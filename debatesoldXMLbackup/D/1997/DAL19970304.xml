      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following regional consultation seminars, the committee identified the key issues and policy areas which must be addressed if the strategy is to be successful.  These are: educational disadvantage; unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment; income adequacy; disadvantaged urban areas; and rural poverty.</P>
      <P>Working groups, including representatives from Government Departments, the social partners and national representative organisations of the community and voluntary sector were established to consider each of these key themes.  In addition, Government Departments prepared strategic statements on their policies and operations from an anti-poverty perspective.  The working groups have reported to the interdepartmental policy committee and these reports, together with the departmental statements, are now being considered by the committee.</P>
      <P>To date, seminars held under the aegis of the committee have been attended by more than 1,000 people and progress reflects the major degree of consultation which has taken place.  The national anti-poverty strategy is now entering its final phase and in line with the commitment set out in Partnership 2000, it is expected that the strategy will be finalised in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The anti-poverty strategy seems to consist of producing reports and holding seminars. If the Government is seriously committed to tackling poverty and inequality in society, why <Col N="1286" /> has it presided over economic changes which have resulted in the poverty gap increasing appreciably? Will the Minister accept, for example, that in the past two years the budgetary strategy has resulted in a position where the gap between take home pay for a couple on £20,000 per year and payment for an unemployed couple has increased by £1,400 while the comparative figure for a couple earning £40,000 per year is £2,700?  Will the Minister explain what anti-poverty strategy does that constitute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a tendency to talk about cost rather than value.  Most Deputies over the years have contributed substantially to tackling the sources of poverty, as is evidenced by the fact that about £2 billion will be spent this year by State Departments on tackling poverty.  While I am glad the Deputy raised the question of social injustice, the way he proposes to measure it is not acceptable.  A measurement that would take account of the fact that approximately 15 per cent of inner city flat and house dwellers have access to third level education would be better. Approximately 75 per cent of those in Mountjoy Prison come from five identifiable areas in Dublin. People are living in appalling housing estates in Dublin and other cities and rural poverty is still a reality.  I accept we have a long way to go to alleviate poverty, but the Government's approach, through the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Health and me as Minister of State with responsibility for local development, is breeding participative democracy that will enable communities tackle the source of the problem.  Credit should be given for what is being done to alleviate poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to long-term unemployment.  Does he accept the most fundamental cause of poverty is unemployment? Will he explain the Government's anti-poverty strategy when in a time of unprecedented economic growth last year the Government reduced the long-term unemployment figure by a paltry 300?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Social welfare increases will be twice the rate of inflation this year.  I accept that is not enough, but as social welfare is a great drain on the Exchequer and there is only so much to go round, the Government can only go so far at any given time.  We have initiated a comprehensive local development plan which sets out to tackle in an integrated way the causes of long-term unemployment.  People are long-term unemployed because they do not have skills, access to third level education or they leave school early. The local development programme will complement the existing educational, health and social welfare programmes and it has received favourable comment from the OECD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to give the impression that I believe we are anywhere near achieving social justice.  We must encourage enterprise and social <Col N="1287" /> justice.  If we do not create wealth we cannot distribute it, but once it is created we should try to distribute it more equitably.  Under the local development programme an integrated plan has been devised which, if successful, will make a significant contribution to addressing the problem of poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>While poverty affects the long-term unemploymed and their families in a damning way, it also affects senior citizens many of whom are proud of their contribution to the development of the State.  Does the anti-poverty strategy contain anything, other than the paltry increase given to old age pensioners in the budget, to help our senior citizens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach adopted by the interdepartmental committee will be cross-departmental and cross-agency and will cover all citizens.  The working groups comprise members of Government Departments, the social partners and national representatives of community organisations. Their reports, with the departmental reports, will form the basis of the interdepartmental committee report which I hope will be available for Ministers to consider in a few weeks. I hope that report will be made public and I am sure it will address the fundamental issue raised by Deputy Burke.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said unemployment is a major cause of poverty.  I am concerned not only about the number of people unemployed but the number who stand to be unemployable because of the lack of resources for pre-school and primary school education and training facilities, particularly in areas where long-term unemployment is endemic.  Does the Government intend to operate the breaking the cycle scheme in this financial year?  A school in Cork North-Central which is deemed to be located in an area of the highest social and economic disadvantage did not have a teacher appointed under that scheme in 1996.  Will additional teaching resources be provided in that and other schools under that scheme in 1997?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is outside my remit.  It is a matter for the Minister for Education.  Additional educational facilities, including pre-school facilities, truancy tracking, information technology and psychological services, will be provided under the £110 million to be spent on local development over the four year period to end March 1999.  In consultation with their partnership companies, schools in disadvantaged areas can select from those services.  They will be supplementary to the services provided by the Department of Education.  As it is not my area of responsibility, the Deputy will have to put her specific question to the Minister for Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that in periods of high growth gaps between sectors of society tend to widen?  For example, the elderly received a 25 per cent increase over three budgets introduced by Fianna Fáil in the 1980's whereas in the last three budgets they received only a 7 per cent increase.  What proposals does the anti-poverty strategy contain to address this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The interdepartmental committee's proposals will be available to Ministers at the end of March or early April.  This year social welfare increases will be twice the rate of inflation.  When the late Frank Cluskey was Parliamentary Secretary in the Department of Social Welfare there was an increase of 25 per cent in social welfare payments in one year.  Throwing money at the problem does not solve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We must adopt an integrated and planned approach to deal with the sources of poverty, irrespective of whether it affects the young, the old or senior citizens.  Such a plan will be presented to Ministers in the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the position of the elderly relative to that of people in other sectors of our society.  If inflation were running at 25 per cent, a 25 per cent increase in social welfare payments would not be of much benefit.  I am talking about periods of low inflation in the late 1980s and now.  The income of senior citizens has declined substantially relative to that of other sectors in the community.  They received a 25 per cent increase over three budgets at a time of low inflation in the 1980s, but they received only a 7 per cent increase over the past three budgets which was also a time of low inflation.  How does the Minister of State propose to address the serious decline in old people's incomes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>All sectors that have fallen behind in terms of income will be addressed under the anti-poverty strategy.  We are one of the few European countries that provides free travel, low cost accommodation and pensions for senior citizens.  We would like to do much more for them.  The anti-poverty strategy programme will address in a strategic manner the causes of poverty and social injustice.  We will not exclude any group when dealing with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister of State describe a 3 per cent increase as double the rate of inflation in view of what the Minister for Finance said in his budget speech?  Has the Government views on the notion of a basic income which has been put forward by a number of sources?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry a genuine question on social injustice and need has turned into a political football.  The credit due to both sides of the House for progress made should be given.  More <Col N="1289" /> progress is needed but it can only be made when a fundamental assessment has been carried out. That assessment is under way and will be completed shortly.  For the first time we are trying to address the causes of social injustice while at the same time promoting enterprise, which is a good way to go about doing this.  I repeat we have a long way to go to achieve the type of social justice I would like, but progress has been made and if this plan is as objective as I expect, it will provide the basis to achieve even greater social justice.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I welcome the extended range of information from the Central Statistics Office.  Does he agree it would be helpful if there were more regular migration and employment statistics?  Perhaps he might raise that with the committee in the CSO.  Does the Minister of State have any <Col N="1290" /> plans to produce quarterly statistics?  Most countries produce quarterly statistics on GNP but we have not managed to do that.  They are used extensively by Eurostat countries to watch for recession in economies or to monitor indicators. There appear to be computer packages which countries producing these statistics use.  Will the Minister of State consider this proposal?  If it is being done on a community basis in several countries, it would be possible to do it here.  While I welcome the quarterly labour force review, will any other economic data be prepared quarterly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The need to produce regular data is to the fore in the Government's mind and that of Central Statistics Office, the agency which delivers the data.  It is in that spirit that we are moving to more regular and more frequent surveys across the economic and social spectrum. The quarterly labour force survey will provide key indicators as regards the performance of the economy and employment.  Last week we announced the monthly publication of the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised previously the question of quarterly national accounts and it is something we are moving towards.  Unfortunately, the lead in time is extensive and we do not anticipate publication until 1999.  As regards more frequent surveys, data and availability of information, it is desirable that we are in conformity with our European partners from the point of view of ensuring our data can be cross checked with that of other member states so we may see our relative performance.  There should be maximum synchronisation between our performance in terms of statistics and data and that in the other 14 members states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Single Market was completed in January 1993, customs declarations were no longer required for the movement of goods within the EU.  Since these declarations were the source of the intra-EU trade statistics, a new system was needed to collect the data.  This new survey system called Intrastat was introduced in all EU countries in January 1993.  It involves the monthly <Col N="1291" /> collection of statistical returns from about 6,900 of the largest traders.</P>
    <P>Before 1993 trade statistics were more timely than most other economic statistics because traders had to complete customs documentation at the time of import-export in order to ensure the speedy movement of goods.  As a result it was possible to produce detailed monthly statistics with a delay of no more than two months.  The Intrastat data collection system has lost this advantage, since it is based on summary returns submitted after the reference month and is also subject to the non-response and timeliness difficulties that are common to all direct statistical inquiries.</P>
    <P>As in all other EU states there were considerable problems in introducing the new system.  The average timelag for 1993, the first year of the new system, was more than seven months.  Much progress has, however, been made in improving the timeliness.  The current timelag is three and a half months for the global figures &mdash; total imports and total exports &mdash; and four and a half months for the detailed figures.  Further improvements are expected over the coming year, although it is unlikely that the former performance will be matched unless traders submit their monthly returns more quickly.  Statistics on our trade with non-EU countries, which are still based on custom documentation, are published two months after the end of the reference period.</P>
    <P>As regards the quality of the trade data, the CSO is happy that the overall quality is good.  In 1994 after one full year's operation of the new system, the CSO conducted a comprehensive analysis of the quality of the results.  This showed that the quality at the overall level was not affected to any significant extent by the introduction of Intrastat.</P>
    <P>The quality of the detailed statistics was, however, affected because of the need to estimate figures for the many small traders who are below the survey threshold, and for the larger traders who did not respond to the survey.  Every effort is being made to minimise the adverse impact on quality of these factors.  The Revenue Commissioners, who collect the data, have adopted a range of measures to improve response while the CSO has improved its methodology of estimating for missing data.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficulties I mentioned, I am satisfied that the new system provides reliable and comprehensive statistics on our international trade which, with the improving timeliness, meets the needs of most users.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important question. Whatever about the arguments in the European Union about Intrastat figures and the changes made, they affect this country greatly.  On the face of it, since the method of collecting figures was changed in 1993, we have had enormous trade surpluses, even though the unemployment figures have remained the same.  We have had trade surpluses <Col N="1292" /> probably since the late 1980s which up until 1993 we were able to track, quantify and qualify.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the figures are accurate and can he give the House an estimate as to the extent of transfer pricing? This issue is being referred to more and more in international articles which I am sure the Minister of State has seen and from which it is clear that many people outside the country just do not believe some of the figures.</P>
      <P>This raises the issue of the black hole and how we have enormous trade surpluses running into billions of pounds when the unemployment figures have remained the same since 1993 and when we have not been able to quantify the figures as well as we were able to do up to that date.  What is the Minister of State's view on the matter?  From experience, the CSO had great difficulty in standing over its figures when it used the old monthly records.  It is a known fact that it regularly lowered the rate of national growth.  Can the Minister of State reassure us on that point and give the House an estimate as to the extent of transfer pricing within the economy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the accuracy of the figures, they only relate to trade with EU member states. On trade with non-EU member states, the old system applies with precision accuracy.  About 95 per cent of companies which trade with EU member states are covered by Intrastat which encompasses companies with imports worth more than £100,000 and exports worth more than £500,000.  There is a mechanism in place of which VAT and other returns to the Revenue Commissioners from part to estimate the trade levels of smaller companies.  These levels have to be estimated to compile comprehensive data.</P>
      <P>To ensure data are as accurate as possible the CSO has introduced a number of measures to tighten the procedures.  Larger traders are being pursued vigorously for their returns.  There is also a prosecution system in place.  Even though one does not like to have recourse to prosecutions, traders have been prosecuted for non-compliance. I hope this sends out a signal that they should submit returns by specific dates.  Traders who submit paper returns are being persuaded to submit them electronically.  Those traders who experience difficulty in completing the Intrastat return can contact the permanent Revenue help desk.</P>
      <P>On whether there is an exaggeration of the trade figures, there is no basis for scepticism and cynicism on the part of Deputy Ahern and other commentators outside the House.  All the information available &mdash; there has been a comprehensive analysis &mdash; shows conclusively that the introduction of Intrastat did not have an adverse impact on the accuracy of the export figures and had only marginal impact on the accuracy of the import figures.  An adjustment of 1.7 per cent was made to ensure there was no distortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> The issue of transfer pricing has been raised time and again in the House.  All the indications are that it is of minimal proportions and does not distort our accounts in any way.  As the Deputy is well aware, the change from GDP to GNP ensures there is a safety value whereby profits repatriated by foreign interprises are automatically factored out.</P>

      <P>The recently established Western Development Commission will promote the economic and social regeneration of the western region and will work closely with and compliment the activities of the existing State agencies and local development groups working in the region. The indicators of stability in the west are reflected in the levels of population, employment and investment in the region.  It will be a responsibility of the commission to focus on these indicators and to agree targets with the relevant agencies in respect of economic and social development.  The commission will monitor progress and performance on these agreed targets and will bring the results to my attention.  The commission's role in this regard will ensure that national and regional polices have a positive impact on the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development, approved by Government last year, forms the basis of the Government's action on the economic and social development of our offshore islands.  The report provides the framework within which the activities of Departments, State agencies, local authorities and local development organisations are monitored to ensure a focused approach to addressing island issues.  Within this framework, Departments and State agencies can re-examine their existing policies as they affect island communities and can formulate new policies to meet particular needs.  In addition, the co-ordinating committee liaises with the Interdepartmental Policy Committee on Local Development <Col N="1295" /> to ensure that a focus on island issues is maintained.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee, I am responsible for ensuring a co-ordinated approach to the responses of the various Departments involved in improving the quality of life of offshore island communities.  The development of access services and infrastructure on islands provides a clear indication of ongoing progress in this area of policy.  Through the operation of the new mechanisms established at local level, responsibility for progress on islands' access and infrastructure is primarily a matter for the relevant local authorities.</P>
    <P>The task force on funding arrangements in the Border region, which I chair, monitors the implementation of recommendations contained in the task force report agreed by Government last July. The task force's primary focus is on funding integration and co-ordination.  Measures of progress in this area will be reflected in improvements in the quality and availability of information and staff training.  The task force reported to Government recently on measures carried out to date.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the islands and the Border region, which the Government acknowledged have not benefited from the economic boom, are special cases which require special attention?  For example, the offshore islands deserve more attention than the mainland and similarly for the Border where it is acknowledged there have been huge job losses. My county had a net job loss of over 500 last year. Does the Minister accept that any attention paid to date, for example, the task force on funding arrangements, is cosmetic and does not constitute the special attention required to bring these areas up to the same standard of living as that enjoyed in Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government established my office to help offshore islands and islanders now have greater access.  They unified themselves by starting their own organisation, Comhdháil Oileán na hÉireann.  They now have access to both local authorities because of the special island committees set up and to my Department through the interdepartmental committee which monitors the distribution of funding available from my Department.  There has been a significant increase and advance in life on the islands. We have also made special tax breaks available for people who want to build houses on the islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Border is concerned, there has been substantial communication between people who live there and local companies, whether through ADM or the Leader programme.  In the next few days, an allocation of a further £5 million for small enterprises in the Border area will be announced.  This injection of funding through the peace initiative will raise the standard of living of those in the area.  I acknowledge that the <Col N="1296" /> area has suffered but funding was made available with the agreement of those who supplied it, such as the EU, the United States and Canada.  The guidelines for the distribution of funds have finally been agreed and the elimination of social exclusion along the Border areas is advancing rapidly.</P>

Some young island people who marry face horrific costs because of the huge increase in land values caused by people moving from urban areas and competing to purchase land and sites in convenient and beautiful areas in the west.  I acknowledge that difficulty and have tried to encourage local authorities to build houses on the islands and in peripheral counties.  This Government has invested substantially in local authority housing because it is one way we will address the marginalisation of rural people.  I do not accept that people in rural Ireland are as downbeat as the Deputy has said.  The rising tide is lifting all boats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The butter voucher scheme is provided for in European Union regulations which provide for the sale of butter at a subsidised rate to social assistance beneficiaries and the scheme operates as a market intervention mechanism under the Common Agricultural Policy. It benefits some 450,000 social assistance beneficiaries and their 405,000 dependants and is administered for the EU by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The Department of Social Welfare acts as an agent for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in distributing the vouchers to social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> Ireland is the only member state still operating the scheme due to expire in December last. However, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry successfully negotiated an extension for another two years at the December meeting of the European Ministers for Agriculture, but on the basis of a reduction from two pounds to one pound as the amount of butter per eligible person. This compromise stemmed form the significant reduction in Irish per capita consumption of butter, the annual tonnage of which fell from 40,000 to 13,000 in the 15 year period 1981 to 1995.  Butter consumption in Ireland is now less than 11b per person per month.  On the basis of these consumption figures, the revised scheme is meeting the average needs of beneficiaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has repeated the contents of an earlier press release which misrepresents the position.  He went back to 1981 to show that the level of butter consumption has fallen.  The review period was the past two years, 1994-6, and we were concerned about the change in that time.  However, there was none.  Given that the consumption level since 1990 has been approximately 12,000 tonnes per annum, there has not been a fall in the level of consumption. Will the Minister of State confirm that is the position? Will he also confirm that the figures he gave are based on the average for the total population, that butter vouchers are used by beneficiaries and the number used is in the region of 855,000 to 900,000 per annum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the scheme was introduced to alleviate hardship suffered by persons in receipt of social assistance and to eliminate the butter mountain, which has been achieved.  The scheme was never subsidised by the Exchequer despite fluctuations in the value of the subsidy in the past.  The value of it remains unchanged at 52p per 11b of butter and the number of monthly vouchers per eligible person has been reduced from two to one in line with EU regulations.</P>
      <P>The butter voucher scheme does not benefit all social welfare recipients.  However, the Deputy will be aware this year's budget provided for substantial real increases for all beneficiaries.  The increase of £3 per week in personal rates of payment together with an additional £1.50 in respect of adult dependants means that all social assistance beneficiaries will receive increases of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent, which is about twice the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Deputy's question about the level of consumption, the total number of vouchers made available has not been taken up in recent years.  I do not have the precise figure.  The reason for the 50 per cent reduction in the value of vouchers was given to the Deputy in a reply to a parliamentary question answered by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  He stated that the Commission's recommendations stemmed from a significant <Col N="1298" /> reduction in Irish <i>per capita</i> consumption of butter, the annual tonnage of which fell from 40,000 to 13,000 in the 15 year period from 1981-95.</P>
    <P>The level of butter consumption is less than 11b per person per month and the new level of subsidy reflects that position.  That and the fact that Ireland is the only member state currently operating the butter voucher scheme made the 50 per cent reduction the most viable possible option for the retention of the scheme.  The facts preclude the possibility of having that decision reversed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures given by the Minister of State are a statistical lie.  Taking a review period of two years from 1994 to 1996 and using an average change in consumption levels from 1981 to 1995 are an abuse of statistics.  There are no ifs or buts about it.  In a letter dated 5 February the Minister pointed out that the volume of butter vouchers issued in 1995 was 20.9 million and 21.2 million in 1996.  There was an increase in the number of vouchers issued in that period.  The real issue is that the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry did not fight the case in Brussels to maintain this measure to alleviate hardship.  As a result of that the poorest face a halving in the value of butcher vouchers to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>Regarding the mechanism for the reduction in the value of vouchers, will the same number be issued at half the value they were previously or will half the number be issued?</P>

      <P>I reject the Deputy's assertion that what I read into the record is a statistical lie.  It is a fact.  The Deputy knows full well that soundbites of that nature are misleading.</P>
      <P>He mentioned the volume of butter vouchers issued in 1995 was 20.9 million and 21.2 million in 1996, but the number redeemed under the scheme was 16.1 million in 1995 and 17.7 million in 1996.  In those two years substantially less than the total number of vouchers available were taken up.</P>

      <P>The methodology used to issue the vouchers has been decided.  There were some delays in the issuing of vouchers initially due to the time factor involved, but details of the scheme were issued to all recipients and under the new guidelines they will get 50 per cent of the value of vouchers to which they were previously entitled.</P>

      <P>The issues involved in the provision of special arrangements to allow women who work full-time in the home have access to social welfare options in their own right and which have been the subject of a recent campaign organised by the National Women's Council and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed are important ones and the Minister has <Col N="1300" /> already put in place a range of measures designed to provide more comprehensive information and advice to women in this regard.</P>
      <P>These measures include an information leaflet entitled Signing on the Live Register which is available at all my Department's local offices. This leaflet gives information on the live register, details about unemployment payments and credited contributions and full details about employment schemes, training courses and educational opportunities and how to qualify for them; access to the services of my Department's locally-based job facilitators to inform and advise on the various options available; advice to spouses of unemployed persons in relation to their right to sign on the live register in instances where such spouses satisfy the conditions to do so; and advice about the options which are currently available under the Community Employment and Part-Time Job Opportunities programmes and which allow a person to participate in either of these schemes in place of her or his spouse.</P>
      <P>The Partnership 2000 agreement recently negotiated provides that a working party including relevant Government Departments and the social partners will be established to examine the question of equal access by women to labour market opportunities including training, education and employment programmes.</P>

The denial of access to a wide range of schemes, training programmes and second chance educational opportunities is a major theme in the National Women's Council's campaign, &ldquo;Breaking Down the Barriers &mdash; Women's Equality in the Labour Market.&rdquo;  The campaign highlighted that access to these options depends largely on prior attachments to the live register or receipt of the one parent family payment.</P>

      <Col N="1301" /> FÁS is charged with managing, encouraging and fostering the provision of assistance in attaining employment and co-ordinating the provision of such assistance by others.  It has a primary role in the area of job placement.  While the concept of a civil right to register as unemployed is highly attractive, it also has to be balanced against the need to maximise the deployment of resources.  It must be recognised that certain categories of people qualify in their own right if they are available for work.  Some people are of the opinion that is not so.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that these women are looking for recognition?  This does not require the Minister to wait for reports from various bodies, including the Commission on the Family, before taking action.  It is a relatively simple matter to allocate a proportion of the placements to women working full-time in the home who want to get back into the workforce and to set up a separate register for them.  Is the Government prepared to do this as the Minister agrees it is an urgent necessity?</P>

      <P>There are ongoing discussions between the Department of Social Welfare and other relevant Government agencies to assess how best the points raised by Deputy Woods can be dealt with effectively.  However, it is not as simple as deciding that a specific number can or will be included because there are varying degrees of entitlement and need.  It is important to ensure that in the event of any changes taking place, they are soundly based and will be undertaken in the light of all the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, one of the recommendations of the Special Task Force on Security for the Elderly established in 1996 was that my Department introduce a once-off £2 million grant scheme to provide grant aid to voluntary organisations in relation to security initiatives for the elderly.  That recommendation was accepted.</P>
      <P>Subsequently I established a National Advisory Committee, on which the National Council for the Elderly, the Irish Association of Victim Support, the Reach Out Campaign, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Country Women's Association and the Garda Síochána under the Neighbourhood Watch scheme were represented, to advise on a suitable scheme that would ensure the available funds were targeted at the most vulnerable older people and the best possible value for money was achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was decided that to make funds available through voluntary organisations was the most <Col N="1302" /> appropriate way of ensuring the most vulnerable older people are targeted by the scheme.  The Minister was aware that many voluntary organisations were already providing services such as those covered by the scheme and had developed expertise and local contacts.</P>
    <P>Voluntary groups operate close to the ground and are aware of the greatest need in their communities. Working with the voluntary sector to deliver these funds to the most needy has the advantage that individual older people need not make an application, can have their needs met with the minimum of administration, without the need for a formal assessment of their circumstances by Departmental staff.  The Minister was satisfied that this was the most appropriate way in which to structure the Department's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I tabled this question because recently the elderly and their families have been victims of an enormous amount of break-ins and violence.  An elderly person was recently battered to death in the west.  That is not good enough.  While the Garda and other bodies are prompt in their attention to the elderly, a district nurse or someone in close contact with the elderly should be in a position to make a recommendation on security, whether it is the provision of a telephone or otherwise.  The requests of the elderly for security provisions are not dealt with quickly enough.  Thousands of elderly couples are still living in fear in rural Ireland and they have reason to do so because there is much devilment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of ensuring that the maximum possible number of persons are involved in providing this service was deemed to be a good one on the basis that it brought more people involved in voluntary or professional work into the system.  Such people have regular and ongoing contact with the elderly which in turn makes their involvement more economically viable and realistic.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been successful in ensuring that a further £2 million is made available from the current year's budget for this year's scheme and announcements on this will be made shortly. It is anticipated that the scheme will be operated on the same basis as last year, which was satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures quoted in the labour force survey report relate to the month of April 1996 and show that between April 1995 and April 1996 there was an increase of 46,000 in the number at work.  This trend has been maintained and, over the past two years, in excess of 100,000 new jobs have been created.  The number of people at work has grown to approximately 1.3 million, the highest in the history of the State.  We have a growing population and net inward migration rather than emigration.  Nonetheless, the level of unemployment is still a matter of great concern but I should point out that the drop in the year to April 1996 has been followed by further significant decreases.  From August 1996 to January 1997 the numbers registered as unemployed decreased by 18,708.  Moreover, the total number registered as unemployed at the end of January, 1997 was some 19,000 fewer than at the end of January 1996.  More significantly, the seasonally adjusted figures also showed a significant decrease for that period.</P>
      <P>My Department is adopting a pro-active, work-supportive approach to assist the long-term unemployed to return to work by providing them with a wide range of labour market initiatives as well as educational supports.  In addition, a number of measures are in place to encourage employers to take on the long-term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that, according to the Labour Force Survey, the number of long-term unemployed remained static over the past year?  What specific measures are planned to tackle this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, the Government already has in operation a number of schemes tailored to tackle the numbers of long-term unemployed.  For example, a team of job facilitators are responsible for marketing the Department's pro-employment, education and training schemes among employers and the long-term unemployed at local level.  In addition to the range of labour market measures operated by FÁS the Department operates a number of programmes <Col N="1304" /> to influence recruitment decisions in favour of the long-term unemployed, to provide them with direct work opportunities, including exemption from PRSI, the back to work allowance and another scheme introduced by my Department in June last under which child dependant increases continue for up to 13 weeks.</P>
      <P>In addition, a range of programmes are operated under the area-based initiative scheme to assist the long-term unemployed resident in a partnership area to return to the workforce. There are also educational opportunities &mdash; the third-level allowance scheme which had some 3,100 participants and the vocational training opportunities scheme, availed of by some 4,300 people.  Approximately 400 long-term unemployed are availing of second-level courses on a full-time basis.  A special scheme was announced in the recent budget for this sector along similar lines to the third-level allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>All of those schemes are in place, targeting the same people in a constructive, supportive manner, particularly the long-term unemployed.  In addition, the numbers on the live register have decreased dramatically over the past 12 months to the extent already indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related to the main problem, the number of long-term unemployed, which remained static.  The Minister mentioned a number of worthwhile projects and schemes but these had already been in operation.  I asked him what new measures are being taken to tackle the number of the long-term unemployed, which is not decreasing.  How many people are claiming the pre-retirement allowance, or pre-retirement credits?  Can the Minister indicate the change in those figures between 1994 and 1996?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not have all the information the Deputy requested but I will obtain it for him. The Deputy will also be aware that it is proposed to increase the numbers eligible under the back to work allowance scheme by an additional 5,000 in the current year, specifically targeting the long-term unemployed.  That number has been increased from 17,000 to 22,000 and 1,000 places are preserved on pilot schemes for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>For example, easing conditions for requalification for unemployment benefit will particularly help casual and part-time workers, with an approximate 10,000 people expected to benefit under the revised arrangement.  Also the Class A rate of employees' PRSI is being reduced by 1 per cent, from the current 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>I do not have in my brief the precise figures of those claiming pre-retirement allowances but I will obtain that information for the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the number of people who have taken early retirement under the pre-retirement allowance scheme is approximately 18,000.  The question I asked was what was the <Col N="1305" /> change in those numbers between, say, December 1994 and December 1996.  If the Minister does not have that information perhaps he would forward it to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the back to work allowance scheme has been one of the most successful schemes, and it has removed some 17,000 people from the live register and given them new opportunities.  While welcoming the increased number of 22,000, will the Minister of State say when those in receipt of disability allowance will be eligible to take up the 1,000 options reserved for them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the campaign to eliminate fraud.  As has always been the case, my Department has taken its responsibilities very seriously to ensure the elimination of fraud, with the obvious objective of protecting those in legitimate need of social welfare payments.  To protect the latter's interests that scheme was enhanced over the past 12 months with beneficial effect.  The first objective was to ensure that nobody legitimately entitled to a social welfare payment should fear investigation and, second, to have it clearly understood that defrauding the system is not acceptable.  The decrease in the live register by some 19,000 in the past 12 months, in some measure, can be attributed to the success of that scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the commitment of this and all Governments to tackling fraud within the social welfare system.  While my attention has been drawn to the fact that many social welfare officers investigate fraud in certain parts of the west, does the Minister of State agree that small farmers in a disadvantaged area, some of whom are in dire financial circumstances, do not warrant such investigation?  The Combat Poverty Agency report stated that counties Mayo and Donegal are the two most disadvantaged areas.  Will the Minister ensure his officials are not going for the easy touch but rather pursuing those who are working and drawing social welfare?  Those are the people we want to attack, not those who have a few acres of land in a disadvantaged area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <P>The focus of the Department has to be impartial and objective in pursuing investigations. Every effort is made to ensure an impartial application of the rules.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>While 13 member states including Ireland support the proposed Poverty IV programme, two EU member states have blocked the proposal which, to be put into effect, currently requires unanimity among all European member states.  The situation in relation to the Poverty IV programme has highlighted the need to underpin the capacity and competency of the Union to carry out effective actions in this area.</P>
      <P>Last year the European Commission invited applications for funding in respect of anti-poverty projects, separate from the Poverty IV programme. Soon afterwards, the United Kingdom Government made an application to the European Court for an order annulling the decision setting up the schemes.</P>
      <P>The President of the Court issued an order in September 1996 stating that while groups could continue to apply for grants no funds could be paid out until the final judgment by the court had been delivered.  The effect of this judgment has been to make it very difficult for some poorly resourced groups to plan or commence projects without a guarantee of Commission funding.</P>
      <P>The laudable, ambitious and visionary plans for economic and monetary union highlight what can be advanced at a European level and also, when compared with EU anti-poverty initiatives such as I have described how much remains to be done at a European level in the area of social policy.</P>
      <P>It was for these reasons the Minister secured the agreement of his Government colleagues to the advancement by Ireland of a proposal within the Intergovernmental Conference to include a specific treaty change which would improve the Union's competence in the area of actions relating to social exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Was a positive report given on the previous poverty programme on behalf of Ireland?  Was it strongly recommended that these programmes be continued?  Did the Minister visit and make representations to the two States involved, the United Kingdom and Germany? Has the Minister spoken with the relevant Ministers in Germany and in the United Kingdom to win over their support for a continuation of the poverty programmes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Irish Presidency, the proposal was advanced by the Minister through numerous bilateral meetings with other EU social affairs Ministers.  On World Poverty Day in October 1996, the Minister spoke to the European <Col N="1307" /> Anti-Poverty Network at the European Parliament on the subject and later that month spoke in the parliament regarding a resolution by MEPs broadly supportive of Ireland's proposal, which was subsequently carried without dissent.</P>
      <P>During the Presidency, within the Council of Ministers, the Minister reluctantly took the view that there was no point in seeking to discuss directly the Poverty IV proposal as the German and United Kingdom Governments were firmly opposed to it.  Instead, the Minister's efforts have centred on a proposed treaty change in relation to social exclusion, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference and also, particularly during the Presidency, on leading a broadly based discussion on the major challenges facing social protection systems in Europe.</P>
      <P>Discussion concentrated on what social protection systems should be doing to contribute to the fight against unemployment.  Drawing on discussions in July, the Minister and his fellow EU Social Affairs Ministers agreed, at Council on 2 December 1996, a resolution &mdash; Council Resolution 96/C 386/02 &mdash; which set out the broad principles which would be applied, within national systems, in this regard.  Ministers indicated their commitment to develop new approaches aimed at helping to prevent people falling into unemployment; they also indicated they would co-operate, under the aegis of the Commission, in the exchange of information between member states on practices and policies in this area.  Such commitments were directly reflected in the Dublin Declaration on Employment, The Jobs Challenge.</P>
      <P>My Department continues to be represented on and is actively participating in the debate and discussion relating to EU anti-poverty policy being carried out by the European Commission's high level group on social exclusion.  It is expected that work undertaken by the group should result in a Commission communication, later in the year, on activities in the field of social exclusion across the Union.  Publication of the communication at that time may well represent an opportunity to raise again the issue of action by the European Union in the anti-poverty policy area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware those two countries have been firmly opposed to poverty programmes in the past for reasons which affect themselves?  Is he aware it was through negotiation with the Ministers directly and a review of the schemes as they operated that a new programme was agreed?  I gather from what the Minister of State has said that the Minister did not consider it worthwhile to pursue this line because he believed the two countries were so firmly opposed.  That is not an adequate answer or process because negotiation is at the heart of the work of the Council of Ministers.  The Minister should discuss these matters with some of the Ministers and show how valuable they have been here and agree a review.  That is how it was done <Col N="1308" /> in the past.  It seems the Minister is not interested in doing that and consequently has failed to deliver.</P>

He was negotiating, at the level at which the Deputy has negotiated previously, and was in a better position to judge the method by which he should proceed. He proceeded correctly on the basis of what he saw as being the area where he was likely to get most support and be most successful.

    <P>This shows that just over half the people on the live register were in the age group 25 to 44.  To put this into context, the 1996 Labour Force Survey showed that 53 per cent of the labour force was in this age group.</P>
    <P>An analysis of a sample of people leaving the live register in the month of January 1997 shows that roughly half of those who left the register were in the 25 to 44 year age group.  This is similar to the overall proportion of this age group on the register.  This would suggest that 25 to 44 year <Col N="1310" /> olds are not, in themselves, a particularly disadvantaged group <i>vis-à-vis</i> other categories of unemployed, although, of course, some people in this age group such as those who are long-term unemployed or those with poor educational achievements are in need of special measures.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare has taken an active approach to assisting unemployed people of all age groups to re-enter the active labour market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from what the Minister of State said that there are just under 300,000 people on the live register, excluding those who are in receipt of disability benefit, invalidity benefit and pre-retirement schemes.  Those are additional to the figure of 300,000 or so.  My question clearly asked what new and additional measures have been considered for the 25-44 age category.  Will the Minister of State give those figures? More importantly, will he indicate the address or region of the majority grouping within that age category?  Am I correct in saying that it is Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have information on the latter part of the Deputy's question, but I will try to make it available.  It is a separate question.  In relation to people in receipt of disability or sickness benefit or any illness-related payments, as the Deputy knows such people have never been on the live register.  They are not eligible for mention in the context of the live register because they are not available for work.  They have always been catered for by way of a different payment system of which the Deputy is aware.</P>
      <P>In relation to the group to which the Deputy's question refers, of particular benefit in this regard is the Back to Work Allowance, which allows certain unemployed people to retain part of their social welfare entitlements, as well as secondary benefits, on taking up certain forms of employment or self-employment.  It has been shown that those who are particularly adept in taking up places on that scheme happen to be in that age category.</P>
      <P>This scheme has been of particular benefit to people in the 25 to 44 year age group.  A survey of entrants to the scheme showed that 74 per cent of participants were aged 25 to 44, which is a very high percentage.  In this year's budget the number of places available on the scheme was increased from 17,000 to 22,000.</P>
      <P>Other measures taken in this year's budget to help the unemployed, and that age group in particular, to get back to work include: improvements in the Family Income Supplement; substantial reductions in tax and PRSI; a more tapered withdrawal of adult dependant allowances, making it easier for the spouse of an unemployed person to take up, or remain in, work; and further increases in child benefit, continuing our policy of making income support for children more neutral <i>vis-á-vis</i> the employment status of the parent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> These measures complement the various schemes operated by FÁS to help get unemployed people back to work.  These include Jobstart and Community Employment.  In the case of Community Employment, a three-year option is now available to very long-term unemployed people over the age of 35.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to pursue the pro-employment policies which have led to record growth in employment in the last three years, while continuing to make available special arrangements to ensure that the most disadvantaged can maximise their chances of gaining available employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned a figure of 22,000 in relation to the back to work scheme.  There are thousands of unemployed people in the Dublin region.  Given the facts and figures he has available, will he indicate the actual number of people unemployed, particularly in the 25-44 age category to which the question refers, with a Dublin address or in the Dublin region?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I do not have that information. It is a separate question.  If the Deputy had asked for that information in the context of the overall question I could have got it for him.  I will try to get that information for the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important and relevant question and policies should be aimed at identified blackspots.  The Minister is aware that the majority of people on the live register in that category live in the Dublin region.  My question related to the new and additional measures required to give those in this age category an opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin region has been dealt a devastating blow this week as a result of Government policy.  This is appalling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not raise this matter in his question and, consequently, I do not have that information in my brief.  The measures to alleviate unemployment are being applied equally throughout the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and are having the same impact in all areas.  This is the intention of the Government, the Minister for Social Welfare and me.  It is not true to imply that incentives such as the back to work scheme have failed in some areas.  In areas of high unemployment there is a higher take up under the various schemes, which have been very successful.  A series of other schemes to supplement these initiatives have been implemented by FÁS and the Department of Social Welfare so that the long-term unemployed <Col N="1312" /> and those living in disadvantaged areas can compete in the workplace with those who have not been so disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not happening.  These schemes have failed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>These schemes are extremely successful and it is unfair to participants and those who organise them to suggest they have failed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Those people will tell the Minister the schemes have failed.  The Jobstart programme is a disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>These schemes have been very successful and the level of participation in them by the general public and those referred to in the Deputy's question is exceptional.  Participants also enjoy a high level of job satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the impact of the various palliatives announced by the Government to mask its abysmal failure to tackle unemployment and, in particular, long-term unemployment.  However, this is contradicted by the figures and he should have referred to the lack of impact of these measures.  Will he accept that the Jobstart programme announced in last year's budget has been an abysmal failure? Does the Government intend to replace or reorganise this scheme or to reduce the age limit?  I raise this question because of the large number of people in my constituency aged between 21 and 35 years of age who do not qualify for participation in the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been extremely successful and will continue to be so.  The support they have received from local communities is a clear indication of their success.  The significant <Col N="1313" /> increase in the number of participants in the back to work scheme since the Government took office is an indication of its success.  The same applies to the other schemes to which I referred and which were not specifically referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister say the Jobstart programme has been a success when 5,000 places were announced by the Minister for Finance but only 250 took him up on his invitation during its first year of operation?  How many people are now participating in the scheme?  Does the Government propose to reduce the age limit or reorganise the scheme to make it meaningful and workable?</P>

      <P>On a point of order, when a request under Standing Order 31 is ruled out we normally do not take the matter any further, but 537 students in the Advanced College of Technology have paid up to £6,000 for their education <Col N="1316" /> for this year.  It is unfair of any system, admittedly we are talking about the private sector, to leave these students in this terrible predicament.  There must be some mechanism whereby we can raise this matter.  We tried to raise it today under Standing Order 31 and by way of a Private Notice Question.  I ask the Tánaiste, with the Ministers for Education and Finance, to devise some method of either transferring these students to other colleges or discussing with them how they can be assisted to finish their education.  The end of the academic year is only weeks away and it is totally unjustified to leave them in this terrible dilemma when they have spent such large amounts of money.</P>

      <P>This matter is ongoing.  It was raised on the Adjournment last week.

I acknowledge these students are in a dilemma with the private sector, not the State, but we are talking about their education. They have paid unbelievable amounts in fees &mdash; one student who met some of my colleagues paid up to £6,000 while many others paid £3,000.  Some bonding arrangement must be put in place.  Over the years the Government intervened to save a coffee shop and we tried to nationalise a towel factory.  These students just want to finish the remaining part of their education.  I plead with the Government to devise some method to help these people.</P>

Next Monday there will be an application in the High Court in respect of the Advanced Technology College to bring in an examiner.  It is my understanding that a pledge of some limited funding from the Government, in tandem with the examinership, would go a long way to sorting out the problems for the students concerned.  My only concern, and I imagine the Tánaiste's only concern, is that we should be seen to act on humanitarian grounds in an effort to fulfil the education needs of the students who have only about three months to finish their course.  There is an insufficiency of State places because of democratic decisions etc.  I would appreciate it if the Government could make some response.  Nobody has yet met the students.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to propose the Education Bill, 1997 to this House.  The Bill, and the debate on it, provides this House with a rare, even unique, opportunity to debate a Bill concerning the provision of education at first and second levels in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It builds upon the best features of our education system as it has evolved.  It does this while, at the same time, recognising the need for change in many aspects of education to meet the needs of students, parents and the partners in education, in a rapidly changing society.</P>
      <P>The Bill builds upon, and is the culmination of, an extensive and in-depth dialogue among all the partners in education.  The National Education Convention and the subsequent round table discussions on intermediate education structures and school governance involved, for the first time, structured multilateral dialogue among all the partners in education.  I take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to all who took part in these discussions, in particular the chairperson, Professor Dearbhla Donnelly, and the secretary of the Convention, Professor John Houlihan.</P>
      <P>There is now a wide recognition that this process significantly enhanced mutual understanding. It promoted an appreciation of respective positions and difficulties.  It promoted an increased awareness of the fundamental importance of partnership, pluralism and a deeper commitment to co-operation and consensus as the key to Charting our Education Future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1322" /> Since becoming Minister for Education, I have sought to promote dialogue and debate.  The Bill before us today is the product of such openness. Its publication does not bring to an end the dialogue between the partners in education which has played such a key part in bringing us to where we are today.  Since publication, I and officials of my Department have continued that dialogue on the provisions of the Bill.  I now look forward to hearing the views of this House.</P>
    <P>Engaging in dialogue is not an empty gesture for me.  Where a reasonable case is made to amend the Bill without diluting its central principles I am prepared to consider that case objectively and, if necessary, propose amendments on Committee Stage.  In that way the spirit of partnership and openness which has characterised the consultative process so far can continue right up to enactment of the Bill and beyond.</P>
    <P>The vital importance of education, and its power to shape and influence our lives, is recognised throughout the world.  We all take a justified pride in our education system.  However, we must also accept the need to identify clearly the challenges facing the system.  From time to time we must take stock of development needs and think carefully about how to address them.</P>
    <P>The Education Bill, 1997, comes before this House at an opportune time.  The education structures which have served this country so well in the past are no longer appropriate to the complexities of modern education.  We must now take action to reform these structures.  We can no longer leave our students to make do with systems dating back to the last century.  We must provide new structures, capable of providing an efficient and effective education service at national and regional levels.  The Education Bill, 1997, seeks to provide the framework for these structures.  The interests of all of the partners in education &mdash; parents, patrons, students, teachers and the State &mdash; are balanced and protected in the Bill.  All those concerned will know with certainty their respective roles, rights and responsibilities and those of the other partners.</P>
    <P>Current proposals represent a final step in what has been a long journey.  The publication of the Green Paper, Education for a Changing World, in June 1992 was a major step forward in the 1990s. Following the publication of the Green Paper, an extensive national debate on education took place.  It was a clear sign of the high regard of the people for education and of their interest in the education system.</P>
    <P>In November 1993 I initiated the National Education Convention, a unique and unprecedented gathering of all the partners in education.  At the convention the important educational issues facing us were debated by all of the partners.  Following the convention I issued in March 1994 a position paper on regional educational councils and in July 1994 a paper on the governance of schools.  Following publication of these papers, I and my officials engaged in further discussions with the interested parties.  The White Paper on <Col N="1323" /> Education, Charting our Education Future, which was published by the Government in April 1995, reflected and built on these discussions.  The Education Bill, 1997, derives from the commitments and objectives in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The Education Bill, 1997, has three main objectives. It provides for an intermediate education structure through the creation of ten education regions, each administered by an education board.  It also provides for the statutory recognition and funding of schools and for the establishment, through a process of partnership and consensus, of boards of management in all first and second level schools in receipt of public funding. The management structures proposed will respond to the diversity of school types, ownership and management structures which is a central feature of education.  The new structures will reflect the plurality of society, including the rights and needs of minority groups, and the concerns of all will be taken into account in the development of these structures.</P>
    <P>The Bill will for the first time place the administrative and educational structures of our education system on a sound statutory footing.  In this way it seeks to fill a vacuum which has long existed in our system.  For too long the education system has been administered by departmental circulars rather than by legislative instruments subject to scrutiny by the Dáil.  This &ldquo;remarkable feature&rdquo; of the system was referred to in the High Court in 1990 &mdash; O'Callaghan v. Meath vocational education committee &mdash; and several times since.  It was also remarked upon by the Constitution Review Group in its recent report.</P>
    <P>The Constitution Review Group, in discussing Article 42.2.4 of the Constitution which relates to State aid for schools, pointed out that:</P>
    <P>The only legislation authorising State funding of denominational education would appear to be via the annual Appropriation Acts ... The present system of disbursing aid where, although the individual education votes are sanctioned by the Appropriation Acts, the applications of these moneys to individual schools is governed by a series of non-statutory rules and circulars is unsatisfactory.  It probably conforms to the letter (but not the spirit) of Article 42.2.4 [of the Constitution].  The Review Group understands that it is likely to change with the forthcoming Education Bill.</P>
    <P>The Education Bill, 1997, addresses this issue by placing the regulations issued by the Department of Education on a statutory basis and subject to scrutiny by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Deputies will agree that our education system has served the country exceedingly well over the decades.  Its achievements are a tribute to the dedication of our teachers, parents, school owners and managers who work so hard to make our education system as good as it is. The quality of the education system is now one of the foundations of our outstanding economic <Col N="1324" /> performance.  Given this record of success, it is worth explaining the clear rationable underlying the proposed changes in the administration of the system.  It is useful to set out the basis for our confidence that the new arrangements are both timely and important.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the system for the central administration of schools originates from the time when national schools were first established in Ireland by the British in the 19th century. The Department of Education was established in 1924 and at that stage the Minister for Education assumed responsibility for all national, secondary, and technical education.  A centralised scheme of administration was introduced as the simplest way to manage what was then a very simple education system and as a way of ensuring that consistent standards were applied throughout the different schools.  The landscape of the educational environment today is vastly different from that of the 1920s.  Education is now universally available and the range and scope is dramatically better than that available in the past. The centralised structure established in the 1920s is inadequate for today's needs.</P>
    <P>While all the partners in education &mdash; parents, school owners, teachers, and school managements &mdash; have co-operated in ensuring that our students are achieving educational standards to match any in the world, we in this House have a duty to provide a more effective basis for our education system.  We must adopt an even more pro-active, dynamic approach, an approach which will not only improve our existing structures and standards but which will give our education system the flexibility and awareness to predict future change and to prepare to meet it.  We need a structure that is more responsive to the needs of the regions and that is representative of community interests, not remote from them.  We need to decentralise many of the co-ordination and administrative functions of Marlborough Street into the regions, where they belong.  We need to empower our schools even more to act as resources of learning for their communities.</P>
    <P>Moreover, we are all aware of the greater demand for accountability in the efficient expenditure of public resources.  In today's environment, education quite rightly accounts for a significant proportion of our national resources. The administrative models we have at present were designed for another age when education was a modest undertaking for the State.  We need new arrangements to administer our education system in an open, transparent and accountable way.</P>
    <P>Modern international thinking strongly supports the idea that the appropriate role of any central education authority, such as the Department of Education, should be to focus on policy development issues.  The actual administration of the system should be as near to the level of selfcontained regions as possible.  In this context, the OECD in its 1991 review of Irish education, concluded that the Irish education system is excessively <Col N="1325" /> centralised.  It stated that &ldquo;the Department of Education functions like a classic highly centralised bureaucracy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At a European level, regional and community involvement in administrative matters, such as support services, school building provision and developing linkages with the business environment, is very much the norm.  The central role of the State is generally confined to areas such as overall policy, curriculum supervision and quality assurance.  Empowerment and mobilisation of regional and community resources is a feature of the education systems in countries such as Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands.  Countries such as Italy, Sweden, Spain and Portugal, which share with Ireland a tradition of highly centralised control of all aspects of the education system, have made significant progress towards devolving responsibilities to the regional level.</P>
    <P>In following international precedents of devolution, the education boards proposed in the Education Bill will be aware of the needs of regional communities, involve and empower communities and ensure that educational needs which, in light of falling enrolments cannot always be met by individual schools, are co-ordinated more effectively. At the same time, the devolution of functions will mean the Department of Education will be able to place an increased focus on national strategic and other issues which are best dealt with at national level.</P>
    <P>The composition of the education boards will reflect the Bill's central theme of partnership. Each board will be composed of an equal number of parents, teachers, patrons, local representatives, ministerial nominees and representatives of the wider community and will respect the diversity of values, beliefs and traditions in Irish society.  The Bill sets out in some detail the functions of education boards, which include ensuring the availability of an appropriate level and quality of education to people in the region, promoting equality of access to and participation in education, promoting the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice, promoting effective liaison between schools and centres for education, contributing to the realisation of national educational policies and objectives and contributing to the realisation of national policy and objectives on the extension of bilingualism in Irish society.  Each board will appoint a director, who will head the executive arm of the board and act as accounting officer. The Fourth Schedule to the Bill sets out, in some detail, the functions of the director.</P>
    <P>Members of the House should note in particular the important effect of section 28 which gives the education boards the power to establish committees to assist them in performing their functions. It is my intention that this section will enable the boards to harness the energy and interest of individuals and groups, with the aim of improving the education service in their regions.</P>
    <P>Time and again during my period as Minister for Education I have been struck by the willingness, <Col N="1326" /> indeed the eagerness, of parents and the wider community to become involved in and support the work of the education system.  I am sure the House will agree these individuals and groups represent one of the most important and valuable resources of our system.  This Bill will, for the first time, provide a statutory basis for the work of these groups and individuals.</P>
    <P>Some questions have been asked about the funding of schools following the establishment of the education boards.  I have been asked whether schools will continue to receive funding on the same basis as at present or whether funding intended for schools can be siphoned off to administer education boards.  Section 37 specifically provides that the Minister for Education will determine each year the criteria by which schools are to be funded.  Each education board will be obliged to make to each recognised school in its region a grant or grants in accordance with these criteria.  These grants will be a first charge on the education boards each year.  This means the Minister for Education &mdash; not any individual education board &mdash; will continue to determine the criteria by which schools will be funded.  These criteria will be standard national criteria for each school or class of school, thus ensuring a consistent provision of funding for education services across the country.  This also means that funds intended for schools cannot be used for any other purpose.</P>
    <P>The record shows that the funding of education has reflected its importance in Irish society.  The House will be aware that, during my time as Minister for Education, I secured a massive increase in the funding available for education, from £1.645 billion in 1992 to nearly £2.3 billion this year.</P>

    <P>The Education Bill, 1997, also deals with the important issue of the boards of management of schools.  This was one of the most important issues dealt with by the National Education Convention.  The introduction, on a voluntary basis, of boards of management at primary level in 1975 represented a huge leap forward in our education system.  The boards provide an opportunity for all interested parties &mdash; the patrons, parents and teachers &mdash; to play a meaningful role in the management of schools.  The Bill builds on the existing system and provides that every school at first and second level will have a board of management.  Members of a board will be appointed by the patron of the school in accordance with regulations made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Each board of management will act in accordance with policies determined by the Minister and will consult with and keep the patron informed of decisions and proposals of the board.  Concern has been expressed that boards of management will interfere with the property and other rights of patrons and owners.  The objective in the interests of the common good is to provide for a statutory scheme whereby all the interests in education can exercise their rights and know their responsibilities.  This requires a careful balance which is achieved in the reasonable and proportionate measures in the Bill.</P>
    <P>For more than a century and a half since the beginning of the system of national education, the role of the patrons of schools has become, and continues to be, of immense importance.  In recent years new patrons have emerged, for example, for multi-denominational schools and Gaelscoileanna.  This welcome development reflects the ongoing changes which continue to shape our society.  Patrons of schools have legitimate rights in the operation of schools.  The importance of the key role of the patron has been clearly recognised in the Education Bill.</P>
    <P>The patrons-owners of schools will retain a key role in the schools they founded and nurtured. The most significant effect of the Bill in respect of patrons-owners is that, under its provisions, the patrons will act to a greater degree than heretofore <Col N="1328" /> in partnership with parents, teachers and the community.  Such partnership is not a new departure as, for some time, the patrons have shared their role with the other partners.  The Bill arises from a deepening and broadening of that partnership while retaining the many benefits which flow from the close association patrons have with the schools.  The Education Bill, 1997, contains a number of important provisions for teachers. When it is enacted, teachers' representatives will have statutory entitlement to membership of education boards and boards of management.  Each education board will be obliged to consult teachers during the preparation of its education plan and will provide support services, including teacher welfare services.  Each school will have to ensure that staff development needs are identified and provided for.  Procedures for the appointment of principals and teachers will have to be agreed between the Minister for Education, the patron and teacher unions or staff associations. There will be a statutory obligation on each school board of management to consult teachers on the preparation of the school plan.</P>
    <P>A number of these provisions, in particular those relating to the appointment and dismissal of teachers, simply statutory underpin the procedures currently in operation in the education system and provide a statutory guarantee that any change in such procedures will occur only with the agreement of all the relevant partners.</P>
    <P>The Education Bill will for the first time, clearly define the role and responsibilities of the school.  This is an essentially commonsense provision, which sets out the functions the majority of schools fulfil every day.  What the section adds to the present arrangements is a clear statement of the rights and responsibilities of all of the members of the school community.</P>
    <P>Section 44 sets out the functions of boards of management.  This section merely reflects what the majority of boards of management have been doing at primary level for the past 20 years, and in some second level schools for nearly as long.  It provides for the important role of the patron, and for the patron's right to be kept informed of the decisions and proposals of the board.  Most importantly it provides for parental choice, by confirming the rights of parents to choose a school for their children which is in line with their own cultural, educational, moral, religious and social values.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the Bill is that it provides a statutory framework for the preparation of school plans in consultation with the parents, the patron, staff and students of the school.  It specifically takes into account those students and their parents who feel they have been dealt with unjustly within the education system. Section 55 provides a mechanism for a student and/or parent, to appeal a decision of a teacher or other members of staff, when the decision materially affects the education of the student.  Depending on the type of appeal involved, appeals may be re-heard in full, or the <Col N="1329" /> issue may be considered on procedural grounds alone.  However, when the decision relates to a refusal to enrol a student, or to the permanent exclusion of a student from a school, the appeal will be the subject of a full rehearing.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed that the appeals system may cause a great deal of extra work for schools.  These concerns are unfounded.  The appeals system will include safeguards against frivolous or mischievous appeals and will be used only when a matter materially affecting a student is not resolved at principal or even at board of management level.  The system will deal with serious grievances with speed and finality.  The Minister will consult the partners in education to frame regulations under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The present system of administration of our education system dates back to the 19th century. We can improve this system, in terms both of its inclusiveness and its effectiveness.  I remind the House of an observation made by the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Costello, on 11 October last year.  He said:</P>
    <P>Hundreds of millions of pounds are spent annually on education by means of administrative measures known only to a handful of officials and specialists ... the measures [are] not readily available to the public and their effect [is] uncertain and often ambiguous.</P>
    <P>The Education Bill will address this concern.  It is landmark legislation which arose from a sustained, open and intensive process of consultation with all of the partners in education.  It is rooted in the White Paper, Charting our Education Future, and provides the means by which many of the Government's White Paper commitments will be implemented.</P>
    <P>The White Paper principles of pluralism, partnership, accountability, quality and equality form the basis of this Bill which seeks to place the education system on a new footing.  It will provide for a new dynamic and pro-active approach to education. I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate, I am concerned at the haste with which the Bill is being pushed through the House.  It would appear that many of the educational interests have not had sufficient time to circulate the Bill to their members, organise meetings, facilitate inputs from their members and prepare an articulated position on the Bill following such consultations.  In recent days, when word went out that the Bill was to be debated on Second Stage in the House, many organisations have been frantically faxing to me, and other Deputies, their hurried positions on it. From a democratic perspective, this is unsatisfactory and makes a mockery of the principle of partnership enshrined in the White Paper on Education.  I suspect the Bill is being rushed through the House primarily out of electoral considerations. The Minister is anxious to have it through the Houses of the Oireachtas before the <Col N="1330" /> general election which is due to take place in either May or June.  She can then wave it around and say, &ldquo;I had a Bill passed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With respect, the Bill is of more fundamental importance than meeting certain electoral needs of the Labour Party.  Adequate time should have been given to all the partners in education to study and reflect on it to formulate a policy position. That is not the case and it does not reflect well on the Minister.  The Bill is an attempt to give a legislative framework to the education system and marks the continuation of a process begun by the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, and continued by her colleagues, Deputies Davern and Seamus Brennan, which led to the publication of the Green and White Papers on Education.</P>
      <P>No one has a difficulty with placing the education system on a proper, sound statutory footing. The Bill, as presented, however, involves much more than that.  It is fundamentally undemocratic and the very antithesis of true devolution of authority and responsibility.  Control from the centre permeates every section.  Far from representing a radical devolution of authority from the top down, the Bill reinforces and strengthens ministerial control over education. The Minister is mentioned repeatedly, almost in every second line, and retains strong power over the entire education system.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to establish ten regional education boards which will introduce a new intermediate tier in the education system.  Fianna Fáil is opposed to the establishment of these boards on the grounds they will be too expensive and too remote from local education interests.  Conservative estimates suggest that in time they could cost up to £50 million per annum to administer. Fianna Fáil pledges to abolish them on its return to office.  We believe that all available resources must be channelled through to the classroom and not wasted on expensive and undemocratic bureaucracies.</P>
      <P>The Bill, on reflection, has a strong bias against denominational schools.  As presently worded, it takes up a strong anti-denominational schools approach.  The CPSMA stated in its submission:</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Education Bill, 1997 would appear to impact more on denominational schools than on vocational, comprehensive or community schools.  Our overall impression of the Education Bill, 1997 is that the State, through the Minister for Education, is planning to exercise a degree of control not hitherto experienced by our schools.</P>
      <P>It is of the view that certain provisions will have the effect of giving the State an undue and unnecessary level of control over the provision, management and functioning of schools.  This is contrary to the Constitution, in particular Article 42.4.  It is also of the view that section 43 represents the greatest intrusion by the State into the management of schools not established by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> Denominational schools have been of fundamental importance to the evolution and development of education since the foundation of the State.  They, too, have rights.  Parents, students and the entire denominational schools' community have rights which seem to have been ignored by the Bill which, in many respects, tramples on existing rights and on the degree of local autonomy and independence these schools enjoy.  It will require considerable amendment to meet the concerns of the denominational schools sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill fails miserably to deal with the issue of disadvantage and poverty.  The most fundamental objective of education as we move towards the end of the century is to eliminate all forms of disadvantage. To do so would provide children from disadvantaged and poor backgrounds with the opportunity to progress and develop to their full potential in life.  Fianna Fáil accepts the fundamental point made by the CORI that the education system is failing to meet the needs of the poor.  Consequently, the Bill needs to promote equality of access to, participation in and benefit from education and should be weighted in favour of the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The rights of the child are not clearly defined in the Bill.  This is surprising given the central importance of the child to the education debate.</P>
    <P>We are extremely disappointed the Minister failed to use the opportunity to define properly the professional role of the teacher in the modern education system.  The Bill demeans and undermines the status of the teacher in education.  That is a major flaw.  In addition, the school principal is given no leadership role.  His or her status has been reduced to that of an employer managing staff.</P>
    <P>We welcome the provisions in relation to parents and the statutory rights conferred on them to sit on boards of management and other authorities in education.  This was signalled in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>The power giving the Minister the right to prescribe the core curriculum is unacceptable.  It is unbelievable that she had not included an obligation to consult and agree the core curriculum with all the partners in education under the umbrella of the National Curriculum and Assessment Council.</P>
    <P>There are no specific or detailed provisions dealing with adult and lifelong learning.  This is contrary to modern realities in the education system.</P>
    <P>The Bill is fundamentally anti-democratic and will increase in an extensive way the power of the Minister over education.  As opposed to a radical devolution of authority from the top down, it reinforces and strengthens ministerial control over education.  The Minister is mentioned repeatedly and retains strong power over the proposed regional education boards.  The Minister will have the power to specify the maximum net expenditure which may be incurred in a financial <Col N="1332" /> year.  Ministerial sanction will be required for the purchase, sale or leasing of land or premises.  The Minister will have the power to designate for employment employees of the Minister or a vocational education committee.  A board will have no choice but to accept the person or persons designated.</P>
    <P>Alarmingly, the Minister will have the power to reject or amend an operational plan submitted by a board.  The Minister will have extraordinary powers in the formulation of such a plan.  When one considers that the plan will have been prepared by the director and then presented to the board, it seems the role of board members in this exercise is marginal and, at best, consultative.</P>
    <P>Section 57 gives the Minister unlimited power in the making of regulations concerning patrons and boards of management.  The Minister retains the power to appoint members to education boards.  While candidates can be nominated by organisations connected with the area in question to fill vacancies, for example, teachers, parents and councillors, they will be appointed by the Minister.  In essence, the Minister will appoint the entire core board in addition to the ministerial nominees.  This is anything but democratic.</P>
    <P>There are 11 national bodies representing parents in the education system.  Each will have the authority to nominate a person but the Minister will have the power to appoint him or her to the board.  Likewise, there are ten national bodies representing teachers and four representing principals. Each will have the right to nominate a person but the Minister will have the power to appoint him or her to the board, of which one member at least must be a principal of a school somewhere in the region covered by the board who may be nominated by a recognised trade union or staff association.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have power in relation to the composition of boards of management.  Ministerial approval will be necessary for the purchase of school buildings or the leasing of land for schools.  The Minister will retain power to determine policy regional education boards, to remove functions from them, to dissolve a board and suspend a director as well as complete control over staff and staff qualifications.  The Minister will determine all grants and the form in which reports are submitted by education boards.  The Minister will also have the power to have reports made on education boards and to prescribe the curriculum.  Consultation and agreement with the partners in education is absent from these proposals and powers enshrined in the Bill.  There is no obligation on the Minister in exercising these powers to consult with the partners in education or to move forward in agreement with them.</P>
    <P>I have outlined a long list of the Minister's powers but the list is endless and runs contrary to the principles outlined in the White Paper on Education and to the Minister's press statements on the Bill.  It is fundamentally undemocratic. Despite the National Education Convention and the alleged consensus which emerged from it, I <Col N="1333" /> have been struck by the widespread concern and opposition among the partners in education to the establishment of regional education boards.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has long argued that the ten regional education boards proposed by the Minister are too large in geographical remit and are too expensive.  The Minister has repeatedly refused to give specific information to this House on the cost of the proposed boards.  Her replies to parliamentary questions on this subject have been vague and lacking in precise information.  In her most recent reply, she confirmed that she has employed consultants, Deloitte &amp; Touche, to draw up a report on the internal reorganisation of the Department and the establishment of the ten education boards.  The Minister does not have any clear view as to how these boards will operate or what they will cost.  She stated in her reply to a parliamentary question on 23 January 1997: &ldquo;It is not possible to be precise about the cost implications of the establishment of education boards at this time&rdquo;.  The Minister also confirmed in that reply that the establishment of education boards would take place on a phased basis with a gradual transfer of functions to the board and that this would facilitate careful appraisal of the incremental cost of the board in the context of the Education Estimates for the year in question within the overall context of the budgetary parameters approved by Government.  The Minister is essentially talking about a long-term process and has studiously avoided giving any details to the Oireachtas on the cost of these boards.</P>
    <P>The experience in Northern Ireland with the development of regional education boards does not give rise to confidence.  Administrative costs alone are extremely high.  Fianna Fáil's view is that regional education boards are an unnecessary intermediate tier in Irish education which will cost too much.  They will not respond to local interests because they will represent large geographical areas and populations.  For example, the South-East Regional Education Board will cover six local authorities, including Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford County Borough, Waterford County, Wexford and Tipperary South Riding.  How could a single board &ldquo;be responsive to the diverse and sometimes conflicting needs of large urban areas and sparsely populated rural districts and also be coherent and equitable in its provisions?&rdquo;  asks the CSPAI?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's view is that the county unit is the most appropriate mechanism to improve the levels of co-ordination at local level and to develop co-ordinated local responses to educational needs.  We favour the establishment of county education fora whereby the various partners in education would establish educational priorities in a given area and co-ordinate their implementation.</P>
    <P>The Secondary Schools Principals' Association is concerned about the cost of establishing these boards.  The association asks how the introduction of new administrative bureaucracies with all the basic requirements of office accommodation, <Col N="1334" /> equipment and salaries and professional administrative staff can be justified.  It also asks who can justify putting precious educational funding into another layer of administration while schools are crying out for basic repairs, adequate classroom space, resources for children with special needs, science equipment or classroom materials.</P>
    <P>The ASTI is also critical of the proposal to establish regional education boards.  Its position paper states: &ldquo;The wisdom of establishing in such a small nation an additional tier of administration in the form of regional education boards that are inserted between the Department of Education and the individual school boards of management is questionable&rdquo;.  The ASTI has made a valid point that there already exists in many local communities a strong sense of identity linked to the local school.  It states that the introduction of regional education boards could dilute this feeling of identity by diminishing the autonomy of the individual school and making it appear to be just another cog in a large bureaucratic machine. What is not understood by many in Irish education is the degree to which the existing system allows for a strong measure of local autonomy and decision-making at the level of the school.</P>
    <P>There has been a history of non-interference on the part of Government with individual schools in relation to operational matters.  Within the context of national guidelines, for example, schools currently have decision-making powers with regard to entry, suspension and expulsions, choice of curriculum programmes, choice of textbooks and school ethos.  The Bill as currently structured takes away these powers and, under the guise of decentralisation, will create powerful regional boards and directors which will gradually weaken the current self-governing autonomy of schools.</P>
    <P>The ASTI also states: &ldquo;The history of non-interference on the part of the Government means that individual schools have retained a high level of decision-making authority, including the power to appoint staff and indeed to decide whether to close or keep open the school&rdquo;.  The Bill involves a dilution of the power of boards of management and is a matter of great concern in that regard.  Even the board of management will not have a school policy function or authority under this legislation.  It will, according to the Bill, have to perform functions &ldquo;in accordance with the policies determined by the education board and the Minister from time to time&rdquo;.  Following the implementation of the Bill, boards of management will clearly have less autonomy and freedom than they currently enjoy.  So much for devolution of authority.</P>
    <P>The ASTI is also concerned about the funding issue and is sceptical about the capacity of the State to adequately fund regional education boards.  In the current edition of ASTIR, it labelled the Bill a bureaucratic nightmare for schools and also suggested that the establishment of regional education boards will camouflage State <Col N="1335" /> shortcomings in the area of education funding generally.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I want to make our position clear.  We believe in devolving as much authority as possible to the local board of management.  We are opposed to the establishment of regional education boards and will abolish them on return to office.  The fundamental interaction in Irish education remains that between child, teacher and parent and all available resources must be directed and allocated in that direction.  The elimination of inequality and disadvantage cannot wait for the establishment of regional education boards and must have first call on available resources.  Regional education boards will cost too much and will take resources from the classroom.  We intend to put all available resources into the classroom.</P>
    <P>We note that the Congress of Catholic Secondary Parents Associations is also opposed to regional education boards.  It accounts for 63 per cent of all students attending second level education and its views demand recognition.  Its concern is that the establishment of regional education boards represents a hidden agenda by the Minister for Education to phase out voluntary secondary schools altogether.  This is a most serious concern and I would appreciate it if the Minister would confirm her position on the retention of voluntary schools and her support for fostering their ongoing development.</P>
    <P>The CPSA has consistently opposed the setting up of education boards on the grounds that they would be costly and unrepresentative because they would only have a small number of members representing parents who have the largest stake in the education system.  It has also expressed its concern at the lack of any research on the costings of the proposed regional education boards and remains unconvinced that they would not represent an immense cost.</P>
    <P>In a recent article, it highlighted the fundamentally centralised and undemocratic nature of regional education boards.  Because they are so large in geographical remit and so removed from the county unit, they cannot take local interests into account.  The CPSA outlined the scenario of parent representatives on a given regional education board.  Two or three parent representatives would be nominated by a national association of parents and appointed by the Minister.  Those few parents on, say, board ten which covers Galway, Mayo and Roscommon will have to represent up to 24,000 pupils at second level and probably a similar number at primary level.  Representation will also include vocational education committee pupils.  Two-thirds of the representation will include voluntary secondary schools and one-third will include vocational education committees, community and comprehensive schools, as well as the primary sector.  The two or three parents on a board could represent the parents of up to 50,000 students.  How will those parents ascertain the wishes of those they represent?  How will <Col N="1336" /> they report back to the interest group?  Where will they meet to prepare policy positions or to discuss education board questions before or after a meeting?  Apart from travelling expenses, who will pay for the work of those parent representatives? Those are practical concerns about the operation of those boards and they merit considerable examination.  I outlined them to illustrate many of the practical difficulties that will follow the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the powers of the director of a new regional education board will be very significant and on a par with, if not greater than, those enjoyed by a county manager.  However, the powers of board members will not be on a par with those of elected representatives to a local council. There is a clear imbalance here.  If the Minister was really interested in local democracy and devolving authority, she would agree that board members and not the director should have the authority and power.  The director will be as powerful as a county manager in a local authority.</P>
    <P>Following detailed consideration of the Bill there is increasing concern about its impact on denominational schools at primary and secondary level.  There is a view abroad that the new legislation together with the implementation of REBs will spell the demise of the voluntary secondary school as we know it today.  As a result of the Bill the State, through the Minister for Education, will exercise a degree of control not hitherto experienced by schools.  There will be a fundamental shift away from local school autonomy to the centre and the State will be the primary controlling force in education.  That is the view of the CPSMA, an important partner in Irish education. It states that certain provisions of the Bill &ldquo;will have the effect of giving the State an undue and unnecessary level of control over the provision, management and functioning of schools&rdquo;.  It is its view that this was never intended under the Constitution or by the principals in the White Paper on Education.  The president of the Catholic Schools Parents Association, Mr. John White, has gone on record as describing the Bill as &ldquo;repugnant of voluntary education and especially to voluntary catholic education&rdquo;.  Why are bodies like that becoming increasingly concerned about the Bill and its impact on them?  A number of bodies from CORI and the Catholic Primary Management Association to the Congress of Catholic Secondary Schools Parents Association are alarmed about the impact of the Bill on their positions.  A total of 63 per cent of the State's second level students attend Catholic and Protestant voluntary secondary schools.  Those parents have the right to make that choice and neither the Minister nor any future Minister can deprive them of it.  They have described section 43 as &ldquo;the greatest intrusion by the State into the management of schools which are not established by the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives extraordinary powers to the Minister to dictate the composition of school boards.  It also gives the Minister power to withdraw <Col N="1337" /> funding from schools which do not have boards and are in conformity with the terms of the Bill.  That type of dictatorship from the centre is outrageous and will be repealed by Fianna Fáil on its return to Government.  We must retain the diversity in our second level education system which has grown historically.  There is richness in diversity which should be promoted and nurtured. The funding arrangements for the three types of second level schools are not equal at present.  It has been proven by objective studies that funding for second level voluntary schools has fallen behind over the years and that the State has not allocated sufficient resources to them.  The Minister established belatedly a steering group on the funding of second level schools. That commitment was given in the White Paper more than two years ago and when the Minister came into office four years ago.  However, it took four years for her to establish the group, again on the eve of a general election.  She knows that any decisions arising from its recommendations will not be made prior to a general election.</P>
    <P>At primary level the position is also unclear. Up to now various groups, including denominational groups, gaelscoileanna, multidenominational groups and so on had the right to establish primary schools where the need arose.  Often it was the denominational group which provided the building and the land.  Section 9 (2) (g) seems to imply that after the passage of the Bill the regional boards will be the only body with the statutory right to give recognition to any new school established and to lease any land or buildings to any person or group of persons establishing a school.  I accept the point made by the CPSMA that it should be made absolutely clear that nothing in section 9 (2) (g) precludes the establishment of a school by a person or body of persons on land and buildings provided other than by lease from the education board.  Otherwise it would be accepted that all future schools would be totally determined and controlled by the education boards.  This theme runs through the Bill and it is something with which I have a fundamental difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Constitution gives parents the right to choose an education for their children.  Groups in society should be entitled to form or establish schools.  They should be entitled to some assistance from the State, but without diktats concerning the manner in which they are established and the composition of boards of management and so forth.  The State should work in partnership with those groups and various bodies, be they denominational or non-denominational.  The daily reality is that the State operates in partnership with all types of interests from denominational to multi-denominational, to gaelscoileanna and so on.  All the groups concerned have rights and entitlements and it would be wrong for the State to take those rights from such groups and to bring them all under the direct and total control of the State. In essence that is what is proposed in the Bill.  As worded, it has serious implications for denominational <Col N="1338" /> schools in general.  There is no democratic mandate to so dramatically and radically change denominational education.  Parents have rights to send their children to schools which are denominational in character and under whose ethos parents wish to have their children educated. Many aspects of the Bill could fly in the face of the ethos of a particular denominational school.  For example, the wide-ranging powers given to the Minister in relation to the prescribing of the core curriculum could be used in such a manner as to undermine the ethos of such a school.  It should be made clear that no element of a core curriculum could be prescribed by a Minister which would have the effect of undermining the ethos of any school.</P>
    <P>Section 57 gives widespread powers to the Minister in almost all matters of educational administration.  The unbridled powers of the Minister could be used in the future to undermine the ethos of denominational schools.  Section 46 is poorly worded and only gives schools a right to manage their affairs in accordance with the Bill. It should be amended to read that the right of schools to manage their own affairs in accordance with the Bill and with other instruments such as the deeds of trust for primary schools that have been negotiated by the Department and the various partners.  It is interesting to note that the Bill makes no reference to the deeds of trust negotiated with the primary school partners.  Perhaps that is because those deeds of trust are the subject of examination by the Attorney General who is determining their general legality and their constitutionality. It is extraordinary that the Minister would publish an education Bill in advance of having secure knowledge on the constitutionality of the deeds of trust which are so essential to the establishment of school boards of management and to the continuing agreement of all the school partners.  Under normal circumstances a Bill would not be published until the legality of agreements that will eventually underpin the Bill have been tested.  This confirms my view that the Bill has been published and is being rushed through the House with a view to the forthcoming general election.  Electoral considerations are uppermost in the Minister's mind.  The &ldquo;i's&rdquo; should be dotted and the &ldquo;t's&rdquo; crossed before a Bill like this should be passed through Dáil Éireann.  As matters stand we do not know whether the deeds of trust negotiated by the Minister and the partners at primary level are constitutional or generally legal and applicable.  Some sections of the Bill could be unconstitutional.  In my view section 37 (7) dealing with the composition of school boards is unconstitutional. I do not believe that the State has the right to deprive any school of funding simply because it does not establish a board of management that is consistent with legislation introduced by the State.  This is an outrageous provision which should be withdrawn forthwith.</P>
    <P>One of the major concerns of denominational school interests is the degree to which patrons have been written out of the Bill.  Adequate reference <Col N="1339" /> to them is absent from the Bill.  The patrons who hold ultimate responsibility for the schools inevitably must have a significant role in the development of a school.  The regional boards essentially reduce the status of school patrons to that of irrelevant bystanders.  Occasionally the Bill refers to consultation with the patrons, but in the view of patrons that is not sufficient.  The Bill could be inoperable if this issue is not resolved. CORI in its analysis of the Bill is very critical of its provisions in relation to school patrons and states:</P>
    <P>The Bill's misrepresentation of the role of patron and its failure to take account of the consultation process leading to the White Paper are fundamental flaws.  These flaws mean that the harmonisation of existing rights which the Bill was meant to enshrine has not been achieved.  They also undermine the Bill's stated commitment to diversity of school types and they threaten the Bill's constitutionality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In addition, CORI strongly criticised section 37 (7) of the Bill which deals with the freezing of funds.  It argues there is a strong body of legal opinion which suggests that any legislation which gives the Minister for Education the power to require that schools be managed by a particular kind of board is unconstitutional.  CORI's legal advice indicates that this proposal does not overcome the constitutional obstacle described by Farry, Whyte and others.  Fianna Fáil's legal advice is similar and we believe, like others, that the imposition of boards of management as envisaged in the Bill would be likely to be found unconstitutional if it were challenged after its enactment.</P>
    <P>It was agreed in the White Paper that school plans would require the agreement or the approval of the patrons on matters concerning the school's values and ethos.  According to CORI, provision for approval of plans is necessary to avoid situations where, for example, a school plan proposed to adopt a policy or practice which would be at variance with the core values of the school.</P>
    <P>We regret the degree to which the Bill undermines the status of the teacher and the school principal.  This Bill represents a change in the administrative framework.  Fianna Fáil suggests there are more radical ways of changing the educational system.  For example, a national educational psychological service could be established quite easily by taking it out of the Department and establishing an independent board.  The conduct and management of national State examinations could be taken out of the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is good to have this opportunity to discuss national education policy.  I agree there are many organisations that are still considering their responses to this Bill and feel more time could have been allowed to consider those responses.  I regret that and it is unfortunate that a longer period was not allowed to those organisations which are still seeking meetings with various spokespersons.  I have met many of them and have more to meet.</P>
      <P>Education is one of the most important functions of Government.  Government funds the education system and decides to a large extent how that system is organised and operated and how resources are allocated.  Government decides what is taught and how students' performance is assessed.  Education is one of the single largest calls on the public purse.  In the current year, the Exchequer will provide some £2.3 billion to fund the education system, which represents about one sixth of total Government spending on services. Taking all these factors into account, it is strange that the subject of education is not discussed more fully and frequently by this House.</P>
      <P>Our education system has, as the Minister said, by and large served this country well.  There have been huge improvements over the past 75 years and the vast majority of Irish students can now obtain a school education that is as good as that in most European countries and better than many.  However, the system is still faced with major problems.  An Education Bill, particularly one as large and extensive as this one, with more than 60 sections running to 45 pages, should deal with these problems.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a disappointment and does not deal with the major issues.  It is concerned almost wholly with bureaucratic structures and has little or nothing to say about the quality of education or how it can be improved.  The main purpose of this Bill is the establishment of the regional education boards.  At a rough count, something like three in every four sections in this Bill are concerned with the new boards in one shape or form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, problems in our educational system and I hope to deal with some of them later.  However, I do not believe that problems as regards structures and decision making will be solved by creating new quangos.  People may be clamouring for a new prisons board to sort out the dreadful mess in our jail system or a new courts board to streamline the management of the courts but they are not shouting from the rooftops for the establishment of a network of regional education boards in the form proposed <Col N="1341" /> by the Minister.  In fact, many of the partners in education have been highly critical of these boards.  All are concerned about the directing of resources into administration and bureaucracy rather than education where it is needed.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education may never have set the world on fire as far as innovation and efficiency are concerned.  However, any faults in the administrative system could be solved by ensuring that the Department was better managed. I say this in light of the fact that the Minister has engaged consultants to examine the workings of the Department.  This is not justification for establishing a whole new network of State boards.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Thatcher was the pioneer of quangos in Britain.  Her philosophy seemed to be that power should be concentrated as far as possible in the hands of unaccountable and unelected public bodies.  Her philosophy also ensured that the bodies provided marvellous opportunities for political patronage and that the ideal person to sit on the board of such a body was what she termed &ldquo;one of us&rdquo;.  We are in danger of creating a bureaucratic nightmare with this legislation.  It is not just the boards that will come into existence. Section 28 provides for the establishment of committees that will operate under the boards.  How are we managing to educate anybody without these committees or quangos?  If the Government is really serious about the devolution of responsibilities from the centre, it must look at the existing local authorities.</P>
    <P>We have a long established tradition of democratically elected local government.  Over the years, powers have been stripped away from local councils so we are left with local administration rather than local democracy.  Instead of giving new powers to councils, however, we seem to favour the quango approach every time.  We have separate local and regional bureaucracies for tourism, industrial development, health services and vocational education.  In other countries most, if not all, of these services are controlled by democratically elected local government.  Switzerland and Denmark are good examples of how real devolution from the centre to the regions and local communities can be managed successfully.</P>
    <P>However, we must ask whether this Bill and these boards are really about devolution.  We should consider the situation when the regional education boards are up and running.  Some 90 per cent of spending at first and second level goes on the remuneration of teachers and former teachers.</P>
    <P>Teachers and how they are paid, are the critical element in the management of our educational system.  This area will continue to be the preserve of the Minister for Education even after the boards are established.  The Minister will be responsible for the level of teachers' salaries and for dealing with teachers' pay claims and pensions. The Minister will also be responsible for determining the number of hours per week teachers work, deciding teachers' holiday entitlements <Col N="1342" /> and terms and conditions of employment. I am not saying that the Minister should not be responsible for these matters.  However, what is the point in establishing these new boards if the Minister will still run the whole show from Marlboro Street In any event, the new boards will be totally dependent on the Minister for all their funding.  Effectively, the boards will spend the money they get from the Minister in the way that the Minister tells them.  That is not devolution; it is a sham.  It is peculiar that in a Bill which is supposed to be about devolution, the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; appears no less than 225 times.  I hope I have got the count right.</P>

      <P>The Minister will not give any clear indication of what the new structures will cost. The Minister for Finance has refused to reveal to the Dáil the internal tentative costings prepared by the Department of Finance.  Experience in Ireland has shown that bureaucracies do not come cheap.  Once established, they have a tendency to grow and their budgets have a tendency to expand.  Various estimates of what the boards will cost have been aired, with suggestions ranging from £20 million to £50 million a year.  The Minister should use this debate to clarify the position on funding.</P>
      <P>How much will these boards cost?  The Minister has continually stonewalled on this.  For months we have consistently tried to obtain the figure from the Minister and the Minister for Finance. All we get is a fudged answer that they will be gradually introduced according to budgetary parameters. Whatever the figure, I question whether this is the manner in which we should spend our education budget.  Can we afford the luxury of regional education boards?  We know that hardly a week passes without some new horror story emerging of rat-infested primary schools in need of refurbishment or replacement.  If the funds to rectify these very serious problems are limited, how can money be found to set up this new layer of bureaucracy?</P>
      <P>According to the Bill the first object of each education board is to ensure that an appropriate level and quality of education is available to each person within its region.  Has that not been the case anyway?  Surely the Department has not been idle for the past 75 years.  Is the Minister admitting that her Department has been deficient in its responsibilities in this respect?</P>
      <P>The education boards might make some sense if they formed part of some coherent strategy for regional devolution but they do not.  None of the so-called regionalisation initiatives of recent years fits in with others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the House an example.  The counties of Cavan and Monaghan are combined, for industrial <Col N="1343" /> development purposes, with Louth to form the north-east region.  For tourism purposes they are combined with Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo to form the north-west region.  For regional authority purposes they are combined with all of the aforementioned counties to form a so-called Border region stretching from the northern tip of Donegal to Drogheda.  For vocational education purposes the two counties are entirely separate entities, each having its own vocational education committee.  The Minister proposes to include Cavan and Monaghan in the north-eastern region education board.  This unlikely creation will stretch from the Dublin suburbs at Clonee to the Fermanagh border at Swanlinbar.  If we are serious about regional government, about devolution, that is not the way to go about it.</P>
    <P>What of the vocational education committees? What kind of administrative logic is to be found in leaving these in place alongside the proposed new boards?  Can the Minister point to any other country with two parallel sets of administration for governing education?  No matter how one views them, these new education boards do not fit into any kind of coherent system of local or regional administration; they will have the appearance of devolution and decentralisation but without their substance.  They will have nothing to do with democracy or equality, rather everything to do with the State under the guise of a regional framework, doing to education what it has done already to local government.  They will be about as parent-controlled as health boards are patient-controlled, as independent of Marlborough Street as the average urban district council is independent of the Custom House.  To whom will they be answerable?</P>
    <P>I wonder where the Fine Gael Party stands in all of this.  The Taoiseach pointed out recently that Fine Gael in Government had no policies of its own any more.  Is this another example of that syndrome?  Since I cannot recall any Fine Gael candidate in the last election calling for the establishment of regional education boards, I wonder has that party fully signed up to this scheme.  I know there is resistance within its membership to these proposals.  I would be very surprised to hear Fine Gael Members champion in any way the establishment of these regional education boards.</P>
    <P>I shall refer to some specific problematical sections of the Bill, to which Deputy Martin has already referred.  This Bill represents not only a bureaucratic nightmare but a constitutional mine-field. Sections 35 to 38, inclusive, deal with schools.  Any Bill that gives a Minister power to demand that schools be managed by a certain type of board will be deemed by many people to be open to constitutional challenge.  I refer in particular to section 37 (7) which provides for the freezing of funds, although without withdrawing recognition from those schools that fail to comply with a ministerial order on boards of management, which has been the subject of legal opinion. That legal opinion stated that the imposition of <Col N="1344" /> boards of management, as envisaged in the Bill, if challenged, would be likely to be found unconstitutional and that the entire Bill could fall if referred by the President to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Section 39 deals with the inspectorate.  I welcome the proposals to put the inspectorate on a statutory basis.  Given that the present service is overburdened and under-resourced, how does the Minister envisage this working?  It appears that this section is largely aspirational.  Giving the inspectorate powers without resources is nonsensical.</P>
    <P>The subject of school patrons is very problematical. Like all other parties in this House, the Progressive Democrats are committed to the principle of pluralism in this society and to the maintenance of diversity in our education system. Section 41 decrees that, where a new school is being established by a group, that group, in its choice of patron, must receive ministerial approval.  I am not sure I see the logic behind that provision.  For instance, if a group of parents comes together to form a new school and decides it wants a local Church of Ireland archbishop to be its patron, surely that is sufficient.  Why should that require ministerial approval?  How will the Minister decide whether a particular patron is or is not suitable?  What criteria, if any, are in place for determining the suitability of school patrons? Will there be a system of appeals to allow people, if they wish, to challenge the Minister?  As the House will be aware, the Bill deals only with the registration of patrons.  The Minister should go further and define their role and rights.</P>
    <P>There is yet another area where this Bill will be open to constitutional challenge.  Article 42 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
    <P>In addition Articles 44.2.4, 44.2.5 and 44.2.6 are also relevant.  Subject to compliance with the requirement that the State, as guardian of the common good, is obliged to ensure that children receive that certain minimum education, it follows that questions of curriculum are matters entirely for parental choice.  The term &ldquo;certain minimum education, moral, intellectual and social&rdquo; referred to in Article 42.3.2 applies to all children.  It also follows that the State cannot use its obligation to ensure the receipt of such minimum education as an excuse to dictate the core curriculum of secondary education unless it acknowledges that it is obliged to provide that education for every child.  For instance, the reference to &ldquo;minimum education&rdquo; cannot authorise the State to determine the syllabus for teaching history to fifth and sixth year secondary students, nor can it possibly be used to determine the syllabus of subjects in respect of which a parent or <Col N="1345" /> student has any choice.  It would be utterly illogical to say that a child had an option whether to study, say, German or English but that the Minister could dictate the core curriculum for either subject, even though the education system did not require a child to study both.</P>
    <P>In the School Attendance Bill, 1942 case, reported in 1943 Irish Reports, at page 334, the Supreme Court had the following to say:</P>
    <P>The State is entitled to require that children shall receive a certain minimum education.  So long as parents apply this general standard of education we are of the opinion that the manner in which it is being given and received is entirely a matter for the parents and is not a matter in respect of which the State under the Constitution is entitled to interfere.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear, therefore, that the State, in general terms, is not entitled to prescribe the core syllabus for subjects to be taught in schools except in so far as that is necessary to comply with its obligation to ensure a certain minimum education for children, which must be of general application.  The State has no general right to prescribe syllabi for subjects at secondary level in optional subjects, and has no right to prescribe subjects as non-optional unless it can so justify by reference to the &ldquo;certain minimum education&rdquo; provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Article 42.4 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>The State shall provide for free primary education and shall endeavour to supplement and give reasonable aid to private and corporate educational initiative, and, when the public good requires it, provide other educational facilities or institutions with due regard, however, for the rights of parents, especially in the matter of religious and moral formation.</P>
    <P>That raises a further question as to whether the State is entitled to distinguish between schools which comply with a State curriculum, envisaged in the Bill as drafted, and other schools, and is entitled to exclude all schools that do not strictly comply with the State curriculum from receipt of State aid.  The legal view is that the Constitution does not give a mandate for such distinction. There are grave constitutional difficulties with this Bill.</P>
    <P>I referred to some of the major problems confronting our education system.  The first issue is educational disadvantage.  I would have thought this should be at the top of the Minister's list of priorities but it does not merit a mention in the Bill.  The full extent of this problem has not been adequately measured.  However, there are tens of thousands of children, mainly in the more deprived urban communities, whose needs are not being met by the system.  Many of them drop out in their early teens.  Others persevere longer but, ultimately, leave without formal qualifications. In some cases, they will not even have succeeded in mastering basic skills in literacy and <Col N="1346" /> numeracy.  These young people are part of what can be termed a self perpetuating underclass. Their parents got nothing out of the educational system; their grandparents got even less.  They are locked into a cycle that will take them from school to the dole.  They graduate within a year from short-term unemployment to long-term unemployment and, ultimately, to virtual unemployability. This is not just a tragedy for them and their families, but for us all.  Unemployability and social exclusion leads to anti-social behaviour in many cases.  The drop outs of today often become the criminals of tomorrow because they have no stake in society and feel abandoned.  In stark economic terms it only costs £50 per week to keep an individual in primary school while it costs £900 per week to keep one in Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>There is no easy solution to this problem but it is still the duty of Government to endeavour to solve it.  Early intervention is the key.  By the time a typical child from a seriously disadvantaged background enters the school system at the age of four, it is probably too late.  That child will be deficient in basic language and communication skills and will have spent its early years in a home where educational values were not regarded as important.  The first three years are vital and, if they have been lost, it is asking a great deal of our schools to make up for them.</P>
    <P>Clearly we need a national educational strategy of early intervention.  Proper support must be provided to disadvantaged families to cope with the education of their children during the first three years, the critical pre-school period.  Successful and cost-effective programmes have been developed in other countries to deal with this problem but we appear not to have a coherent approach to it.  New legislation is not required in this area.  The Minister would be far better advised spending even a relatively small amount of money dealing with this problem than blowing millions on more bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>Another issue of major importance to our educational system is the teaching of the Irish language. The Bill does not refer to this issue.  Apart from a fairly cursory mention in the White Paper on education policy, the Minister has had little to say about the way in which the Irish language is taught in our schools.  My party recently published a discussion document on this subject.  We showed that, while successive generations of Irish people have undergone 12 or more years' instruction in Irish, the vast majority of our adult population still do not have a reasonable command of the language.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out by Bord na Gaeilge, the State body charged with the promotion of the language, found that more than three quarters of Irish adults admitted to having little or no ability to speak the first official language of the State. The effort and the resources that go into the teaching of Irish are remarkable.  We estimate that the average student going through our educational system as far as the leaving certificate will have studied Irish for more than 2,000 hours <Col N="1347" /> during that time.  This is roughly equivalent to studying the language on a full time basis for 25 hours per week for two years, yet many young people leave our schools with less ability in Irish than in modern continental languages such as French and German.</P>
    <P>The general lack of fluency in the language is clearly reflected in support for the Irish language media.  RTE Radio One broadcasts the news every day in Irish and English; it is the same news but not the same audience.  The number of people listening to the news in English is 25 times greater than the number listening to it in Irish.  A huge amount of wasted effort goes into teaching Irish in our schools.  If people can get a basic knowledge of Spanish from tapes in 12 months, why can they not get a basic knowledge of Irish in 12 years at school?  Will the Minister outline her thinking on this subject and indicate whether her Department is working on any plans to deal with this problem?</P>
    <P>Another major issue to be confronted is the academic bias of our educational system.  Irish schools do a very good job of preparing students for the leaving certificate.  The leaving certificate is heavily geared towards preparing students for third level.  However, I am not sure our system serves the needs of students equally well.  It does not do enough to help people who want to move straight from school into the workplace.  Many of the new factories setting up around the country, particularly in the computer industry, find that many 18 year olds are ill-equipped to move from the classroom to the factory floor.  FÁS, thus, effectively second-guesses the educational system by running courses for school-leavers.  In many cases it teachers people skills they should have learned in school.</P>
    <P>I refer to modern languages.  We have tele-sales and computer support operations locating in Ireland which require young people with a good speaking knowledge of French, German, Spanish or Italian, yet many young people have to undergo additional courses in these languages to enable them to cope with the needs of the workplace. We should look more closely at the curriculum, particularly for second level schools.  It is important that our children receive a good liberal education but we will do our students a great disservice if we fail to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to survive and prosper in today's workplace.</P>
    <P>Curriculum development is a very important subject as is that of parents associations.  One might expect issues such as these to form the meat of any major legislation in the field of education. Instead, in the Bill they are relegated to a group of sections at the end styled &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo; but as framed may be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of this Bill is to establish regional education boards.  A great deal of time and effort will go into setting up these boards. They will swallow up a great deal of scarce <Col N="1348" /> resources when they are established but I fail to see how they will make any difference to the quality of education delivered in our schools.  Setting up regional boards should not be our top priority in education.  Instead, we should focus on the real issues.  What can we do to tackle the problem of educational disadvantage?  What can we do in terms of curriculum development?  What strategies can be put in place to improve the teaching of Irish?  What is the best way to manage the decline in pupil numbers that will be a central feature of the education system in the years ahead?  These are the issues the Minister and her Department should address.  This Bill should be the framework for the future of Irish education. Instead, it is a bureaucratic and constitutional minefield.  It will do nothing for the future of our children.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Tá áthas orm go bhfuil deis agam labhairt ar an mBille seo anocht.  Ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire a chaith an-chuid ama, ní ag caint ach ag éisteacht le han-chuid daoine a raibh suim acu san Oideachas.  Sa deireadh d'éirigh léi Bille a thabhairt isteach, rud nar éirigh le h-éinne roimpi.</P>
      <P>Os rud é gur chaith mé i bhfad níos mó blianta ag múineadh ná mar a chaithfidh mé mar Theachta Dála tá tuairimí faoi leith agam ar an oideachas agus déanfaidh mé iad sin a léiriú sul i bhfad.</P>
      <P>Rinne an Teachta Helen Keogh tagairt do labhairt na Gaeilge agus do na fáthanna nach labhrann daoine Gaeilge.  Sin ceist an-tábhachtach. Cén fáth nach bhfuil níos mó daoine ag labhairt Gaeilge sa Dáil?  Chaith gach éinne sa Dáil go leor blianta ag foghlaim Gaeilge &mdash; tá céimeanna ag an-chuid acu &mdash; ach ní labhrann siad Gaeilge sa Teach cé nach dtógfadh sé mórán trioblóide orthy sin a dhéanamh.  Déarfainn féin gur easpa suime atá i gceist.  Ní h-aon mhaith a bheith ag caint faoin nGaeilge muna bhfuilimid toilteanach an teanga a labhairt.  Sin fadhb a bhaineann leis an tír ar fad.  Níl go leor suime ag daoine an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Níorbh ghá ach beagán cleachtadh a dhéanamh agus bheadh Gaeilge ag gach éinne sa Teach seo, déarfainn. B'fhearr liomsa dá mbeadh i bhfad níos mó Gaeilge le cloisint.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bhí mé ag múineadh chreid mé nach raibh aon suim sa Ghaeilge ag na daoine a bhí í gceannas ar an tír, fiú amháin sa Roinn Oideachais, mar níor chuala mé daoine ag labhairt Gaeilge sa Dáil.  Fós ní minic a labhrann daoine Gaeilge sa Dáil agus ba chóir go mbeadh iarrachtaí níos fearr déanta.  Le cúnamh Dé áfach tiocfaidh feabhas ar an scéal agus beidh deáshampla á thabhairt sa Dáil.  Tá mé cinnte go labhróidh an chéad chainteoir eile Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on talking and listening to people, producing a Green Paper and several White Papers.  My ambition before I leave the Dáil is that some day I will be called to a higher authority and produce a brown paper.  The <Col N="1349" /> Minister said there has been little legislation in the education area.  While some groups might regret that, it is a marvellous tribute to the educational system, including the Department which is freely criticised by so many people.  It is also a marvellous tribute to teachers.  Such people would have remained at school beyond the age of 14 or 15 years.</P>
    <P>We should never decry our wonderful education system.  I was a teacher in the United States long before I entered politics and I was shocked at the first lecture I attended in a university there when the lecturer explained that he had to teach his first year students to read.  There were policemen with guns in schools.  Ireland is far removed from that but we have a habit of knocking ourselves.  We should be proud of our education system and particularly of our teachers. Even in this mad age of commercialism, many of them spend extra time helping students to gain skills in sport, acting, singing and other areas. They do so willingly and we should do everything possible to ensure that is recognised and nothing is done which gives them the impression that their work is not appreciated.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with producing education Bills is that everybody is an expert on education.  Everybody received a smidgen of education, whether they went willingly to school or cried all the time they were there, and they know what school and teachers are like.  Depending on their luck, they either have a good or bad impression which automatically prejudices their views.  No matter what is contained in an education Bill, it involves experts or self appointed experts.  The type of expert is immaterial because both express their views freely.  It also involves parents and if a school does not have the goodwill of parents, where can it go?  Parents should feel free to talk to teachers, and particularly principals because they are more inclined to talk to the principal than others, about matters which concern them. If there is a spirit of co-operation between parents and teachers, the school will be successful.</P>
    <P>Nothing is as bad as ill-will between parents and teachers because, apart from anything else, parents are so helpful to schools.  Many parents organised functions to provide equipment when the Department did not have the finance, or occasionally the goodwill, to do it.  Some of us were lucky enough to have an overhead projector before there was one in the Department of Education. It was wonderful to see the look of shock on the inspector's face when he saw it.  However, such co-operation is to everybody's benefit. Where parents are prepared to help out and teachers are willing to co-operate, as they should be, the children are the real beneficiaries.  This is the only thing that counts in education because if students do not gain from something, we are all wasting our time.  I am glad the role of parents is recognised in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am worried about section 54.  I received submissions from the ASTI, principals and a former manager.  They all have their views but I am concerned <Col N="1350" /> about the provision which states that a parents' association may advise a principal or the board on any matter relating to a school and the principal or board shall have regard to any such advice.  I have no difficulty if that is a generalisation to ensure parents feel free to make suggestions to a principal or a board.  However, I am concerned about the exact meaning of the phrase &ldquo;shall have regard to any such advice&rdquo;.  If people are considering whether a door should be locked permanently or whether French should be taken in the morning rather than the evening, a principal will usually listen to their views.  However, it is different if it involves compulsion.</P>
    <P>Section 54(2)(b) states that a parents' association may &ldquo;adopt a programme of activities which will promote the involvement of parents, in consultation with the Principal, in the operation of the school&rdquo;.  I am not sure how binding that provision will be but, regardless of their willingness and helpfulness, parents are like the rest of us and they all have different views.  Some think sport is more important than education while others think teaching a foreign language is more important than teaching Irish.  Others think everything should be done through Irish and more think Irish dancing should be part of the curriculum.  The difficulty is that parents, with the best will in the world, could find themselves talking to a principal whose head is spinning because he is wondering how he can accommodate all views.  The provision may just give parents the right to air their views, which I accept, but a principal should not feel tied by 14 different suggestions from 14 different parents.</P>
    <P>A principal's role can be difficult.  Nowadays most principals have secretaries but if I still had the privilege of being a full-time principal of an eight teacher school, I would object strongly to presenting a report to the board of management in Irish and English.  It is a fine suggestion but principals must deal with interruptions from parents, people selling books and other inquiries.  I recall one occasion when there was a knock on the classroom door.  When I went out, there was a man selling encyclopaedias, although they were not called encyclopaedias rather &ldquo;aids to learning&rdquo;. I was only back in the classroom when there was another knock and there was another man selling encyclopaedias for a different company. Such interruptions do not help teachers to keep cool and continue teaching mathematics or other subjects.</P>
    <P>If one is a serving principal, it is difficult to deal with such matters and do what one wants to do, which is teach.  Unless facilities exist, I would not go overboard about asking principals to produce reports.  The board may be asked to do it, but the principals will end up doing it.  The previous speaker referred to Fine Gael people but I am making these points as a teacher who believes in the practicality of education.  All the theories about power mean nothing to me because we should do whatever is good for students.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> The regional boards, like the health boards, are a bone of contention and there are different views regarding the work they carry out.  However, there is no doubt that they have the advantage of knowing the areas with which they deal and they are more accessible.  The Minister should listen carefully because if she sited the headquarters of the regional board for the south east in Carlow&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder why the Deputy advocates that proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i>&mdash;&mdash;it would be much more accessible to those in Kilkenny than is Dublin, for example.  With its regional college, St. Patrick's College which has links with University College Cork and London University and Benekerry National School, where I spent many years as a teacher, Carlow is an ideal site for the headquarters of the regional board.  It is time the town was recognised as being able to make a contribution.  That might be the most important statement I will make during my contribution.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the size of the regional boards.  I understand provision is made for a minimum of 36 members on each board.  I do not know how practical this will prove to be.  I served on a health board and I am not certain that boards of that size are what we require.  Provision is made for six public representatives to sit on each board but, again, I am not sure about the logic behind this.</P>
      <P>Under the Second Schedule, those not eligible to serve on an education board include: an &ldquo;undischarged bankrupt&rdquo;; a person who &ldquo;within the immediately preceding three years has, under the protection or procedure of a court, made a composition or arrangement with creditors&rdquo;; or someone who &ldquo;within the preceding five years has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment&rdquo;. That would be acceptable but it is also stated that a person who &ldquo;is for the time being entitled under the Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas to sit therein, or... is for the time being a member of the European Parliament&rdquo;. Therefore, Members of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament are included with other undesirables and I can only presume that the Minister was not involved in drafting the Second Schedule.</P>
      <P>It was reported on a radio programme this afternoon that 22 per cent of sitting Dáil Deputies have experience in the area of education.  It would be apt if those with knowledge of that subject were not disqualified from membership of the regional boards.  This is not the only Bill on which arguments of this type have arisen and someone should communicate with the civil servants or those in the Bills Office who rule out Members as undesirables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role and statutory position of inspectors was referred to but I could not care less if they <Col N="1352" /> were left to hand from windowsills in this regard. What do these people do?  On previous occasions I described inspectors as the bane of my life.  They interrupted people trying to do their best for pupils because they appropriated silly ideas from some foreign source which they believed could be applied throughout the education system.  They claimed they could assess an entire class within three minutes but were ignorant of whether certain pupils had eaten breakfast that morning.  The role of inspectors should have practical application.</P>
    <P>I note that, under the Bill, inspectors are given much responsibility, including providing advice to parents' councils.  However, I believe they will merely visit schools and not achieve anything useful. Inspectors, particularly in the case of young teachers, should serve as advisers.  For example, they could provide help to a teacher whom the principal of a school believed was in need of it rather than finding fault and trying to throw their weight around.  In fairness to current inspectors, I should state that I am speaking from experience of the bad old days when people obtained tremendous pleasure from insulting teachers. These individuals were once described as teachers who tired of classwork, came to prefer paperwork and eventually adopted the role of being unhelpful.</P>
    <P>Inspectors seem to have been given many responsibilities under the Bill and I would not like to see them removed from their main role, namely, helping teachers who may experience difficulty with discipline or methods of teaching. Adequate emphasis is no longer placed on modhanna múinte.  In the past a teacher would be taken apart following a sample lesson.  Outside the classroom, the inspector would say &ldquo;Bhí an ceacht sin go maith, a Sheáin, ach...&rdquo; and that &ldquo;ach&rdquo; covered a multitude of faults.  Whatever sense of pride one had on leaving the room, one had very little by the time he had finished.  This had a great effect and illustrated that, when teaching, one is not giving a lecture.  I will not refer to lecturers because some of them lack the ability to either lecture or teach.  At primary and secondary level, it is vital that teachers use the correct educational methods.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the powers granted to the boards to acquire land or buildings and lease them out.  What will happen to rural schools in this regard?  If a parish wants to build a school will it be at the mercy of a regional board which might decide that it would be better to site the school in the nearest town?  Can a parish apply to a regional board to have a new school built in its locality or will the board of education simply purchase land, construct a school and lease it? That may not be suitable for the people seeking such a school.</P>
    <P>If a town is engaged in a process of expansion and the board of management establishes a school structure, what would happen if three different groups, a non-demoninational section of the community, the Church of Ireland and the <Col N="1353" /> Roman Catholic Church, applied to be patrons? I have been asked this theoretical question but I do not know the answer to it.</P>
    <P>I could speak for the remainder of the evening if I were to enter into the detail of the Bill.  I welcome the legislation and I realise that, like the curate's egg, it has good and bad points.  Objections to the Bill will emerge during the debate but I do not accept Deputy Martin's assertion that the Minister is rushing the legislation through before the general election.  This Bill has undergone a lengthy gestation period and I compliment the Minister on its introduction because she must deal with Members, including myself, who believe they are experts on education.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there would be no need to introduce this Bill.  It could be placed on the scrap heap.  Deputy Browne provided practical examples of what it is like to be a teacher.  I have never been a teacher and I am no expert on education. However, I listen to other people's opinions and I believe I could provide a more practical perception of education than a theory of it.</P>
      <P>When the Minister introduced this Bill today, she spoke about the principle of partnership. That is laudable but is it possible to implement it?  She also mentioned the three words on which the Labour Party will hang itself &mdash; openness, transparency and accountability.  Those are also laudable but they have nothing to do with this Bill.</P>
      <P>If the Minister visited any of the 4,000 primary and second level schools and told the students, teachers, parents, principals, boards of management and anyone involved in education that this House would spend four and a half hours today discussing this Bill, that we would probably spend 30 hours discussing Committee Stage &mdash; we spent 22 hours discussing Committee Stage of the Universities Bill &mdash; and that the Seanad would spend a further 30 hours discussing it, they would be shocked because education is the Cinderella of official concerns.  However, they would also be delighted to hear what we have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister asked these people what they expect from this legislation, they would say new resources and a proper input in education.  The Minister will have to spend a further £5 million or £6 million, if not £50 million, implementing this legislation, although she has access to the largest education budget of almost £2.3 billion.  Every teacher and lay person would expect to get proper school buildings, remedial teachers, access to psychological services, new school books, a new curriculum, computers in primary schools, more career guidance teachers in second level schools, more music in schools, access to sports halls, an <Col N="1354" /> escort service for children with special needs and better school transport so that they could get rid of buses which were bought in the 1960s but which look like they were bought in the 1920s.</P>
    <P>If people sat in the public gallery they would hear what we will do.  We will establish regional education boards, recognise schools for the purposes of public funding and establish an inspectorate on a statutory basis.  If Deputy Browne became Minister for Education, God help the cigire.  We will also provide for the establishment, composition and functions of boards of management of schools, establish the role of parents' associations, allow appeals by students or their parents and provide for the making of regulations by the Minister.  These people would say we have three heads because we are doing nothing about education.</P>

      <P>We are legislators but these people would tell us we do not know what we are doing.  That is the biggest criticism of politicians over recent years.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows I am opposed to the establishment of regional education boards because there is no need for them.  I am sure she receives millions of letters every day asking her for money for other educational needs.  The child must benefit, not bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>The Minister wants to establish ten education regions.  I attended a selection convention on Sunday and the two parishes of Gweedore and the Rosses could not agree on who to select as a candidate for the general election.  How will the people of County Donegal, County Leitrim and County Sligo agree when they all have different priorities and needs, although they are in the same profession?</P>

      <P>Section 9 provides for the objectives and functions of an education board. Section 9(1)(a) states: &ldquo;to ensure that there is made available to each person living within that region an appropriate level and quality of education, other than university or third level education, to meet the needs of that person&rdquo;.  I am delighted that is included, but how will we meet the needs of every person?  This will be a minefield because every person who goes to pre-school or primary or second level school has a different need.  As a recent court case showed, many children's needs are not being met.  Many children have, or feel they have, special needs.  It will be difficult to amend section 9 (1) (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is promoting parental choice.  I have no problem with that but there must also be access where the patron allows a pupil to move <Col N="1355" /> from one school to another, although this will lead to school transport problems.  Creevy National School, for example, is a popular choice for parents.  Children attend it from the catchment area which is not perceived to be the school's catchment area.  However, the Minister will not provide for an extension to the school. I do not know how the Minister can encourage parental choice if she does not provide proper accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the functions of the education board as regards the planning and co-ordination of education.  Section 9(2)(a)(i) states: &ldquo;the provision of primary and post-primary education in its region, including in so far as is practicable, education through Irish&rdquo;.  That must be amended to read: &ldquo;including education through Irish&rdquo;.  There are at least six members of Donegal vocational education committee who represent the Gaeltacht, including the parents' representative.  Many of the TDs and councillors have a great interest in the Irish language.  We promote Irish and make an effort to ensure that people obtain a proper education through the language.  There are two small schools in Ballinamore and Aranmore island which have blossomed and made a wonderful contribution to the promotion of teaching through Irish.  It took a lot to convince those on the other side of the House that we should have these schools.</P>
    <P>It is raiméis for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to tell the House that he will solve everything by establishing a sub-committee. That is an insult to the people of the Gaeltacht. If regional education boards are not going to be introduced then we have to look at the concerns of na scoileanna lán Gaeleacha agus faoi fadhbanna Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Section 17 relates to membership of a local authority.  I do not know who wrote this section but it should be deleted.  I cannot see why a person employed by a regional education board should not be allowed to be a member of a local authority.  Councillors do not make much money. However, this Bill stipulates that people will have to obtain special leave before they can become a member of a local authority.  No one will leave a permanent job in a regional education board to become a councillor.  We should not prevent anyone from being a member of a local authority.  A similar stipulation was removed from a recent local government Act and certain people who work for county councils can now put their names forward for local government.</P>
    <P>Section 18 refers to the transfer to staff.  There is much talk of consultation with staff.  However, I see little evidence of this.  Section 12 of the Regional Technical Colleges Act should be incorporated into this Bill.  It is unfair to staff who work in other institutions who are not consulted. This is a dictatorial element and I hope the Minister will consider introducing an amendment with regard to the transfer of staff.  This is important because these people have made a contribution <Col N="1356" /> to the running of educational establishments, for which they deserve recognition.</P>
    <P>Section 37(5) relates to annual school funding by vocational education committees.  Members of vocational education committees and those who teach in the vocational sector are disappointed and disillusioned because they believe they will be thrown on the scrap heap.  I understand why they feel this way.  The Minister said that, due to school accommodation needs, she would amalgamate towns and counties.  However, everything else is in limbo.  The only way for the Minister to remove vocational education committees is to starve them of all power.  That will be achieved through this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the education boards will now provide support services to schools.  If this is so there is no need for vocational education committees.  Similarly, if there is no flexibility allowed in the administration of school funds there is no need for vocational education committees. We have always been able to assess the needs of our sector yet there is no mention of this.  Section 5 will simply say &ldquo;there is your money, away you go&rdquo;.  There is no flexibility and we will be given no say in the running of our schools.  That is an insult.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that it will be the function of the board of management to appoint a principal. I do not know why this is included.  Section 48(9) states: &ldquo;This section will not apply to teachers or other staff of a school which is established and maintained by a vocational education committee&rdquo;.  Why is this introduced with regard to teachers and not principals?  The Minister is on a suicide mission if she differentiates between the methods of appointing a principal and teachers. This is an insult to those who will be either principals or teachers.  I hope this is a mistake but, if it is not, why has it been introduced?</P>
    <P>The inspectorate should be on a statutory basis. However, we do not have enough cigirí and their functions have not been properly defined.  One set of inspectors will be answerable to a regional education board, the other to the Minister.  This is a mish-mash which will get us nowhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that inspectors will be involved in the psychological assessment of children. With all due respect to inspectors, this will be ineffective unless the Minister appoints educational psychologists as cigirí.  There is one educational psychologists between three counties, including Donegal, in my area.  If a statutory inspectorate is to be introduced, there will have to be enough of them for every subject at primary and secondary level and they will have to support teachers rather than being dictatorial.  A number of other issues not covered by this legislation must be looked at.  The Bill will have to be amended, as was the Universities Bill.</P>
    <P>If good legislation is to be introduced, there should at least be a solid basis for Second Stage. This is not a good basis for the education of young people.  When people read this legislation they will see there is nothing in it except more <Col N="1357" /> bureaucracy.  We do not know how much this will cost.  The Minister is rushing legislation through so that during the general election she can say the Labour Party introduced education legislation and the other parties did not.  The Minister should reconsider and go back to the drawing board with this legislation.</P>

      <P>Resources are targeted towards the disadvantaged and, as well as no fees, there are grants for students studying abroad.  That should be acknowledged.</P>
      <P>This Bill charts the future for education and there are very important provisions in it.  The issue of boards of management is one.  That concept was first introduced by a Fine Gael-Labour Government from 1982 to 1987.  We would all like to establish schools from a &ldquo;green field&rdquo; basis as we could then lay down the rules for every school to have a board of management.  However, there are 4,000 schools around the country, many of which have different backgrounds.  There are 3,200 primary schools that are either Catholic, non-Catholic or non-denominational.  There are secondary schools that are vocational, community colleges, voluntary secondary and community schools.  There is a tremendous diversity of ethos, background and tradition in these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this were a green field site, the Bill would be easy to implement.  However, in forcing boards of management on schools we will have to tread warily, bearing in mind what has happened in the <Col N="1358" /> past.  About 25 schools are privately owned, in each case by an individual.  The Ceann Comhairle will be aware of a very fine one in Borrisoleigh operated by a very fine gentleman, Pádraig O'Shea.  He bought this school when there were about 100 pupils and has, over 20 years, built it up until there are now 600 pupils there.  Parents are voting with their feet and the school cannot expand fast enough for the numbers that wish to attend it.  That individual owns the school.  Grant aid and teachers' salaries are paid by the Department but the management of the school is vested in this person.  Bank overdrafts and loans are dealt with by one individual and guaranteed by him.  Can this Government now impose a board of management on this school?  I would question our ability to do so as it may be unconstitutional. It will probably lead to a constitutional challenge and a Supreme Court hearing in which that school and others like it may succeed.  The Minister might respond to that matter by quoting from the legal advice she has received on it.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the voluntary secondary schools which are also privately owned.  What is the legal advice regarding them?  Have the consequences of imposing a board of management on these schools been considered?  I live in the shadow of one, St. Finian's, Mullingar.  What would be the consequences of imposing a board of management on that school?  Could it operate in the same manner as a day school down the road?  Can they divorce their boarding school activities from their normal school activities and, if so, would the board of management be applicable to the normal school activities or the school's total commitment?  I am unsure of what the arrangements would be and am interested in the Minister's reply.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the two-tier system of boards of management proposed in the Bill.  There is a board of management that will apply to the voluntary secondary schools but there is a second level of board of management for vocational schools, which will not have the power to appoint staff.  Again, if we were starting from a green field position, it would be easy but starting from the present position it may not be so.</P>
    <P>There is a penalty clause built into this Bill where any school that does not comply with a board of management can be penalised.  Examining that, one sees that some schools can be penalised and will not get increases and grants but some schools cannot be penalised.  If a vocational school does not appoint a board of management, one cannot penalise it because it is funded through the vocational education committee, which is on a county structure.  Similarly, non-Catholic voluntary secondary schools cannot be penalised individually for not appointing a board of management because they receive a block grant which is then passed on to schools, which means they do not receive direct payment.  We will be left with a system that penalises voluntary Catholic secondary schools.  The Minister should <Col N="1359" /> respond clearly as this is worrying and not something the Minister or I would wish.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its total disregard</P>
      <P>&mdash; for the welfare of rural communities, and,</P>
      <P>&mdash; for the principle of equity for all our citizens</P>
      <P>in their handling of the water charges issue, and calls on the Government to take immediate action to assuage the deep resentment felt throughout the country.</P>
      <P>On 19 December the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, unveiled what he billed as a brave new departure in local government. This initiative came after a long process of study by a review group.  The Minister assured us that what he was unveiling was the cumulation of a long process of deliberation and study.</P>
      <P>On that day he announced that local government was to be financed through motor taxation. The Minister's announcement stated: &ldquo;charges for domestic water supply and sewerage facilities are either flat charges or related to broad valuation bands but never to usage.  Therefore, charges for domestic water supply and sewerage facilities will be abolished with effect from 1 January 1997&rdquo;.  The Minister's claim that his plans were comprehensive and the product of study &mdash; reiterated in his amendment to the motion &mdash; is a nonsense.  It is self-evident the plans were not comprehensive or the product of any great study or consultation and, further, were intrinsically anti-rural and inequitable.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with the Minister's claim that his proposals were the product of study.  The Minister initiated a study on the subject of local government finances which was carried out by KPMG and published last year.  It contained a list of 26 possible options for local government finance, not one of which referred to towing local government behind the family car.  The creative process behind the Minister's proposal to hitch local government to motor tax was entirely his own. He ignored every single option outlined in the KPMG report.  The political reality in relation to the study by the Minister and the reform of local government is that he has set up a plethora of groups to compile a conundrum of reports, each of which he has ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of study, under this Minister, has been to delay.  By announcing the setting up of report groups and their subsequent completion the Minister has cynically sought to confuse the <Col N="1360" /> contemplative with the active.  Nothing happened until 19 December.  The announcement on 19 December owed nothing to what had gone before.  This particular paper trail was an end in itself.  That announcement was a knee jerk reaction by the Minister to the increasingly acute electoral pressures on the Labour Party in Dublin. The result has been the creation of a serious inequity on householders in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>By throwing out the principle of equity the Minister has brought the political process into disrepute.  He has deepened an existing sense of disillusionment with the political system and his unseemingly squirming in the interim has been as unedifying as it has been ineffective.</P>
    <P>Faced with the political crisis of his own making, the Minister tried to square the circle on 21 January.  He succeeded only in exacerbating the situation even more.  He had already deeply angered rural dwellers by leaving them out completely. He twisted the knife by playing favourites among those who had been spurned.  In announcing that local authorities would take over private group water schemes he presumed that was what these groups wanted but, often, it is not what they want.  It completely overlooks the equally pressing case of those who, through their own initiative and frequently through their own money, had private wells or group water schemes on private sources.  The announcement on 21 January, far from squaring the circle, inflamed the situation further.</P>
    <P>We have come full circle in relation to the Minister's handling of local government reform. Careful reading of his amendment gives an indication of his <i>modus operandi</i>.  The Minister's amendment after a gem-like reference to a new buoyant funding system ends with a commitment to &ldquo;undertake a full examination of a range of issues arising in relation to group water supplies within the framework of a planned approach to the organisation and management of water supplies in rural areas and to report to the Government thereon&rdquo;.  The Minister is back to where he started, with a study.  I have observed this Minister at close quarters for the past two and a half years and for two years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's objective is to manage the message rather than address the issues. What the Minister was about on 19 December and later on 21 January was not addressing the serious issue of local authority funding but getting the message right for the Labour Party.  Saving the political skins of the endangered eight was the prompting behind an opportunistic and disastrous attempt at a political stroke.  In the process the Minister betrayed an instinctively anti-rural bias in the sympathies of his party.  The leader of Democratic Left was happy to avail of the opportunity to launch another broadside against rural communities. Where was the Fine Gael Party when this was going on?  Was it asleep at the Cabinet table in December when the Minister put his plan through? Was it asleep at the Cabinet table in January when the Minister arrived with another plan?</P>
      <P>It is well known that rural Fine Gael Deputies had strongly warned its Ministers of the acute political danger posed by Minister Howlin's plans.  When the issue boiled over there was a belated attempt by Fine Gael to define a separate identity for itself on this.  Faced with a threat to Government unity the Taoiseach scuppered that quickly and a junior press officer was hung out to dry &mdash; I understand he was an assistant press officer up to that time &mdash; and Fine Gael's rural Deputies were told to cool it.  It is apparent that Fine Gael is in power but not in office and that office is more important than equity for its constituents. Equity and fairness are at the core of this issue.  I have set out the options that are open to the Minister to remove the inequity he has created by his announcements on 19 December and 21 January, as follows: direct subventions to householders; direct subventions to appropriate group water schemes; local authorities or the Department taking charge of schemes opting for that particular approach;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the provision of a formal scheme between the Department, local authorities and group water schemes which will ensure that those groups that wish to remain independent can do so without suffering any penalties and inequities, and will be facilitated in their function of providing and maintaining a potable water supply to their communities.</P>
      <P>The first and second options could be used in the short-term to remove the inequity created by the Minister.  It seems, however, that the Minister will not take those options.  He will delay this with a further report.  Whatever political manoeuvring the Minister does to try to save face on this matter, the trustees of group water schemes cannot wait forever for him to make a decision on some form of subvention in the immediate future to allow a proper system to be worked out.  I see that the Minister is shaking his head, but when these schemes start closing down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will let that be on their heads.  Options three and four that I outlined are, of necessity, long-term and would require full consultation with the group schemes concerned before any details of the scheme could be finalised.  The Minister should initiate discussions with the federation of group water schemes as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Water quality is accepted as a key issue on all sides.  The recently published Environmental Protection Agency report highlighted the higher incidence of quality problems in smaller schemes. A holistic response to this issue must include training for operators and professional assistance where necessary.  The way out of this morass is not to go further down the blind alley the Minister has stumbled into, nor is it to revert to form and attempt to manage the matter with yet another study and a report.  The solution is to approach this issue from the viewpoint of equity and fairness.  I am asking the Minister to do so.</P>

      <P>The motion is in the names of our spokesperson on the environment, Deputy Dempsey, myself as chairman of the party, and the party's Chief Whip, Deputy Dermot Ahern. That indicates the seriousness with which our party views the decision of the Minister and the Government.  An anti-rural bias was shown when 150,000 houses were excluded from the Minister's original decision to abolish water charges.  Was this decision thought out?  It is extraordinary that it was announced about a week after 88 local authorities had prepared their estimates for 1997. I would have thought that any Minister who was going to reform local government would first consult with local authorities.  Instead of that, councillors debated their estimates and then found that one of their sources of funding was to be taken away and replaced by a different source, motor tax.</P>
      <P>Was there agreement between the three parties in Government, Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left?  The Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, is here.  His colleague, Deputy Ring, made clear to us what some members of Fine Gael think about the matter.  The Taoiseach stated in Galway that Fine Gael had no policy of its own, it was only a Government policy.</P>

      <P>That is all right, but does Labour reciprocate?  I would be concerned if I were Deputy Higgins.  I have a three page letter here from a Labour Member of the Oireachtas.  I will read it as far as the second paragraph.  The letter was circulated widely and was the subject of a full-scale debate at Monaghan County Council yesterday.  The letter states:</P>
      <P>I always place the concerns of rural people to the forefront of my political work.  To that end I have succeeded in getting vast increases in funding for county roads, keeping rural post offices open and getting small schools refurbished, all of which was achieved with the help of Labour Party Ministers.</P>

      <P>More importantly, there was no question of priority need, merely an Oireachtas Member going along and getting all these things done.  There was no question of whether they were needed or whether there was priority.  I wonder what An Post thinks of a Labour Member of the Oireachtas keeping post offices open in <Col N="1364" /> rural Ireland?  I wonder what the Minister for Education has to say?  She came into the House and told us that her decisions were made on the basis of priority and not on the basis of representations from anyone on any side of the House, yet a Member of the Oireachtas tells us that these decisions are made on a totally different basis.  I accept that not everyone in this House believes what is written in this letter, but it was the subject of a major debate at Monaghan County Council yesterday.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for the Environment found himself in a hole he tried to correct the decision he made, but the way the Minister approached the decision was badly thought out.  He dug himself into a bigger hole by deciding that water supplied by the local authority to group water schemes would be free of charge, but private group water schemes would still have to pay.  He stated that he would provide £15 million in the current year.  I tabled a parliamentary question but the Minister could not answer what that £15 million would be used for or how it would be divided between the local authorities.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if the Minister is aware but some of his Fine Gael colleagues in Government should be, that £15 million would not go very far. There are two counties in my constituency and I am informed that £15 million would not cater for the needs of either one, let alone the whole constituency.</P>

Group water schemes made a tremendous difference to rural Ireland in terms of economic and social development.

      <P>On the question of local government reform, it is not good enough to tell local authorities that their funding will come from motor taxation.  Apart from the Government, no one believes that motor taxation should be used to pay for local charges.  However, this is the only measure announced by the Minister in terms of the exact amount of funding which will be made available to local authorities this year.</P>
      <P>This proposal is badly thought out as the Minister does not know the amount local authorities will be allowed to collect by way of motor taxation in the coming years.  In reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Dempsey last week the Minister said the amount would be 6 per cent over two years and that this was explicit.  He went on to say no increase would be allowable and that this was agreed unless the base rate for tax was increased by the Government.  I ask the Minister to compare this with the statement in his press release on 19 December that during 1999 and subsequent years local authorities would have discretion to vary the national rate by not more than 6 per cent.  Which statement is correct?  Will local authorities have discretion to vary the rate by not more than 6 per cent during 1999 and subsequent years or will the rate be 6 per cent over two years with no discretion to vary the rate during subsequent years?</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to meet the federation. Deputy Dempsey, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, adopted a rational and reasonable approach in his letter to the federation.  He said there would be equity in the provision of a water system, an allocation would be made for the running of the schemes and he would discuss the matter with local authorities and the representatives of group water schemes to ensure the provision of a top quality water supply.  I wish to share my time with Deputies Hughes and Killeen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me so that I can contribute to the debate on this very important issue.  Unlike the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, the Minister may not be aware that many years ago community groups in County Mayo set up group water schemes because there was little prospect of the introduction of a regional water scheme. The 350 group schemes in the county are very successful and provide a service to the public at no cost to the taxpayer.  The package of measures announced by the Minister will, unfortunately, interfere with these schemes.</P>
      <P>Many of the schemes introduced ten to 15 years ago need to be renewed and upgraded, while their running costs are increasing on an annual basis.  As a result, group scheme trustees have had to impose increased charges on their members who are satisfied to pay them because they are competitive and, in many cases, lower than the rates laid down by Mayo County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> The package of measures introduced by the Minister benefits the majority of the public but it gives the impression that water is free.  However, it is important to point out that water is not free. Those of us who have served on county councils know that the costs of providing a water supply and maintaining sophisticated water treatment plants are escalating.  The charges which have been abolished accounted for only a fraction of the costs incurred by county councils in providing a water supply.  County councils were happy to carry the additional costs and they used the rate support grant and other sources of revenue to cover these.  However, the Minister has abolished water charges and the rate support grant and introduced an equalisation fund.  This means most rural counties are dependent on the whims of the Minister for the Environment of the day to distribute the equalisation fund in a fair and equitable fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion in the names of Deputies Dempsey, O'Hanlon and Dermot Ahern.  In fairness to the Government, it is not attempting to hide the fact that this is a political <Col N="1368" /> decision.  It has effectively admitted that and that it is an attempt to buy votes in urban areas in the run up to the general election.</P>
      <P>I can imagine the attacks which would be made on a Fianna Fáil Minister who made a similar decision.  However, I do not visualise such a Minister being so foolish as to make a decision which is clearly so inequitable and deals such an unfair hand to a huge proportion of the community.  I can imagine the kind of attack he would come under from the Labour, Fine Gael and Democratic Left parties.  A question I would like answered is: did the Government not realise there was inequity in what was being decided?  It would have been impossible for it not to realise there was grave inequity.  Did the Government care?  If some people in Government cared, there is no evidence at this stage that they did anything about that.  The 1977 decision to remove domestic rates has been much maligned but it must be said that it was equitable.  Regardless of whether a house was in the centre of Dublin, another city or rural Ireland, rates were removed from it.</P>
      <P>The decision in relation to water charges applies only to those households who get their supply from local authorities.  That clearly undermines those who have put a great deal of work into getting a supply for themselves.  The Government's decision makes a mockery of the decision to set up a ministry for western development and rural renewal.  That was an afterthought &mdash; another position was intended for the Minister of State in question.  When one sees the type of decisions the Government has made, and this is perhaps the most striking one, it is clear that it does not have any commitment, beyond the PR exercise of creating a ministry, to the people of rural Ireland or to western development.</P>
      <P>The Government's amendment refers to a new, buoyant funding system for local authorities which nobody seems to know anything about and on which the Minister is slow to give details.  It also refers to consolidating these charges into general taxation which, as anybody who has taken the trouble to study the pattern of taxation in Ireland will know, is the exact opposite to what is recommended in any report on taxation.  Nevertheless, that is the route the Government has chosen to follow.  It believes the political advantage it thought would accrue from this decision was good reason for going down that route and it is now facing a difficult situation.</P>
      <P>Where in this new buoyant system for local authorities is the alternative funding?  We are all aware motor taxation already existed and in the previous archaic system it was transferred directly to the Department of the Environment and subsequently redistributed to local authorities under various headings, mainly in road grants.</P>
    </Speaker>

It is expected now to be sufficiently topped up to make up for the shortfall that arises from the removal of these charges.  Since the Minister is not in a position to tell us that amount, it is difficult for those on this side of the House to know the additional charge that will be put on motor tax to make up the shortfall.</P>

      <P>If the information was available to the Minister, he could have made it available but he did not.  The Minister does not know what he is doing.  If the shortfall is to be made up from motor tax, we will have some difficulty in taxing our cars in the future.  This is a mess which has been created by Government.  It is up to the Minister to address it.  Regardless of the smart alecky answers the Minister throws across the House, the responsibility is his.  He is doing very badly in this instance.  Deputy Dempsey referred to other instances where he did badly but on this issue in particular there is a problem which must be addressed.  I offer the Minister some suggestions, one of which is that any group water scheme wanting to be taken over should be taken over immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Another is those that do not want to be taken over, and there are good reasons some do not, should get a grant per domestic member.  The inequity that exists for those with private supplies must be addressed and I am interested to know how the Minister proposes to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know the implications for local authorities of the Minister's smart decision that they will take over group water schemes that need to be taken over.  Many of these schemes are already in difficulty.  They need a great deal of repair.  The county councils and local authorities will have to find the money to <Col N="1370" /> pay for these schemes when they are taken over. They will have a number of options in that regard.  They can substantially increase their charge to commercial customers, who already pay rates, and to farmers.  They can transfer the funding from roads, some of the other funds or the famous equalisation fund the Minister is proposing, but local authorities will have more responsibility and less money.  That is the difficulty the Minister has placed them in and out of which he should take them.  He may take the view that neither he nor anybody else in his party will be a Minister after the election&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have better prospects than the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and somebody else will have to clear up the mess.  That happened before, notably in 1987 and on previous occasions, but the Minister has created this problem and he is not attempting to address it.</P>
      <P>There are people who want to form new group water schemes and there are many who do not currently have a supply.  They are clearly in a serious situation and they are wondering where the funding will come from for their schemes. They are also wondering why they should bother setting up schemes.  The Minister clearly does not place any value on the voluntary effort that went into setting up these schemes down through the years.</P>
      <P>When leaks emanated from Government that this decision might be made, I attempted to raise it by way of parliamentary question, which in fairness was premature and ruled out of order because it was a hypothetical question.  I sought to draw attention to the difficulties which would arise, and which have now arisen.  I am astounded that the Minister or somebody else in Government could not have foreseen those difficulties. In a feeble attempt to answer one of my questions subsequently, the Minister said that he might be prepared to allow the PAYE allowance continue for members of group water schemes.  He either did not realise or did not care that relatively few members of group water schemes would benefit from that.  He certainly did not realise the difficulties he had created for those in group water schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there are 233 individual group water schemes in County Clare, one of which is the largest in Ireland.  It is a particularly well run scheme but it is unlikely to apply to be taken over by the county council.  In that event, the people who are members of that group water scheme will face the difficulty of collecting money while their neighbours in every direction are getting free water.  I was an officer of a group water scheme for a long time and I know the difficulty in collecting money.  I know the work that went into that and the hours worked by the people who run group water schemes.  They make an enormous effort on behalf of their local communities and they do not need me to tell them that the Minister <Col N="1371" /> does not have any regard for their work or their communities.</P>
    <P>The issues of equity and fair play are fundamental but there are also practical issues such as the way the schemes operate, how they can be funded and how to tell somebody they must pay for their group water scheme even though other people do not do so.  Despite his unwillingness to meet its members, the Minister is undoubtedly aware of the setting up of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people in Government might be shocked by the speed at which rural people were prepared to organise and put forward their views.  I welcome the fact that they were not prepared to be shot down by the Government.  Their argument, which they made clearly, is that rural communities rely on cars much more than urban communities.  They will be faced with double taxation while people who have free water in other local authority areas will pay the same level of motor tax.  Effectively the people in rural areas will be subventing them. They are deeply concerned that their schemes will fall into chaos if their members refuse to pay, and there are strong indications that there are individuals around the country who will refuse to pay.  Group water schemes already in debt to the banks are in the process of collecting their finance for this year in the hope of dealing with that.</P>
      <P>The Government has clearly been caught offside in a political decision it thought was good news for it.  However, it is not too late for it to address the problems.  We on this side of the House have outlined what needs to be done, and I look forward to the Minister addressing those points with a good deal more honesty than I have seen heretofore.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No 1:</P>
      <P>To delete the words after Dáil Éireann and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the comprehensive proposals of the Minister for the Environment for the reform of local government contained in the document <i>Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change</i>, which will provide local authorities with a new buoyant funding system and consolidate local authority domestic water and sewerage charges into general taxation, and also welcomes the commitment by the Minister to undertake a full examination of a range of issues arising in relation to group water supplies, within the framework of a planned approach to the organisation and management of water supplies in rural areas, and to report to the Government thereon.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> On 19 December last, with Government approval, I launched a new programme for the development of local government entitled Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change. The programme is the single most important local government reform measure in many years, and the issues which Deputies opposite are seeking to raise by this motion cannot be viewed in isolation from this radical and comprehensive programme. That is why my amendment seeks to broaden the debate and place it in its proper context.</P>
    <P>The reform programme is an ambitious one which sets out to build a new local government, sharper, more independent and more powerful. It is not a discussion paper nor is it a series of recommendations.  It is a programme of decisions. After a quarter of a century of discussion about local government reform, what is now being put in train is a comprehensive programme of specific actions.  The programme is based on four core principles: enhancing local democracy and widening participation; serving the customer better; developing efficiency in local government; and providing a proper funding system for local government.</P>
    <P>Over the past few weeks, I have attended a number of regional seminars on the new programme to present and discuss it with local authority members and officials.  I have now provided that opportunity for every county in Ireland.  I have been heartened by the response across all political parties, and I am determined to press ahead with its implementation with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>An important measure in the reform programme is the enhancement of local democracy. Democracy demands more than simply holding elections every few years.  It is about choice and empowering people to govern themselves.  The democratic process in Irish local government has its roots in the earlier part of this century but local government, through no fault of its own, has not developed with the times.</P>
    <P>The reform programme now sets out to modernise all aspects of local government through a range of measures.  It will do this in four different ways: by recognising the legitimacy of local government as a democratic institution through constitutional recognition and by the ratification of the European Charter of Local Self Government, bringing Irish local government into line with European norms; by strengthening the corporate position of councillors within local government through the establishment of strategic policy committees which will enhance their political and community leadership role, and by redressing the imbalance that currently exists between management and the elected member; by broadening involvement in local government, through the participation of community, consumer and other interest groups and local development bodies currently at work in every community in Ireland; and by widening the remit of local government through forging new relationships with local <Col N="1373" /> development agencies and with the wider public service.</P>
    <P>The Government and the public &mdash; the people who elect us &mdash; demand and expect high standards of service and efficiency from local government. All are now agreed that local government services must be delivered in a way that keeps its customers happy.  Huge strides have been taken in recent years towards this objective.  Local government is now more efficient and more consumer and citizen oriented.  As I acknowledged at the regional seminars, local government, councillors, management and staff work exceptionally hard and have a commendable public service ethos and a commitment to the betterment of the communities they serve.  However, we need to go further.  The new programme is designed to build on what has already been achieved to ensure that citizens, the local government customers, are guaranteed efficient and user friendly services in all cases and in all areas.</P>
    <P>Action is under way on a wide range of measures designed to improve the quality of the service which is already being provided.  Legislation is in preparation and implementation groups are already at work dealing with particular aspects, for example, local authority linkage systems, linkage with the Garda Síochána and the introduction of the strategic policy committees. However, all these programme proposals will come to nought unless we are prepared to include in the reform programme measures that will, once and for all, restore local authorities to a sound financial footing and give them some assurance that the financial resources necessary to carry through their programmes will be made available to them.</P>
    <P>To do this, the long-term decline in the financial independence of local authorities, presided over by a succession of Environment Ministers, needs to be reversed, and the basic drawbacks of the existing local finance system tackled.  For a start, the local authority funding base was too narrow and there was little buoyancy.  This problem was compounded by the fact that the authorities have been continuously conferred with new functions, with no allowance being made for the additional pressure such functions place on their finances.  Furthermore, the authorities were at the mercy of central government to the extent that they never knew for certain how much rate support grant they would receive from year to year and, in addition, the grant did not always keep pace with inflation.  As a result of these problems, the authorities built up substantial revenue account deficits and were unable to respond to the legitimate demands of their customers.</P>
    <P>The policy agreement between the three parties in Government.  A Government of Renewal, gave a commitment to commission a professional study on local government funding to see how we could introduce &ldquo;a fair, equitable and reasonable system of funding&rdquo;.  I engaged KPMG Management Consultants to carry out this study, the focus of which was to set the agenda for change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> A range of possible funding options was examined, each of which involved advantages and certain disadvantages.  The underlying conclusion was that there is no one right way to fund local government &mdash; it is a matter of weighing up the pros and cons of a number of options in order to decide which is the most suitable having regard to existing and future requirements.</P>
    <P>From the start, I accepted that a solution to the problem of local authority funding was a <i>sine qua non</i> of any meaningful attempt to reform local government.  Regardless of the difficulties, we cannot stand still and allow the existing system to limp along, perhaps with just some small changes at the margins.  To do so would leave the system without direction, without a future and could, ultimately, seriously threaten the very existence of local government.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I was very pleased that the Government agreed to my proposals for a fundamental restructuring of the system of funding local authorities in the context of this comprehensive reform package.  The new, stronger, more independent, financial base for local authorities is essential if the other initiatives contained in the reform programme are to become a reality.  Hoving spoken at regional seminars in every corner of this land, I know there is a palpable yearning among local authority members of every political persuasion for local government reform.  They support this package, not every dot and comma, but the general thrust of it.  If for whatever political motives because this is election year we, or the Deputies opposite, do fatal damage to this set of proposals in the weeks and months ahead we will be doing a great disservice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy had his chance and he did the damage.  He is willing to sign blank cheques now, even if Deputy Harney does not allow it.  There is a genuine opportunity to build political consensus well in advance of publishing the document.  Most political parties have been in Government in the past five years, and in the next ten years some combination of those parties should allow local government to thrive, real <Col N="1375" /> powers to be devolved and a proper funding base to be put in place.  The proposals the Government has accepted go a long way towards achieving those objectives.</P>
      <P>Service charges was a contentious issue for many years and had to be dealt with head-on in any proposals for local authority funding.  It is an accepted principle of charging for services that the amount you pay should depend on the amount of service you use.  Can one imagine the ESB imposing a standard charge for every user of electricity?  Would it be acceptable for the ESB to charge every householder the same amount regardless of how much electricity they used?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the case with charges for domestic water and sewerage services which were either flat rate charges or related to broad valuation bands.  The Government took the view that because those charges are not related to usage they are, in effect, taxes and should, accordingly, be consolidated into general taxation. As a result, under the new arrangements, domestic water and sewerage charges will no longer be levied with effect from 1 January 1997. Charges will remain for commercial water and sewerage services where the volumes consumed are larger and where users can generally be charged according to the amount of service they use.  Refuse charges will also remain as they can be readily related to usage.  A number of local authorities already operate a tag system under which a charge per bag is levied.</P>
      <P>The most important feature of the new funding arrangements is the fact that we are giving to local authorities full ownership of the entire proceeds of one single tax, namely motor tax.  This money will be ring-fenced by legislation that I will bring before the House in this session and guaranteed as future income to local authorities. I emphasise that this does not involve new taxation. Instead, rather than being paid into the Exchequer, motor tax income will be available to fund local authorities which have collected the tax on behalf of the Exchequer for many years.</P>
      <P>Why motor tax, one might ask?  First, this is an extremely buoyant source of income &mdash; the KPMG strategy identified lack of buoyancy as one of the main weaknesses of the existing system.</P>

      <P>Second, it is local authorities which provide vehicle owners with the essential road and traffic services.  Third, it meets the criterion of simplicity while allowing for a degree of local discretion.  Income from motor tax will significantly exceed the combined income from rate support grant and domestic water and sewerage <Col N="1376" /> charges &mdash; that point has escaped many commentators. Already, it is expected that 1997 car sales will increase above the record 1996 level by a substantial margin.  That is good news for local authorities.  It means they will share in the current economic boom and in the benefits at community level in terms of improved services.</P>
      <P>It is also important that the authorities should have a measure of discretion over their local funding system.  Under the new system, while the basic rates of tax will continue to be set nationally, local authorities will be able to vary the rates of motor tax on motor cars and motor cycles by up to 6 per cent, subject to a maximum of 3 per cent in 1998, the first year the local variation will apply.  There will be no change in motor tax rates in the interim.  I will explain this matter because Deputies may have misconstrued it.  I have built in a buoyancy to a maximum of 6 per cent local discretion.  In other words, it will be open to local authorities to vary the base rate by 6 per cent, 3 per cent next year and 3 per cent the year after.  Thereafter, unless the base rate is changed by central Government, there will be no further discretion available at local authority level.  It will be up to the Government to see how buoyant the system is and, if there is need for greater flexibility, to increase the base rate.  It is a good clear system, but if any local authority does not wish to take advantage of the variation of 3 per cent next year and 3 per cent the year after it may decide not to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people understand it, but there are none so blind as those who will not see. To facilitate the fact that not every local authority will generate the same amount of motor tax, I am establishing an equalisation fund into which will be paid 20 per cent of the proceeds of motor tax on motor cars and motor cycles and the full proceeds of all other motor tax revenues, including driver licence duties.  This fund will be used in the first instance to make good all income lost through the abolition of domestic water and sewerage charges and the rate support grant.  The balance will be allocated as equitably as possible among local authorities, having regard to their needs and resources.  All local authorities will benefit from this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite earlier attempts by me to clarify the matter, some people, for their own purposes, still suggest that motor tax is being increased across the board to pay for the abolition of water charges.  This is totally wrong.  The new arrangement involves no new tax.  Rather, it involves a reassignment of the proceeds of an existing tax, at existing rates. Nobody will pay more money.  This is more than sufficient to allow the rate support grant to be discontinued and local authority charges for domestic water and sewerage services to be consolidated into general taxation.  Any increase in the rate of motor tax within the 6 per cent limit which a local authority, at its discretion, may decide on will be for the sole purpose of raising additional finance to improve or extend local services.  It is a plan for buoyancy in the future.  No local authority will need to raise the rate of motor tax to <Col N="1378" /> make up for the loss of water charges.  That loss will be made up without a penny extra being paid in taxes.  Is that clear?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Pending enactment of the legislation, interim funding arrangements are in place whereby the rate support grant is being paid to the authorities for the first five months of this year.</P>
      <P>I am confident the financial proposals contained in &ldquo;Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change&rdquo; will facilitate the long-term development of local government into the new millennium.  At long last, a new financing system for local government is being introduced which will contain real buoyancy and an element of local discretion.  If we want effective local government, we must provide it with the resources it needs to do its business and this is exactly what I have set out to achieve.  Let us not engage in political point scoring on this.  If we do, the ultimate loser will be local government.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements, no household, urban or rural, connected directly or indirectly to a public water supply will have to pay for a domestic water supply.  I dispel the myth that only urban households will benefit from these arrangements and that they will do so at the expense of rural households.  According to the 1991 census returns, some 235,000 rural households, or 55 per cent of total rural households, are supplied directly or indirectly from a local authority public water supply.  The majority of rural dwellers will benefit from the abolition of water charges.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy the figures for group water schemes.  All of these, including the 85,000 rural households served by group water schemes supplied from a public main, will benefit directly from the abolition of water charges.  A total of 55 per cent of rural dwellers are better off as a result of my announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 40 per cent of all farm dwellings are connected, directly or indirectly, to a public water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the outset, I acknowledged that the position of households served by group water schemes needed special consideration in the light of the decision to abolish domestic water charges. I was particularly concerned about the 55,000 households served by group water schemes which have private supplies.  Some of these frequently <Col N="1379" /> experience problems with the quality of supply and because of the condition and efficiency of the headworks and distribution systems.  Difficulty arises for the operators and members of these schemes in dealing effectively with these deficiencies.  These difficulties were not addressed by Ministers in the past.</P>
    <P>It must be a cause of major concern that the quality of water in many of these schemes is not up to standard.  The recent Environmental Protection Agency report on drinking water quality indicates that 43 per cent of private group supplies suffer some degree of coliform contamination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Sixty-two per cent of public schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This has arisen largely as a result of the lack of investment in water filtration and disinfection facilities.  Many of these schemes were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s when cost effective and straightforward water treatment technology was not widely available.</P>
      <P>Many group schemes are currently under resourced and unable to respond to the challenging task of supplying water in compliance with the standards for drinking water.  Having regard to the increased vulnerability of private sources to organic pollution, it is essential that greater resources should be provided to enable these schemes to connect to a good quality public supply or, where this is not feasible, to put in place proper water treatment facilities.</P>
      <P>Last January, for the first time, I announced a new multi-annual programme with capital funding of £5 million for 1997 to establish a programme of works with the specific objective of improving water quality in group supplies and enabling local authorities to take over private schemes where members so wish.  This programme of upgrading works would complement the established and successful programme of capital grants for new group schemes and for the extension and upgrading of existing ones.  When I became Minister I more than doubled the grant per household, from £700 to £1,600, to those who wanted to provide water through a group scheme. I more than tripled the grant for group sewerage schemes, from £500 to £1,600 per household.  That is an indication of my support for group schemes. I also acknowledged the work of successive organisers of group water schemes.</P>
      <P>I am devolving full responsibility for small public water and sewerage schemes to local authorities. Capital funding in the form of block grants will be made available to them for this purpose in 1997 and future years.  Deputies can discover what else I have done in support of group water schemes if they read my speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week at Question Time, I informed the House that within the framework to which I referred, the question of the running costs of group water schemes and charges to members for <Col N="1380" /> domestic supplies was being considered.  On 20 February, I met representatives of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the Irish Farmer's Association and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association to hear their views on the issue.  I have also received written submissions from trustees and members of private group water schemes, many of whom support the action I have taken.  Local authority managers are being consulted on the detailed arrangements for the transfer of responsibility for the administration of the grants schemes from my Department to the local authorities and on the question of drawing up integrated strategic plans for rural water supplies. This would include the setting up of a comprehensive inventory of group schemes and the development of an intensive monitoring programme for water quality, neither of which is currently in place.</P>
    <P>I am giving careful consideration to the broad range of views presented to me.  I am mindful of the positive and helpful suggestions put forward and will examine the submissions I received with great care.  Rushing out with offers of blank cheques, as the Progressive Democrats has done, will not advance this cause.</P>
    <P>In 1997, the provision of almost a quarter of a billion pounds, comprising £173 million in State grants and more than £68 million in local authority resources to non-national roads, is clear evidence of my commitment to rural Ireland.  I resent Deputy Dempsey's comment that the Government has neglected rural Ireland.  I am prepared to set my record as Minister against that of any of my predecessors.  Between the launch of the restoration programme in mid-1995 and the end of 1996, a period of just 18 months, more than 5,000 road schemes had been completed, with more than 8,000 kilometres, or nearly 10 per cent of the entire network of abandoned regional and county roads, benefiting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The restoration programme is producing the required results in terms of value for money and outputs, and local communities are witnessing the fruits of the increased expenditure by the Government in this area.  Our multi-annual programme is transforming the non-national roads network, and with it a significant aspect of the quality of the lives of those who depend on them.</P>
      <P>I invite Deputies opposite to look into their hearts and compare my record of achievement with their object failure to arrest the decline of the roads on which rural communities depend.  I assure them, and the community generally, that rural water supplies will be dealt with in a planned, integrated way, just as we have done in the case of non-national roads.</P>

      <P>Although the Minister made a comprehensive speech, he did not address the issues put forward by Deputy Dempsey or the concerns of those involved in group water schemes.  Despite his Department's spending, it has not spent money on water schemes or helping private schemes.  Rural Ireland has been forgotten as regards group water schemes.  Water charges were abolished by the Minister but those who spend thousands of pounds maintaining their own water supply each year will not get anything under any proposals made so far.  Certainly the Minister did not think through the proposals he announced in Galway.</P>
      <P>The Government has completely mishandled the water charges issue and deserves the criticism it has received.  I am surprised Fine Gael has done a U-turn on the Government's decision.  In fact, one could say it has done two U-turns if one includes the statement made by its press office and the Taoiseach's office.  When one hears the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, blame farmers for the level of protest, it looks as if the left-wing parties have won out again.  It is not only farmers who are protesting but thousands of people who have been involved in group schemes for many years.  The Taoiseach and his Ministers have turned the water charges issues into a political farce and are stepping in and out like characters at Lanigan's Ball.  It is time the Government got the message and dealt fairly with people in rural areas and ended this discrimination.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in Galway he wanted the local authorities to take over all rural group water schemes with £5 million.  A Deputy from a Government party, my constituency colleague, Deputy Connaughton, said at a public meeting that he would not let the Department or the councils within an ass's roar of the water schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who attended a large meeting in Barnaderg near Tuam on 30 January felt that people in rural areas should not have to pay increased road tax to subsidise free water schemes in cities and large towns.  The Minister's decision has left these schemes, and their trustees and organisers, in a financial and environmental crisis.  The sooner he tells us what he proposes to do, the better. Deputy Dempsey suggested he could address the <Col N="1382" /> inequity by giving a direct subvention to the householder or to the appropriate group water schemes.</P>
    <P>Up to 20 per cent of houses in County Galway are linked to group water schemes and do not benefit from the Minister's decision.  There is no timescale for taking over the schemes and local authorities have been slow to do so in the past. People travelled from as far away as Sligo, Clare and Monaghan to the meeting in Barnaderg near Tuam and were strong in their criticism of this decision.  They said the Minister was talking about a paltry sum.  Only 20 of 600 people at the meeting said they would like local authorities to take over the schemes.  Local authorities are already short of cash and it is difficult to see how they can be responsible for water schemes on the instruction of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Since 1963, 499 grant-aided group water schemes have been completed in County Galway. Indeed, the Minister has approved some schemes since coming into office.  There is now administrative chaos.  The Minister spoke about the devolution process where these schemes would devolve to local authorities from the Department. It is time he spoke about equity, stopped blaming the farmers and adopted a positive attitude to group water schemes.  I am a member of a group water scheme comprising 540 houses.  Members of that scheme have questioned whether they will continue to pay water charges and the increase in road tax.  We have been given a double blow because each time a member of the Government talks about group water schemes, they forget about rural groups.</P>
    <P>The Government has been embarrassed by water charges for some time.  It introduced the delimiting Bill delimiting the powers of local authorities and that caused difficulties for rural schemes.  After the by-election in Dublin last April the Government was scared that a candidate might be elected on this issue but that is no reason for introducing inequitable proposals.  It is time the Government decided to help those helping others, like those involved in credit unions, by providing water for thousands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to say what I would like on this subject. The case for group water schemes has been well made and the inequity as regards those involved in such schemes has been highlighted.  I would like to speak on behalf of another group which is voiceless and, therefore, of no concern to this Government.  I refer to the huge number of people who use private supplies of water, many of whom live in my constituency in the most westerly part of the country.  What will the Minister do for them or will they be forgotten because they are not represented by an organised group? Does equity depend on lobby and power groups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a seething anger among those on private supplies who, coincidentally, live far from urban areas.  My neighbours and I will pay more than £100 extra in petrol taxes to enable those <Col N="1383" /> living in cities to have free water and a free sewerage system, which is unjust.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there is no extra taxation involved.  I do not understand how somebody can wipe out £69 million in charges and not have to raise £69 million elsewhere.  The price of petrol was increased by 9p per gallon in the budget and for rural people living furthest from population centres it is a direct tax on distance.  These people will not benefit from the abolition of water or sewerage charges.  The number of people in my area who do not have to pay for sewage treatment is negligible.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke about roads.  Although this debate is not about that issue some points he made must be addressed.  Connemara is getting less money for roads because the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has pulled the money for the bóithre áise and the Minister for the Environment has done away with our supplementary grant.  We have less money for roads than ever before.  When we have major bridge problems, we must take money from the running cost grants.  If one asks people in Connemara about roads, they will say they have less discretionary money and money for roads than ever before.  For the first time the Department of the Environment gave us a list of roads to be dealt with leaving us with £863,000 from an £8 million discretionary grant for County Galway.  Is this devolution of power?</P>
    <P>The question of small rural businesses must be addressed.  Rural businesses, which are seasonal in nature and have small turnovers because of declining population caused by Government policy, are the only group paying commercial rates and water and sewerage charges.  How will they survive?  The Minister spoke about general taxation and relative usage.  How can he justify that as regards small businesses which have little use for water and sewage treatment and pay charges on a fixed basis?  It is unbelievable that motor taxation and local authority financing are being linked.  When we analyse the position in three to five years time to see in which counties there was an increase of 6 per cent because the councils concerned were starved of funds &mdash; there will be no increase prior to the general election &mdash; we will find it was the counties which offer fewer services. It is like saying that an apple and an orange are the same because they are both round and approximately the same size.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows, the only reason this change was made was political expediency.  It was an advantage that a certain percentage of those living in rural areas benefited.  It was a cynical exercise, at the expense of overburdened and under-funded rural communities, to regain support in Dublin where it was melting away.</P>
    <P>Funding is being made available to upgrade water schemes following which they will be taken over.  Does this mean that schemes which need to be upgraded and cannot be taken over because of their location will be penalised?  Rural communities <Col N="1384" /> want to know if they will find themselves at the bottom of the pile when it comes to State funding and at the top when it comes to the payment of taxes.  It is about time the Minister clarified the matter.</P>

      <P>Last weekend the Minister, Deputy Howlin, visited Donegal where the county council is well organised and has advanced many projects.  Since the abolition of water charges was announced on 19 December with great speed &mdash; the rate at which one would expect a decision to be made in the case of an application for a new fire station in Buncrana or a sewerage scheme in Greencastle or Malin &mdash; there has been much confusion in the county.  The county council raised £3.85 million by way of these charges in 1995 and £4.5 million in 1996. It used imaginative measures in collecting them, including prize draws at county and urban level, for which it must be complimented.  The Minister has, however, pulled the rug from under its feet. Prior to announcing his decision it had agreed the estimates, in which provision had been made for scheme takeovers, and drawn up a five-year plan. So much for careful planning.</P>
      <P>Urban councillors find themselves in a worse position.  They look to the county council to provide funding.  The county council, in turn, looks to the national Parliament to provide a float. About 280 schemes have been taken over but 350 remain while others are being considered.  The group water scheme is a valuable asset to rural communities.</P>
      <P>There is a need for clarification.  Why did the Minister move so fast?  He said that outstanding charges can be collected, but the chances of collecting this money are slim.</P>
      <P>Given that many families in rural communities need two cars because of the special circumstances in which they find themselves, we have a second double taxation issue for a Labour Party Minister to address.  The funding raised by way of motor taxation will not be sufficient to maintain and improve roads, many of which have not been tarred in 20 or 30 years.</P>
      <P>As a public representative, I find it difficult to explain the reasoning behind the announcement to motorists and group scheme participants.  We want to know how the equalisation fund will be distributed.  As Deputy Hughes stated, we do not want to be subsidised from Dublin and as in the case of the education boards proposed by the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, we do not know what the cost will be.  The abolition of water charges was a good idea but nobody thought through the implications.  Rural dwellers have come to expect discrimination and inequity rather than equality.  I would like someone to prove them wrong and to sort out this mess.</P>

Their abolition has been presented under the guise of better local government but <Col N="1385" /> the Minister has failed at the first hurdle because all he has managed to do is to divide urban and rural communities.  The interests of public and private group water scheme participants and in particular those who source their supplies from private wells have not been taken into account.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that this is only the beginning, that there will be further reforms.  If so, it is a poor beginning.  The rate support grant is being done away with and replaced by motor taxation revenue which the Minister said should be sufficient. Every county councillor disputes this. There will be an increase of 3 per cent in 1998 and up to 6 per cent in 1999.  There will be no increase in 1997 because it is an election year. There are many questions to be answered.  The funding raised by way of motor taxation should be used to finance road improvements.  It should not be used to defray water and sewerage charges.</P>
      <P>The Minister said time and again that this change is only one aspect of the package of measures he has in mind.  Approximately £5 million is to be made available to county councils this year but that will not be sufficient to resolve the problems in County Leitrim.  There has been no talk about the maintenance and upgrading of group water schemes.  How will the issue of contamination of supplies be resolved?  The Minister said he intends to broaden the funding base but by removing water charges he has narrowed it. This is not a good first step for advancing local government.</P>

    <Title>Education Bill, 1997: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned, I spoke about the penalties schools could incur by not establishing a board of management. Is it not the case that, if a vocational or Protestant school cannot be penalised, the only schools which can be under this system are Catholic voluntary and private schools?  It would be strange if for the first time in this State there was a law which discriminated against Catholic schools.  Will the Minister explain that?</P>
      <P>The imposition of penalties has a net effect on the education a child receives.  Our Constitution states that all children will be treated equally and are entitled to the same facilities and advantages. If some children are penalised because their masters did not put a board of management in place, is this not unconstitutional?  I would like to hear the Minister's response and the legal advice she has obtained on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the patron seems to be downgraded in the Bill.  There are many references to the education boards consulting with various people but patrons are excluded.  What is the explanation for that?  Surely, it cannot be a conscious attempt to <Col N="1386" /> downgrade the role of the patron?  If a member of staff is to be dismissed, it can be referred to the education board for a ruling.  Surely, within a voluntary secondary school, for example, the role of the patron is to appoint a member of staff and in consultation with the board of management to ratify that appointment.  Why should it be referred to a regional board if that member of staff is to be dismissed?</P>
    <P>Another question arises as to the establishment of new schools.  The Bill provides that any new school established must be built on property owned by the regional education board.  Does that mean no group can establish a school without the property being owned by the regional education board?  Why is that?  Who will purchase this property?  If it is not readily available for the establishment of a school, will the school be prevented from being formed because the regional education board does not own the property? If the property is available to some group prepared to build a school on it, will we deny it the right to do so?  Is that in keeping with our Constitution which allows denominational groups to establish and operate their own educational facilities?</P>
    <P>Ten regional education boards are proposed and the one for the Midlands would cover four counties and have a membership of 24 people.  Of those, four would be public representatives. There is much disquiet that only four public representatives are deemed worthy to serve on the board.  They have been elected by the public and should have a greater role in any such body.  What about the four teachers appointed to the board? As it will cover four counties, how will we in Westmeath choose our one teacher to serve on the board?  Will that teacher represent the primary sector, the vocational sector, the community college sector or the voluntary secondary sector? If we choose one from the primary level, does that mean four primary teachers will be on the board?  Likewise, will there be parents on this regional board from the different types of schools?  Who decides who will elect them and how they will be elected?  The same applies to the boards of management, the patrons and the interested outsiders.  Gender balance must also be maintained.  Are we not taking an extremely difficult path which will make these mechanisms almost unworkable?</P>
    <P>Coming from County Westmeath, I have a jaundiced view of vocational education committees and my colleagues understand why.  Is it not crazy that there are 38 vocational education committees and that, while there are proposals to amalgamate some of them, many will be kept in place while regional education boards are established? Should the two sectors run in parallel or should we have one or the other?  It is a topic worth debating.</P>
    <P>On the role of the poor school principal in relation to this Bill, there are 3,200 principals at primary level and about 800 at second level.  A typical principal in a five teacher primary school <Col N="1387" /> in a rural setting or small country town will now be burdened with more work.  He must prepare, publish and distribute a school plan and an annual school report.  I hope the latter will not be a recruitment document with glossy photographs; an advertising feature for the school.  The principal is to identify the educational needs of his students.  How is he to do this?  How will he identify the needs of students who require special care?  He must keep records.  For how long? When will they be accessible to whoever is supposed to have access to them?  He must also ensure parental involvement.  How is he to liaise with parents on an almost full-time basis while doing his job?  In the case of the principal of the five teacher primary school, he will have to teach 30 pupils at the same time.</P>
    <P>This is supposed to be a document for the future strategy on education in Ireland.  One crucial aspect for second level education in the future is school amalgamations in small towns.  It is a thorny subject and the cause of endless difficulties. It is not clear how we should proceed with school amalgamations and how they will be resolved.  In this document for the future there is no mention of them or how they should be dealt with.  This topic should be addressed on Committee or Report Stage as second level education will greatly depend on how school amalgamations are negotiated.  We can no longer tolerate two small secondary schools each with 200 pupils in small towns as they cannot offer the subject choices and range of activities that should be available to second level students.  There is a need for such schools to amalgamate.  The guidelines for school amalgamations should be laid down and included in the Bill.  Will the Minister consider doing that?</P>
    <P>While a number of points will be teased out on Committee Stage, I wish to refer to the withdrawal of recognition of schools.  The Bill states that if recognition is withdrawn from a school the pupils can be taken into other schools, but what will happen to the teachers?  That is not covered in the Bill.  Will they be thrown on the scrap heap?  Will they receive their salaries for the period the school is under review?  If the school in question were operating independently, which I expect it would be, what would happen about accumulated expenses in terms of bills, a caretaker's salary and so on?  Will those costs be covered?  Those matters need to be clarified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is about ministerial control and centralising power.  It is an administrative nightmare.  It does not go into the expenditure involved in running the boards.  The Minister can reject or amend the operational plans of the boards.  They must accept persons designated by the Minister as employees and the inspectorate is also under her control.  It seems that the Minister and the director of a board will be pitted against the other board members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a limited role for school principals in the Bill.  Policy function is also a matter for the <Col N="1388" /> Minister.  The boards of management will have less autonomy and freedom to manoeuvre than they have at present.  Even though this Bill deals with structures, we have missed a golden opportunity. It is silent on the central matter of a teaching council which could deal with codes of professional practice as well as teacher qualifications and conduct.</P>
    <P>The Minister has neglected the Gaeltacht areas in her considerations and perhaps at a later stage she will address them in detail.  The appeals board proposed does not have a teacher representative. How can teachers be expected to have confidence in such an appeals system?  No resources are provided for in the Bill to deal with the requirements of pupils with special needs.  What has been provided in the Bill for principals who are already overburdened with work?  They are now being asked to take on further responsibilities with the production of an annual report.  I am sure they would be willing to do that and would agree with it in principle, but they are overworked and the Minister does not seem to recognise the day to day problems they face in attempting to do their work to the best of their ability in difficult circumstances. The main issue is where the funding will come from for the boards.</P>
    <P>The voluntary secondary school sector is cash starved.  These boards will need office accommodation, equipment, the provision of salaries and professional and administrative staff.  In providing those facilities will we not be putting precious funding into another layer of administration? Schools are crying out for basic repairs, adequate classroom space, resources for children with special needs, scientific equipment and classroom materials.  I am concerned that if education boards are instituted they would be not only cumbersome but ineffective in mirroring the problems of the counties and schools involved.  We know that, irrespective of how hard the staff in health boards work, it can be cumbersome dealing with such bodies.  We should not introduce another administrative layer into our education system.</P>
    <P>There is a major lack of clarity about future operations and functions of vocational education committees which must be resolved in the interest of openess, transparency and accountability. How can a single board in, for example, the south east region, which consists of six local authorities, be responsible to such a diverse population dealing with urban areas and sparsely populated rural districts?  For example, in County Clare the partners in education got together some time ago on a country basis and decided the way forward in education and what was best for the educational interests represented in that county.  The Fianna Fáil spokesperson on education, Deputy Martin, has shown great interest in what the partners in education in County Clare have to show for their work and much of our policy on vocational education committees is based on that example.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as constituted, will result in education boards becoming top heavy, unwieldy, bureaucratic, <Col N="1389" /> self-perpetuating structures and available funds will be absorbed in them.  The vocational education committees are referred to in the Bill but the reference is woolly and unsatisfactory.  We on this side of the House consider the county structure of education, particularly the one in my constituency of County Clare, is more in line with Irish traditions and loyalties.  The proposed regional structure is too remote for individual schools.  What will be the future of small localised school units in the proposed regional bodies? Educational boards will provide funding to each school as they consider appropriate.  There is no indication as to what is considered appropriate funding.  On what basis will funding be provided? There is too vague a basis on which to frame a Bill.  The Minister will know the IVEA, the umbrella body for the vocational education committees, has proposed a county structure to subsume all vocational education committees and I would like that further debated by the Minister. The Government's proposal provides for 18 vocational education committees and ten education boards.  It adds a further layer of unnecessary and costly administration to the system.</P>
    <P>We all realise there are many areas of education that have not been given the type of funding that is badly needed.  They include the psychological service, the remedial service, teachers, capital funding and special needs development. Another issue that is always lurking in the background in discussions on education is the problem of truancy, which has not been addressed adequately by the Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the position regarding the psychological service, the remedial service, capital funding and the definition of disadvantage with particular reference to my constituency in County Clare.  The proposal that inspectors assess the psychological needs of students is not the appropriate approach to providing a psychology service.  In 1986, at a meeting of the Association of Child Psychiatry and Psychology, teachers and psychiatrists outlined the type of service required by schools.  Deputy O'Rourke set up two pilot schemes in Dublin West and Tipperary South in 1990.  Since then, only ten additional psychologists have been appointed.  The work that needs to be done through providing a psychology service in primary schools should be set as a priority not only by this but every Government.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, at a meeting with representatives of the Psychological Society in 1993, was hopeful that her Department would appoint ten psychologists per annum for the lifetime of the Government.  However, the White Paper has further delayed appointments by suggesting that psychology services should be provided by local education boards when they are set up.  This proposal has slowed down any likely progress in other areas.  Eighty per cent of primary schools will not have any psychology service for a considerable time &mdash; perhaps for the lifetime of children currently attending primary school.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1390" /> Adult psychology services in Clare comprise three psychologists and one trainee.  Two psychologists are provided for community care and one for learning disability.  At post-primary level, a part-time service is provided by one psychologist based in Galway and, at primary school level, there is no service.  Community care psychologists offer services to children and adolescents, and their families, who have significant emotional and behavioural problems.  The Brothers of Charity in Ennis do their utmost, although they do not have the staff, to deal with the difficulties associated with learning disability.  As regards learning disability, if the same ratio used in other counties was applied to Clare, there should be four psychologists employed instead of one.</P>
    <P>As regards the school population in County Clare, there are 20,000 students, 13,000 at primary level and 7,000 at post-primary level.  There are two special schools, three special classes for learning disabilities, two special units for language disorder and the hearing impaired and classes for travellers.  There is no school psychology service for the population at primary level while the post primary sector is serviced by one psychologist based in Galway.  The screening services offered by the Brothers of Charity are operated under difficult circumstances as they are short at least three staff members.  Three psychologists are required immediately for the primary sector and two for the post primary sector in Clare.</P>
    <P>Another issue which should be addressed when discussing education is that of the definition of &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo;.  I would prefer to see these practical problems addressed now rather than talking about a Bill that only deals with structures and does not even allude to their possible funding. We acknowledge and accept that there is social disadvantage in urban areas but there is also poverty and social disadvantage in rural areas.  The Minister does not seem to understand that schools in county towns, for example, my county town of Ennis, are similar to many urban schools and would like to be part of the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; programme, not least the national school in Cloughleigh, Ennis.  This would be of great benefit to all the students in this school. These problems do not arise only in Dublin and the major cities but in rural towns also.  I hope that even, at this late stage, the Minister recognises those needs.</P>
    <P>The area of the special needs of primary school children is not alluded to in this so-called &ldquo;Educational&rdquo; Bill.  For example, Scoil Mhuire in Lahinch, County Clare, needs the immediate services of a resource teacher.  At present, five children with varying degrees of special needs, from junior infants to fourth class, attend the school.  I hope the Minister will provide a resource teacher for this school.  It is a four teacher school and the staff are doing their utmost not only to fulfil their responsibilities to the mainstream students but also to give every possible attention to those children with special needs.  They feel they are not giving the necessary service to either group <Col N="1391" /> because of the lack of a resource teacher.  I am sure the Minister realises how difficult it is to teach when there are differing levels of ability and maybe some behavioural difficulties also. The teachers in this school in Lahinch would like to provide this service but are not in a position to do so without the support of a resource teacher.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a great disappointment.  Education is a major issue in any democratic and civilised society.  In Ireland, the education system has always occupied a special place in our hearts and we realise the great benefits of it. We can be proud of it because its standards are and always have been very high.  Teachers work in difficult conditions, either because they do not have the staff support they want or because they work under difficult physical conditions as capital funding is not available.  These are the issues we should be discussing tonight rather than a Bill which only refers to structures and lays on another administrative layer to our education system which will eat into scarce resources.</P>
    <P>I raised the question of remedial school teachers on the Adjournment last week, as well as the capital funding needed for a number of schools, including the gaelscoil in Kilmurry and schools in Kilkee, Tuamgraney and Knockanean. There is also an immediate need for a remedial teacher to cover the six schools in East Clare, Ogonnelloe, Tuamgraney, Bodyke, Broadford, Kilbane and O'Callaghan's Mills.  It is important to say that 57 of the 124 primary schools in Clare have no remedial service and the situation is one of the worst in the country.</P>
    <P>I compliment our party spokesman on his contribution. He pointed to the very great difficulties not faced up to in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will reflect very carefully on its provisions and table appropriate amendments with practical, positive implications for education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also extraordinary to hear such a plea for capital budgets for psychological and remedial services.  If my memory serves me correctly, the Fianna Fáil Party held the Education portfolio for in the region of 47 years &mdash; a distinguished former Minister for Education is present &mdash; and did damn all to provide for remedial or psychological <Col N="1392" /> services or home/school liaison officers.  We had to await the arrival of the Minister early in 1993 before witnessing any movement in those areas.</P>

      <P>It is incredibly embarrassing to have to listen to this type of contribution by a member of a party which dominated the Department of Education for 50 of our 75 years of independence. The vicious cutbacks implemented between 1989 and 1992 by the infamous Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition brought capital spending on primary and secondary education to a virtual halt over those three bitter, barren years.  It required the present Minister to begin to deal with the horrendously bad conditions in primary and some secondary schools.  I am proud to have been associated with schools such as St. David's CBS, St. Aidan's CBS and Pobail Scoil Neasáin in Baldoyle in my constituency where, at long last, requisite resources have begun to be invested which Fianna Fáil failed to do over their long and at times very barren tenure.</P>
      <P>As a former teacher it gives me great pleasure to welcome this Bill and contribute to this debate. From my teaching experience I am only too well aware of the confusion caused by the lack of guiding legislation in the education sector since independence. I am only too aware of the frustration of parents and teachers, and on occasion patrons, who have felt totally excluded from the decision making process from time to time.</P>
      <P>This is an historic Bill.  It is remarkable that, since this State became independent, with the exception of the Vocational Education Act of 1930, this is the only Bill whose provisions are far-reaching and re-organisational, specifying appropriate standards to be complied with.  We should salute the Minister on its introduction, following very lengthy consultations.  Its publication and presentation are timely.</P>
      <P>Education always has been important, contributing to the welfare and self-development of all our citizens.  It is the primary factor in determining the success of one's career, the prevailing rule of thumb always being that the better one's education the better will be one's job.  Many people contend that a significant proportion of the credit for our outstanding economic progress in recent years must be attributed to the wonderful work and outstanding achievement of our primary and secondary teachers who, over the past 30 years, have modernised the schools curricula, often working in extremely difficult conditions, sometimes with primary classes comprising anything from 36 to 40 or 50, if not more, pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall position in education is rapidly changing and its importance throughout one's lifetime becoming ever more important.  The days when one ceased formal education at the age of 18 or in the early 20s &mdash; if one was fortunate enough to have been able to attend a third level <Col N="1393" /> institution in the first place &mdash; are fast disappearing. Many more teenagers are attending third level colleges than ever before and <i>per capita</i>, we have one of the highest rates of third level educational attendance within Europe.  Increasingly young adults are being joined by older, mature adults seeking to catch up on an education they may not have had an opportunity of acquiring at an earlier age.  I ask the Minister to liaise with groups representing mature third level students who have been making a strong case for some help with the burden of their fees.  It was this Government that abolished third level undergraduate fees.  It has to be remembered that a significant number of older people did not have the chance of continuing to third level.  They are now availing of that opportunity and are of the strong opinion they are being penalised, something all parties in this House must address.</P>
    <P>If technology continues to develop at its current pace we shall all require to be re-educated and retrained throughout our careers.  While education needs to be recognised as a social service, it is also important that its role in economic advancement be clearly recognised.  Success in this field has become the yardstick by which the level of one's skill are judged.  Ability to acquire new skills and expertise represents a significant indicator of how much, how often and how long one will work.</P>
    <P>This has come as a body blow to the advocates of the new right economics of the 1980s.  Economic success is no longer about greed but more about investment, particularly in people.  I do not agree with much of the economic activity with which the present British Conservative Government has been associated.  Nonetheless it is interesting to note that its education and employment ministries are combined within one super ministry.  While that may not represent the correct way forward it demonstrates, belatedly, how discredited Conservative politicians under their Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, have begun to recognise the key problems of their education system which, at second and third levels, has not yielded sufficient numbers of quality graduates for the advancement of the British economy.  The British are now attempting to redress that deficiency.  We have always been somewhat wiser in that respect.</P>
    <P>I read in the press earlier this week of the intention of the Progressive Democrats, if that party ever returns to Government, to repeal this Bill, if enacted.  It appears that party would prefer to see money spent within the education system, directly on schools.  When that party was in Government four years ago, funds within the education system were more conspicuous by their absence and there was a long catalogue of cuts which disfigured education services throughout that unhappy period.  I hope Deputy Séamus Brennan and his colleagues will not travel down that Progressive Democrats road following the general election.  I hope the electorate will not give the Progressive Democrats the kind of support <Col N="1394" /> which would enable that party to exercise any influence on any future Government.  Of course, the Progressive Democrats Party would prefer the present position to continue, under which all regulations and resources are dispensed centrally by the Department of Education.  They would probably feel better placed to withstand parents' pressure for investment in the education system than under the system proposed in this Bill when, for the first time, parents will be allowed a significant input in determining education policy.</P>
    <P>The parents understand the importance of education in determining their children's future even if the Progressive Democrats do not.</P>
    <P>One of the significant features of this Bill is that for the first time the role of parents, the key primary educators, is finally given a statutory basis in that they will have a right to be present on the local education boards.  Many would say the guilty party in this area is Fianna Fáil.  Since 1932 when it first won election in the State Fianna Fáil has occupied the Department of Education for more than 45 years and for all its so called radicalism in the 1930s and 1940s the system it inherited from the British was left virtually unaltered.  Fianna Fáil should not oppose this Bill. Given its record over the decades, it should hang its head in shame.</P>
    <P>There are a number of important areas in the Bill.  The most significant aspect is that for the first time it will put the education system on a statutory footing.  It means the rights and responsibilities of all the key actors in the education system will be recognised &mdash; school staff, 40,000 teachers and principals.  My colleague, Deputy McGrath, referred to the problems which may arise in relation to the workload of the principal. One of the benefits during the past four or five years is the development of a responsible middle management system in our primary and second level schools.  There were criticisms of the recent agreement between the INTO, the Minister and the Government.  That agreement ultimately referred to recognition of the development of the middle management system under which the senior cadre of teachers in each school will assume a great deal of the burden which principals and the vice principals carried alone.  The Bill has taken this a stage further by formally recognising that.  Everyone in my profession would welcome this development which puts the middle management system on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy de Valera's call for a teaching council and recognition of a professional body to ensure the highest standards continue to be the hallmark of Irish teachers at each level.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the regional education boards.  Most people would consider the various health boards, tourism boards and many other areas where there is regional development have operated well.  Under the Eastern Health Board, two or three counties together can have a population resource which can make a difference in the provision of key resources.  I <Col N="1395" /> do not follow this argument.  In this regard the Fianna Fáil party, Deputy Brennan in particular, is hiding behind the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The opposition to the establishment of the boards which will enhance the quality of education by bringing it closer to the regions it serves is perplexing.  As a Dublin Deputy I have been perplexed by the position adopted by Fianna Fáil. On a fortnightly basis it bemoans the treatment of this or that region at the hands of the Government as if the problems suffered by those regions had only begun in 1995.  Why is it so opposed to a Bill which will devolve responsibility for education on those regions?  Will it propose to end the Civil Service decentralisation programme and, if so, we will be happy to retain the half of the Civil Service which we still have in Dublin &mdash; the area of highest unemployment in the State?</P>
    <P>The underlying thrust of the Bill is recognition of our diverse education system, as one based on partnership and its success in the past.  Our recent economic success, and perhaps our success going back to the mid-1960s, has resulted from the education system.  The Minister must be commended for insisting on the embodiment of this principle of partnership in our education system.  On entering office the Minister established the national education convention following wide-ranging consultation, such as had never been seen in the history of Irish education; published a White Paper &mdash; I pay tribute to Deputy Seamus Brennan who published the previous Green Paper &mdash; and embarked upon an extensive consultation process.  This is representative of the qualities brought to Government by the Minister and the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin suggested the Bill has fallen foul of the denominational sectors.  He failed to point out that CORI and other religious bodies have welcomed most of it.  For instance, they welcome the flexibility the regional boards will give the system to promote equality, attempt to pursue the issue of education disadvantage and develop support services and many of the other positive features prominent in the Bill.</P>
    <P>CORI welcomes the provisions which stipulate that each education board should develop an education plan.  The absence of such plans in the past has been a key weakness in the system, particularly at primary level, to assess its weaknesses and strengths.  Far from being a burden the necessity for plans and transparent accounting will be a further strength of the developing education sector.  CORI has welcomed the Bill's attempt to ensure the principle of equality in schools' admission policy is placed at the centre of our education policy.  It is a disgrace it has taken 60 years to put that provision in place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin raised CORI's concern about funding for tackling disadvantage and inequality in our education system.  It is tiresome to listen to this criticism from a Deputy who sits on the same front bench as Deputies McCreevy and Cullen. Deputy Cullen beamed in tonight from County <Col N="1396" /> Waterford.  I presume he is another of our colleagues who has been out canvassing.</P>
    <P>Until last weekend Fianna Fáil has got away with a huge amount of double speak on its plans for this country's future.  This double speak, particularly on education, will be exposed in the coming weeks.  Deputy Martin's passionate defence of the rights of the denominational sector is misplaced.  The majority of parents wish to have their children educated in their own denomination and in their religious and cultural traditions. At the same time they do not understand the reason a large number of school buildings lie idle in the evenings when there are community uses to which they could be put.  It strikes me that Fianna Fáil's opposition to the Bill is based more on currying favour with powerful interest groups rather than the needs of the public.</P>
    <P>The comments uttered by Deputy Keogh were somewhat bizarre and extremely convoluted.  She seems to be looking for a system such as that which operated in Tzarist or Soviet Russia run absolutely on individual discretion.</P>
    <P>One of the key features which I welcome &mdash; and on which we have had lengthy discussions in the Committee of Public Accounts in recent months &mdash; is the attempt to introduce a fundamental principle of accountability throughout the education system.  The budget for the sector is up to £2.5 billion.</P>
    <P>At the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I have been a member for the past four years, we have heard some incredible sagas in recent months.  We had to dissect the unedifying history of Westmeath County vocational education committee where extraordinary events took place.  A member of the vocational education committee was appointed chief executive of the vocational education committee and important and significant overruns occurred in expenditures.  In Kilkenny vocational education committee similar problems emerged on a smaller scale.  Under the Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1994 we have the power to ensure the money this House allocates for our children at primary and secondary level will go to the children for whom it is intended, and to no other purpose.  That is the least our children can expect.  Unfortunately, the evidence which has been placed before the Committee of Public Accounts about a number of our education institutions would indicate that has not always been the case.  I strongly welcome the insertion in this Bill of the principle of absolute accountability for State moneys for our children and teachers, and that they will be accountable to this House.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  I congratulate the Minister and look forward to the speedy passage of this legislation through the House.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Broughan that this Bill is historic.  It is the result of some ten years of gestation and work by five or six Ministers for Education, as well as many fine people in our education establishments, and <Col N="1397" /> officials in the Department of Education and elsewhere in our public service.  The Bill is the product of much consultation over a long period. I welcome the fact that it is before the Dáil and the Minister is to be thanked for that.  However, more than one third of the Bill deals with the issue of regional boards.  There has been a considerable shift from the original Green Paper, produced in 1992, and the Minister's current policy.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Education at the time, I introduced that Green Paper and specifically set my face against regional boards. While all my colleagues may not agree, I set my face against any formal intermediate structure. The Minister changed that and inserted specific proposals in the White Paper and the legislation. It is worth debating the substantial difference between the policy of my party, which is opposed to the regional boards, and that of the Government. The issue is worthy of serious debate with a little less heat and a bit more light.</P>
      <P>In October 1992, I told the Seanad that I deliberately had not included an intermediate structure in the Green Paper because I felt the case for such a structure had to be made.  I also said that before I would embark on establishing any regional or county educational structure I needed to be convinced that within a couple of years somebody would not take the view it was a pity all that money was not going into educating children in schools.  I also said that money should not be tied up in bureaucracy and administration, but should go into the schools where it was desperately required.</P>
      <P>I concluded that address to the Seanad by pointing out that any changes that are necessary should be made for the sake of school children. The changes should not be made to keep either politicians or teachers busy, or to satisfy local authorities or other interest groups in education. We have had too much politics in education, which is about delivering a service to the pupils of the country.  It is not about keeping teachers, administrators, bureaucrats or elected officials happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can sometimes lose sight of what education is about.  Occasionally when one is trying to make policy in a sea of options &mdash; and all of us in this House experienced that feeling from time to time &mdash; it is critically important to have a guiding star to go by.  There really is only one guiding star in education and that is to deliver quality service to the maximum number of children in the State. Anything that gets in the way of that has no place in our system.  That is why I made those remarks in the Seanad in October 1992 and I have helped to convince my party that it is still a good policy. That is why I am saying now that we should not have regional education boards because they will get in the way of that clear objective.  They are there to fiddle around with the education system, <Col N="1398" /> to tinker with it and to establish a mosaic of educational bureaucracy which will turn into an absolute nightmare.</P>
    <P>While it may be useless to do so, I would like to ask the Minister for Education, even at this late stage, to abandon these regional education boards.  They will not meet the guiding principle of delivering quality service to our children.  The Minister appears to have gone both ways on these regional education boards.  On the one hand she says the boards are designed to help education and to have services devolved to them, but then she holds back ministerial control to herself.  Ministerial sanction is to be required for the purchase, sale or lease of any land or premises by the new board.  The Minister will also retain the power to reject or amend the operational plan which is to be submitted to each educational board.</P>
    <P>One can imagine the mess with thousands of schools submitting operational plans to the boards who would then have to prepare plans for the Department.  They would ring up every day and wonder when sanction would be given for their operational plans, including the disposal of property and so on.</P>
    <P>A bureaucratic jungle is now being established. This is a small country which has the capacity to run its education system without building this layer of ten gigantic regional boards.  They will cost a fortune and will come between pupils and policy makers.  We will all spend our days administering the process rather than delivering the service directly to children in the education system.</P>
    <P>Even the school board of management, it seems, will not have a school policy function because that also has to be checked with the regional board.  From what I can see, the school boards would appear to have less autonomy and freedom of manoeurve than they currently enjoy. I am not sure where the Minister gives effect to her claim that this is devolution of authority and responsibility.</P>
    <P>I support the statutory recognition given to the rights of parents.  I also support the provisions in the Bill which seek to establish our educational establishments on a statutory footing.  That needed to be done and it is in order, but these regional boards which take up one third of the Bill are a totally wrong and inappropriate response to the future needs of the education system. They will be ineffective in influencing the strategic policy of developing Irish education. They will be extremely bureaucratic and we take the view that, in office, we will abolish these boards.  I strongly advocate that course of action to whoever holds office after the next general election.  I passionately believe that the boards are going in the wrong direction.  They just build a scaffolding which is totally unnecessary in this day and age.  If the Minister wants to devolve to lower levels of authority she should devolve to the school board itself.  In fairness, the Minister is being quite tough about putting in school boards, so why not give them the authority to deal with <Col N="1399" /> some of the issues which the regional boards are now being asked to do?  Is it that we do not trust the school boards to deal with these matters?</P>
    <P>A strong board of management in a school should be underpinned with legislation, which we are doing.  Following that a school board can deal with many of the issues which are given to the regional boards.  We have consistently said on this side of the House that any available funds in education have to go to the classrooms not into the structures themselves, particularly into fancy bureaucratic structures like those proposed. Regional boards are unnecessary.  Despite repeated questioning over many weeks, Members on this side of the House have been unable to establish the estimated costs of the boards.  It is unfair to ask the House to pass legislation without putting a price tag on it.  This is unprecedented as we are usually given some indication of the cost of legislation.  However, on this occasion we have not been told the first year costs or the estimated costs over the next five or ten years.  I have some experience of the Department of Education and that information is available to the able people who work in it.  No one in the Departments of Education or Finance agreed to the establishment of ten regional boards without asking the estimated costs, the staffing required, the salary of the chief executive and their role in terms of property, management etc.  Unfortunately we cannot get the answers to these questions in the House.  This is regrettable as this information would have enabled us to debate the real value of these boards.</P>
    <P>The regional boards will act as a smokescreen and allow future Ministers for Education to say what is already said about semi-State companies. The type of reply Deputies will receive from future Ministers for Education will be: &ldquo;I cannot deal with that issue because it is a matter for the western or southern regional board&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>If we were to debate the health boards I would refer to the millions of pounds spent on them and the need to give hospital boards more autonomy.  I am criticising the establishment of regional boards without giving any indication of the costs involved.  The Departments of Education and Finance would not dream of agreeing to the establishment of these boards without knowing the costs over the next four or five years.  The Departments have that information <Col N="1400" /> but it is being withheld from this House. I welcome many of the provisions but, as the Minister is aware, I first voiced my opposition to the introduction of intermediate structures in the area of education five or six years ago.  I am still opposed to them not because the Minister thought of them but rather because they are fundamentally wrong in terms of education and go in the wrong direction.</P>
      <P>Dr. John Coulahan, for whom I have enormous respect and who was very good to me while I was in the Department, said in a recent article that if the regional education boards were to fulfil the functions being assigned to them they would be and should be expensive.  Dr. Coulahan is professor of education at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, and is a regular adviser to the Department of Education.  The Minister will not tell us how expensive the boards will be and they are being set up because it seems like a good idea.  This proposal has not been properly thought through. Instead of setting up these boards the maximum amount of responsibility should be devolved to schools.  If one looks at the responsibilities being given to the regional boards one will see that it would be easy to devolve them to schools.</P>
      <P>The education boards will be required to submit costed operational programmes.  Following the submission of these programmes to the Department there will be a press conference at which the chief executives of these glossy public relations boards will tell us about their plans for the future.  I am not sure what this has to do with education and I suspect it has more to do with the career building of these chief executives who will want to be like semi-State executives and have the usual perks that go with that office.</P>
      <P>I differ from my colleagues on this side of the House in one or two respects.  For example, I do not believe elected local officials should play a prominent role in the policy making aspects of education.  Other countries have gone down this road but it is not one we should go down.  I have no doubt that local officials will play a strong role on regional boards.  However, education is the business of parents, teachers and pupils, not of local or national politicians.</P>
      <P>I support the establishment of a unified agency to be known as the Inspectorate.  This body should be given teeth and made independent so that it can comment on the operation of the Department of Education and the Minister's policies. If the Inspectorate is not independent then this initiative, which I support, will not be worth much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have participated in the debate not to make political points but rather to support this historic legislation which is the culmination of ten years' work; the establishment of the system on a statutory basis; the appointment of independent inspectorates and the introduction of greater accountability in the system.  However, I am trenchantly opposed to the establishment of regional education boards.  I have studied the <Col N="1401" /> issue carefully and believe school boards could carry out these functions.</P>
    <P>Some functions should be taken out of the Department of Education, which should be engaged in policy, not operations.  Its function is to set and monitor policy, set standards, allocate resources, ensure management takes place and target areas of speciality.  It should not be involved in fixing school gates or dealing with minor issues.  Much of the work of the Department of Education is devoted to the payment of teachers' salaries.  If one does not have a philosophical hang-up about the payment of teachers' wages by a Department, they could be administered in the first instance by a payments agency which is at arms length from the Department. The Minister administers billions of pounds worth of property, if one includes every educational establishment.  This work could be carried out by an agency which specialises in property. The psychology services could be undertaken by an outside company, while special education could be dealt with by a specialist unit.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister wanting to take the clutter out of the Department to allow it concentrate on policy, but handing over this responsibility to regional boards will double the clutter, not remove it.  To remove the clutter and allow the Department focus on policy, responsibility for areas such as payroll, property, etc., should be given to specialised agencies who can operate them on a national basis if necessary in a commercial way.  School boards should be given real power to run their schools.  Boards of management are well able to run their schools within the parameters laid down by the Department of Education. They do not need Big Daddy looking over their shoulder in the form of local representatives and political appointees of all sorts.  If that is done we will have real devolution, not the fictional devolution offered in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate.  I compliment the Government in general and the Minister for Education in particular on bringing the Bill to fruition after many years of consultation.  The Bill, which is the result of a painstaking consultative process, has received a broad welcome from the partners in education including parents, teachers, Department officials, religious patrons and owners of schools.  I do not understand the Opposition's attitude to it.  It has latched on to the question of regional education boards, the only reasonable sound bite in terms of media opposition to the proposed changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered the Bill is the first attempt, excluding the 1930 vocational education committee Act, to establish a statutory framework for primary and second level education.  My one criticism of the Bill is that, in establishing the regional education boards, it did not clean the slate completely by abolishing the vocational education committees.  With some notable exceptions, including the City of Dublin vocational <Col N="1402" /> education committee and Cork County vocational education committee, which are widely recognised as being successful, vocational education committees have not wrapped themselves in glory during their existence.  The Minister had an ideal opportunity to put in place a new administrative framework for the democratisation of education.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat confused by the Fianna Fáil opposition to the Bill because on the one hand we have had a trenchant defence of the vocational education committee system and disdain for the meagre rationalisation the Minister is effecting, which is long overdue.  The argument was put forward that county, not regional, education boards should be established.  We also had the position as enunciated by the previous speaker and the spokesperson earlier that regional education boards will be abolished if Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats return to Government.</P>
    <P>What are vocational education committees if not regional education boards under another name dealing with a specific sector in the education field?  In establishing regional education boards we are putting together a critical mass of schools at primary and secondary level which will have sufficient numbers and resources to make them significant players in terms of education policy.  This is the first attempt in the closing years of the 20th century to establish a statutory framework for primary and secondary education that outlines the roles, rights and responsibilities of all the players.  It is vitally important that these legislative provisions are put in place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recognition in the White Paper of the role of religious in education and the whole question of ethos.  It is a logical progression, in terms of the democratic constitution of regional education boards, that ethos is enshrined and protected by virtue of the composition of each of the regional education boards.  Parents who wish to have their children educated under the ethos of a particular religious tradition will ensure that it is recognised, as will teachers and patrons.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism from the religious that the Bill does not enshrine the principles recognised in the White Paper, but the democratising of education through the regional education boards will safeguard the principle of ethos in education for the future.  That is important.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not go the extra mile with regard to the vocational education committees because we will have a situation which has an analogy with the health services in terms of the health boards and the voluntary hospitals.  Regional education boards will exist side by side with vocational education committees. It is not too late for the Minister to reconsider that.  I know it will open a Pandora's box and there will be a great deal of criticism, but I suggest the capacity to command media attention is not directly related to the concern of the people most affected by the Bill, namely, the pupils. Anybody who has been a member of a health <Col N="1403" /> board will be aware of the uneasy relationship that exists between the voluntary hospital sector and the health boards.</P>
    <P>The regional education boards bring a long overdue element of democratisation to education. There will also be transparency in terms of the allocation of resources.  In the publication of education plans there will be an onus on regional education boards, particularly in the context of the effects of demographic trends, to take tough decisions in the not too distant future as that trend manifests itself through the education system.</P>
    <P>There may come a time when regional education boards will have to make strategic decisions about the provision of services in their own areas.  It is important to empower people who are representatives of those who provide the education service and those who receive it.  They must be directly involved in making decisions for their own regions.  In terms of transparency in allocating resources, disadvantaged and marginalised areas of education such as special and remedial education will have a far greater chance of getting their share of resources under the regional education boards than they have under the competitive forces currently at play in terms of the distribution of resources by the Department of Education.  Services such as remedial and special education have for too long been the Cinderella of the education services.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge what has been achieved in these areas in the past few years.  From a situation where very few schools had access to remedial teachers, 80 per cent of schools or pupils &mdash; I am not sure which &mdash; now have remedial education services.  However, a significant number of small schools still do not have that resource.  The democratisation that will follow the establishment of regional education boards will make it easier to target resources at these areas in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>The composition of the boards is very important.  The cost of regional education boards has been identified as a reason for abandoning the idea.  I received some documentation recently expressing outrage at the cost of regional education board meetings.  Based on a model somewhat like the South Eastern Health Board, it could run to £3,000 or £4,000.  For 12 board meetings a year, that is peanuts in terms of the cost of giving the consumers of education a say in how education services in their area are delivered. There will be other costs.  The Opposition has concentrated excessively on the cost of the regional education boards.  However, there will be an element of reducing costs to the Department of Education with the transfer of resources, decision making and personnel from a highly centralised Department to regional education boards.  The Department is excessively bureaucratic, notwithstanding the fact that it has been decentralised to Tullamore and Athlone.  It is difficult to see any transparency in the various steps <Col N="1404" /> involved in making decisions on the education process.</P>
    <P>I accept that it is difficult to put an exact cost on the regional education boards.  There is a cost, and it is worth bearing, but there will be a simultaneous reduction in costs in terms of the ongoing operation of the Department of Education itself. The introduction of the boards will free up the Department to make broad policy decisions rather than being involved in day-to-day questions of whether a school in Donegal should have a one classroom extension or a multipurpose room built on.  I do not expect the Minister to be as authoritative as I, as a local Deputy, would be about a school in my constituency or one in Donegal.  That would be an unfair burden to lay on the Minister.  We should really be demanding that the Minister apply herself in a diligent fashion to the broad policy areas and leave the day-to-day operations of education policy at a level where they are best dealt with.  The Minister has done a reasonable job in trying to do both to date.  I look forward, with the establishment of regional education boards, to more emphasis on policy by the Department.</P>
    <P>In terms of the establishment of regional education boards, I am particularly interested in the role of the Irish language.  That will be interesting, given the democratic constitution of regional education boards.  There are glaring anomalies in the distribution of resources in the context of State policy on promoting the Irish language.  Recently in the Muskerry Gaeltacht in my constituency a primary school in Ballingeary lost a teacher.  That school is <i>de facto</i> a gaelscoil, but it also has to operate through the medium of English for pupils who are not fluent in Irish.  However, the resources available to that school, which operates through the medium of Irish for 99 per cent of the time, are less than the resources available to gaelscoileanna.  It will be interesting to see how parents and teachers react to that and how regional education boards will proceed in promoting the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Another issue that has been raised in the context of the Irish language is the question of establishing a special education board for Gaeltacht areas.  I am not convinced that this should be done.  One of the advantages of regional education boards is that they will bring decision making close to the people.  If an education board for Gaeltacht areas were to be established, it would probably be established in Galway.  A school in the Muskerry Gaeltacht would, therefore, be disadvantaged by not having access to the decision making process if, for example, it had to ring a board in Galway on a Monday morning to request a temporary teacher or go cap in hand as we do at the moment to the Department of Education to get an extension to the primary or secondary school.  The schools in the Muskerry Gaeltacht have been well served by the vocational education committee system.  A continuation of that principle through the establishment of the regional education boards would <Col N="1405" /> serve local schools better than a board which was geographically far removed from them.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the &ldquo;missing chapter&rdquo; in the Bill &mdash; the allocation of resources.  It is native in the extreme to expect the Minister for Education to commit resources by virtue of this legislation for education services &mdash; she could not legally do that because she would be superseding the budgetary procedures if she attempted to do so.  In the past few years increasing resources have been available to the Department of Education and there have been many improvements during that period.  However, there are still shortcomings in special and remedial education, the provision of caretakers and secretarial assistance. The consumers of education will never be of the opinion that we have adequate resources.  This has never been the case in regard to education or in regard to any other service.  There is always competition among Ministers for resources at Cabinet level.  Much has been achieved during the Minister's tenure in office, and it is unfair to criticise the Bill for not legally copperfastening the provision of resources from now into the future.</P>
    <P>I broadly welcome the Bill which provides a statutory framework within which services in the education field may be delivered in the future.  Rights, responsibilities and roles are clearly outlined.  Much of the criticism is for criticism's sake and is without real substance and conviction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the Education Bill.  Every responsible person who has the interests of children at heart must have something to say on this Bill.  The increasing significance of educational achievement for the future of our young people is evidenced on a yearly basis, with students under great pressure from parents, teachers, peer groups and so on to achieve greater qualifications and gain a measure of what society calls success, which is difficult to quantify.</P>
      <P>In terms of the links between education and social disadvantage, the aim of any Bill in this area must be to ensure the highest quality of education service for the young of today, the adults of tomorrow.  A Bill, introduced five years after the Green Paper on education, is important and must be welcomed.  We must aim to address the issue of educational disadvantage.  We should consider the idea of a strong local input into what is a centralised institution.  We should consider education in terms of its true remit, its links with the community.  We should open up the structures so that the people may play a part in decision making for themselves and their children, while remaining aware of the rights of denominational and other groups to provide education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our record in terms of early school leavers is not exemplary &mdash; I think Donegal is not far from the top of the list.  In its report, the Conference of Religious in Ireland stated that the education system is failing to meet the needs of poor people. That warrants immediate and serious attention. <Col N="1406" /> As a former teacher, I am concerned about the establishment of the ten regional boards.  There are many problems with regard to schools.  There is need for basic repairs, adequate classroom spaces and resources not only for courses such as science and music, for which I have a preference and which greatly lack resources, but also for special needs, not to mention basic classroom materials.</P>
    <P>The boards will constitute a new layer of bureaucracy, with the need for offices and office equipment as well as professional and administrative staff.  While they will be a good source of employment not only in terms of staff but also for those who will supply the equipment, the Minister cannot argue that there will not be a substantial amount of capital involved in the establishment and running of such boards.</P>
    <P>There is a perception that schools will rank second best to the boards in that the maintenance of a board office may take priority to a school issue.  That fear is difficult to dispel when one looks at other organisations made up of more than one layer.  The suggestion has been made that schools will rank third best in that funding will have to be approved by the board as well as the vocational education committee.  I would like clarification on whether that will be the case.  The concern is that the greater the number of bodies involved, the lower will be the amount of money for schools, where needed.</P>
    <P>Another worrying feature is the lack of information on the cost of putting in place these boards.  As with the abolition of water charges, which was debated for the past hour and half, the Government has decided that the setting up of ten regional boards is a good idea, but it cannot put a figure on what it will cost.  It is wrong to implement such a proposal without first costing it. Where will the money be found for the structures, salaries and so on?  That question may be posed by schools which have been refused assistance because of lack of resources.  The school in Moville sought funding for amalgamation but was not successful and other schools which sought funding for extensions were told there was no funding available.  There is no problem, however, in making money available for the ten regional boards.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest educational resources is the remedial service, which is of such vital importance that it cannot be stressed enough.  The Minister has heard much about that service and will hear much more about it in the future.  Instead of setting up ten regional boards, the Minister should have put the resources directly into the classroom.  That might be an old fashioned idea but it would have a much greater impact on students.  What good is another layer of bureaucracy when, for example, in Donegal there are 74 national schools without a remedial service and 37 remedial teachers covering the remaining 104 schools?</P>
    <P>While I welcome programmes such as Breaking the Cycle, attention must be given to the anomaly <Col N="1407" /> where two schools in a town, both of which are attended by children from the same family, are treated differently, with only one designated as disadvantaged.  A school close to my home which is designated as disadvantaged receives no additional resources in terms of teaching.  It is recognised as disadvantaged only in certain circumstances. I presume the Minister will respond by saying that the boards will be a way of bringing those issues to the attention of those involved at local level.  In setting up the boards, how much money will be taken out of the system which would otherwise be provided for schools?  I disagree with Deputy Creed who said that, given the number of people who would receive allowances for travel to and from meetings, based on the health board system, the cost of holding one meeting could be £2,500.</P>
    <P>The boards will have to cover urban and rural areas and, in some cases, different counties.  The proposal is to devolve power, but in reality the position will be different.  Boards of management are too large.  Will the Minister respond to the charge that members of those boards will work full-time, but on a voluntary basis?  Will they be expected to take on a number of different roles? This is similar to the Credit Union Bill which also interfered with the voluntary aspect of society. Credit unions do not want too much outside interference.  People who work on a voluntary basis do not want others undermining their positions. It should be recognised that they give freely of their time and effort.</P>
    <P>The Minister is mentioned in almost every line of the Bill.  Why is the role of the school patron being undermined and the choice of patron taken from the school?  What support will be given to principals to deal with the extra workload involved in being a member of staff and middle management?  Principals will obviously have to report back to the education boards.  It will be difficult for a working principal to deal with such a heavy workload without proper support.</P>
    <P>The proposal to evaluate teaching and management quality is welcome.  However, it is pointless identifying a problem if resources are not available to remedy it.  It is similar to the argument about remedial teachers and psychologists &mdash; if one does not label a child, one does not have to deal with the problem.  We do not have an educational psychologist in Donegal.  Some people do not want one appointed because they believe it would be pointless having a psychologist identify a child with a problem if there are no resources to help that child.  If problems are identified resources must be put in place to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Students should have recourse to an appeals mechanism, but the statements in this regard are rather vague.  I would welcome clarification in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill should not be rushed through the House.  We should not create more bureaucracy. Fianna Fáil supports the provisions which will entitle parents to sit on education boards.  It is <Col N="1408" /> important that parents are involved.  If they get involved in this way they will become more interested in the education system.  The Bill does not provide enough support for adult and community education.  Parents should be encouraged to get involved in education by taking up courses or getting involved in boards of management. Fianna Fáil also supports the statutory recommendation of the National Parents Council.  Parents have made a positive contribution to our education system over the past 20 years and more are getting involved in education in their local areas.  Their contribution, which has brought the needs of children and parents to the forefront of debate, must be recognised in legislation.</P>
    <P>Funding should be allocated for in-service training for parents on boards of management, particularly if the concept of these boards is to change substantially.  It is important that parents know what is expected of them when they become members of such boards.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 37 education psychologists, 19 of whom are based in the Dublin area. As in the case of the water charges, we do not expect equality in rural Ireland, but we always aspire to it.  While the Minister talks repeatedly of her achievements in the area of remedial education, no appointments were made last year. This is currently the subject of a heated debate in Donegal.  I am sure that debate will get hotter before the election.</P>
    <P>During my teacher training course I was told the role of music was important for the development of a child's co-ordination and language.  The rhythm of music helps a child identify signs and pronounce syllables.  Additional resources should be provided for teaching music in schools.  While it could be claimed that resources are not available for science, I do not believe a pupil could take science in the leaving certificate and not have used a Bunsen burner or carried out some type of experiment.  However, a pupil could take music in the leaving certificate and not have touched an instrument.</P>
    <P>In regard to the role of the patron, CORI stated:</P>
    <P>The Bill's misrepresentation of the role of the patron and its failure to take account of the consultation process leading to the White paper are fundamental flaws.  These flaws mean that the harmonisation of existing rights which the Bill was meant to enshrine has not been achieved.  They also undermine the Bill's stated commitment to diversity of school types and they threaten the Bill's constitutionality.</P>
    <P>Those are not positive comments.  I do not want members of education boards to be taken for granted.  The Bill does not outline who will sit on those boards.  If they are given substantial powers their members should be trained in how to carry out their functions.  What will it cost to set up the boards?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister provide secretarial, caretaker and middle management support for school principals? <Col N="1409" /> We must retain the core value of our schools, their ethos should not be threatened.  In that regard CORI states:</P>
    <P>...the Bill provides for involvement by the Minister in virtually every aspect of the work of education boards and that it grants to the Minister a number of functions which are currently exercised by schools.</P>
    <P>That is a recipe for disaster.  We should not fix something if it is not broken.</P>
    <P>The Bill fails to deal with adult community education.  We should continue to recognise qualifications, especially at second level, achieved across the Border.  The Minister should not forget to allocate money for recreational needs.  If establishing the regional boards will cost £50 million, will we have any money left for the classroom needs which I outlined earlier?</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to introduce boards of management, but who will be appointed to them? I also welcome the parental input and the right of students to review a decision made against them by the board.  Students who feel they have been unfairly treated do not get enough support. Given that the Minister is flush with money, she should consider Scoil Colmcille in Malin which is in great need of an extension.  She should also look at schools in Moville which amalgamated in September but which await funding and at the 74 schools which seek one remedial teacher per three or four schools.</P>
    <P>I spent three quarters of my life in a school and I would like others to spend time in an educational institution.  It would be of benefit to them as it was to me.  I hope the Bill will be amended to address the issue of resources.  Resources should be directed at the child who is only in school for a limited time.  In many instances, the school gives the child the most important direction he or she will get in life.  Resources for schools should take precedence over any other spending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I have been waiting a long time to speak on an education Bill such as this.  Submissions received over recent weeks made important points, particularly in relation to suggested amendments.  It is important to remind ourselves what the Bill is about. Although we have a good education system, many aspects of it need to be addressed in a rational and effective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is surprising our education system is so good given that we have depended for so long on the goodwill, co-operation and hard work of those delivering the service, including teachers, parents, members of boards of management, etc. and on circular letters from the Department which have little or no statutory basis.  We should make provision for the education of all children, including any child with a disability or special education needs and ensure the education system is accountable to students, their parents and the State for the education provided.  This must be <Col N="1410" /> conducted in a spirit of partnership between schools, patrons, students, parents, staff and the State.  A Bill which achieves those objectives will do much for the further development of the education system.  They are ambitious objectives which those who participate in the education system deserve.</P>
    <P>Given the long process of consultation which took place before the publication of the Green Paper, at the convention in Dublin Castle and after the publication of the White Paper, this Bill deserves the support of the House.  Although it is comprehensive, it does not specify everything that will be done at the various levels of the education system.  The Bill sets out good general aims and objectives and the broad brush strokes in relation to how the system should be administered. It provides a more effective way of accounting in the House and at regional level for the working of the education system.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the Minister has been criticised for excessive interference in the system while at the same time criticisms were made about the lack of detail.  The Bill strikes the right balance as regards the responsibilities of the Minister in terms of the policy and functions of the system while giving the boards of management, regional education boards and the partners in education the freedom to make an input.</P>
    <P>The two aspects of the Bill I most welcome are the setting up of the regional education boards and the changes made to the operation of boards of management at school level and the involvement of parents at that and national level. Members spend a large proportion of their working day in contact with the Minister or the Department by asking parliamentary questions, writing letters or making telephone calls to get windows fixed, alarm systems installed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> There is no reason such detail should concern Members.  The Department spends much time answering queries and dealing with schools and does not have the time or energy to concentrate on broader policy issues.  I welcome any devolution of the role and functions of the Department to a lower level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past six years there has been much talk about county committees which have resurrected as a county forum or a county talking shop. I would like to think that education committees at county level would work but given the consultation in the national education convention and the criticisms made during this debate about the potential cost of regional education boards, it is clear they would not command the support of the partners in education required to make them <Col N="1411" /> effective.  If regional boards are being criticised for being too costly, 34 or 36 county education boards would be more costly.  There is an obligation on us to make these proposals work in the interests of those concerned.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about how effective a regional board covering four counties will be in delivering services in the two counties I represent, although it will be no worse than dealing with a single institution in Dublin which is more remote than any regional education board.  We must learn from the experience of the health boards and should avoid certain things.  Planning and delivering services at regional level will be effective and will lead to a high level of efficiency.  However, what is missing from the operation of the regional health boards is a mechanism by which communities and interest groups can be consulted.  The Minister should examine before Committee Stage further elements of consultation which may be introduced at a sub-regional level to prevent the education board losing touch with those at grass roots level.</P>
    <P>The local health committees established under health board legislation were abolished by Fianna Fáil on cost grounds.  There was a view that they had become little more than talking shops.  They had no input in the decision-making process in health boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, to give full information to the House on the latest revelation in the hepatitis C controversy.  There is a need for him to clarify, as a matter of extreme urgency, the circumstances surrounding the infection of persons in 1970-71 with the hepatitis C virus.  It has been reported in the media that a woman infected with hepatitis C as a result of a blood transfusion at that time subsequently died and that her family received compensation from the hepatitis C compensation tribunal.  This revelation is significant as up until now the hepatitis C infection scandal has been associated with events since 1976.</P>
      <P>The case reported in the media appears to set a precedent whereby those infected with hepatitis C through blood or blood products in years prior to 1976 may make claims and receive compensation. The woman involved is understood to have died of liver cancer in 1994, just after the 1976 scandal became public.  When terminally ill in 1994 her doctor made contact with the chief medical consultant at the Blood Transfusion Service Board and is understood to have asked that the source of her infection be traced and that others who may have received blood from the same batch in 1970-71 be traced and notified of the infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> It has been reported that the response of the Blood Transfusion Service Board and of the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, was grim.  The woman involved died without knowing if her family would be compensated and the full circumstances surrounding her infection explained.  Even after her death it was reported that the Minister also sent holding letters.  I call on him to outline in detail the background to this case and how the infection occurred.  How many other cases are there and why was the matter not disclosed in the public interest before now?  What are the implications for the compensation tribunal and the judicial inquiry which has been looking at events since 1976 only, even though it appears the Minister was aware of infections prior to this date?</P>
    <P>A targeted look-back programme commenced in October 1994 to identify persons who may have been infected with hepatitis C as a result of a transfusion.  How many people have been identified under this programme?  In a recent reply the Minister informed me that 270 living recipients have been traced, 230 have been tested and 128 are antibody positive.  Why have the remaining 40 not been tested?  How many deceased recipients have been identified?  It is my understanding that the families of deceased recipients have not been notified of the possible infection.</P>
    <P>This latest revelation is another example of the Government's drip feed of information in dealing with the hepatitis C problem.  The Minister has a duty to inform the public of the full facts of this case.  It appears the public interest has not been kept to the fore in his consideration of these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware, the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry on the hepatitis C infection of blood and blood products specify at paragraph 1 the following matter of public importance:</P>
      <P>The circumstances in which Anti-D, manufactured by the Blood Transfusion Service Board (BTSB), was infected with what is now known as Hepatitis C and the implications thereof, including the consequences for the blood supply and other blood products.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive the final report of the tribunal of inquiry shortly.  In the meantime it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment which may be seen to pre-empt the findings or recommendations of the tribunal which was established on foot of a motion passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>On the eligibility of persons to apply to the compensation tribunal, clause 1 of the compensation scheme states that its purpose is to provide compensation:</P>
      <P>(a)  to women who have been diagnosed positive for Hepatitis C antibodies or Hepatitis C virus resulting from the use of Human Immunoglobulin-Anti-D within the State;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> (b)  to any person who has been diagnosed positive for Hepatitis C antibodies or Hepatitis C virus as a result of receiving a blood transfusion or a blood product within the State.  Such a person, where the context so requires, is hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;transfusee claimant&rdquo;; and</P>
    <P>(c)  to children and partners of persons referred to at (a) and (b) above who have been diagnosed positive for Hepatitis C antibodies and/or Hepatitis C virus.</P>
    <P>The scheme shall continue indefinitely so as to give effect to the said purpose.</P>
    <P>Clause 4 of the compensation scheme states that the following persons may make claims to the tribunal:</P>
    <P>(a)  the persons referred to at Clause 1 above;</P>
    <P>(b)  any person responsible for the maintenance of any of the persons referred to at Clause 1 above, and who has incurred financial loss, and/or incurred expenses, as a direct result of providing such maintenance arising from the condition diagnosed and referred to at Clause 1;</P>
    <P>(c)  where any of the persons mentioned at Clause 1 above has died as the result of having contracted Hepatitis C, any dependant of such person.</P>
    <P>The compensation scheme does not make reference to when a claimant was infected with the antibodies or virus.  A person who has contracted hepatitis C as a result of receiving a blood transfusion or blood product within the State or a carer or dependant of such a person as set out in clause 4 is eligible to apply for compensation. Claimants are required to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that the hepatitis C antibodies or hepatitis C virus in respect of which the claim is being made resulted from a blood transfusion or blood product received within the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first time I have raised the issue of Keytronic Ireland Limited, one of the largest companies in Dundalk until recently.  A number of months ago, it shed 316 jobs and the Minister is aware of the circumstances under which those job losses were announced.  On the same day, a new industry which would make up for the lost jobs was announced but this has yet to be put in place. When Keytronic announced it would make 316 workers redundant, it also announced it was to start negotiations regarding redundancy and compensation for the employees losing their jobs. Those ran into severe difficulties and workers expressed bad faith as regards how they were treated and a bad taste was left in some people's mouths as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> One of the carrots held out to public representatives and the people of Dundalk was that Keytronic would retain 75 jobs in the facility &mdash; despite almost 300 jobs being lost &mdash; with a view to building on them in years to come.  As this loss was such a huge jolt to the workers, their families and to Dundalk, a number of people suggested occupying the factory to ensure machinery would not be removed until they got their just entitlements. It was decided not to do that because 75 jobs would be retained and any such action would jeopardise them.</P>
    <P>We now learn within months that the 75 jobs are now at risk and 33 are soon to be lost.  We are told it is because of a lack of orders and a downturn in business.  How can that be in such a short space of time?  It raises questions about the negotiation of this package, what State moneys were recouped and how this company was allowed shed such a major number of jobs on the premise that it would retain 75 jobs which will now vanish in a puff of smoke.  The people directly affected in the area were badly treated and were not assisted as factory employees should be when they lose their jobs.  I question the conduct of State agencies involved when, within a number of months, some of the 75 jobs will now evaporate. I know the Minister took a personal interest and visited Dundalk on the issue.  While he may give me the gospel according to the agencies, he must believe that something was wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with regret that I learned Keytronic intended laying off a further five employees.  In addition, it indicated that, unless orders significantly increased in the next two months, it would be forced to reduce employment from 86 to 53 by the end of April.  The company was the subject of much discussion in the House last year when it announced a reduction in the numbers employed from 391 to 75 in May 1996 as a result of major restructuring worldwide, including the transfer of part of the Dundalk manufacturing operation to a sister company in Mexico.</P>
      <P>Despite the success of the Dundalk company, in co-operation with staff and unions, in restructuring its business in 1996, market factors, especially pricing pressures, have continued to impact adversely on the Dundalk operation.  As a result, the company is now forced into further layoffs.  I assure the House that IDA Ireland is closely monitoring the situation and maintaining close contact with the company in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out, however, that County Louth is still the location of an impressive array of overseas companies and the north-east has more than 40.  On foot of the significant layoffs at Keytronic in 1996, I requested the industrial development agencies to embark on a vigorous campaign to bring alternative jobs to the north-east.  In late 1996, two large new projects were announced.  DSC Communications intends creating 475 jobs at Drogheda over the next four <Col N="1415" /> years and Engineered Plastic Components, Dundalk, expects to employ 300 persons by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is continuing to actively respond to the challenge of attracting new inward investment to the north-east region through the acquisition of land for development.  An advance factory is currently under construction in Dundalk and this is being promoted by IDA Ireland.  A new industrial site for an advance factory is being acquired in Cavan and a developer will be sought to provide an advance factory in Monaghan as soon as a project has been secured for the Cavan factory.  As I announced yesterday, the IDA will press ahead with its new regional strategy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>My party and I welcome and support the recently announced policy drive aimed at attracting industrial investment into provincial towns.  The principle of targeting areas of special needs is a good one which I hope will be vigorously implemented.  However, my concern is that Cork city will yet again be passed over in this new drive.  That is why I have sought to raise this matter on the Adjournment to urge the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Government to put in place a parallel package of incentives for urban unemployment blackspots, specifically in Cork city.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is at crisis point.  There are now almost 18,000 people registered as unemployed in Cork city.  The number out of work has risen since the rainbow coalition assumed office in 1994.  Of those registered as unemployed, some 5,000 are under the age of 25.  There is a clear transfer from school to the dole and it is alarming how quickly short-term unemployment can become long-term.</P>
      <P>Last year, 71 per cent of all new jobs announced by the IDA went to the greater Dublin area.  Only 7 per cent went to Cork.  Since Digital closed in 1993, more than 3,500 new jobs have been announced for Galway.  The Plassey technological park in Limerick is doing extremely well and Cork is losing out all the time.  There is a clear need for a major Government initiative to attract jobs to Cork city, specifically disadvantaged areas such as the northside of the city.  This cannot be emphasised enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A study carried out last year demonstrated that, in certain communities in the city, unemployment is as high as 54 per cent and there are housing estates in my constituency where unemployment is as high as 80 per cent.  This is a crisis. If this current trend is allowed to continue for another five years and unless there is direct intervention now, people with jobs will be in the minority in large tracts of the northside of Cork city. The quality of life in those areas is deteriorating rapidly despite the best efforts of local communities. Long-term unemployment is a recipe for social disaster.  It brings in its wake crime, drugs and a breakdown of family life.  At a time of great <Col N="1416" /> prosperity for the fortunate few, to all intents and purposes many of my constituents have been cruelly cut off from the normal workings of the market economy.  We have created a strange society in modern Ireland.  On the one hand we have an economic boom and on the other we have mass unemployment.  We have labour shortages, yet we continue to impose penal tax rates on anyone who is willing to take up or create a job.  The tax problem must be tackled, but that alone will not rectify the position I described.</P>
    <P>The Government must upgrade the infrastructure in Cork-North Central.  To date the Government has failed to honour its commitment to expedite the much needed by-pass at Blackpool. Cork continues to suffer the economic consequences of the failure to provide a modern infrastructure.  We must also direct resources into education and training.  It is regrettable that we spend in excess of £300 million annually on FÁS training schemes and we now have a skills shortage. That area must be addressed.  Will the Minister direct the IDA to put in place a package that will effectively tackle the unemployment crisis in Cork city?  Natural justice demands no less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government attaches a high degree of importance to achieving a balanced regional spread for inward investment projects and I have taken a keen interest in this issue throughout my period in office.  I have visited many urban and regional centres to satisfy myself at first hand as to the opportunities and the difficulties that exist relating to industrial development and employment creation possibilities.  I am also satisfied that all the agencies for which I have responsibility are conscious of the importance of that goal and are implementing programmes informed by the importance the Government attaches to its achievement.  As I announced yesterday, the IDA will be pressing ahead with its new regional policy which will involve financial incentives now biased in favour of smaller regional locations, with higher grant levels as appropriate to each individual case; the involvement of private sector investors stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations; and working in partnership with local authorities to have available quality serviced sites at priority locations for new industrial investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of jobs, there has been quite a positive spread in 1996 into all the larger population centres.  Cork benefited particularly.  In 1996 the IDA alone announced nine new investment projects providing an estimated new jobs total of 1,455.  Already in 1997 four major projects were announced involving an estimated 840 new jobs &mdash; Kodak with an estimated 360 jobs, Moog Ltd. creating an estimated 80 jobs, Dovatron Ireland with 100 new jobs and Motorola with 300 jobs. Forbairt companies are also performing strongly, ahead of the national trend.  Overall, the net gain in employment for IDA and Forbairt companies <Col N="1417" /> in 1995 and 1996 was 995 and 1,401, respectively. That compares with only 139 in 1994.  Effectively there has been a tenfold increase in the net employment performance in Cork in the past two years.</P>
    <P>However, I am equally conscious that Cork still continues to experience high unemployment.  It is essential we continue to focus on developing indigenous enterprise and strengthening the foreign-owned base.  The Government also intends pursuing macro-economic and fiscal policies to improve the overall competitive environment. Tackling unemployment effectively is more than just a matter of creating additional jobs.  Potential employees need to be equipped with the skills to match the jobs being created.  To ensure that those who are long-term unemployed can garner their share of new jobs the kind of sustained one-to-one counselling and training now being provided through the Cork Local Employment Service is also a vital component of a comprehensive response to the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill raised many issues including tax policy and the Blackpool by-pass to which I do not propose to respond.  However, I can assure her it is the Government's determination to introduce innovative approaches to tackle long-term unemployment.  Many of the initiatives we set up last year are building effectively and I am pleased with the improved progress.  The type of approach enshrined in the Cork Local Employment Service is the way to respond to this form of crisis.  There must be a close one-to-one working with people who are long-term unemployed.  Tackling the problem is not only a matter of job creation, which is second to none in Cork.  I am very pleased with the progress in job creation there, but that is not our sole response.  We must consider other approaches to tackle long-term unemployment and that is one of the priorities I continue to address in the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to inform us about what the Department is planning to do about the alarming increase in the incidence of brucellosis during the past year.  The increase is particularly concentrated in Munster in Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Tipperary in particular.  In the past year 313 herds were restricted and 75 per cent of them were in that region.  Anyone who knows about agriculture knows that contagious abortion or brucellosis is a particularly frightening disease.  It wipes out herds.  It reduces the income potential for herd owners.  It can and often does spread to humans as undulant fever.  Economically it threatens our food exports and our high status internationally in handling disease problems.  Many people are concerned that we have moved from a brucellosis free status a few years ago to an explosion in the incidence of this rampant contagious disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> Did the Minister and the Department take their eye off the ball on this matter?  What measures will the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry take to contain this disease and to introduce controls to finally rid the national herd of this scourge?  To what extent was research carried out on this disease?  Veterinary experts have said that the blood test used is not 100 per cent accurate. We have had a number of disease problems during the past few years, but it is worrying that an old disease like this was allowed to develop to this extent.  I await with interest what the Minister of State has to say on the measures being taken to address this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Joe Walsh for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The incidence of brucellosis was on the increase when we entered office in 1994.  I am fully aware of the current situation in regard to brucellosis which is giving rise to concern.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the Minister's recent replies to parliamentary questions, the number of herd restrictions increased from 189 herds at the end of 1995 to 313 herds at the end of 1996.  To clarify the position on these 313 herds, approximately half had only one reactor and 68 per cent had two reactors or less.  In addition, a significant number of these herds have had two clear blood tests but continue to be restricted under national legislation.</P>
      <P>The position nonetheless is of concern particularly in the Limerick, North Cork, North Kerry and South Tipperary areas.  With this in mind, I organised meetings in my county and additional public meetings, addressed by national experts, were held in these and the other areas over recent months.  Foremost among the issues discussed was good herd management which is essential for the prevention of brucellosis.</P>
      <P>Bought-in animals represent one of the biggest risks.  Where buying in cannot be avoided, it is of the utmost importance that such animals are prudently sourced from reputable outlets, isolated from the main herd until after calving and subsequently subjected to two clear blood tests. Aborting animals or suspicious calvings should be isolated and abortions reported immediately to the district veterinary office.  Aborted material which is extremely infectious should be disposed of safely.  As an incentive to herd owners to combat this disease through improved herd management, all contiguous brucellosis testing during 1997 will be paid for by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions as to what other initiatives should be taken to reverse the current trend are currently taking place between the Department and representatives of the farming bodies and veterinary groups.  These discussions cover all aspects of the brucellosis eradication programmes of recent years including the intensive programmes for herds with active infection, increased bulk milk <Col N="1419" /> ring testing, herd depopulation and other aspects. It is hoped that these discussions will shortly be finalised and the necessary new measures put in place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> The Dáil adjourned at 11.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 5 March 1997.</P>

      <Quest>the reason twins aged 12 years since 26 December 1995, who started secondary school in September 1996, do not qualify for the grant for twins; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 214 together.  Child benefit is currently payable in respect of all children up to age 16 and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education or are physically or mentally challenged.  Child benefit is payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children are born together.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the significant additional costs involved for parents of twins, I made provision in the 1996 budget for increasing the grant in respect of the birth of twins from £200 to £500 and for the introduction of a new grant of £500 which is payable on the twins reaching the age of four years and again on reaching the age of 12 years.</P>
      <P>While the legislation providing for these improvements was not enacted until the beginning of April 1996, it was nevertheless decided to backdate this measure so as to apply to all twins born and those reaching the ages of four and 12 on or after the 1st January 1996.  This ensured that twins who might otherwise have qualified pending the enactment of the Social Welfare Act, 1996, received the grant.  Over 1,400 families have benefited from these improvements at an annual cost of almost £700,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the recommendations contained in various reports, including the Expert Working Group on Integrating Tax and Social Welfare, the Interim Report of the Commission on the Family and the ESRI Report on Poverty in the 1990s, I have targeted this year's improvements in child income support to benefit low income families and in particular, larger families.  This has been achieved by increasing the higher rate of child benefit, payable in respect of third and subsequent children by £5 and in addition, increasing the lower rate of child benefit, payable in respect of the first and second child by £1.  When taken together with the increases provided for in the 1995 and 1996 budgets, the new rates of £30 and £39 represent an increase of 50 per cent in the rate payable for the first two children and 56 per <Col N="1422" /> cent in the higher rate payable in respect of the third child onwards.</P>
    <P>In the context of reducing disincentives to work, priority is being given to FIS as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children.  Accordingly, FIS will be reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages, as at present.  This will significantly increase the supplements payable under the scheme, thereby increasing the rewards from work.</P>
    <P>As a first step towards meeting the commitment in Partnership 2000, this year's budget provides that FIS will be calculated on the basis of gross earnings less PRSI contributions and levies, with effect from June.  Pension contributions will also be deductible.  In addition I have provided for an increase in the income thresholds governing entitlement to FIS by £10 at each point.</P>
    <P>These two measures will mean that virtually all current FIS recipients will get an increase of at least £6 in their weekly payment.  FIS recipients who pay PRSI &mdash; those earning over £80 per week &mdash; and the levies &mdash; those earning over £197 per week &mdash; will receive an extra increase.</P>
    <P>My priorities for the immediate future in relation to the development of child income support involves continuing the process of removing any disincentive effects arising under the current arrangements and working towards a basic income for children.</P>
    <P>Based on present payment rates, the cost of paying double child benefit in respect of twins is estimated to be £8.5 million in a full year.  This cost will increase to £9.1 million, when account is taken of the increased rates of child benefit, which will take effect from September.</P>

      <P>Information is not maintained in my Department of the number of former prisoners who claim unemployment assistance or other social welfare payments on their release.</P>
      <P>Experience in social welfare local offices shows that the majority of prisoners who apply for unemployment assistance on release have been in receipt of payment prior to entering prison and payment is made without delay on the next due pay date.  Where a released prisoner who has had no previous application attends a social welfare local office the case is dealt with expeditiously.  In the majority of cases this means a payment issuing on the next due pay date.  Unemployment assistance is however paid in arrears and where there is immediate need the person is advised to contact the community welfare officer for a payment under the supplementary welfare scheme.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the current procedures which are in place for released prisoners are working well and I am not aware of any problem in this regard.  These procedures are kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 18 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware one of the recommendations of the Special Task Force on Security for the Elderly established in 1996 was that my Department introduce a once-off £2 million grant scheme to provide grant-aid to voluntary organisations in relation to security initiatives for the elderly.  That recommendation was accepted.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, the Minister established a National Advisory Committee, on which the National Council for the Elderly, the Irish Association of Victim Support, the Reach Out Campaign, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Country-women's Association and the Garda Síochána (Neighbourhood Watch) were represented, to advise on a suitable scheme that would ensure that the available funds were targeted on the most vulnerable older people and the best possible value for money was achieved.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the advice of this advisory committee and taking into account the amount of money available and the cost of security equipment, I decided that funding could be provided for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems.</P>
      <P>The scheme was operated on a once off basis and was reviewed by the National Advisory Committee at the end of December 1996.  Expenditure under the scheme in 1996 was £2.562 million.  A total of 528 voluntary organisations received funding with some 14,944 individuals receiving assistance.  It is expected that a similar number of individuals will benefit in 1997.</P>
      <P>Based on the recommendations of the National Advisory Committee and the obvious need to ensure that the most vulnerable older people continue to be assisted the Minister obtained a further £2 million in this year's budget to enable the scheme to continue in 1997.</P>
      <P>The scheme will be advertised shortly in the national papers and will be open for all community and voluntary organisations working with, or providing support for, the elderly to apply.  The scheme will operate on the same basis as in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was decided that to make the funds available through voluntary organisations was the most appropriate way of ensuring that the most vulnerable older people are targeted by the scheme.  I was aware that many voluntary organisations were already providing services such as those covered by the scheme and had developed expertise and local contacts.  Voluntary groups operate close to the ground and are aware of the <Col N="1425" /> greatest need in their communities.  Working with the voluntary sector to deliver these funds to the most needy has the advantage that individual older people need not make an application and can have their needs met with the minimum of administration and without the need for a formal assessment of their circumstances by departmental staff.  I am satisfied that this was the most appropriate way in which to structure my Department's response to the situation.</P>
    <P>Those who can benefit from the scheme include older people, i.e. people aged 65 or over, living alone or living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable. Priority in allocating available funds will be given to the most vulnerable older people.  Vulnerability is difined in terms of advanced age, disability and isolation.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will increase the means threshold for the non-contributory old age pension and in particular the means threshold under the national fuel scheme for contributory old age pensioners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>An old age non-contributory pensioner can have weekly means of up to £6 and still qualify for the maximum rate of pension.  Where a pensioner's weekly means exceed £6, the pension is reduced by £2 for each additional £2 of means. This means that an old age pensioner can have weekly means of up to £68 &mdash; £70 from June &mdash; and still qualify for a reduced rate old age &mdash; non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>During the debate in this House on last year's Social Welfare Bill, I made known that I was taking the opportunity of the introduction of the new one parent family payment and the new disability allowance to commence the process of standardising the provisions of the assessment of capital across all of the various social assistance payments, including old age non-contributory pension on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>This year's Social Welfare Bill provides for an extension of these new arrangements to old age non-contributory pensioners with effect from October.  Under the new provisions, the first £2,000 of capital will be disregarded, the next £20,000, will be assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £22,000, if any, will be assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>This means that a single old age non-contributory pensioner will qualify for the maximum rate of payment where they have capital of up to £6,160.  The equivalent amount of capital for a couple will be £12,320.  An old age non-contributory pensioner will still qualify for a pension where he-she has capital of up to £35,000 in the case of a single person, or £71,100 in the case of a couple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist qualified householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  Applicants must live alone or only with qualified dependants, a carer, a person in receipt of a short-term unemployment assistance payment or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right.  A payment of £5 per week &mdash; £8 in smokeless zones &mdash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks, from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
    <P>People in receipt of a non-contributory pension automatically qualify for payment under the national fuel scheme as their means are already assessed for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>In order to be eligible for assistance under the national fuel scheme the income of a contributory pensioner and his household must be below a certain limit.  In 1995 I increased this income limit from £5 to £10 per week in excess of the maximum contributory pension rate.  Last year, I announced a further £5 increase in the income limit which took effect from October 1996.  This means that a person may have a combined household income of £15 per week over the appropriate Irish maximum contributory pension rate, or savings-investments of £8,000, and still qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>
    <P>A review of the scheme was recently carried out on behalf of my Department by independent consultants to ensure that the scheme is operating effectively and equitably.  A draft of the consultant's report was received a short time ago and any changes to the scheme will be examined when the consultant's final report has been received. Any recommendations arising from the report with financial implications could only be considered in the light of available resources.  I propose to place a copy of the report in the Oireachtas Library and will send a copy to the Deputy when it is available.  I am hopeful the report will enable Deputies to consider the best options in addressing the question of fuel poverty.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the inequality which exists for different participants on the part-time job opportunity programme in view of the fact that a married person is treated differently from a lone parent; the steps, if any, he will take to eliminate this inequality; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the continuing social welfare entitlements of lone parents and married people participating on the part-time job opportunity programme.  The issue he is raising stems from the fact that the contingencies of lone parenthood and unemployment are provided for in differing ways under the social welfare code.  The difference referred to is not based on marriage, but on the basis of one parent or two parent households.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the position is that a lone parent who may be married in receipt of the one-parent family payment may secure a higher net income than people who were previously in receipt of an unemployment payment in cases where earnings from the part-time jobs opportunity programme represent the sole source of income.  This situation arises as a result of specific policy decisions taken to deal with these quite separate contingencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is clear evidence to show that there are high risks of poverty associated with lone parenthood. I would draw the Deputy's attention to the ESRI's report &ldquo;Lone Parents in the Republic of Ireland: Enumeration, Description and Implications for Social Security&rdquo; which contains several references to the risks of poverty associated with lone parenthood.  Specifically, the report states that when the income data for households of different types are analysed to calculate relative risks of poverty, unmarried lone parents emerge as the highest risk category.  The report notes that studies of lone parents in the United Kingdom, the USA and other countries report a pattern of poor socio-economic status, marginal attachment to the labour force and generally low standards of living and concludes that there are <Col N="1428" /> reasons to hypothesise that lone parents in Ireland may also be susceptible to such patterns.</P>
    <P>The part-time job opportunities programme is a pilot scheme which is run by the Conference of Religious in Ireland (CORI).  Overall responsibility for the scheme, which has created some 1,000 part-time jobs for unemployed people in six pilot areas, lies with the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>While participants on the programme are drawn predominantly from the unemployed, places are also made available to lone parents in order to provide them with an avenue back to the active labour force and thereby reduce their dependency on the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Programme participants who were previously unemployed receive a weekly allowance with increase for adult and child dependants where appropriate in lieu of their unemployment payment. In addition, they are free to avail of other work opportunities which may arise in the non-community employment period.</P>
    <P>Lone parents, on the other hand, are not obliged to satisfy the availability for work condition required of unemployed people.  The income they earn under the programme is treated in the same way as any other income they may have and is taken into account as part of their means for the purpose of determining the weekly rate of one-parent family payment payable in their case.</P>
    <P>The one-parent family payment is a payment for both men and women who, for a variety of reasons, are bringing up a child or children on their own.  No distinction is made between married and unmarried persons in this context.  It is available to a person who is unmarried, widowed, separated, a prisoner's spouse, or a person whose marriage has been annulled and who is no longer living with his or her spouse.  It is a means-tested payment which takes account of any income or earnings which the lone parent may have.  The nature of the payment acknowledges the particular difficulties faced by lone parents rearing children on their own.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that my Department is implementing policies aimed at targeting particular groups of recipients for special attention in line with their requirements.  I am satisfied that the difference in treatment between these two categories of social welfare recipients is appropriate in that it reflects the different nature of the contingencies of unemployment and lone parenthood.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I have established a Commission on the Family which is examining how best we can support families, both two parent and one parent families.  I will arrange for a copy of its interim report to be sent to the Deputy for his information.</P>

The figures requested by the Deputy are currently only available up to the end of October 1996, but it is expected that the full expenditure figures for 1996 should be available in April 1997.

      <P>There is an active ongoing control programme covering all areas of the social welfare system and specialist control staff are deployed, in addition to staff carrying out routine reviews, at head office and at local level.</P>
      <P>The programme is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.  New approaches and measures appropriate to each scheme are undertaken on an ongoing basis and when it is considered that they will yield results.</P>
      <P>In relation to lone parents' payments there is a full investigation of circumstances at the point of claim.  During the lifetime of each claim there is a programme of routine reviews and specially targeted control projects aimed at identifying undisclosed means, cohabitation-marriage, incorrect addresses and fraudulent encashment.  During 1996, some 10,000 lone parents had their entitlement to payments reviewed.</P>
      <P>I am determined to ensure that payments are confined to those who are legally entitled to them.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance was introduced in September 1993 as part of my Department's programme of initiatives designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force.  The scheme has proved to be a very worthwhile initiative with 17,000 persons currently in receipt of the weekly allowance. It provides support over a three year period to those wishing to take up employment or self-employment opportunities.  Because of the success of the scheme, the Government has agreed as part of its strategy to tackle unemployment, to increase the number of places from 17,000 to 22,000.  One thousand of these places will be reserved for people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final report on the evaluation of the scheme was made available to my Department in 1996 and this indicated that the scheme was playing <Col N="1431" /> a significant role in enabling the long-term unemployed to take up a job or become self-employed. It found that the levels of deadweight and displacement associated with the scheme are within acceptable levels and are offset by the opportunities provided to the LTU's.  The evaluation of the area allowance enterprise which was also commissioned by my Department at the same time has been received.  Since both schemes are inter-dependent I decided to wait and publish both reports together.  I intend doing so within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>In 1996 the Department of the Taoiseach inherited responsibility for the provision of all-year-round cargo-passenger services in respect of two ferry contracts to the Aran Islands: cargo-passenger service from Galway city &mdash; £550,000 per annum; passenger service from Rossaveal, County Galway &mdash; £60,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with its special responsibility in relation to Gaeltacht islands, in the context of its overall responsibility for the Gaeltacht region, the <Col N="1432" /> Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht last year provided a grant of £45,615 towards the cost of operating the ferry service to Cape Clear, County Cork.  In addition, Údarás na Gaeltachta contributed £31,500 in 1996 towards the cost of operating the ferry service to Tory Island, County Donegal.  It is expected that the level of assistance provided in 1996 in respect of these two ferry services will be maintained this year.</P>
    <P>The report of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on island development clearly identified access services as the priority issue facing offshore island communities.  Mechanisms have been established involving the island themselves, whereby projects to improve islands access have been selected and prioritised at a local level. On the basis of these priority projects, funding amounting to £1 million has been made available from the Exchequer between 1996 and 1997, via the relevant local authorities and on foot of recommendations of the inter-departmental co-ordinating committee.  In addition to access funding, £1 million is being made available this year specifically for priority infrastructural projects on islands.</P>
    <P>Additional proposals to improve access to offshore islands, including subsidies for passenger ferry services, are being considered by the inter-departmental co-ordinating committee in the context of the policy framework set out in the islands report and of available funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>A working group on violence against women was set up by the Government in September 1996.  The main task of the working group is to develop a comprehensive strategy to deal with violence against women with a particular focus on domestic violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Membership of the group is drawn from Government Departments, the Garda, Síochána, health boards and individual experts and practitioners from outside the public sector.  The representatives include a number of individuals who have been involved in the work and management <Col N="1433" /> of refuges including representatives from Women's Aid and Carlow Aid for Women.</P>
    <P>For practical purposes the size of the working group had to be kept at a manageable level. However, in order to provide an opportunity for a wide range of interests, which it was not possible to accommodate on the working group, to put forward their views, a consultative seminar was arranged in November last year.  The Federation of Refuges attended and contributed to the seminar and all the views expressed have been taken on board by the group in their work.  In addition, the chairperson of the working group, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, Minister of State, has had a number of bilateral meetings with various individuals and groups including two meetings with the Federation of Refuges.  The views of the federation and all other interested groups will be fully taken into account by the working group in drawing up its report for Government.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the report will be ready for submission to Government by the end of March.</P>

      <P>It is my understanding that a federal compensation law, the <i>Bundesentschädigungsgesetz,</i> was enacted in Germany in 1956, inviting claims from victims of injustice under the Nazi regime.  The deadline prescribed in that legislation for the receipt of such claims was 1969.  There is also a provision for Jewish claimants who did not meet this deadline to apply for compensation through the Jewish Claims Conference.</P>

      <P>The medical criteria which must be met in order that a disabled person may qualify for tax relief are set out in regulation 3 of the <i>Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994,</i> which came into effect on 1 December 1994. Six different types of disability are listed and a disabled person must meet at least one of them in order to qualify for relief.  It is a matter for the local director of community care and medical officer of health to decide if a person qualifies under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The above mentioned regulations were drawn up following completion of a comprehensive review of the operation of the scheme, established by the Finance Act, 1989.  The review involved wide-ranging consultation with all interested parties, including the organisations representing the disabled.  The medical criteria listed are there to ensure that the costly reliefs of the scheme are targeted at those who are severely and permanently disabled.  There will always be difficulties in defining the categories of disability in a satisfactory manner without opening up the scheme too widely.</P>
      <P>While the Deputy does not indicate what type of impairment he is referring to, his comment will be noted in the context of the periodic review of the scheme.</P>

I also understand that a number of sheriff's warrants in respect of income tax arrears have been issued in this case and that fees referred to relate to these warrants.  The fees in question amount to £154.78 and £53.95 and are legally payable to the sheriff under section 71 of the Finance Act, 1988.</P>
      <P>The moratorium on enforcement action by Revenue in regard to the collection of tax from cross-Border workers was introduced in July 1995 and continued until 31 May 1996.  Since then, normal collection procedures have recommenced for tax liability.</P>

      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle income from pensions is, therefore, reckonable as income for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>I would draw to the Deputy's attention that pensioners are treated more favourably under the Irish income tax code than the generality of taxpayers. The exemption limits for pensioners are significantly higher than those which apply generally. In the coming tax year these will stand at £4,600 single-£9,200 married couple for those aged between 65 years and 74 years and £5,200 single-£10,400 married at 75 years and over as compared with £4,000 single-£8,000 married for other people.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, if taxed under the normal system, a person aged 65 years and over receives a special age allowance in addition to the normal personal allowances.  In the budget I announced the doubling of this allowance to £400 single-£800 married from April 1997.  Pensioners will also benefit from the increase in the personal allowance of £250 single-£500 married and the 1 per cent reduction in the standard tax rate announced in the Budget.  In addition, some pensioners will benefit further from the increase of £500 single-£1,000 married in the standard band.</P>
      <P>The income tax improvements introduced in this year's budget will be of considerable benefit to elderly taxpayers.  The tax position of the elderly will, of course, be borne in mind in future budgets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Deputy may be aware that an EU regulation on novel foods and novel food ingredients was recently adopted by the European Parliament and Council &mdash; Regulation (EC) No. 258/97.  Genetically modified foods come within the scope of novel foods, as set out in Article 1.2 of the regulation.</P>
      <P>Article 8 of the regulation contains provisions relating to the labelling of such novel foodstuffs in certain circumstances.  Essentially, there must be specific labelling to inform the consumer of any characteristic or food property e.g. composition, nutritional value, nutritional effects, intended use of the food which renders a novel food or novel food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient. There must also be specific labelling to advise the consumer of the presence in the novel food or novel food ingredient of material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which may have implications for the health of certain sections of the population; material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which gives rise to ethical concerns; or an organism genetically modified by techniques of genetic modification.</P>
      <P>The Novel Foods Regulation is due to come into effect in all member states in mid-May of this year.  My Department, which has assumed responsibility for the implementation in this country of the regulation, will be participating in discussions at EU level concerning the practicalities of the implementation process.</P>
      <P>Finally, I wish to point out to the Deputy that the labelling requirements for novel foodstuffs as prescribed by the above mentioned EU regulation are additional to the general food labelling provisions which are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>

      <Quest>further to his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 55 of 20 February 1997, if he will select postal district eight on a pilot basis to operate a scheme which will ensure that each pharmacy in that district will dispense methadone to an equal number of clients from the General Medical Service and from general practitioners on a private basis in order to alleviate the impact on any one area.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Methadone can be prescribed through the General Medical Services for medical card holders, or on a private prescription for those attending a general practitioner on a private basis.  At present it is not necessary to designate the name of a pharmacy on the prescription and <Col N="1444" /> any pharmacist can dispense methadone on foot of a properly presented prescription.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is in the process of implementing a number of Methadone Protocol schemes, where patients are provided with treatment cards which contain the name of the doctor and the name of the pharmacist who are dealing with that patient.  In this way the board is working towards involving a number of additional doctors and pharmacists in the provision of services to drug misusers.  At present just over 300 people have been provided with these treatment cards and are being treated by 35 general practitioners in 42 pharmacies, under these schemes.</P>
      <P>My Department will consult with the Eastern Health Board on the feasibility of carrying out a pilot scheme in postal district 8.  However, under such schemes, treatment and dispensing of methadone in any given area will only be to people living within that specific catchment area. Therefore, private patients, or indeed General Medical Services patients from other postal districts, may continue to frequent a particular pharmacy in that area in large numbers, so until such time as the Methadone Protocol Scheme extends city-wide, with all persons holding treatment cards and attending local facilities, the problems to which the Deputy refers will not be alleviated.</P>
      <P>It is intended to provided treatment cards to all drug misusers who come into contact with the Eastern Health Board services, or to the patients of general practitioners who are registered on the central treatment list.  This scheme will take time to be implemented in a properly controlled fashion, but it is expected that significant progress will be made on its implementation during 1997 and that all persons on the central treatment list, over 1,900 at present, and others who come into contact with services during 1997 will be provided with such a card and, therefore, have their local pharmacy designated to dispense.</P>
      <P>In its policy document on drug abuse, which was published in October 1996, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has encouraged all pharmacists to participate in methadone dispensing and that dispensing of methadone should ideally be for patients who come from the local community where the prescriber should be a local general practitioner or from the drug clinic in the area.  It has also recommended that pharmacists should limit the number of patients to whom they will dispense and that patients should be on the central treatment list.  I welcome these recommendations which strongly endorse national policy and the strategy being implemented by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review committee which has been established in my Department to examine the role of general practitioners and pharmacists in the provision of services for drug misusers is looking at present practice in relation to prescribing and dispensing of methadone.  The committee includes representation from the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Eastern Health Board.  The <Col N="1445" /> report of this committee will be available to me in early April and I look forward to its recommendations on how the present system can be expanded quickly, yet with the controls necessary to guarantee a network of outlets at local level where methadone is prescribed and dispensed to drug misusers.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The health board orthodontic services are currently being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan.  The action plan provides for the phased improvement of orthodontic treatment services through a consultant-led orthodontic service in each health board.  The <Col N="1446" /> Southern Health Board's consultant orthodontist was appointed from 1 September 1992.  The service is provided from St. Finbar's Hospital, Cork, with outlying satellite clinics in the board's community care areas.</P>
      <P>A primary task of the consultant is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to sub-consultant level for health board dental staff.  This enables the board to provide a greatly increased volume of service and a service of high quality. There are at present five dental teams attached to the orthodontic unit at St. Finbar's working under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant.  Approximately 1,970 patients are at present receiving treatment.</P>
      <P>Because of the high cost of providing orthodontic treatment, it is important that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severely affected/handicapped.  Patients are, therefore, assessed for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and placed on waiting lists in descending order of severity/ handicap.  In some areas there are large numbers of children on the waiting lists and there can be long waiting periods for orthodontic treatment.  I accept that such waiting periods are undesirable.</P>
      <P>In the Southern Health Board the waiting period for assessment for orthodontic treatment can be up to two years and the waiting time for treatment following completion of the assessment can be up to 18 months.</P>
      <P>Further developments of the orthodontic services in the Southern Health Board will be considered in the context of priorities determined by the board.</P>

    <P>In common with other community drugs schemes, the increase in expenditure under the drugs refund scheme arises in the main from an increase in the number of persons claiming under the scheme and also an increase in the cost of medicines due to the prescribing of newer more effective and more expensive drugs for the treatment of, for example, peptic ulcer disease and asthma.  Such therapies are examples of the advances achieved in the treatment of particular conditions which are reducing the need for people to be treated in hospital and are allowing people to maintain a higher quality of life in the community.</P>
    <P>As part of the agreement entered into with community pharmacists, new arrangements are being introduced this year to provide for greater accountability in the operation of this scheme. Also, discussions are being held with the Irish Medical Organisation to explore ways of encouraging cost-effective prescribing in the community drugs schemes.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Midland Health Board is responsible for the management of services and deployment of staff at St. Loman's Psychiatric Hospital, Mullingar. Current personnel policy for the health services provides that health agencies which are managing resources within their allocations may fill non-consultant posts without recourse to the Department.</P>
      <P>A total of 27 temporary nurses are available on a panel which serves St. Loman's Psychiatric Services and Mental Handicap Services at Lough Sheever Centre, Mullingar.  Sixteen of the nurses on this panel provide services in the psychiatric services.</P>
      <P>No staff, permanent or temporary, are currently required to work overtime at St. Loman's Hospital.</P>
      <P>As previously stated to the Deputy, a panel for the filling of vacant nursing posts in the Longford/Westmeath Mental Health Services has been extended to 4 April 1997.  However, it has been agreed between nursing unions and management, in the context of the recent nursing dispute, that temporary employment in the service should be reduced to the minimum level consistent with operational requirements.  Under the revised offer arising from the recent Labour Court recommendation, 2,000 nursing posts are to be converted from temporary to whole-time permanent status by means of confined competition. This factor is currently being taken into consideration in the filling of further permanent nursing posts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I intend to take Questions Nos. 72 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, the provision of long-term care for the elderly and the physically disabled in the Tullamore area is a matter for the Midland Health Board.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board informs me that the Consolation Nursing Home was purchased by the board from the Sisters of the Holy Family who were anxious that the premises would be retained for public use.  Due to a decline in the number of vocations the Sisters were unable to continue to provide a nursing home service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building consists of a single storey block which can accommodate up to 25 residents and a vacant two storey dwelling house.  It is located in a prime location area and is adjacent to Tullamore General Hospital which provides the regional orthopaedic and ENT services.  The board states that it does not have a centre for the young physically disabled and that these patients are inappropriately placed at present.  The Consolation Nursing Home premises provided an ideal <Col N="1453" /> opportunity to meet the needs of this group.  The board put this proposal to my Department which provided an allocation of £280,000 for the purchase of the home.</P>
    <P>The board recognises that the private nursing home sector provides a valuable service in the context of the overall &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of services available for the elderly and this is recognised in the board's own strategy for the elderly which anticipates an increase in the level of residential services to be provided by this sector.  In the case of the Consolation Nursing Home, the Sisters were not in a position to provide a nursing home service and the board states that it does not have the funding at present to provide additional inpatient services for the elderly.  The board always intended to phase out the nursing home service and introduce the new service for the physically disabled under 65 years.  The board also states that it is not economically viable to operate an independent unit of 22 beds for the elderly.</P>
    <P>The board intends to complete the phasing out of the premises as a nursing home during the second quarter of 1997 and to commence the process of establishing the service for the physically disabled.  The board is very conscious of the worries of the elderly residents of the Consolation Home and has stressed that these patients will not be moved to the board's homes in Mountmellick and Athlone.  The board states that suitable arrangements must be made for the residents and that these arrangements must be acceptable to the residents.  I understand that a meeting is to take place tomorrow, 5 March, between the chief executive officer and the Offaly members of the board to consider all aspects of the issues involved.  The chief executive officer has assured me that the transition from the existing service to the new service will be handled humanely and with full consideration for the welfare of all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose taking Questions Nos. 75 to 78, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is responsible for the delivery of health services, including mental health services and services to persons with a mental handicap, in Dublin.  Acute in-patient beds for those with mental illness in Dublin north <Col N="1455" /> city and county, for those with a mental handicap, together with services for the elderly, are provided on the campus of St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane. In addition, a range of other services &mdash; outpatient clinics, day hospitals, day care centres, group homes and a vocational and sheltered employment facility &mdash; are also provided.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years substantial upgrading works have been carried out on the hospital campus. Between 1994 and 1995 a total of £500,000 was spent on upgrading which included a special capital allocation of £350,000 made available by my Department.  In 1996 my Department provided a further £250,000 while the board provided £60,000 from its own resources which enabled further substantial upgrading to be carried out in all patient care areas throughout the hospital.  The bulk of this funding was expended on the upgrading of accommodation for persons with a mental handicap on the hospital campus.  Further upgrading is in hand, including the upgrading of fire safety arrangements.</P>
    <P>Inappropriate restraints, seclusion or padded cells as suggested by the Deputy, are not employed at the hospital.  Restraints on patients are prescribed by medical staff for specific reasons and for specific lengths of time and are used in accordance with legislation and accepted medical practices.</P>
    <P>Monitoring of the standards of care provided for patients in psychiatric hospitals is carried out by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  The inspector carries out annual inspections of all public psychiatric hospitals, including St. Ita's Hospital. In his report for 1995, which I have just published, the inspector notes the enhancement of the overall appearance of clinical areas and also the improvement in staff morale in the hospital but acknowledges that further improvement in standards is necessary.  The hospital is also visited by members of the Eastern Health Board and is inspected by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and An Bord Altranais.</P>
    <P>My Department recently approved funding for the refurbishment of accommodation at Beaumont Hospital to enable acute in-patient psychiatric services to be provided at the hospital as soon as possible.  It is the board's long-term objective to provide all acute psychiatry for the catchment population at Beaumont Hospital.  This development, coupled with the development of a localised community-based service, means that admissions to large psychiatric hospitals such as St. Ita's will be curtailed.</P>
    <P>The board is a major provider of services to persons with a mental handicap.  It provides a wide range of community-based services, including day and residential facilities, in addition to the St. Joseph's Mental Handicap Service at St. Ita's Hospital which provides specialist services for persons with severe and profound mental handicap and those with challenging behaviour.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of my Department that inappropriately placed patients with a mental handicap <Col N="1456" /> should be transferred to more suitable care settings. The development of community facilities for such persons generally requires the transfer of some staff from the hospital to the community.  In the case of persons with a mental handicap in St. Ita's Hospital, the transfer of inappropriately placed patients has taken place at the same time as services for the remaining patients have been augmented.  Additional revenue funding of £265,000 was provided in the period 1993 to 1996 to increase staffing levels at the hospital, to provide multi-disciplinary support and to enhance services to persons with a mental handicap who are also behaviourally disturbed.  A further £100,000 has been provided this year.  This funding is over and above that provided for those transferring from the hospital campus.  Those remaining on the campus also benefit from the increased staff/patient ratio resulting from the overall reduction in numbers.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the staff at St. Ita's Hospital have the necessary equipment, materials and physical resources to carry out their jobs effectively.</P>
    <P>The board's development plan for St. Ita's Hospital is being implemented on a phased basis. Significant progress has been made, including substantial upgrading of the mental handicap facilities, improved staffing levels in the services, rehabilitation training and placement of patients in more appropriate accommodation both in the community and on the hospital campus.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended that a special capital fund be created for the replacement of some of the existing accommodation for persons with a mental handicap currently being cared for in psychiatric hospitals and that this programme should be managed by a special unit to be set up within my Department.  The commission was especially anxious that St. Ita's should be among the first to benefit under this programme because of the large number of persons with a mental handicap who are accommodated there.</P>
    <P>The Government decided, on publication of the report, to establish at monitoring committee comprising representatives of Government Departments, the social partners, organisations representing people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers to monitor the implementation of the commission's recommendations, including the health care and employment recommendations which are the responsibility of my Department.  This is subject to the submission to Government, in the first instance, of a programme of measures to be implemented, which will be drawn up by an interdepartmental task force on which my Department is represented. This task force is due to submit its detailed action plan by 30 June 1997.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department recently met with the Eastern Health Board to begin discussions on the measures which could be taken this year to continue the programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from St. Ita's Hospital to more appropriate care settings now <Col N="1457" /> that the 1997 allocation for new developments is available.</P>
    <P>This would include the transfer of persons with a mental handicap from St. Ita's Hospital to more appropriate care settings in a number of locations, including the former Madonna House complex which was acquired last year by the Eastern Health Board for its mental handicap services.  The necessary refurbishment work is well advanced and this accommodation will be coming on stream towards the middle of this year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): St. Vincent's Hospital provides a 24 hour, seven days a week, all year round accident and emergency service.  The staffing level at present of a consultant, three registrars, eight casualty officers and 24 nursing staff is considered by the hospital authorities to be sufficient to meet the demands of their accident and emergency department. These medical staff are assigned exclusively to the accident and emergency service and do not work in other parts of the hospital.</P>
      <P>The method of operation in accident and emergency departments is to accord priority to those most in need.  In the normal course, this means that those with less serious complaints have to wait from time to time while higher priority cases are being treated.  Experience in the provision of accident and emergency services has shown that a significant number of those who attend could be treated as effectively and far quicker by their family doctor.  This is why the current public education campaign on the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments was launched. The thrust behind the campaign is to keep accident and emergency departments clear for recognised urgent emergencies.</P>

      <P>Some 35 general practitioners are involved in methadone Protocol schemes, prescribing methadone to 300 patients.  These schemes were initiated in March 1996 and involve each patient having a treatment card, which is lodged in a specific pharmacy for the duration of treatment. The Eastern Health Board expects to extend this treatment card to all people involved in methadone treatment in the course of 1997.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware, under the boarding-out scheme, frail or dependent elderely people who cannot live in their own homes or find accommodation with relatives may be boarded out by the health board in family homes. Boarding-out differs from welfare, nursing or long-term care provision in that the accommodation is provided for a client of a health board by a private home owner who has entered into an agreement with the health board to provide accommodation and allied services.  A full assessment is carried out on each resident and careful assessment is carried out on each carer by the geriatric assessment committee.  The maximum number of persons to be boarded out in a dwelling is six.  The health board pays a grant equivalent to half the current rate of the non-contributory old age pension per resident to the carer.  In addition, it is recommended that the person being boarded out pays the carer half the amount of their old age pension per week.  The boarding-out regulations came into effect on 1 September 1993.</P>
      <P>Five health boards are currently operating the scheme.  The relevant health boards and the numbers of people being accommodated are as follows.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Transport of people with disabilities to health centres attended by them in connection with their disability is provided either directly by the health boards or by voluntary agencies providing services on behalf of the boards.  Funding for the provision of transport is available either by way of capital grants or lottery funding.  The policy in relation to the development of these services is to ensure, where possible, that the services are community based so as to minimise the time spent in travelling to and from centres.</P>
      <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities was published on 18 November.  The commission's report recommends the development of a wide range of economic and social services for people with disabilities, including the transport needs of people with disabilities, both public transport and transport to health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided, on publication of the report, to establish a monitoring committee comprising representatives of Departments, the social partners, organisations representing people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers to monitor the implementation of the commission's recommendations.  This is subject to the submission to Government, in the first instance, of a programme of measures to be implemented, which will be drawn up by an interdepartmental task force on which my Department and the Department of Transport, Energy and <Col N="1462" /> Communications are represented.  This task force is due to submit its detailed action plan by 30 June 1997.</P>
    <P>Funding will continue to be made available to develop the transport services for people with disabilities availing of the health services, as appropriate, in line with the recommendations of the commission.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities are currently being examined by an interdepartmental task force which will draw up a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities, based on the commission's report.  Until the Government has had the opportunity to consider this plan, it would be premature to seek funding in so far as implementation of the recommendations is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Government did allocate £500,000 towards disability in this year's budget. The provision of £200,000 from this figure, combined with £100,000 already provided for in my Department's Estimate, means that £300,000 will be available to fund the work of the interim Council for the Status of People with Disabilities in 1997.  It is intended to use the remainder to <Col N="1463" /> institute a number of innovative projects aimed at promoting equality for people with disabilities as well as meeting the costs of both the monitoring committee being established to monitor implementation of the commission's recommendations and follow-up administrative costs associated with the work of the commission.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I.

      <P>Where there is a negative assessment of the implications for the site of the proposed development, a local authority or An Bord Pleanála may decide to grant planning permission only for reasons of overriding public interest.</P>
      <P>In the case of a site hosting a habitat defined as a &ldquo;priority habitat&rdquo; in the EU habitats directive, the only considerations of overriding interest shall be: those relating to human health or public safety; beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment; or further to an opinion from the European Commission, other imperative reasons of overriding public interest.</P>

      <P>Farmers and other landowners who suffer losses in income as a result of the designation of special areas of conservation, SACs, can seek compensation through one of two alternative schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>Good progress is being made in the development of waste recycling and the achievement of national recycling targets.  The various recycling grant schemes which have been operated by my Department since 1989 have contributed significantly to the substantial expansion of recycling activities and infrastructure which has occurred in that period.  The network of recycling bring-centres has increased from some 60 sites in 1988 to over 400 sites in 1996 and is still expanding. The recycling rate for waste packaging has increased from 10.3 per cent in 1993 to 15.6 per cent in 1995.  A major stimulus to the recycling of packaging waste is expected from the recently published draft Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations and from the establishment and mobilisation of the industry led REPAK scheme.</P>
      <P>Financial assistance is available under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-1999 for the provision of recycling infrastructure and for the carrying out of waste management strategy studies by regional and local authorities.  Grant assistance of some £2.25 million has already been allocated.  This includes grants for recycling facilities in the south Dublin area and the development of a joint waste management strategy by the four Dublin local authorities. Consideration of proposals for segregated collection systems for household waste will form an integral part of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> Kerbside Dublin is a private sector initiative under the auspices of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  While Kerbside has received regular grant assistance from my Department and the Dublin local authorities, extension of its services would be a matter for its management board.</P>
    <P>The comparative costs of different waste management options, including recycling, have been analysed in the report &ldquo;The Economics of Solid Waste Management in Ireland&rdquo; which was commissioned by my Department and published by the Economic and Social Research Institute in November 1995.  A copy of the report is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>From 1 January 1997 to date, 67 applications for group scheme grants in respect of the provision or upgrading of water supplies have been received in my Department.  Details of these are given in <Col N="1473" /> Table 1.  The total number of unapproved schemes in my Department is 1,159, including the 67 proposals received this year, but an indeterminate number of these could no longer be considered to be live proposals.  A total of 147 schemes have reached an advanced stage of planning &mdash; the details are in Table 2.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements for the devolution of responsibility for the administration of the group scheme programme, the capital provision for group scheme grants in 1997 will be allocated between local authorities having regard, among other things, to existing commitments on foot of approvals issued by my Department. Some 250 schemes have been approved to go to construction this year.</P>

      <P>I have recently published draft regulations which provide for the imposition of obligations on suppliers of packaging and packaged goods to take specified measures to facilitate the collection and recycling of packaging waste.  The draft regulations also provide for the approval by the Minister for the Environment of schemes for the recovery of packaging waste.  Suppliers who are participating satisfactorily in an approved scheme will be exempt from the main requirements of the regulations.  I propose to bring the regulations into effect in May 1997 following the obligatory period of three months consultation with the European Union.  I expect that the REPAK scheme, which is at an advanced stage of mobilisation, will be submitted without delay for approval under the regulations.  The detailed contractual and other arrangements between REPAK and recycling firms will, however, continue to be a matter for negotiation and agreement between the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial or resource teachers to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Remedial teacher posts and resource teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  I have also allocated an extra 39 resource teacher posts at primary level bringing the total number in place to 46.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources to this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage. As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>The assessment of taskwork in the case of leaving certificate applied students has been postponed because of industrial action by members of the Public Service Executive Union in pursuit of a staffing demand.  This action involves members of that union refusing to carry out work related to vacant posts and to co-operate with any new work or scheme which they deem to require additional resources.  Industrial action of this nature has the affect of slowing the flow of work to a greater or lesser extent.  In the Athlone offices the principal effect has been delays in the completion of administrative processes relating to the leaving certificate applied programme.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the disappointment and disruption caused to schools, teachers, students and examiners by this postponement.  It is intended to reschedule the assessment of taskwork at the earliest opportunity.  Arrangements for the rescheduling of the assessments will be undertaken in a flexible manner following consultation with the parties concerned.  My Department is continuing to pursue all options open to it in seeking a resolution to this difficult industrial relations problem.</P>

      <P>I take it the questions relate to the devolved grant scheme under which national schools will receive a basic grant of £2,000, plus £9 per pupil, to carry out improvement works to their buildings, services and furnishings.  The current position is that some modifications are being made to the computer programme devised for payment of the grant.  However, arising out of industrial action in my Department by members of the Public Service Executive Union, it is likely that there will be a delay in the payment.  Consequently, I am not yet in a position to say when the grant will be paid.  However, I can say that every effort is being made to resolve this dispute and to pay the money as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's White Paper on Education outlines a policy for the expansion of the schools psychological service at both levels.  It is envisaged that the provision and development of psychology services for schools will be a function of the education boards.  This development will take place on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>My Department's provision of a psychological service to primary schools began in 1990 with a pilot project in two designated areas.  The designated areas were West Tallaght-Clondalkin and South Tipperary.  The purpose of the project was to gain experience of the development and provision of such a service prior to consideration of an extension to primary schools in other areas. Four additional psychologists were employed on temporary contracts in the pilot project.  The project completed its pilot phase in September 1993, and was put on a permanent basis in the two areas in early 1994.  The four psychologists took up permanent posts in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further ten psychologists were appointed by my Department in 1995 in order to allow for the <Col N="1496" /> expansion of the psychological service to primary schools.  These psychologists were assigned, as a matter of priority, to national schools serving dis advantaged areas in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  In addition, the national schools in the original pilot project continue to have access to the psychological service.  Any further expansion will take place in the context of Government decisions on public sector numbers.</P>
    <P>In those areas where there is a psychology service provided to primary schools by my Department, pupils, parents and teachers have access to the service through the school principal.  The psychologists carry out assessments as the resources of time and personnel allow.  In addition, they engage in a certain amount of casework with those pupils and parents who would benefit from counselling in the school situation.</P>
    <P>The school's psychologists give priorty to pupils whose difficulties are perceived to be acute, and to not operate a formal waiting list. Such pupils may therefore be seen without undue delay.  Where necessary, the schools psychologists refer pupils to the appropriate specialist agencies of the health authorities for further assessment and treatment.</P>

A nationwide network of 40 teachers, capable of supporting the programme on a part-time basis, remains in place.  The network is targeting, in particular, those schools which currently are not teaching the programme.  I remain firmly committed to improving the coverage of the programme within the education system and to ensuring that adequate training is provided for teachers, parents and members of school boards.</P>

      <P>The allocation of Garda personnel is the responsibility of the Garda authorities and they have informed me that over the period 1991 to 1997 the strength of Garda personnel attached to Tallaght Garda station has risen by 32 members with the current strength at the station being 140, all ranks, as of 31 January 1997.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities also inform me that foot and mobile patrols are regularly carried out in the Tallaght area and &ldquo;Operation Dóchas&rdquo; is in operation in the area.  In addition local patrols are augmented, as required, by the divisional task force unit based in Crumlin.  The Garda authorities point out that the community policing unit, which is based in Tallaght, as well as patrolling the area, regularly liaise with the local residents and the business community.</P>
      <P>While the Garda authorities are aware that the opening of the new Tallaght hospital, together with other construction projects in the locality, will significantly add to the development of the greater Tallaght area, they are nonetheless satisfied that the current policing needs of the Tallaght area are being adequately met with the present deployment of resources given the expansion of these policing arrangements over the past six years.  I am assured by the Garda authorities, however, that all policing arrangements for the Tallaght area are kept under continual review and adjustments made as necessary.</P>

      <P>At its meeting on 11 February last, the Government agreed on the establishment by my Department of a working group on illegal and harmful use of the Internet.  The terms of reference of the group, as approved by the Government, are as follows: to identify the nature and extent of the issues surrounding the illegal and harmful use of the Internet; to prioritise such Internet issues with particular reference to the need to address the issue of child pornography in the short-term; to examine and assess the current approaches both domestically and internationally to addressing Internet issues, in relation to those issues which can be domestically addressed, to identify the legal, technical and structural problems which arise and to make specific recommendations for their resolution <Col N="1501" /> in terms of short, medium and long-term proposals as appropriate and in relation to those issues which require resolution in an international context, to make recommendations which will inform policy in this regard.</P>
      <P>The inaugural meeting of the group, chaired by an official from my Department, took place on 25 February and included representatives from Government Departments, UNICEF, service providers and from relevant academic and research areas.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the area being studied by the group is highly complex and has a major international dimension.  There are no quick and easy solutions available for the many difficult legal, technical and structural issues to be addressed.  Rather than commit the group to deadlines which would jeopardise their brief, the terms of reference reflect the need to identify, quantify and prioritise the various issues and evaluate &ldquo;best practice&rdquo;, particularly in other countries.  This will inevitably take some time to accomplish.  I, should however, draw the Deputy's attention to the specific direction being given to the group regarding the prioritisation of issues relating to child pornography.</P>

      <P>The only CCTV schemes currently sanctioned for funding by my Department are the Temple Bar scheme, which has been operational since October 1995, O'Connel Street, Dublin, Tralee and Finglas. Work on the O'Connel Street system is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed shortly.  Preliminary work has commenced on the Tralee and Finglas systems.</P>
      <P>An advisory committee has been established within the Garda Síochána to examine all applications and proposals for CCTV systems as an aid to policing.  I am informed that to date applications have been received from 21 locations, including Clondalkin, for the installation of CCTV schemes and that these will be considered by the advisory committee with a view to determining priority.  I should point out that the extension of Garda CCTV systems to other areas will have implications for Garda personnel and resources and must, of course, be viewed in the context of overall policing operations.  These CCTV systems must be carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures.</P>
      <P>However, before any such schemes can receive public funding they will be subject to specific technical and procedural standards set by the Garda and will be subject to open tendering in accordance with the normal public procurement procedures.  While I have provided additional funding this year for the expansion of CCTV systems, the commitment to the O'Connell Street, Finglas and Tralee schemes limits the opportunity to fund further systems for other areas this year. However, the Deputy may wish to note that the maximum level of funding which I propose to provide for the installation of any Garda CCTV scheme would be in the region of 50 per cent of the total cost of the project, the balance of which would have to be met by commercial-local interests in the proposed location.</P>

      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities. The Garda BSE operation commenced on 28 March 1996, following the Government decision on the total prohibition of the importation of beef and beef products.  An operational plan was drawn up by the Garda authorities to fulfil the obligations of the Garda Síochána in relation to the enforcement of the Government decision.</P>
      <P>Garda involvement in this operation has been kept under continuous review by the Garda authorities and adjustments have been made as necessary to the number of static and mobile patrols of the Border area.  These have been in response to the changing policing requirements of the operation and were made in consultation with my own Department as well as the Departments of Agriculture and Defence and Customs and Excise officials.  The most recent phase of the operation commenced on 24 February 1997 and involves a rolling checkpoint strategy.  I understand from the Garda authorities that while the number of static checkpoints along the Border has been decreased the total number of checkpoints will, in reality, be maintained.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that this new strategy will prove to be a more effective deterrent overall against the illegal importation of beef and beef products across the Border.  However, they have assured me that the situation will continue to be kept under review and any necessary changes made.</P>

      <P>Since coming to office I have had a review of the insurability position of share fishermen and women for social insurance carried out in the Department.  Taking account of the working arrangements which apply to this group of workers, and the ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Agegate case, the legal advice available to the Department confirms that those persons who are employed under contract of service conditions are insurable at the ordinary rate and are eligible for all benefits.  This applies under the present legislation and therefore amending legislation is not required.</P>
      <P>Persons who are employed under contract for service conditions, such as self-employed owner-skippers of boats or partners are insurable at Class S.</P>
      <P>The situation was explained to representatives of the fishing industry whom I met on 14 January last.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements come into effect immediately and sharefishermen who are not owners or owners-skippers should apply to their local social welfare inspector if they have a claim for unemployment assistance or unemployent benefit, disability benefit or occupational injury benefit, and their claims will be processed as quickly as possible.  Because of the long and complex history of this issue, there are a number of issues with regard to eligibility which have to be resolved and a small number of cases may have to be referred to scope section of the Department for a ruling.</P>
      <P>I have established a small working group in the Department to address these issues and I expect its report within weeks.</P>
      <P>Any person who wishes to have a ruling regarding the insurability of his or her employment should apply to the scope section of the Department.</P>

      <P>As set out in my reply to Questions Nos. 25 and 74 on 27 November 1996, the Department of Social Welfare and the Pensions Board have jointly launched a national pensions policy initiative.</P>
      <P>I would again like to stress that there is no danger to anyone's Social Welfare pension entitlement.  However, the issue of our ageing population is one which cannot be ignored. Therefore, I have put it firmly on the agenda so that all the options are explored and the necessary decisions taken and implemented in good time so that the retirement years of people in the future are safeguarded and secured.</P>
      <P>The first part of the pensions initiative has been completed with the launch of a consultation document last month which now forms the basis for general discussion among all interested parties, the social partners and the general public. Responses to this document have been invited with a deadline for receipt of end May 1997.  It is intended to hold a pensions seminar in June.  The target date for the completion of this pensions initiative is next autumn.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare has also formally accepted a recommendation from the Final Report of the National Pensions Board (1993), that an actuarial review of the projected long-term costs of pensions under social welfare be carried out every five years.  It is hoped to have the first actuarial review completed by mid year.</P>
      <P>I believe that this is a very important time for pensions policy.  We need to look comprehensively and very carefully, over a relatively short time frame, at the present position.  We then need to make decisions and, most importantly, to carry those decisions through so that we face up to, and deal with, the medium and long-term issues so as to ensure that the living standards of future generations of pensioners are safeguarded.</P>
      <P>I believe that these initiatives are important first steps to achieving this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 207, 208 and 216 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware one of the recommendations of the special task force on security for the elderly established in 1996 was that my Department introduce a once-off £2 million grant scheme to provide grant-aid to voluntary organisations in relation to security initiatives for the elderly.  That recommendation was accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, the Minister established a National Advisory Committee, on which the <Col N="1509" /> National Council for the Elderly, the Irish Association of Victim Support, the Reach Out Campaign, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Country Women's Association and the Garda Síochána (Neighbourhood Watch) were represented, to advise on a suitable scheme that would ensure that the available funds were targeted on the most vulnerable older people and the best possible value for money was achieved.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the advice of this advisory committee and taking into account the amount of money available and the cost of security equipment, I decided that funding could be provided for:</P>
    <P>Small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and</P>
    <P>socially monitored alarm systems.</P>
    <P>The scheme was operated on a once off basis and was reviewed by the National Advisory Committee at the end of December 1996.  Expenditure under the scheme in 1996 was £2.562 million.  A total of 428 voluntary organisations received funding with some 14,944 individuals receiving assistance.  It is expected that a similar number of individuals will benefit in 1997.</P>
    <P>Based on the recommendation of the national advisory committee and the obvious need to ensure that the most vulnerable older people continue to be assisted the Minister obtained a further £2 million in this year's budget to enable the scheme to continue in 1997.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be advertised shortly in the national papers and will be open for all community and voluntary organisations working with, or providing support for, the elderly to apply.  The scheme will operate on the same basis as it did in 1996.</P>
    <P>It was decided that to make the funds available through voluntary organisations was the most appropriate way of ensuring that the most vulnerable older people are targeted by the scheme.  I was aware that many voluntary organisations were already providing services such as those covered by the scheme and had developed expertise and local contacts.  Voluntary groups operate close to the ground and are aware of the greatest need in their communities.  Working with the voluntary sector to deliver these funds to the most needy has the advantage that individual older people need not make an application and can have their needs met with the minimum of administration and without the need for a formal assessment of their circumstances by Departmental staff.  I am satisfied that this was the most appropriate way in which to structure my Department's response to the situation.</P>
    <P>Those who can benefit from the scheme include older people &mdash; those aged 65 or over &mdash; living along or living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable. Priority in allocating available funds will be given <Col N="1510" /> to the most vulnerable older people.  Vulnerability is defined in terms of advanced age, disability and isolation.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain disabled persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of December last year the numbers availing of the scheme totalled 8,476.</P>
      <P>In last January's budget, the Minister announced that provision is being made for the payment of an additional amount equivalent to 50 per cent of their existing entitlement to carers who are providing full-time care and attention to more than one person.  This measure will come into effect from next June.</P>
      <P>Statistics are not maintained by my Department as to the number of carers who are providing two or more people with full-time care but it has been estimated that it may be as many as one in four.</P>

      <P>The 1995 budget provided a sum of £450,000 for training and other forms of technical assistance to participants on the back the work allowance scheme.  In 1996 this amount was increased to £600,000 and this year, due to the anticipated significant increase in the number of recipients of the allowance, a sum of £1.2 million has been made available.  This support is mainly for back to work allowance recipients engaging in self-employment projects, many of whom are unable to provide for the following requirements due to financial constraints: assistance in preparing a business plan/marketing strategy; start your own business courses and business skills training; help with business accounts; advertising and printing; preparation of submissions for capital funding etc.; and preparation for interviews and CVs for those opting for employment.  Grants are made available following consultation with the Department's local job facilitator.  The number of recipients assisted by the back to work allowance <Col N="1511" /> scheme in 1996 was 2,163.  The grants are paid to the supplier of the relevant service and not directly to the recipient.  I am satisfied that this form of assistance is making a signficant contribution to the sustainability of businesses set up under the back to work scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a number of grant schemes which concentrate on support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work.  The individual grant schemes which support such voluntary and community activity are the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations, scheme of grants for locally-based women's groups, scheme of grants for locally-based men's groups and scheme of grants for lone parents.  These are all once-off grant schemes.</P>
      <P>In 1996, a total of 2,663 applications for funding from voluntary and community groups were received by my Department under the various schemes and some 1,333 groups were allocated grants amounting to a total of almost £2.5 million. In general, applications which were not successful did not satisfy the criteria of the schemes and/or were the responsibility of other statutory agencies. Unsuccessful applicants were notified in writing by the various regional offices of my Department.</P>
      <P>Details of all grants paid under the various schemes in 1996, and in previous years, are available in the Library for the information of Members.</P>

      <Quest>the number of social welfare recipients which are affected by the 1953 rule of the Department whereby their contributions prior to 1953 are not taken into consideration when assessing contributions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>To qualify for the old age (contributory) pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions, or 24 in the case of a retirement pension registered since January 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I announced in my budget that in future, people who pay PRSI, but who currently fail to <Col N="1512" /> qualify for the present minimum old age (contributory) pension, will receive a contributory pension as long as their yearly average number of contributions is between ten and 20.  A yearly average between 15 and 19 will give entitlement to a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 will give entitlement to a pension of 50 per cent.  This measure, which will be introduced in November next, will mean that people with broken or sporadic contribution records will now qualify for a contributory pension, as long as they have at least 260 paid contributions.  Social insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account for old age (contributory) pension and the new <i>pro rata</i> pension in satisfying the first two conditions but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is relevant to point out that prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable.  These were: national health insurance, widows and orphans pension and unemployment insurance contributions. These contributions gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
    <P>The old age (contributory) pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of that pension.  However, as a concession and to enable persons reaching pension age at that time to qualify immediately for a contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1953 were taken into account in calculating a person's entitlement to pension.  These transitional arrangements operated until 1973.  From that date contributions paid prior to 1953 were no longer counted for the purposes of satisfying the yearly average test.  However, they are still reckonable for the other two conditions.</P>
    <P>Assuming that the Deputy's question effectively refers to the number of people who would be entitled to a contributory pension if insurance paid prior to 1953 was taken into account in calculating the yearly average, this information is not available.</P>

      <Quest>the number of social welfare recipients which are not in receipt of full benefit due to gaps in their social welfare contributions, in particular recipients affected by the rule which prevented employers deducting related social insurance in the 1960s and 1970s if the employee was earning £750 or more per year; if the employee in such circumstances was officially notified by the Department that they could make a voluntary contribution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Special <i>pro rata</i> pensions were introduced in 1988 for certain persons who failed to qualify for contributory pension, because they were out <Col N="1513" /> of insurance for periods prior to 1974 when their earnings exceeded the insurable limit, and their yearly average of contributions was less than 20. These arrangements were devised to deal with the once off situation arising from the removal of the remuneration limit in 1974.  Under the 1988 arrangements, pensions are awarded for averages of between five and 19 contributions.  As at December 1996, 424 people were in receipt of these special <i>pro rata</i> pensions.</P>
      <P>If an insured contributor's income went over the insurable limit, the old insurance card had an instruction &mdash; under the heading &ldquo;Instructions to Insured Persons&rdquo;&mdash; in bold black print to the effect:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6. if you cease to be insurably employed and wish to continue your insurance as a voluntary contributor notify the Department immediately.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Leitrim is faring very well in terms of recent and proposed new job creation.  On 24 February I announced that two new investments by overseas companies, with the support of IDA Ireland, will create 100 new jobs in County Leitrim. Investments will be made by: Westmark of Germany, a manufacturer of mechanical kitchen aids, which will create 88 new jobs in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim; and Lilly Industries of the US which will establish an industrial coatings facility and create 12 new jobs in Ballinamore, County Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Leitrim continues to be marketed for inward investment and IDA Ireland is in active <Col N="1516" /> discussion with a number of companies with a view to creating additional jobs in the county. Forbairt client companies in County Leitrim recorded an increase of some 37 net additional jobs last year.</P>
    <P>Over the past decade one of the most positive developments in the overseas natural resources sector, for which Forbairt is responsible, in the north-west region has been the establishment of a major facility by Masonite Ireland to manufacture moulded door skins at Annaduff, County Leitrim.  Excellent progress has been made on the construction of the Masonite facility and the company plans to commence pilot production later this month.  It is planned to start production of door skins on the first production line in June with the second production line due to be in production by early 1998.</P>
    <P>Over the past six months the company has recruited in excess of 100 employees who have undergone training in the US and in Ireland. Total employment now stands at 156 people and it is likely to rise to its target of 330 by early 1998.</P>
    <P>Lilly Industries is a major supplier of building products coatings to Masonite in the US.  Its County Leitrim plant is a direct response to a request from Masonite to establish an operation close to its new Irish facility for the supply of white paper and a clear coat product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The local employment service networks are currently operational in 14 key areas around the country, comprising 12 partnership areas, Cork city, south-west Kerry, Waterford, Dublin's northside, inner city Dublin, County Wexford, Mayo, Dundalk, Tallght, Finglas/Cabra, Limerick, Ballymun and two non-partnership areas, Kildare and Clare.  The aim of the LES is to provide the gateway or access point to the full range of options which should be available to enable a long-term unemployed person return to the world of work &mdash; these include guidance, training, education and employment supports.</P>
      <P>The Government has recently agreed to the extension of the service to four new areas: Drogheda; Ballyfermot; Clondalkin; and Blanchardstown.</P>
      <P>In selecting these areas, the Government gave priority to large urban areas experiencing high levels of unemployment and those with a drug abuse problem.  I am confident that the LES can make a real impact in the four new areas that are characterised by endemic unemployment. Officials of my Department have met with representatives of the four new areas to organise the implementation of the service in those areas.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 commits the Government to the development of an effective public employment service, including the phased expansion of the local employment service to all partnership areas during the period of the agreement.  I am currently reviewing options in this regard and am anxious to ensure the provision, in a structured and well directed way, of improved information, guidance and placement services to the unemployed and the matching of individual job-seekers with notified vacancies from employers.  In this context the LES will provide an intensive, client-centred service in selected disadvantaged areas to those furthest removed from the labour market.</P>

      <P>IDA Ireland continues to actively promote County Kerry, including Killarney and Kenmare, <Col N="1518" /> within the south-west region to potential overseas investors.</P>
      <P>Expansion of existing overseas industry is a major source of new business for IDA Ireland and County Kerry is fortunate to have some good quality companies located there.  During 1996, IDA Ireland assisted two expansions and one new project in County Kerry which together will create approximately 330 new jobs.  These announcements will have a positive impact on employment in the county as a whole over the next couple of years, including Kenmare and Killarney.</P>
      <P>I am fully satisfied that there is a high level of co-operation between all the agencies, both statutory and voluntary, involved in industry development and employment creation in County Kerry. Accordingly, I have no proposals to establish a task force at this time.</P>

The licensing provision of the Act commenced on 1 September 1989 and provision was made for upgrading to be carried out under a permit system over a five year period in order to alleviate any financial burden on operators.  All premises should now be at licensing standard.</P>
      <P>Under Council Directive 91/498/EEC financial assistance from the Community is only available for abattoirs complying fully with EU Directive 91/497/EEC which applies to the production and marketing of meat.  However, as Directive 91/497 contained modified structural requirements for approval of low-capacity abattoirs serving the domestic market, these premises are not eligible for Community aid.

While the price for butter and SMP is supported under the EU common organisation of the market for milk and milk products, the actual price for milk paid to producers is a function of a number of factors, including the products into which the milk is processed and the markets on which those products are sold.</P>
      <P>It is the case that international dairy markets have weakened during 1996 and this is now reflected in the price being returned to producers. It is also the case that recent revaluations of the Irish green rate have given rise to a reduced level of support in Irish pounds.  As regards the latter, I have already announced that a compensation scheme will be introduced which will offset some of the effects on producers incomes of the recent revaluations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 253 together.</P>
      <P>The recent strength of the Irish pound against the currencies of EU member states other than the UK has made market conditions for the sale of Irish food in those member states more difficult. It has also reduced the value in Irish pounds of EU market supports.  On the other hand, the depreciation of the Irish pound against sterling has strengthened the position of Irish food in the UK market.  Moreover, under EU Regulations, the value in Irish pounds of direct payments to farmers has been protected from the two recent revaluations of the Irish green pound.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has made a proposal to the Council for the payment of compensation to Irish farmers for the losses resulting from those revaluations.  The earliest practicable time for the Council to adopt the proposal is at its meeting fixed for 17-19 March.  The aid will be payable to farmers in the beef, dairying, arable crops and sugar sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> The total amount of EU compensation proposed by the Commission is 62 MECU or £46 million approximately.  In my reply to Question No. 151 on 27 February 1997, the Irish pound equivalent was stated to be £50 million approximately, the conversion being made by using the normal &ldquo;green pound&rdquo; rate of conversion.  It is now clear from further information received from the Commission that the 62 MECU should be converted using the different &ldquo;budget&rdquo; rate of conversion.</P>
    <P>At this stage, no decision has yet been taken to supplement the EU compensation with national funding.</P>

      <P>The position regarding exports of greyhounds to Spain and the operation of greyhound tracks in Spain is set out in my reply to Question No. 112 of 18 December 1996.</P>
      <P>The prosecution of offences of cruelty to animals, including greyhounds, is a matter for the Garda Síochána.  By virtue of the Control of Horses Act, 1996 (Commencement Order), 1997 (S.I. No. 99 of 1997), introduced on 3 March 1997, the penalties for cruelty under the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, have been increased to a fine of up to £1,500 and/or six months imprisonment on summary conviction and a fine of up to £10,000 and/or two years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.  These new penalties are the result of a major recasting of the penalties under the 1911 Act by Section 48 of the Control of Horses Act, 1996.  These significantly tougher measures will be supported by the vast majority of people and will act as a greater deterrent against acts of cruelty to all animals.</P>

      <P>Since the introduction on 1 January 1993 of EEC Regulation No. 2092/91, governing the organic production of agricultural products, 760 farmers notified my Department of their intention to commence or to continue as organic operators.</P>
      <P>As provided for in Regulation 2092/91, my Department has approved three private organic inspection bodies: IOFGA, Organic Trust Ltd. and Demeter Standards Ltd. to carry out necessary inspections under the regulation.  Under this regulation organic operators must submit their operations to annual inspection.  On the basis of information furnished to my Department by the inspection bodies there were approximately 600 active organic farmers in Ireland at the end of 1996.</P>
      <P>My Department, when possible, sends a representative to certification panel meetings of the private bodies, where the findings of the inspections are discussed and decisions regarding status of operations are taken.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware the rural environment protection scheme offers attractive financial incentives to farmers who continue or who convert to an organic farming system.  At present many organic farmers are following five year organic REPS plans.  To date 164 farmers have received payment under the REPS organic farming supplementary measure.  Payments under this measure fall due at the end of a recording year i.e. after a year in the scheme has been completed. Part of the process of assessing entitlement to REPS payment, including organic payment, involves a system of compliance checking on scheme participant farms to ensure that the planned undertakings have been satisfactorily carried out.</P>

      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to recent media comment on alleged irregularities uncovered in the 1997 EU ewe premium scheme resulting from the fact that a much larger percentage of inspections this year will be unannounced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that on-farm inspections under the 1997 ewe premium-sheep headage schemes commenced recently and will continue up until the end of the ewe premium retention period which expires on 23 April 1997.  I can also confirm that the number of unannounced inspections, particularly in respect of lowland flocks, will be <Col N="1527" /> greater than heretofore.  The decision to increase the number of unannounced inspections was taken so as to give greater assurance on the overall level of controls in place in respect of this scheme particularly because sheep are not individually identified.</P>
    <P>Because of the relatively small number of inspections which have taken place to date my Department has not, as yet, fully analysed the results of inspections &mdash; this exercise will be carried out when all inspections have been completed at the end of the retention period.  The types of irregularities uncovered during on-farm inspections range from a shortfall in the number of animals presented for inspection to possible fraudulent applications which results in the flockowner being disallowed payment for the year in question and debarred from the scheme for the succeeding year.</P>
    <P>While it is too early to draw specific conclusions it would appear that on a pro-rata basis the level of irregularities detected so far in 1997 has increased somewhat over 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 260, 261 and 262 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> In the 1996 budget £13 million was provided for the first phase of the voluntary early retirement scheme for members of the Defence Forces. In 1996, 500 personnel left the Defence Forces in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  It was never intended, nor would it have been possible, to fund in the first year the release all of the members of the Defence Forces who will leave under the voluntary early retirement scheme.  It is expected that the target number will be achieved over a three year period.</P>
    <P>Aside from the budgetary considerations it would not be desirable or practical from an organisational point of view to allow the release of the total number in the first year.  The aim is to move to an organisation with a total strength of 11,500 over the three year period of the implementation plan.</P>
    <P>Following representations which were received on behalf of personnel who had applied for VER in 1996 and whom it was not possible to facilitate because of the oversubscription of the scheme it was decided to grant pre-retirement support leave to personnel who wished to avail of it; 110 personnel availed of this concession.</P>
    <P>In 1997 approximately 750 personnel &mdash; including 110 personnel who availed of the pre-retirement support leave concession in 1996 &mdash; will be released from the Permanent Defence Force under the VER scheme.</P>
