    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 17, financial motions by the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 25th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, will the Taoiseach call in the British Ambassador and tell her that, in view of the new evidence that has come to light, it is the wish of Dáil Éireann that a new inquiry is held into the events of this day 25 years ago in Derry when 13 innocent men died at the hands of the British forces?  It would be reasonable for the Taoiseach to tell the British authorities that justice must be seen to be done, as in the case of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will recall, Deputy David Andrews raised this matter with me earlier this week and in response I said that the Government would take up this matter with the British authorities.  Since then we have done so and furthermore we intend to raise it at the Anglo-Irish Conference where the Tánaiste will meet the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland within the next seven days.  Taking up the matter at the highest political level is the most effective way forward and that is the course we intend to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say at what level contact was made by the Government and to whom in the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter will be pursued at the level of the Tánaiste with the Secretary of State within the context of the Anglo-Irish Conference. That is the most effective way forward in this matter.  Since 1985 a structure has been in place under the Anglo-Irish Agreement to deal with issues of this nature which affect the views of sections of the community in Northern Ireland, as this issue does most certainly.  That is the appropriate way forward.  The Tánaiste has this matter very much in hand and, in the past 24 hours, stated the Government's position pursuant <Col N="238" /> to my response to the question in the House by Deputy Andrews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say if contact has been made based on the new evidence?  I listened carefully to what the Tánaiste said last night.  Has there been an initial reaction from the British Government?  This is a matter on which we should not wait for Anglo-Irish meetings.  In the previous cases I mentioned the British Government had to be dragged from such meetings in order to eventually get justice.  Will the Tánaiste indicate what was stated by the British authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House we will not rely on initial reactions in this matter but will pursue it with vigour and consistency until a satisfactory outcome is reached.  The appropriate level at this point for the matter to be taken up is that of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs with the Secretary of State within the context of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  We will not be placed in a position of not pursuing the matter by initial reactions of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Taoiseach has said, but in view of the fact that substantial new evidence has arisen and the findings of the Widgery inquiry are totally discredited, and particularly as today is the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, will the Taoiseach consider taking up the matter at prime ministerial level?  Is the Government prepared to make available to any new inquiry that hopefully will be established, material from its archives on that episode in our history?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must dissuade Members from debating this matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recollect I was not in Government at the time.  I was in Opposition and I would have to take into account the views of the Government of the time in regard to the matter.  If information of substance is available on the files of the Irish Administration, I can discern no reason it should not be made available to any subsequent inquiry.  I am not aware of the content of any such information, but I will make inquiries to discern what information is available and, if it is of a kind that could be made available and would be useful to a tribunal of inquiry, it will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very conscious of this issue.  I was in public life at the time of the Bloody Sunday events and I am very conscious of the appalling effect it had on public opinion at the time.  I am also very conscious of the scars that remain in the minds and hearts of many of the families affected to this day and the sense of incompleteness they feel in regard to the matter, the sense that issues affecting them and the integrity of their loved ones remain unresolved.  This is a human issue that needs to be resolved regardless of the political <Col N="239" /> views of the community affected.  This is a human rights issue, not one to be pursued in the context of one community seeking vindication at the expense of another.  If the events had occurred in a different community in Northern Ireland, the same considerations would apply.  In any comment we make on the matter in this House, it is important to approach it in that way, to see it as an issue of the rights of human beings to vindication, regardless of their political tradition, rather than to look at it in the context of seeking to pursue any other approach of a broader political kind.  This is a human rights rather than a political question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Taoiseach said.  I hope the Tánaiste will be successful in the role outlined by the Taoiseach, but if he is not, will the Taoiseach give a commitment to the House that the Government will proceed on this matter, with the support of Dáil Éireann, to the European Court of Human Rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not make a decision of that nature in the context of a hypothetical question of the kind posed by the Deputy.  This is a serious matter we need to pursue in a very deliberate way.  I am not raising any extensive expectations of what may occur at the Anglo-Irish Conference when the matter is raised by the Tánaiste beyond saying, as we all know, that he will raise the matter with the utmost vigour and effectiveness but, as I said in response to earlier questions from the Deputy, we intend not to be put off by any initial response and to pursue this matter in a deliberate, careful and effective way until we receive a satisfactory outcome to what is a human rights issue of considerable importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the votes on Programme 2000 are in the bag, will the Taoiseach take any new initiative to resolve the nurses' dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a matter proper to the Order of Business.  There are many other ways of raising this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are entering a dangerous stage, I urge the Taoiseach to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trespassing on the Order of Business by responding to this question.  It would not be particularly helpful for me to be drawn into an extensive question and answer session on this subject.  As the House is aware, the Minister for Health, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and others are seeking a resolution of this matter on an ongoing basis.  Meetings are taking place over present days on the matter with a view to seeing if a solution can be found.  As far as the Government is concerned, I set out the parameters within which a solution must be found in the statement I made on the occasion of the launch of Programme 2000.  I will furnish the <Col N="240" /> Deputy with a copy of my remarks on that occasion in case he has not already received them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised reform of the Vocational Education Act, 1930 given that the Taoiseach indicated to me earlier in the week that Bill will be introduced after the passage of the education Bill which will be introduced nearer to the summer, if not before an election, will the Government consider not implementing the ministerial order which would dissolve the five town vocational education committees pending the reform of the Vocational Education Act?  As I understand the dissolution of the town vocational education committees is imminent, I ask the Government to defer this until the overall package is put in place and to ensure the matter is dealt with in tandem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy acknowledged, I gave him information on the timing of the legislation last week.  It is not appropriate for me to become involved in making statements about matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the most appropriate course for Deputy Martin to follow would be to table a parliamentary question to the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the day it is hoped Programme 2000 will be concluded satisfactorily, does the Taoiseach or his Ministers intend to make any positive intervention or to take an initiative in regard to Irish Life where a considerable number of people are due to be laid off next Monday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is the subject of discussion between the management and the unions of the company in question.  The various agencies of the State that assist in the resolution of industrial disputes are available to the parties in respect of any intervention that might be appropriate, but it would be best to allow this matter to be pursued by the parties concerned in the appropriate way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Employment Equality Bill in regard to which the Government circulated an <Col N="241" /> amendment for Report Stage, as the last amendment had to be withdrawn when Democratic Left objected to it and the Bill was left in suspended animation, will the Taoiseach confirm that the amendment to section 37 has the support of the three parties in Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I can put the Deputy's mind at rest on that topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On that legislation, at the Whips' meeting last night it was proposed that the Bill be guillotined in an hour and three-quarters. I and the Progressive Democrat Whip objected to that.  Will the Taoiseach give a guarantee that the legislation will not be guillotined and that the pressure groups involved in that Bill will have an opportunity to see exactly what the Government is proposing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension. The Government Whip has informed me that there is no question of an artificial time limit being placed on this Bill.  It is scheduled for next week and, hopefully, it can be concluded then but, if it is not, it can be taken on another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a copy of the proposed schedule outlining that an hour and three-quarters is given to that Bill.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as far as next week is concerned. That is the amount of time available for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but if further time is necessary it will be provided.  There is no question of that being the total time limit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only as a result of our objection.  The Government tried to guillotine the Bill.  It tried to muzzle the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought the Deputy would understand that the schedule for next week will only include the amount of time to be taken on a given subject next week and does not contain any reference to subsequent weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for acceding to our request.  He is trying to muzzle us on the compellability of witnesses Bill.  This is the Government of openness, transparency and <Col N="242" /> accountability.  Did the Government schedule that Bill?</P>

      <P>On the nurses dispute, will the Taoiseach take into account the legitimate interests and rights of retired nurses?  The major question of relativity and indexation has not yet been addressed in the talks.  It is of deep concern to the pensioners concerned and should be covered in any overall settlement.  I ask the Taoiseach to take a personal interest in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I also urge the Government to seek a new inquiry into the Bloody Sunday killings. Does the Taoiseach have a publication date for the Bretton Woods Agreement (Amendment) Bill and propose to consult the various interest groups on the matter which is of immense concern to the Debt and Development Coalition and overseas aid agencies?</P>

Last night the Minister met the Competition Authority to decide what action can be taken under the relevant legislation.  The Minister of State is to meet the vintners organisation today. I am aware that the possibility of concerted price increases is facilitated by the licensing laws administered by the State which limit the number of suppliers of this product, particularly in Dublin, because they preclude the transfer of licences from rural Ireland to Dublin.  This creates an artificial market in which concerted price increases are possible.  Concerted price increases in the licensed trade have been illegal since 1965.  Under <Col N="245" /> the restrictive prices order of that year they were rendered illegal.  Any concerted increases in drink prices would constitute a serious breach of the law.</P>

      <P>When the debate adjourned yesterday I was speaking about the good work being done by the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs.  The State improvement scheme delivered as a result of the work of the task force will focus on priority areas in Dublin, both city and county and in the cities of Cork and Limerick.  It will help to eliminate aspects of design and layout of estates which encourage anti-social behaviour, carry out improvement work to enhance the living environment for tenants and establish improved estate management arrangements.  The implementation of the programme also presents local authorities with a further opportunity to develop partnerships and build bridges with local communities, and I hope local authorities will avail of this opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other initiatives relate to improving the housing management performance of local authorities. In 1995 I introduced a housing management initiatives grants scheme under which more than £200,000 has been allocated to date.  The grants are part of an overall strategy designed to ensure better housing management, including estate management.  Significantly, the majority of projects <Col N="247" /> approved under the scheme refer to tenant training in estate management.  The 1997 provision of £200,000 &mdash; double that of 1996 &mdash; will ensure the progress achieved in 1995 and 1996 is consolidated and further developed.</P>
    <P>Funding for accommodation of the homeless has, and will continue to have, a high priority. Under the new Dublin homelessness initiative, new administrative arrangements and structures involving co-operation between statutory agencies and the voluntary sector are expected to achieve more efficient delivery of services for the homeless in the Dublin region in 1997.</P>
    <P>I am also keen to encourage the very significant contribution of the voluntary sector in the provision of housing for the socially excluded.  I will provide more than £41 million for the voluntary housing capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes.  This will allow for 1,200 starts this year in the voluntary sector.  Much of the expenditure under the capital assistance scheme is used to provide accommodation for the homeless.  The many good examples of those using this scheme include Focus Point, the Salvation Army and the St. Vincent de Paul.  The rental subsidy scheme, whose main focus is on providing accommodation for families, has also been used to fund transitional or second stage accommodation for homeless people.</P>
    <P>On the urban renewal front, there have been a number of significant developments over the past 12 months.  The consultants' study on the urban renewal schemes which have operated since 1986 was completed and published.  It concluded that the schemes have been highly successful as a mechanism for encouraging private sector investment in areas of dereliction and decline.  Nevertheless, it also concluded that the future requires a more focused, integrated and strategic approach, which is a view I concur with.  After the study's publication late last year, I initiated a process of public consultation.  Before concluding this process, I will hold a conference to draw together the various strands of opinion.  Following that, I intend to submit to the Government proposals for future urban renewal policy.</P>
    <P>What is clear at this stage is that future policy will be based on a more targeted and integrated approach.  This is something for which all involved will require time to prepare.  A preparatory period of about 12 months will be required after details of any new urban renewal scheme are announced.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to announce earlier this month that the Minister for Finance has agreed to extend the deadline under the current urban renewal scheme for one year to 31 July, 1998. This extension will ensure that urban renewal activity continues during the preparatory period for the next phase of urban renewal.  It will also facilitate the completion of many projects which are currently in planning or in progress.  I am determined to ensure that full advantage is taken of this extension.  I do not want the extra year to <Col N="248" /> simply encourage people to sit back and put the completion of developments on the long finger. This extension is subject, therefore, to a very important qualification.</P>
    <P>If a project is to avail of the extra 12 months, at least 15 per cent of expenditure on it will have to be incurred by 31 July this year, the date on which the scheme would have expired had there been no extension.  The timing of the announcement has given developers ample advance notice to get their projects under way and comply with the expenditure requirement.  It will be up to them to ensure they meet the conditions if they want to avail of the one year extension. Extending the current scheme on a transitional arrangements, is to move towards a more strategic and integrated approach to urban renewal in the future.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the views of all the interested parties in framing that approach.  We must aim for an approach to urban renewal which yields results more in line with the requirements of the closing years of the 20th century.  I am determined to ensure we achieve that aim.</P>
    <P>This is a good budget, from the point of view of social solidarity and partnership.  It also helps employment creation and prudently provides a sound basis for continued economic growth in 1997 and beyond.  When the electors make their choice this year they will look at the record of this Government.  Although the cracks already show in the proposed union between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats before they even reach the altar rails, I have no doubt that in their desperation for power, the two Opposition parties will do their best to paper over them. However, the jibe from an unnamed Progressive Democrats member about Deputy Bertie Ahern's deficiency in the statemanship department hardly encourages the groom.  Deputy Dermot Ahern's macho assertion that in a future Government Fianna Fail will be firmly in the driving seat is hardly a sound basis for a modern Irish relationship.</P>
    <P>This budget and this Government shows that true partnership can be developed in Government. Partnership must continue to be built across communities, between old and young, rich and poor, if we are to meet the reality of today's world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on the budget which was introduced last week by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  I knew this was not a bad budget when I heard the response of Deputy McCreevy who did not have much to say.  I also heard other Fianna Fáil Members say the budget was good because when their party was in Government it took the right decisions for the country.  Then I heard the Progressive Democrats say that tax changes would not have taken place but for them.  Having heard that, I was happy the budget was a good one and that people were satisfied with it because it meets their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> Some Members of the House do not think people on social welfare should be looked after but such people must be assisted, although no one who is working should get social welfare under false pretences.  I would not support that, but there are people in society who have to be supported and assisted by the social welfare system. I welcome the increases in this budget for them. If some people were not claiming social welfare under false pretences others who need it would receive more.  The Progressive Democrats may not like to see people getting any kind of social welfare but people depend on it, particularly in rural areas where there are few employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>This is the third budget I have witnessed since becoming a Member of the Dáil.  While having a regard for the national interest, I must also look at the interests of County Mayo which has developed in the last three or four years.  Following the introduction of the pilot scheme announced three years ago for Westport, the town has developed in an unbelievable way.  Mulrany has also benefited from a seaside pilot scheme.  The Minister of State, Deputy McManus, should introduce urban renewal schemes for towns such as Swinford, Kiltimagh and Ballinrobe, which need uplifting.  People are prepared to invest but they need an incentive to do so.  I hope the Minister of State will examine that matter.</P>
    <P>While I broadly welcome the budget, there are a few aspects of it with which I am dissatisfied, and I raised them with the Taoiseach on budget day.  For example, if a young couple buys a first home that is under 1,400 sq. ft. they receive a £3,000 grant.  That is very good but if they buy a second-hand house they do not receive a first time buyer's grant.  In addition, they must pay stamp duty on their house which is an annoying penalty.  The Taoiseach should reintroduce a measure in the Finance Bill whereby if someone buys a new first home they will get the £3,000 grant, but if it is a second-hand home they should not have to pay stamp duty on it.  That is only fair.  They are entitled to that if it is their first home.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about people who are buying ten or 11 houses &mdash; there are already plenty of tax breaks for them &mdash; but why should a young couple or person starting out in life have to pay stamp duty on their first home?  The Government should look at this because it is wrong.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed about another category of person that was not looked after in the budget, although a small change was made for them.  They are people who look after the elderly at home.  In rural areas there is a high population of old people and it is a tradition that a son or daughter will care for their elderly relatives at home.  They take them on board and look after them.  While I welcome the increase if there are two carers in one house, most elderly people are looked after by only one individual.  Some old people are very sick and need much care and attention.  There is <Col N="250" /> a problem, however, if their son or daughter is working because in some cases they may have to give up employment to look after an elderly parent or other relative.</P>
    <P>If a husband or wife caring for an elderly person are working, the carer's allowance is means tested.  Last year in the Dáil I made a suggestion which would save the State money.  It was that the first £50 of a carer's allowance should not be means tested, but any amount above that should be.  Carers are saving the State a great deal of money because, without them, elderly people would be put into homes or hospitals where nurses and doctors would have to be paid to look after them.  I do not see why the first £50 of the carer's allowance must be means tested.  The Government should re-examine that simple suggestion which would not cost much money. People looking after the elderly at home are entitled to be paid for doing so, and to get some assistance.</P>
    <P>A recent health board survey revealed the massive amount of money it costs to look after a person in hospital.  The Government should look at this proposal along with removing stamp duty for first-time house buyers.  There are many tax breaks for those who are well off and some people in this House have an agenda to look after people who are well able to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>People on low incomes in council or other houses that require repair, constitute another category for whom no grants are available.  They may, for example, need to re-roof their homes or replace windows but cannot afford to do so. There are no grants for doing such repairs so the Government should introduce a grant scheme for this type of work.  It is not necessary to introduce a grant scheme to which everyone, including doctors, solicitors, barristers and judges, is entitled to apply.  Such people applied for these grants because they were available even though they could afford to pay for the repairs themselves.</P>
    <P>It would be a simple matter to reintroduce house grants for people earning less than £10,000 or £12,000 a year.  They would then be able to afford to repair their homes without always having to depend on the council or the State to do it for them.</P>
    <P>As regards the pilot scheme I mentioned in Westport, people came from all over the country to buy houses there and that, in turn, put pressure on the local economy.  People born and reared in Westport cannot buy a house there because they are competing with millionaires from Dublin and Cork who want to buy summer houses.  They are no good to the local economy.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a man in Achill last week who told me about the pilot scheme in Mayo.  He said that while it was a great scheme it did not revitalise the area.  He cited the example of a scheme of 20 houses which were bought up within a few hours of being put on the market.  He said that on Christmas night there was not one light on in any <Col N="251" /> of the houses because they had been purchased for use as summer holiday homes.  The houses will be occupied for the 12 weeks of summer when people want to spend their holidays in Achill, but that is no use to the local economy.  It is far better to give people grants to entice them to live and work in an area and try to develop it.</P>
    <P>I have already raised the question of people with disabilities.  A person in my area, Mr. Michael Corbett, has set up a group called Personal Assistants.  This year it asked the Government to set up a fund.  I have seen how the personal assistants worked under FÁS schemes but these schemes will not last forever.  They now want to set up a fund and have asked the Government for assistance.  Some £500,000 was provided in the budget for people with disability, but that sum will be spent by the Civil Service on administration so it will not reach the people who need it.</P>
    <P>The Personal Assistants group sought help from five Departments dealing with this matter, including the Departments of Equality and Law Reform, Health, and Transport, Energy and Communications.  The Government should reconsider this request.  Each Department should give them £100,000 that would make available a further £500,000 to set up this fund so that these people will not depend on the State all the time. They want to have their personal assistants and to be independent.  I have seen how this system has worked in the context of the FÁS scheme and the independence it has given to people with disabilities. We are well able to look after people who can fight for themselves, who are able to march outside the Dáil, by giving them tax breaks.  We should look after those who are not able to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>A report entitled, &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo; contained over 400 recommendations which the Government accepted.  Given that, I cannot understand why there was no funding in the budget.  I welcome the allocation of £10 million for the mentally handicapped, people who must be looked after.</P>
    <P>The budget was welcomed by most sectors in society.  I was surprised that the publicans increased the price of a pint.  For three years in succession there has been no increase in the duty on alcohol.  If the Government had levied an increase the Licensed Vintners Association would have complained, but when the Government did not do it they saw fit to increase the price of a pint by 5p.  Perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, will look into that to see if what they did was right.  I would also ask him to investigate the price of soft drinks which is a scandal &mdash; publicans can charge between £1.20 and £1.30 for a coke or an orange and make a big profit.  The Government should consider bringing back price restrictions.  Perhaps the publicans and shopkeepers should have to apply to the Government for price increases.  We have seen what the supermarkets <Col N="252" /> are doing in the context of the price wars and Sunday trading.  As soon as there is any leniency, they abuse the system.  The publicans are the very people who would be complaining if the Government increased excise duty on the pint.  In the past three years that has not happened.  The working man is entitled to a pint at a reasonable price, and I am disappointed that the publicans have increased the price.  The economy is doing well, and there was no need to increase the price on this occasion.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome the budget.  I would like the Government to look again at the carer's allowance, to re-examine stamp duty and to put in place funding for Independent Living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my friend and colleague, Deputy Michael Smith.</P>
      <P>On this day 25 years ago, I was Parliamentary Secretary to the former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch.  Two or three days later, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach &mdash; the designation &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; had yet to be created &mdash; I attended the Derry funerals.  More than any other single episode, the events of 31 January 1972 led Northern Ireland to 25 years of murder and violence. Although at the time I welcomed the setting up of an inquiry under the Lord Chief Justice at the time, Lord Widgery, I soon became aware of the limits of that exercise.  Sadly, what several Ulster men and Ulster women have told me over the years now appears to be borne out by the new evidence unearthed by Dr. Dermot Walsh and Don Mullan: that the Widgery inquiry was totally inadequate, irresponsibly conducted and careless in the way it went about its business.</P>
      <P>This is all the sadder for those of us who have spent our lives urging people to have faith in the institutions of law and democratic government.  It is now clear that the whitewash of the Widgery inquiry and the resurrection of the IRA are inextricably linked.</P>
      <P>As democratic politicians try to salvage the peace process, it is incumbent on us all to prove that the rule of law and the ways and institutions of democratic politics must be seen to be thorough, impartial and above reproach.  The Widgery inquiry was none of those things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, through the medium of the Anglo-Irish Conference as well as through contact between Heads of Government, should actively support the establishment of a new inquiry.  The interests of justice demand no less. In that regard I would like to strongly support my party leader Deputy Bertie Ahern when he called on the Government to invite the British Ambassador to the Department of Foreign Affairs to give added urgency to the strong feeling here on the need for a reinvestigation into what happened this time 25 years ago.  I support him strongly and believe his proposition would give added force to what appears to be all-party consensus on the need for the reopening of an inquiry into this tragic period of our history.  As I said on Tuesday, and as the Taoiseach repeated <Col N="253" /> today, it is a human rights issue falling into the same category as the cases of the Birmingham Six, the Guilford Four and the Maguire family which were travesties and glaring miscarriages of justice.  I strongly support this call for an immediacy in this matter and hope that the British take seriously what the democratic politicians on this island want.</P>
    <P>Another matter that concerns me is the all-party petition presumably produced by Mr. John Hume.  It seems extraordinary that the British House of Commons can produce a petition of this nature and it does not appear that there is any mechanism in this House for an all-party petition on a matter of this nature to indicate all-party concern about the problem.  I will leave it at that. I am grateful to the Chair for his indulgence in allowing me to speak on this in what, after all, is a budget debate.</P>
    <P>Time was, a Cheann Comhairle, when the budget set the agenda, not just for fiscal policy, but for the development of the country's broader economic, industrial and social policy.  In arriving at its decisions, the Government of the day consulted across a wide range of organisations, public and private.  Then, on budget day, it removed the veil of secrecy and mystery that surrounded the whole process.</P>
    <P>These days, however, the lead-in to, and the presentation of the budget is an altogether different affair.  Not only were details of this year's budget leaked ahead of time in a series of well spaced press releases but, to all intents and purposes, it is clear that the Government has admitted the social partners as governing partners as well.</P>
    <P>Something may be said in favour of removing, or at least easing, the secrecy that has surrounded the budget in the past.  Secrecy is not vital to all areas of the process.  However, the mystery remains, the mystery as to where the role of the Government stops, and that of the social partners begins.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress that I am not criticising the concept of partnership.  It was pioneered by Fianna Fáil and, in particular, by my party leader, Deputy Ahern, when he was Minister for Labour. However, as the concept of a national agreement has been developed by the Government, it is clear that the Minister for Finance has confused the function of a budget with his negotiated pay deal.  Therefore, it came as no surprise to me that almost all the major commentators on the budget framed their initial reactions in terms of Partnership 2000.  One said that the Minister for Finance had delivered on what had been agreed to in Dublin Castle last December.  That is all very well.  I congratulate the Minister on concluding a pay deal, but it is precisely because the Minister has his eye on a pay deal and not on presenting an overall framework for the development of the economy that this year's budget is a very limited document indeed.  As a framework for economic development, it is neither coherent nor strategic.</P>
    <P>In regard to tourism, this is an unfortunate and <Col N="254" /> fruitless road on which to embark.  Here we have an area which is crying out for a more realistic and integrated commitment from Government.  It is one thing for the budget to exclude concessions to tackle long-term unemployment and it is another to compound that failure by refusing even the slightest incentive to an industry where the costs of job creation are minimal when contrasted with other sectors.  If the tourism industry achieves its targets for job creation, as listed in the operational programme, it will not be as a result of any interest that this Government has in the industry.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, when the present Minister presented a budget that was largely drawn from the previous Fianna Fáil/Labour Programme for Government, the Minister proposed incentives to develop seaside resorts.  I am sorry that nothing of the like has been developed since.  It may be that the Minister believes his largesse is so great that our resorts do not need any further help. However, even if that were the case, which I do not accept, similar schemes could be applied to niche areas within the tourism industry.  We use these kinds of incentives to develop our film industry.  Why not apply them to promote the construction of theme holiday villages?  The concept of the designated area can be developed to encourage a product or an idea.  Such incentives would not only help these niche areas to develop and mature but would have a ripple effect on the industry as a whole.  It is time to recognise that the tourism industry is not just about Americans visiting Ireland, it is an industry which is undergoing a great internal transition in product development and the tax regime should recognise this.</P>
    <P>It is also time to recognise that the tourism industry is not a mere appendage to what passes for the Government's policy on enterprise and employment.  It is central to those policies and vital not just to our economic health and success but to the integrity of our communities and, in particular, to those rural communities that are being affected by rural decline, unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>The development of the relatively new area of tourism can only happen if the private and public spheres work together.  However, as the tax regimes currently stand, there are no incentives to go down that road but I will allow that the Minister has made a start with the changes in corporation profits tax and employers PRSI. However, these changes are preliminary and they do not address the central point, as pointed out by the ITIC last December, that the net earnings for lower paid persons in the industry must be relieved or subvented to ensure there is an incentive to work even at lower incomes.</P>
    <P>The employment schemes could also be used to enhance the industry.  These schemes exclude seasonal tourism enterprises at present.  As some of those involved in the tourism industry have suggested, a case could be made for extending the schemes to include such enterprises and thus <Col N="255" /> ensure that what has been applied to other areas of the economy can be applied here also.</P>
    <P>As in the case of tourism, the Department of Tourism and Trade is concerned with marketing and, to a lesser extent, is conscious of product development.  One cannot be enhanced without the other.  If both are not nurtured in tandem, our efforts will fall between two stools.  The development of a marketing strategy for any business is costly, as is evident from the experience of the current tourism brand.  This explains why, for example, the chairwoman of the Small Firms Association saw the budget as providing no reward for a sector which, like tourism, is universally acknowledged to be central to job creation. There are no incentives to develop or expand the market.  The Minister is content merely to recite the facts and figures of the sector and, in so far as the tax regime is concerned, let the sector fend for itself.</P>
    <P>At a time when our financial position is strong, this Government has squandered an opportunity to use our strength and apply it to funding and directing, in an overall and comprehensive way, an integrated policy of renewal and development. If the budget is anything to go by, this Government's future is already well in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With your indulgence, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I join my colleague, Deputy Andrews, and our party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in calling on the Government to persuade the British Government to set up a new inquiry into the tragic killings of Bloody Sunday 25 years ago today.  For those of us who then served in this House and travelled to Derry for the funerals of the fourteen men slaughtered on that occasion, it has left an indelible mark on our memory.  The fact that their names have not been cleared and nobody was brought to justice for those events is a terrible blotch on our history.</P>
      <P>The onus is now on the British Government, in the light of new information, to make sure that we put an end once and for all to the notion that any one of those men was involved in violent efforts and that it was not a peaceful march.  We, on this side of the House, are extremely anxious that the Government should treat the matter with new urgency, and that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs should spare no effort to make sure that inquiry takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally when a budget is to be introduced we hear and read statements which indicate that it will be a great budget, and that was the case this year.  The Taoiseach intervened on the day prior to the budget to tell the people that it would be the best budget ever.  It must, therefore, be quite disheartening for Government members to find that questions are still being raised and there is public disquiet about many of the provisions in the aftermath of that so-called great budget.  It was clear from a poll that a great majority did not find the budget held the kind of advantage for <Col N="256" /> them which earlier statements by Government members, and particularly the Taoiseach, had indicated.</P>
    <P>We need to examine some of the other decisions taken prior to the budget which were dealt with to some extent in the budget provisions. As one who worked hard as Minister for the Environment to try to make sure there was an equitable system of service charges across the country and who took some action to help bed down these charges, I want to deal briefly with the present mess in local authorities which arises from an ill-conceived decision by the Government and particularly the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>The amount raised by service charges represented about one third of the maintenance costs of water supply systems but provided no funds towards the capital costs.  The cost of these schemes runs into billions of pounds.  Many areas still have poor water supplies and there is a great need, notwithstanding Structural and Cohesion Funds, to raise new funds to deal with this problem. Due to the growth in industrial demand and hygiene requirements in rural areas, there must be continual investment in these schemes.</P>
    <P>There are four types of arrangements for the provision of water supply.  Public water supply schemes are provided by the local authorities and funded in the main by the Department of the Environment with the help of Structural and Cohesion Funds.  There are then a range of group water schemes, some of which are provided from sources of public water supply while others are totally private.  There are private supplies to farms and, of course, a great number of houses still have no piped water supply.  The 1991 census showed there were in excess of 12,000 homes without any piped water supply and this is an indictment on our system.  When one is taking a decision to make fundamental changes it is important that there is equity and that everybody is given a fair chance to have this important and most basic requirement in the management of a household, farm or business.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city millions of gallons of water are leaking from a creaking system.  Pipelines put underground over 100 years ago are pounded by heavy vehicular traffic.  The local authority is almost incapable of dealing with the matter.  This city faces a crisis in relation to the provision of a water supply and pollution in Dublin Bay.  It is said that the Ringsend sewerage scheme will receive only secondary treatment and that a tertiary treatment system will not be provided due to lack of funds.  Was this caused by a panic stricken Government anxious to buy votes, that did not care about the national interest or was it another way of trying to pretend one does not have to pay, that somehow it is possible to have a free lunch, that one can invest billions of pounds in water and sewerage schemes without providing for maintenance costs?</P>
    <P>It is one thing to decide that for political or other reasons certain systems should be changed. <Col N="257" /> We live in a democracy and every Government must have the right to do that I am not getting into the rights and wrongs of whether there should be service charges.  What I am saying is that before something is changed one should know what will be put in its place.  What was decided on this occasion was anti-rural.</P>
    <P>People who live in rural areas and travel to Dublin for sporting and recreational events, to visit hospitals and the airport; hauliers who haul goods to the airports and seaports and those who have to drive to work have now been asked to pay for their own water supplies and to carry the additional burden of paying for other areas where people refuse to pay.</P>
    <P>The total value of excise duties on petrol and diesel in one year represents £40 million.  The extra 6 per cent which will be added to motor tax in the next couple of years will yield an additional £12 million.  If the £40 million and the £12 million are added together the total amounts to roughly what the water service charges yield.  Therefore water service charges have not been abolished but directly transferred onto motorists, hauliers, agricultural contractors and those who need these services to run their business.  Is that fair?</P>
    <P>On the one hand, the Minister is making some changes in income tax which will help lower paid workers and others while, on the other hand, if one happens to live away from the major centre of population one will have to pay more than anybody else.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another matter which has caused consternation in many rural areas.  Perhaps it is not known, though it is well known in the Department of the Environment and by the Minister, that there are 5,545 group water schemes in the country.  All have tried to provide their own supply, all have put their hands deep into their pockets to set up those schemes and all have set up units to collect the maintenance charge every year.  They serve 150,000 households, nearly half of whom are being told today, notwithstanding the fact that they provided the capital to set up the scheme, they must now pay the annual maintenance.  On top of that they must pay an additional tax on their motor cars, lorries and tractors to service other areas.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder there is anger and disquiet in so many of those areas where nearly half of the schemes are provided from private systems and not from public water schemes.  Given that a decision has been taken to abolish service charges and the Government has put the onus on the motoring public to pay the full cost, I beseech the Minister for the Environment to do something about the matter.  Those who try to make an effort are always penalised and those who do not make the effort seem to get praise and help.  I plead with the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture to convey that message.  I am not anxious about the politics of it or who wants to vote for whom but I am concerned about fair play now that a decision has been taken so far as other communities are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> In a democracy the public representative should not be the first line of defence and the State should not have to do all that has to be done, thus creating a dependency culture.  Two of my colleagues in the House representing rural constituencies know what I am talking about. When one makes the effort, one should be encouraged, not deprived or discriminated against as happened in this case.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the 12,000 households that have no water supply.  When I was Minister I had no fear in standing up to pressure from any group that did not want to pay.  I wanted to ensure people had adequate sanitary facilities in their homes.  It was unfair to women in the home trying to look after young children not to have such basic requirements.  I was prepared to fight to ensure there were funds to reach those communities. I plead with the Government to ensure the funds are made available to serve as many of those households as possible through whatever schemes are in place or need to be put in place.</P>
    <P>Some elements of the budget are welcome, such as VAT refunds and tax concessions.  It is time to restore the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  I live in north Tipperary where there are problems with eutrofication in the Lough Derg area.  A number of schemes and tertiary treatment schemes are now on course and there is a problem in relation to intensive agriculture and pollution arising therefrom.  We will not be able to provide tourism, angling and recreational facilities along this great natural water resource if we do not deal with domestic and industrial pollution and the problems created by peat silt and intensive agricultural production.  It is time a commitment was given to restore those schemes as it is inordinately expensive to meet all the criteria in the context of dairy management and in-wintering facilities for cattle.</P>
    <P>There is no point lauding the few pounds increase in old age pensions.  The increases of £1.80, £2.20 and £3 over the past three years give a total increase of £7 over three budgets.  This is equivalent to an increase of between 20p and 30p a day over that period.  It is important to remember that old age pensioners lived through the economic war and worked under very different conditions &mdash; they had practically no time off during the week and most of them never had a holiday.  We should do everything possible to find increases for them, regardless of who else has to do without.  Increases in some areas could be done without and it would have been no harm if the Government had made the break in the budget and increased the old age pension by £5 per week.  One could not boast about such an increase, as old age pensioners deserve the very best after a lifetime of struggle.</P>

      <P>The economy has never been in a better shape or more buoyant.  This buoyancy is based on sound economic management and sustainable growth.  Unlike the buoyancy and growth in development we experienced at the end of the 1970s, this buoyancy will not lead to a depressed economy in the future.</P>
      <P>The economy continues to expand rapidly, underpinned by strong growth in consumer demand.  This demand has been fuelled to a great extent by continued low inflation and very favourable interest rates, which have remained at historically low levels for some time.  Mortgage interest rates are at an all time low and this has been of considerable help to families with large mortgages.  The growth of more than 7 per cent in output last year compares favourably with growth of only 2.5 per cent in the OECD as a whole.  The benefits of growth are clearly evident in the substantial increase of 50,000 in the numbers employed.  Ireland's GDP per head increased from 76 per cent of the EU average in 1991 to approximately 100 per cent last year.  I accept that previous Government's laid the foundations for this great performance but this Government deserves credit for its good management of the economy.</P>
      <P>The outlook for this year is for further strong growth, sustained by moderate inflation and interest rates, and substantial growth in employment. Gross domestic product is forecast to increase by more than 6 per cent, slightly lower than in 1996.  Clearly, the economy is in good shape in the run up to economic and monetary union and the Government is totally committed to fulfilling the criteria for membership.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 laid the foundations for many of the concessions in the budget.  The main thrust of the commitments in the agri-food section of Partnership 2000 is the need to create the conditions for improved competitiveness across the farming and food sector.  The commitments in Partnership 2000 and the tax concessions arising from some of these will greatly assist farmers in improving competitiveness in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The advance Central Statistics Office estimate of agricultural incomes shows an increase of 0.1 per cent in agricultural incomes in 1996.  This follows on the record increase in farm incomes in 1995.  Aggregate incomes at well above the £2 billion mark are at record levels.  This is a very good performance given the difficulties experienced by the beef sector as a result of the BSE crisis.  There were outstanding performances in the pig and sheep sectors and good increases in the cereals sector, while output and income levels in the milk sector remained on a part with last year's buoyant figures.</P>

      <P>Direct payments to farmers have increased dramatically in recent years and total payments this year are estimated to exceed a record £870 million, which represents more than 42 per cent of aggregate farm income.</P>
      <P>To give total assurance to consumers in every market, a comprehensive series of new controls was initiated during 1996.  This included rigid new regulations on meat and bonemeal exclusion, a specified offal ban, total depopulation of herds and cohort animals and their removal from the food chain.  New measures have also been introduced which will ensure local authorities live up to their legal obligations on meat inspection.  As Minister with responsibility for this area, I am relieved progress has at last been made in the implementation of the provisions of the Abattoirs Act.  New regulations have also been introduced on the control of knackeries.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress has been made in recent months in the establishment of full traceability of animals.  The new animal location file is in place and the necessary facilities are being rapidly introduced to ensure total traceability.  Discussions on the new quality assurance scheme are at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>The measures taken by my Department last year, together with recent successful prosecutions, have resulted in a welcome reduction in the use of illegal substances.  I compliment the farm organisations, particularly the IFA, on their decision to expel members convicted of this abhorrent crime.  I know the Minister, Deputy Yates and I can depend on the continued support of farm organisations in the battle to finally eliminate the use of illegal substances.  I hope offending farmers will realise that their actions will not go unpunished and the use of illegal substances and the misuse and overuse of legal substances is doing considerable damage to the integrity and credibility of the national and international image of our beef product.</P>
      <P>Consumers can no longer be expected to accept without question the integrity and safety of the food they eat.  They are increasingly concerned about aspects of food production, safety and hygiene.  Food scares, breaches of hygiene regulations and the use of illegal substances, all of which have been the subject of recent comment in the press and on television, highlight the absolute need to restore confidence in the food chain.  The Government responded swiftly to this need by announcing its intention to establish the independent Food Safety Authority of Ireland, whose interim board has already been appointed.  The preparation of legislation to give the authority a statutory basis is one of the Government's main priorities.  I am confident the authority, through the exercise of its primary function of ensuring that standards relating to the safety and hygiene of food are properly observed, will play a very important role in giving the consumers the assurances to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to stress that our food safety arrangements have been satisfactory overall in <Col N="261" /> protecting both public and animal health.  We have not experienced any complaints of major control problems arising from external inspections and this is significant in the context of a country which exports 85 per cent of our beef and 80 per cent of our dairy products.  While there is strong evidence, including international endorsement, of the effectiveness of our existing controls, we are determined to press on so as to improve existing standards and develop new standards in accordance with technological development.</P>
    <P>My Department is particularly concerned with the perceived and understandable concerns about the safety of beef in the aftermath of the BSE crisis.  The issue of traceability has been given an even higher priority than heretofore and the Department is currently concluding its examination of the elements necessary to develop a statutory national beef assurance scheme.  The scheme will be based on adherence by farmers, factories, compounders, dealers and marts &mdash; all the links in the food chain &mdash; to strict standards which will be validated, monitored and controlled independently. A computerised movement monitoring system will underpin the control of animal movement and identification and will be developed in a compatible format with emerging EU requirements. I am satisfied these measures will secure the support of all the industry's main players and will be endorsed by consumers as an effective and transparent means of assuring consumers of the safety of the beef we eat.</P>
    <P>The ability of the agricultural sector to compete successfully in the more challenging environment of the future will depend, among other factors, on continued improvements in farm structures.  The agricultural sector continues to be characterised by small farm size and a relatively high age profile.  These structural defects are impeding the development of a more competitive sector.  The early retirement scheme, along with the installation scheme for young farmers, are two of the measures currently in place to encourage land mobility.  In addition, changes to the taxation regime for farmers over a number of years are also contributing to land mobility across the sector.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to a land policy document I hope to publish in the near future.  In the past, the Land Commission controlled our land policy and concerned itself with the division of large estates.  As the number of estates declined, however, the role of the Land Commission became less relevant and, with the agreement of all parties in the House, it was dissolved.  This left a void, however, and necessitated a review of land policy.  Over the past year and a half I had widespread consultations with the farming organisations and other interested bodies and received their views on the direction we should go on land policy in the future.  I hope my land policy document will reflect those views which were reflected both in last year's and this year's budgets.  We <Col N="262" /> have made progress already on the direction we are going with regard to land policy.</P>
    <P>In the future land mobility will be driven by tax incentives, encouraging young farmers to take over the running of farms from their parents at an earlier age and through the enlargement clause contained in the early retirement scheme and other such measures.  The provisions for leasing and the incentives under the social welfare and finance codes will hopefully encourage more elderly farmers to pass on their farms either to family members or people not related to them.</P>
    <P>In addition to this new approach we intend to stress the need for more environmentally friendly farming practices.  That is currently expounded through schemes such as the REPS which will lead to a new direction in land policy.  I am sure the new land policy will be welcomed by all those involved in the land.</P>
    <P>The following are some of the main incentives in the tax area to encourage the early and orderly transfer of land: a dramatic improvement in capital acquisition tax &mdash; the 1997 budget raised the flat rate relief from 75 per cent to 90 per cent for gifts and inheritance of certain agricultural property; the special stamp duty relief for transfers of agricultural land and buildings to young trained farmers has been renewed for a further three years.  This concession will save young farmers £4.5 million in a full year and will continue to act as an important incentive to early transfer and thus structural change within the farming sector. That is part of our new direction in land policy. There was also significant improvement in the tax exemption for long-term leasing under the 1996 Finance Act which has acted as a strong incentive for early transfer.  To encourage new entrants into farming it is also vitally important that the investment requirements of those starting up in the business of farming are recognised.  The agreement, in the context of Partnership 2000, to consider the issue of the special 100 per cent stock relief for young trained farmers demonstrated this Government's commitment to supporting on-farm investment.  The decision to renew the 100 per cent stock relief for young trained farmers for a further two years will be of enormous benefit to new entrants who have to invest heavily in building up stock numbers.  I welcome the announcement that the 25 per cent stock relief will continue to be available to all farmers for a further two years.  This measure should act as a positive incentive for farmers to reinvest in productive on-farm investment.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that the sector has a high requirement for investment in productive and, in particular, non-productive investment necessary to comply with more stringent environmental standards required by the EU and demanded by the consumer. The importance of environmental measures to farmers is clearly evident in the strong participation in the control of farm pollution scheme and the rural environmental protection scheme.  The whole aspect of environmentally friendly farming and the thrust towards <Col N="263" /> extensification will be dealt with in the land policy I intend to publish shortly.</P>
    <P>The commitment in Partnership 2000 to improve the existing generous capital allowances available to farmers has been honoured.  The budget has provided for a special year 1 allowance of 50 per cent of the expenditure incurred on necessary pollution control measures up to an expenditure limit of £20,000, with the balance of expenditure written off over the following seven years.  This concession is unparalleled in any other domestic sector of the economy and it will act as a strong incentive for those undertaking necessary pollution control works on farms.  This measure was sought by the Opposition spokesperson on agriculture and by the farming organisations and it is the way to proceed in the future. We must encourage more investment in farming by way of incentives through the tax system.</P>
    <P>The other provisions of the budget in the area of income tax will also have a positive impact on the farming community.  The 1 per cent reduction in the standard rate from 27 per cent to 26 per cent combined with the widening of the bands, increased personal allowances and the increase in the income tax exemption limit is to be welcomed. The improvement in corporation tax should help considerably the food agri-sector and the agri-services sector.  This was a positive budget for the farming community which will give more incentives to young farmers in particular.  It should be welcomed.</P>

      <P>The political stability of this Government has resulted in low interest rates and sound economic management.  Gone are the days of internal fighting between parties in a coalition Government. Gone are the days when the party chairman of the Progressive Democrats shouts from the sidelines at his colleagues in Government and does everything possible to upset the work of the Government.  Gone are the days when a Progressive Democrats Minister lectures his Fianna Fáil colleagues on a weekly basis about the economy. Political stability and a Government that gets on with the job of running the country is the key to prudent economic management in any country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic outlook under which the Minister for Finance introduced the budget is unprecedented. For the first time the Government has planned for a current budget surplus.  Growth is expected to continue over the next three years, with GDP expected to increase by 6.5 per cent this year and 5.5 per cent in the next two years. Employment is expected to increase by 114,000 over the next three years, with 45,000 more people expected to be in employment by the end of 1997.  The general Government deficit is forecast to remain well within the Maastricht criteria for the next three years.  Exports which increased by 10.5 per cent in 1996 are expected to increase <Col N="264" /> by almost 12 per cent in 1997 and by just under 10 per cent in the following two years.  Inflation is projected to remain low at approximately 2 per cent and mortgage interest rates are at their lowest level in 30 years.  Consequently, families have real disposable income and a retail boom was evident in every village, town and city over the Christmas period.  Economic projections include the provision of £1 billion in tax cuts as part of the commitment in Partnership 2000, £245 million of which will provide for the adoption of social inclusion measures.  Any fair-minded person examining those statistics would have to admit the Government is managing the economy well and that it is on the right track.</P>
    <P>The budget has benefited a large number of people.  PAYE workers, particularly the low paid, will get a net £6 or £7 per week into their pockets, the largest increase in approximately ten years. It is particularly significant that they will get this increase at a time of low inflation and low mortgage interest rates.  Furthermore, there will be a greater incentive for the business community to take on additional employees, particularly those long-term unemployed.  It is important that we break the cycle of long-term unemployment.  The Government has committed additional resources, particularly under the back to work and other schemes, to get people back to the workplace. Corporation tax and the low rate of employees' PRSI have been reduced.  In the case of employers, the threshold below which the 8.5 per cent rate applies, which is of considerable benefit to labour intensive industries, has been increased from £13,000 to £13,500 per annum.  This will solve many of the difficulties in the sheltered sectors of our economy as well as in the exposed sectors, such as the textiles industry, where there has been great pressure in the marketplace, particularly in respect of foreign markets and competition from the Far East.</P>
    <P>The Government is encouraging employment. Tax bands have been widened, the standard rate has been lowered, personal allowances and exemption limits have been increased and low income families have been given an additional £6 per week under the family income supplement, which is assessed on net rather than gross pay. As a result of the budget there will be a greater incentive to work rather than remain on social welfare.  The solution to poverty and poverty traps is to encourage people to take up employment. It should not be more attractive to remain on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry outlined positive developments in agriculture.  I welcome the allowances introduced under the control of farmyard pollution scheme which had to be abolished some time ago because the national plan negotiated by the leader of Fianna Fáil, as Minister for Finance, did not provide enough money for it.  He provided for 3,500 applicants, but 18,500 applied. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was faced with the problem of bringing forward <Col N="265" /> money from 1997, 1998 and 1999 to meet the enormous demand for the scheme in earlier years of the plan.  The tax incentive in the budget will encourage farmers to proceed with important environmental protection work.  As farmers want to adhere to high environmental standards, the incentives in the budget will go some way towards meeting the expense incurred in complying with the regulations set down by local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular the increase in relief under capital acquisitions tax which will benefit farmers and business people when transferring property or businesses.  The current 75 per cent rate has been increased to a flat rate of 90 per cent for the majority of transfers.  This will be appreciated by the agricultural and business communities. Farming stock reliefs will be retained at 25 per cent and extended for a two year period and the special stock relief of 100 per cent for young farmers is also being retained.  The stamp duty relief for transfer of assets to young farmers will be extended for a further three years.  These are important measures in terms of land mobility.</P>
    <P>There have also been generous increases in other areas.  The tax reliefs and increases in social welfare provisions have been introduced in the context of the Maastricht criteria and following considerable debate about current spending levels.</P>

      <P>I remind Deputy O'Keeffe and others in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that this is not the only Government which has had current spending level difficulties.  In referring to the period when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in Government from 1990-2, no less an authority than Dr. Garret FitzGerald stated in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 25 January 1997:</P>
      <P>This period was marked by a significant rise in current spending as a proportion of GNP. Almost two-thirds of this increase was due to the growth of Public Service pay.  During these three years this rose by more than 19 per cent in real terms &mdash; reflecting an annual increase of almost 2 per cent in numbers and more than 4 per cent in the rate of real pay.</P>
      <P>Also, in these three years, the volume of current non-pay spending also rose as a percentage of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> He went on to state:</P>
    <P>How was the increase in public spending as a proportion of GNP ...paid for?  Taxation was not increased &mdash; it remained at just less than 33.2 per cent of GNP.  It was paid for by Exchequer borrowing.</P>

      <P>The Opposition parties may criticise the Government or accuse it of being a centre left Government because it removed the residential property tax &mdash; a tax extended by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government which in turn did nothing to alleviate the hardship and double taxation about which it pontificated so much.  They may accuse the Government of stopping emigration and bringing people back to work; increasing employment by 100,000 in the last three years and reducing unemployment by 30,000; presiding over a level of investment which has increased by 30 per cent; increasing child benefit by 50 per cent in the last three years; giving free access to universities and third level colleges; presiding over a real increase in consumer spending of 10 per cent and the first reduction in the national debt in 40 years.  They may do so if they wish.  I am proud of this Government which has achieved an enormous amount in three years and has done so in an atmosphere of political stability, cohesion and cooperation, rather than the bickering and infighting of previous years.</P>

      <P>He referred to political stability as the reason for the sound economy.  He must have been asleep for the last ten years, and particularly last week when we heard interesting stories about the Minister for Finance having particular difficulty with the budget, having been <Col N="267" /> gazumped on certain issues by the leader of his party.  I would not call that &ldquo;cohesiveness&rdquo;.  When such arguments come to light in the newspapers one can imagine that relations are not as happy as Deputy Hogan and others might like to portray.</P>
      <P>I was also amused when the Deputy referred to Dr. FitzGerald's economic analysis in one of the newspapers.  Dr. FitzGerald is an eminent personality but he now writes as a journalist, not as Taoiseach.  Perhaps if he had taken some of his own advice he might still be Taoiseach and Leader of Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>The budget is a grave disappointment for the electorate, particularly the disadvantaged in the community.  It has neither helped the disadvantaged nor attempted to keep the economy on an even keel.  Rather, the Government has attempted to squander the fruits of an economy which was producing growth and engendering confidence thanks to the responsible economic policies of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government over the last ten years.</P>
      <P>It is irritating for those of us on this side on the House to hear members of the Government parties claiming the credit for the economy's good performance.  They inherited a healthy economy thanks to Fianna Fáil's approach to the economy since 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard it.  Deputy Hogan tried to claim that the soundness of the economy was due to the Government's political strategy.  He neglected to say that the Government inherited a healthy economy which has been growing since 1987.  The initiative cannot be claimed by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government has demonstrated a lack of financial prudence regarding public expenditure which has been evident over its lifetime.  The budget could have been a wonderful opportunity if targeted correctly.  Instead, it is all over the place &mdash; a cynical exercise with the sole aim of garnering votes from the electorate.  As Deputy McCreevy pointed out, this was an SOS budget, a &ldquo;Save Our Skins&rdquo; budget.  Although it allows us to make good political points, it is a shame for the country and its healthy economy when the many opportunities available to the Government have been squandered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, a pensioner will get only an extra 40p per day.  The Minister for Social Welfare's boast that there has been an increase in benefits over the last three budgets which has amounted to £7 per week is hollow.  This £7 would not buy a bag of coal.  The 60p per week increase in the supplementary allowance payable to blind pensioners is derisory.  There is a further tax on motorists through an extra tax on petrol which will add to the cost of living across the board. This tax dilutes our present competitive advantage <Col N="268" /> over Britain rather than trying to maintain it.</P>
    <P>The last Fine Gael and Labour Party Government doubled the national debt while in office and this pattern is emerging once again.  Even when the economy is strong the Minister for Finance plans to add another £2 billion to the debt by 1999 &mdash; that is, of course, if he is returned to Government and is in a position to carry out the proposed policies.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that cultural life has been dismissed by the Government in this budget. Money was available and provision could have been made for the arts and heritage sector but the opportunity was missed.  No provision was made for the millennium which is only 1,000 days away.  Unless projects are put in place Ireland will be the only EU country without a vision and purpose for the new century.  The British Government has put forward plans for the millennium and many of our European neighbours also have plans.  Yet the Government has made no statement on its plans.  I have raised the issue with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht on many occasions, in the House and elsewhere, and asked him what plans are in train and what resources will be available to him.  The Minister could only inform me that a list of suggested projects had been submitted by different lobby groups and interested individuals but no decision had been made regarding staffing or funding. That is very remiss of the Government.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ideas that could be presented and carried through as millennium projects and these would have lasting effect and not merely hold people's interest during the year 2000.  Such projects could be used by the cultural community and those interested in the area of culture and arts for many years.  I put forward a number of suggestions, one of which proposed the establishment of a music conservatoire.  This proposal was also recommended in the PIANO report and I believe we could widen it to incorporate the entire area of the performing arts.  The Minister has not issued a reply to this suggestion but Fianna Fáil would like to see the project, which received a favourable response from the cultural sector, carried through.</P>
    <P>No provision was made in the budget to establish a film commission which the film industry called for to promote Ireland internationally as a location.  Such a commission is necessary to address the current downturn in film production in this country.  Fianna Fáil recently published a position paper in respect of the film industry and we support the establishment of a film commission because it is necessary for the long-term benefit of the industry.  I am sorry that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has not taken up this Fianna Fáil proposal.  There are also no tax provisions in respect of film script development. None of the proposals in the budget alluded to tax provisions which would help the film industry.  In the budgets introduced by the Government, there was only one negative proposal <Col N="269" />&mdash; in the 1996 budget &mdash; in respect of the film industry which downgraded section 35.</P>
    <P>There are inadequate provisions in the budget to address the crisis in our national cultural institutions, particularly the National Archives and the National Library.  According to the budget, the archives are expected to develop without funding.  Everyone is aware of the serious debate about the National Library and its need for funding. The director of the National Library, Dr. Pat Donlon, who is retiring from her position &mdash; I pay tribute to the work she carried out &mdash; yesterday outlined the difficulties experienced by the library over a number of years.  I raised this matter on previous occasions with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, particularly on a specific adjournment debate.  Fianna Fáil is very concerned about the lack of funding for the library.  The Minister will argue that there has been a percentage increase but that does not amount to much when one considers the figures. The percentage increase is calculated on a very low base.  We should consider comparable institutions in Scotland and Wales and ensure that the National Library receives adequate funding for its work.</P>
    <P>In the Cultural Institutions Bill, which has passed Second Stage, reference is made to the National Library and the improvements it requires.  Unfortunately, however, the Bill focuses on structures and makes little or no specific reference regarding how the National Library will continue, even with new structures.  It is fine to discuss new structures but these will be useless if adequate funding is not provided.  Members are aware that the work carried out in the National Library in connection with cataloguing, etc., is labour intensive.  The Government must realise that we have entered the information age and recognise the need to provide funding for new technologies to deal with prized items of culture and heritage contained in the National Library.</P>
    <P>No provision was made in the budget for Arts Council funding toward the arts plan.  Everyone has heard of, and was very encouraged on reading, the famous arts plan.  It was published with great flourish and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht made many statements about his plans and the way they would be initiated. However, it soon emerged that what had been a three-year plan had become a five-year plan due to the fact that promised funding from Government was not forthcoming.  The Government used a combined figure in the budget for the period 1994-96 to disguise the £12 million shortfall in the arts plan.  This is a cynical accounting exercise which attempts to cloud the true situation regarding the arts plan.  Those working closely with the arts plan, those who took the trouble to send in submissions and those looking forward to a new era with the publication of the plan have become very disillusioned.  Some believe that the publication of the arts plan was one thing but, if funding is not forthcoming, then the Government is playing a rather cynical role.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> No provision was made in the budget regarding compensation to or consultation with farmers in respect of the designation of special protection areas and special areas of conservation, despite the fact that these are to come into force next month.  I was interested to hear proposals made by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, regarding the Government's land policy.  I would be interested to read those proposals because worthwhile information has not been forthcoming from the Department of Arts, Culture and Gaeltacht on the proposed national heritage areas and special areas of conservation. Members who live in rural constituencies are aware of the great concern expressed by farming and other organisations about proposals to deal with the habitat directive which is to be signed in February.</P>
    <P>I and my colleagues in Fianna Fáil tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht asking him to come clean on this matter, discuss the issues and provide an update on his consultation with the social partners, either during a plenary session of the House or at a meeting of one of the committees. The Minister has prevaricated on this issue and I understand that the signing of the directive is imminent.  However, even though the Minister was invited to address the Select Committee on Social Affairs, it seems that the proposed date does not suit him.  I hope he will find the courage to come before the House to outline the current position before the directive is signed.</P>
    <P>Paltry provision was made in the budget to protect built heritage, despite the Minister's promises. A number of platitudes have been expressed in respect of the necessity to protect that heritage. This matter was discussed by the House on many occasions.  However, despite sympathetic mutterings from the Minister and the Government, there has been no follow through.  The budget presented another opportunity to provide substantial funding to deal with this issue but again we have been disappointed.</P>

      <P>The budget has been described in Government circles as a good budget, a budget for the future, but economic writers call it a budget for inflation.  That is worth thinking about because there is a real danger that as a result of many of the provisions in the budget inflation will rise.  I will deal with that matter later.  Squandermania has been the hallmark of the Government since coming to power, particularly in the spending targets it set itself.  There has been an increase in current day-to-day spending of approximately 20 per cent as against total inflation in the same period of about 6.5 per cent.</P>

      <P>When a Government sets targets it is important that it meets them.  In money terms we are talking about an increase of £2 billion in day-to-day spending, which can be classed only as economic lunacy of an unprecedented level.</P>
      <P>When the Government was asked about its commitment to the programme of renewal we were told that money was spent well and wisely, but in many instances the public are asking whether this is a repeat of the 1982-7 period when Labour and Fine Gael were in Government. Deputy Hogan mentioned spending under Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, but I would refer him to the fact that Deputy Bertie Ahern brought in the first balanced budget in 17 years. Under Labour and Fine Gael the national debt was doubled, from £13 billion to £26 billion, and it is now £30 billion.</P>

      <P>Under the parameters set down in the programme for Government the national debt will be increased by a further £1 billion by 1998.  The old adage &ldquo;live now and pay later&rdquo; seems still to be part and parcel of the policies of Labour and Fine Gael.  As David Quinn stated:</P>
      <P>So reality has forced Labour to practice the financial equivalent of safe sex.  Alas, like the fictional character, the Steppen Wolf, beneath the civilised exterior lurks a wild man struggling to break free.  What goes for Labour goes doubly for the Democratic Left, except in the case of the DL the beast is already loose and it takes all the energy of Fine Gael and Labour to restrain it.</P>
      <P>Not a good job has been done to date on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at the current Estimates we will see that there is lack of control.  For example, in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, £4.5 million was spent on consultancy services, an increase of £1.1 million; in the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht there was an increase of 75 per cent and in the Department of the Taoiseach there was an increase of <Col N="272" /> 14 per cent.  Administration costs in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications have increased by 20 per cent and in the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht by 17 per cent.  That does not smack of the type of control we would like to see.</P>
    <P>I note this morning the consternation of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who called in the vintners because he is concerned at the price increase of 5p in the pint.  Those who warned against the dangers of inflation probably see that the first sector has recognised there is additional spending power and is capitalising on it by increasing prices.  That will result in an increase in inflation, which could have detrimental effects on our targets in terms of the economic and monetary union.  That is what we have always been afraid of.</P>
    <P>I understand the difficulties experienced by the Minister for Finance with Programme 2000, particularly public sector pay and the fact that the Government has exceeded day-to-day spending, but it is a pity his leader did not pay more attention to him.  With Democratic Left in Government there are difficulties and the old adage &ldquo;if you lie down with dogs you get up with fleas&rdquo; is true.</P>

      <P>There are two Cork Ministers in the House and it would be remiss of me not to mention a couple of Cork issues &mdash; they would be disappointed if I did not do so.  The decision of the Minister for Education to take the unprecedented step of upgrading Waterford regional technical college to institute of technology status without setting down criteria or parameters was naive in the extreme.  It caused embarrassment for Cork Deputies on the Government side and has led to a position where everybody wants to join the bandwagon.  The two Ministers present share my views on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review group is being set up to deal with this matter.  Yesterday Athlone regional technical college officials met the Minister's programme manager and an official from the Department of Education and it was clearly stated that the Department is not in favour of putting a time limit on the report of the review group.  It was suggested that it could report in three months' time, but that is not acceptable.  It should be suggested to the Minister for Education that the review group be given a two week remit to examine the position in Cork.  If we look at Cork regional technical college in terms of the diversity of courses, quality of personnel, quality control <Col N="273" /> and points of entry to the college, not alone does it equate with Waterford but it is better in many respects.</P>
    <P>Since examinations will be held in May, thankfully the students in Cork have gone back to class, but they have given a two week deadline for the matter to be resolved.  I exhort the Ministers present in the strongest possible manner to bring to the attention of the Minister for Education that Cork regional technical college must be granted institute of technology status within that two week period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>

      <P>This week I heard of two cases of people who are comatose and cannot gain access to University Hospital Cork because the accident and emergency department is inadequate.  An obstetrics unit is also needed there.  Since massive amounts of money are spent on these buildings, will the Department of Finance consider a build, lease and buy-back programme such as that successfully operated by the IDA in the development sector?  Such a programme could be a runner. Rather than the Government committing itself to major spending perhaps arrangements could be made to bring such a programme on stream to ensure a top level service is provided in the Cork area.  The two Ministers of State present are aware it is badly needed.  The introduction of such a programme would be a way out of the Exchequer having to find large sums of money that would need to be spent immediately.  It is a concept well worth considering and I urge the Ministers of State to consider it.</P>

    <P>The nurses' strike is one close to our hearts but it was not handled well, given that the Government <Col N="274" /> had three bites of the cherry in an attempt to settle it and the cost of it continues to escalate. Some initiative, imagination and goodwill would go a long way towards resolving the problem.</P>
    <P>Has the Government a policy on employment? What type of graduates do we produce?  Is there a link between the universities sector and the demands of our economy?  Those demands are to fill high tech jobs in the pharmaceutical, health care, electronic and computer sectors.  We do not produce enough graduates to meet the demand in those sectors.  We advertise for skilled workers and there is a dearth of courses for apprentices. Much of the blame must be attached to the Construction Industry Federation because it decided to employ subcontractors and did not take any responsibility for training.  We are now in a dilemma and are trying to entice people to return home from abroad.  It is good to see people coming home, but we have a dearth of skilled people and that problem must be addressed.  Thirty four per cent of students in University College Cork graduated in the arts compared to 6 per cent in engineering.  Something must be done about that imbalance as the graduates coming on stream are not meeting the needs of our economy.  Surely there is a relationship between the university sector and the demands of our economy.</P>

      <P>This is the third budget introduced by my party colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  In many ways he is a man to envy these days.  He is the Labour Party's first Minister for Finance, but he is also the only social democratic or socialist Minister for Finance in the European Union who is in a position to simultaneously reduce taxes on income while spending more on the essential services on which so many of our people depend, on what Deputy Quinn, as quoted by Deputy O'Keeffe, termed &ldquo;safe sex&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The financial statement is not just an economic budget it is also a statement of our aims and priorities as a community.  Our community comprises not only a record number of people at work but also a record number of people who depend on those at work, be they old age pensioners or people who depend on social welfare. The budget is not only a budget for those at work but for those who depend on them.</P>
      <P>Much of the focus of the pre-budget speculation centred on the need for so-called continuing tax reform.  In this context the phrase &ldquo;tax reform&rdquo; is a misnomer.  What commentators really mean is a reduction in income tax or any other tax which they happen to pay.  They do not mean reform in any serious sense of that word.  I for one find that unfortunate.</P>
      <P>The residential property tax did not serve the purpose for which it was intended.  It did not contain house price inflation, it did not channel investment into more productive sectors of the economy and, most importantly, it did not bring in much money.  The tax fell foul of that most important of taxation maxims, it failed to command public acceptance.  It had to go and no doubt few will shed many tears over it.  Its going also represents a significant failure.  It represents our failure once again to devise an acceptable way of taxing something other than income or consumer spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, pointed out yesterday, the overall take from taxation is not high by European Union standards, but the take from income tax is among the highest. Inevitably this will continue to be so for as long as the political establishment and the social partners refuse to countenance any broadening of the base.  In these days of high economic growth this is probably a matter of little consequence. However, as the Opposition is keen to point out, <Col N="276" /> high growth cannot be expected to continue for ever.  Sooner or later we must grasp the nettle of broadening the base.  We should use the opportunity now to give serious consideration to introducing carbon and energy taxes.  We should reconsider capital taxes, particularly capital acquisitions tax.  The lessons learned from the introduction of RPT are powerful and must not be forgotten, but they must not frighten us off the medium-term aim to broaden the base and thereby reduce considerably the level of income tax currently extracted from the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>All parties in the House are apparently agreed on the need to reduce taxes on income.  The Minister has made considerable progress in his three budgets since 1995.  The standard income tax band has been widened by £1,700 in the case of a single person and by £3,400 for a married couple. That is an increase of more than 20 per cent, an amount which more than compensates for the reduction in mortgage interest and VHI reliefs. Those increases are significantly ahead of the cumulative inflation rate over that three year period which runs at approximately 7 per cent.  Personal allowances have also been increased well beyond the level of inflation as has the general exemption limit as a result of which many thousands of workers and pensioners have been taken out of the tax net.</P>
    <P>There may be general agreement in this House on the desirability of reducing income tax, however, I suspect there is little agreement on the rationale behind tax cuts and the means of implementing them.  The prime purpose of tax cuts must be to promote employment.  The primary way of doing that is by eliminating the poverty and unemployment traps in the tax system. It is not good enough that somebody could be worse off by virtue of taking a job or by earning more.  This has implications beyond the tax system.</P>
    <P>In terms of the income tax system, if we accept the need to reduce the impact of such traps, inevitably we will be driven to focus the benefit of taxation reductions on those on low or moderate pay.  In fairness to the Minister, he has sought to do that.  He has reduced the lower rate of tax and raised personal allowances, but the Minister and the Government need to do more to deal with this issue.  Last year the Government published a report of the commission charged with recommending ways to integrate the tax and social welfare systems.  The commission provided a useful analysis of the anomalies in the existing systems.  It dealt at some length with issues such as basic income, provision for children and support for workers on low income.  It also made detailed short-term proposals.  It suggested the gap between personal allowances and exemption limits should be progressively closed.  It also suggested that provision be made for the retention of secondary allowances in certain circumstances. The Minister has made significant progress in this direction but I am sure he will agree that more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> The other main reason to reduce income tax is to contain wage inflation, while adequately rewarding workers at a time of economic growth.  This aim was central to the Minister's thinking in negotiating the Partnership 2000 programme which is likely to be accepted by ICTU today.  I strongly support the notion of social consensus and partnership. It is important to involve the social partners in determining how economic growth is to be sustained and how the fruits of that growth should be distributed.  Many other groups were given an opportunity to express their views as to what the programme should include.  I endorse not just the contents of the agreement but also the process which brought it about.  It is important that we do not take it for granted.</P>
    <P>In that context the Fianna Fáil Leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, is to be commended for initiating the process when Minister for Finance.  He would do well, however, to read the report of the proceedings of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs in March 1996 when it heard an extraordinary and forceful presentation by the former Minister for Finance in New Zealand, Ms Ruth Richardson.  During the course of her presentation she viciously attacked the concept of social partnership and all that goes with it.  Her exposition was one of the most ideologically right wing presentations which I have heard in the confines of this House in recent years.  She derided any concept of social consensus, national accord and most of the values on which European society, post-World War II, have been constructed.</P>
    <P>Following this exposition from the Honourable Ms Richardson, the Progressive Democrats spokesperson on Finance, Deputy Michael McDowell, said: &ldquo;I support what you said with a heart and a half&rdquo;.  Last week the same Deputy endorsed, in principle, the provisions of the Partnership 2000 programme.  As Deputies will remember, this is not the first issue on which he has recently changed position.</P>
    <P>In their 1995 statement on the economy the Progressive Democrats made it explicitly clear that they favoured the privatisation of most, if not all, of the public utilities during the next five years.  This commitment, too, appears to have been watered down, or has it?  In the not too distant past the Progressive Democrats explicitly supported a property tax.  I wonder if they still do. I also understood that the Progressive Democrats agreed with the standardisation of tax reliefs.  This was less than clear, however, from the contributions made to this debate last week by Deputies Harney and Michael McDowell.</P>
    <P>The confusion, if that is what it is, in the Progressive Democrats policy is nothing by comparison to the bogus duplicity of the Fianna Fáil position. Deputies McCreevy and Harney have made it clear that they think the Minister is spending too much.  Deputy Ahern has explicitly committed Fianna Fáil to eliminating borrowing altogether by 1999.  He has said that the national debt <Col N="278" /> should be frozen at a level under £30 billion. Since the national debt currently stands at £29.9 billion, this would effectively freeze borrowing almost immediately.</P>
    <P>Equally, Deputies Ahern and McCreevy have demanded that deeper and more expensive tax cuts be made, again with immediate effect.  The effect of this in this year's budget would have been to reduce spending by a sum in excess of £1 billion, yet Fianna Fáil speakers in this debate have consistently demanded increased spending on a range of areas.  Yesterday, Deputy O'Donoghue demanded an increase in the social welfare provision for old age pensioners, while Deputy de Valera demanded considerably increased spending on the arts.  Each of Fianna Fáil's spokespersons outlined a litany of projects for which they want funding.  Rarely does a week go by without Deputy Martin making further demands for increased resources in education provision. All of these demands are inconsistent with that party's rhetoric on the budget.</P>
    <P>The truth is simple, one cannot improve social services without spending money.  If one wants to cut spending one must cut services.  Fianna Fáil is looking to take £1 billion out of this year's budget.  This amounts to almost 10 per cent of total net current spending.  This cannot be done without significant cuts in essential services.  It is high time this was spelled out to the public.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Minister is spending too much, that he has been profligate and, even, promiscuous with the public finances.  This allegation deserves study.  This is the first time in decades that a Minister for Finance has set out to return a surplus on the current budget, and not just a small or technical surplus.  The Minister has provided for a current budget surplus of no less than £192 million.  For the first time in living memory the national debt fell last year.  The debt-GDP ratio is significantly lower than it was when the Labour Party came to power in 1992 in partnership with Fianna Fáil.  It is well within the criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Those who argue for reduced spending often point to public service pay as being the core of the problem.  In a sense, they are right, the public service pay bill is rising beyond the rate of inflation.  There is more than a little evidence of what is euphemistically called grade drift within the system.  Numbers in the public service generally have increased in recent years but not by very much.  Almost all of the increase is accounted for by the areas of health and education, areas which have been specifically exempted from any cuts a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government might introduce.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have informed us that they will cut 3,750 jobs in the Civil Service. We, and more particularly Civil Service workers, need to know where and when the axe will fall. Perhaps Deputy McCreevy will tell us if Fianna Fáil is committed to a similar reduction in numbers. People deserve to be told before the axe <Col N="279" /> falls so that they can make a sensible and informed choice.</P>
    <P>Those who attack the public service pay bill need to tell us where the fat is to be found.  Is it, for example, at clerical assistant grade where an entrant will earn £155 per week rising to £230 per week after 11 years or is it at clerical officer grade where an entrant will earn £156 per week rising to £280 per week after 15 years?  If Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats think that these figures are excessive, they should say so and let us have a debate but perhaps the fat is at the higher grades.  Higher grade civil servants have received pay increases significantly ahead of inflation in recent years but the bald fact is that most of these people are still paid far less than they could reasonably hope to command in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should look outside the Civil Service altogether.  Are the Opposition parties saying that teachers, nurses or Army personnel are paid too much?  Are they saying that we have too many teachers, nurses or Army personnel and that they will reduce the numbers?  It is not good enough to say that bureaucracy would be reduced.  We must be told how and when that will be done.</P>
    <P>I am not attempting to say that all is rosy in the civil and public service.  There are unquestionably management and other deficiencies in the service which we have been too slow in addressing.  The way in which budgets are managed, for example, leaves much to be desired.  There is far too much inflexibility.  Most of all, there is a stream of accountability and a culture of secrecy which is utterly unsuited to the information age at the end of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>On public spending, I am willing to ask if we should be doing more to improve public services, although I fully accept that we should be slow to incur recurring costs in the system.  I am not making that argument but we could do more in terms of once off spending.  I cite hospital waiting lists as an example.  The Minister has continued the initiative started some years ago by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, when Minister for Health, of targeting moneys at reducing specific hospital waiting lists.  This initiative has been very successful in reducing waiting lists by almost a half but I acknowledge that more needs to be done.  Would it be possible to provide additional moneys on a once off basis to continue this initiative?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has provided funding for a programme to reduce the number of substandard schools.  Again, this is once off expenditure.  I wonder, however, whether we should take the opportunity to do all the work that needs to be done now, although I acknowledge that much has been done.  Last week the Minister provided £250,000 to upgrade the heating system in schools in the Kilmore west area in my constituency.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about the fact <Col N="280" /> that the marginal rate of taxation was not altered in the budget and claims have been made that there is nothing in the budget for higher earners. This is completely untrue.  Even if we discount the fact that RPT has been abolished and third level fees eliminated, both of which are more likely to affect higher earners, there is a great deal within the budget which is of direct benefit to those who pay the 48 per cent marginal rate.</P>
    <P>A reduction in the standard rate benefits everyone, not just those who pay all their tax at the 26 per cent rate.  By contrast, a reduction in the higher rate benefits only higher earners.  Surely it is a more equitable use of resources to introduce changes which will benefit the maximum number of people.  It makes one wonder why the Opposition parties are so anxious to reduce the top rate.  It could be a matter of political opportunism to buy the votes of higher earners.  However, since this possibility is so awful perhaps we should leave it aside in the spirit of charity and look at the economic arguments.</P>
    <P>The argument traditionally advanced is that if the well-off are given an incentive there will be a knock-on effect on less well paid workers and on job creation.  This is what Bill Clinton famously called the &ldquo;trickle down&rdquo; effect and what George Bush earlier referred to as &ldquo;voodoo&rdquo; economics. The truth is that trickle down does not work.  The experience of Nigel Lawson in the UK is instructive. He certainly managed to multiply the number of champagne swilling yuppies in the city.  He also overheated the British economy which ultimately led to inflation and a current budget deficit, the likes of which we have not had in this country for some years now.  Does anyone seriously believe that at this point in the economic cycle we need more money swirling around in our economy?  It amazes me that commentators who normally scream loudly at the risk of inflation or overheating seem to have little or no difficulty with injecting money into the economy through tax cuts.</P>
    <P>Does anybody believe that cutting the higher rate of tax will increase job creation?  It may encourage people to do more overtime and take a part-time job in addition to their existing one. It will scarcely create more jobs, particularly for those who are long-term unemployed.  I concede that the marginal rate kicks in far too early but Deputy Quinn has made significant progress in that regard and we can now at least say that a married couple with a mortgage and one person earning will not pay a higher rate of tax until they earn in excess of £30,000.</P>
    <P>This is a good budget which does not stand on its own but falls into the pattern of the budgets previously introduced by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the 1992-94 Labour-Fianna Fáil Government.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to continue the progress in years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The various reactions of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to this year's <Col N="281" /> budget were among the most interesting things about it.  Fianna Fáil essentially tried to have it both ways.  They were envious of the fact that a Minister could come in with a prudent, balanced and socially responsible budget, implemented against a background of a national pay and partnership agreement, and secure the economy for the next three years.  There was envy on the Fianna Fáil benches because they could not partake in such a development.  The mantra was repeated by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe that public spending is out of control and that this Government has been spending, spending, spending.  We have spent on the crucial areas of primary education, health and the housing programme and we do not apologise to anyone for doing this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Séamus Brennan and I participated in a discussion on Dublin local radio last Sunday morning.  He accused us, as Deputy O'Keeffe has done, of increasing spending by 20 per cent over three years.  I made the point, and Colm McCarthy also reminded us, that in that period the growth in the economy has been in the order of a cumulative 33 or 34 per cent.  The economy has grown by a massive one third and we have increased spending by 20 per cent.  It is a reasonably fair deal that the people, particularly the poor and lower paid, should get a fairer share of the fruits of that economy, which has not been happening.  Fianna Fáil needs to decide where it stands on this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Batt O'Keeffe made the extraordinary proposal to privatise the major hospital in Cork. What will his Cork constituents think if that message reaches home from Dáil Éireann this evening?</P>
      <P>We have seen the Progressive Democrats alternative budget, which proposes to take almost £3 billion out of this economy and out of public expenditure.  We know, as we saw before in the &ldquo;end tax and spend&rdquo; documents, that, despite the protestations of their finance spokesperson, this could only be done by massive privatisation.  The Labour Party backbench Deputies met Aer Lingus and TEAM representatives last night about current conditions in that industry.  The message must go out from this House that a future Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government will introduce massive privatisation of our national airline, Telecom, CIE, of each jewel in the crown of public enterprise, and as Deputy Derek McDowell said, of the State service itself.  We are faced with that daunting prospect from a future &ldquo;slash and burn&rdquo; Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also had the ludicrous spectacle last week of a Progressive Democrats Deputy invoking Mr. Tony Blair, the leader of the British Labour Party, regarding the performance of the Irish Labour Party.  He does not seem to know that the development of the Irish Labour Party, its successful doubling and its most powerful influence on this House over the last four years, was achieved because our party leader, Deputy Spring, travelled the new Labour road of reorganising <Col N="282" /> our party long before Tony Blair did with the British Labour Party.</P>
    <P>It could be said that the British finance spokesperson, Gordon Brown, would be delighted to introduce the kind of budget which Deputy Quinn introduced.  The British Labour Party is committed to keeping Government spending as a percentage of GDP constant.  If it succeeds, its figures will compare favourably with our own. The Progressive Democrats' mantra that spending is out of control and the invocation of Tony Blair and the British Labour Party as a stick to beat us with is completely inane.</P>
    <P>In the last few budgets, we have tried to concentrate our tax reform measures to take those on middle and lower incomes out of existing employment and poverty traps.  Gordon Brown's proposal to introduce a 10 per cent initial tax rate is a different way of doing exactly the same thing. It is nothing to do with Progressive Democrats efforts to destroy basic social services, to the benefit of the already well-off.  It was a Labour-Fine Gael Government who, in the 1970s, introduced a 20 per cent tax rate.  Tony Blair believes in communities, investment, a well-run education system and in ending social division.  If we looked at the Thatcherite wasteland caused by 18 years of Conservative rule, at New Zealand, at the low-paid job market in the United States and at the pursuance of catholic, progressive democratic politics in Britain, we can see the prospects which face our constituents if a Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Government is elected to this House. That prospect is a totally dismal one and has to be opposed at every turn.</P>
    <P>I commend my colleague, Deputy Quinn, for his performance in his third budget.  He is not alone the first Labour Minister for Finance but also perhaps the best one.  It is ironic that Deputy Bertie Ahern's former colleague, George Colley, was the last Minister for Finance to bring a current budget surplus and a balanced current budget into this House.  After that, Fianna Fáil went through its mid-1970s spendthrift phase when a huge proportion of the population deliberately did not pay tax, which resulted in public debt.  The Minister is to be commended for getting the numbers right in relation to growth, inflation and exports, and for using some of those accruing benefits in the poorer communities through increased spending on education and health.</P>
    <P>The constant refrain we heard from Opposition speakers last week about levels of taxation is nonsense. According to the taxation league table of the 15 Eropean Union countries published in Eurostat and the OECD's statistics, Ireland is fourth lowest with only the UK, Spain and Portugal below us.  Our tax to GDP ratio is 37.5 per cent and falling, and compares favourably with the Benelux countries whose ratios are all around the mid-40 per cent, as well as to the Scandinavian states whose tax to GDP ratios are 50 per cent plus.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> The consistent problem, for which conservative parties in this House are responsible, is that over the years segments of the community have not paid their fair share of tax.  At the Committee of Public Accounts last week I demanded that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners should carry out a study on the so-called black economy. The Comptroller and Auditor General will also insist that the study be carried out for that committee, and I am repeating the call in the House today.  We must examine and investigate the size of the black economy.  It may be that there was always much more money to redistribute and spend on vital services such as health, but for various reasons it was not collected.</P>
    <P>We recently saw the collapse of a large insurance investment company where 15 or 20 people who invested large sums of money did not even report it to the Garda.  That is because it may be hot money and cannot be reported as no taxation was paid on it.  Those people have robbed the taxpayer and the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the abolition of local service charges which were a crippling burden on my constituents in Dublin's northside.  Fianna Fáil had the opportunity many times to get rid of this measure, which was a form of double taxation on householders, but refused to do so.  I also welcome the abolition of residential property tax which was fundamentally a tax on the Dublin area where over 70 per cent of it was collected.  The measures relating to stamp duty on the sale and purchase of large value houses is a fairer way of collecting taxation formerly collected through RPT.</P>
    <P>I welcome the moves which the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has made on a responsible policy of tax cutting for personal taxation and for his attempt to remove some of the anomalies in that area.  In particular, I welcome the doubling of the age allowance which had not been increased for about a decade.  The Minister for Finance, together with the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, are to be commended for refusing to allow the social insurance fund to be dismantled and raided.  After all, almost half the basic social welfare budget is provided through the social insurance fund.  The Progressive Democrats essentially want that fund to be dismantled and smashed.  I wonder if Fianna Fáil is prepared to go along with that because, if it is, we will have a situation such as that in Germany and Holland where a pensions time bomb is hanging over the State.  Going back to the 1920s and 1930s, we have always tried to have a responsible attitude to this and the Government will rightly reject any attempt to destroy it.  I hope my constituency colleague, the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, who liked to wax eloquent on the social insurance fund, will also take that view.</P>
    <P>I welcome all the measures the Minister has taken in the business area.  He is a progressive Minister for Finance and has slashed corporation tax to 28 per cent for the business sector along with introducing the developing companies market. <Col N="284" /> In addition he has implemented a master plan for the Dublin region.  I welcome all the measures on social solidarity in relation to social welfare.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's fourth budget later this year which will continue his outstanding performance in this Department.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan holds an important portfolio so I will not encroach on his time too much.  In this important debate on taxation, expenditure and financial policy I will, in the few minutes available to me, address but two issues which are relevant to my constituency of Wicklow.  The urban renewal scheme has been a major success.  Towns throughout the country fortunate enough to have been so designated have been upgraded and transformed.  In my constituency the towns of Bray and Wicklow have been fortunate.  As one who has pressed vigorously for the inclusion of these towns, I derive great personal satisfaction from the improvements brought about there through the urban renewal mechanism. However, this satisfaction is sadly countered by my total dissatisfaction, dismay and disappointment that the town of Arklow was not deemed worthy of inclusion in the scheme.</P>
      <P>For years I have been making the case for Arklow which has been devastated by unemployment due to the running down of traditional industry over the years.  I would now make yet another plea to the Minister and to the Government to designate Arklow for inclusion in the scheme.  Its case is meritorious and has already been well made.  The Government should not let the economic boom pass Arklow and its south Wicklow hinterland by.</P>
      <P>In view of the success of the urban renewal schemes generally, I can see no logical reason to exclude smaller towns in my own consistency such as Greystones, Enniskerry, Kilcoole, Rathdrum and, in the western part of the county, Blessington, Dunlavin and Baltinglass, Tinahealy and Carnew in addition to Hacketstown and Rathvilly in the newly arrived part of my constituency in County Carlow.  These towns and others would get a new lease of life by being thus designated. Perhaps a tax incentive scheme akin to the urban renewal scheme already <i>in situ</i> could be considered while the economic situation is as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an example of what I am saying regarding these smaller towns, I know of businessmen who would be ready, willing and able to undertake substantial investment in my home town of Rathdrum if the appropriate tax incentives were put in place.  I am sure that also goes for such towns throughout the country.  Let us take advantage of the affluence that is currently in our midst.  I appeal for this matter to be urgently addressed <Col N="285" /> while the economic climate is right.  The economic boom should not be allowed to pass County Wicklow by.</P>
    <P>I also wish to address the question of the infrastructure necessary to allow such economic development to proceed.  Water and sewerage facilities are seriously deficient in many areas of my constituency.  The western area of County Wicklow is without a proper, modern and quality water supply.  This is totally unacceptable in the late 1990s and is tantamount to a national disgrace. With the coffers brim full surely now is the time to give the people of west Wicklow their basic right to a decent water supply.  In north Carlow the people of Hacketstown have a water system that was built in the 1930s.  On 25 July last I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment asking if he knew of the hardships being experienced by the people of Hacketstown because of the poor quality and supply of water and if he would make provision for the installation of a new plant and instruct his Department to issue the necessary approval to Carlow County Council to proceed with the site investigation in relation to this proposed scheme.  The extension of the north regional water supply scheme from Rathvilly to Hacketstown is the relevant scheme.  The Minister replied indicating that although Carlow County Council had submitted proposals, given the high level of commitments under the water and sewerage programme he could not say when it would be possible to approve them.  Most respectfully, and as strenuously as words will allow, I ask the Minister to address that matter during this affluent time, to alleviate the hardship being suffered by these people and allow the town to develop to bring it into the late 1990s.</P>
    <P>In the eastern part of Wicklow are towns such as Newtownmountkennedy, Newcastle, Kilcoole, Ashford, Rathnew, Glenealy and Rathdrum which are currently rendered sterile from the point of view of development because of the lack of adequate facilities, particularly sewerage services. Investors and developers are queuing up to build houses, to upgrade the area and to engage in the general development for which these areas are crying out.  Their aspirations are totally frustrated because the planning department of the local authority, Wicklow County Council, cannot grant planning permission in the absence of basic services.  This is scandalous.  Now is the time to put these facilities in place &mdash; while the interest and the enthusiasm of investors is there.  I fear greatly that the economic boom will pass my constituency by.  There is an onus on all of us, and particularly on the powers that be, now or postelection, to ensure that this does not happen.  I again ask that my plea be heard and acted upon now.  I thank the Chair for facilitating me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three problems with this budget.  First, it is the wrong economic strategy; second, it has all the hallmarks of a bookkeeper's budget and, third, it does not address the issue of <Col N="286" /> the single currency in any sensible way, but ignores the fact that it will be in operation fairly soon.  These are three fairly fundamental objections.</P>
      <P>Let me comment first on the aspect of the single currency.  During its Presidency and again in this budget, the Government has missed the opportunity to deal with the single currency and European Monetary Union, to which we agreed in the Maastricht Treaty and with which I have no difficulty in principle.  I am disappointed that the Government has not attempted to build conditions into our participation in that currency so as to assist Ireland.  Specifically, there is need to establish a compensatory fund, a type of fiscal federalism, which would assist countries that cannot keep up when things get rough or who get caught in the crossfire of competitive devaluations in the years ahead.  A number of leading economists and international commentators in the international financial press have also supported this view.  I want to use the opportunity of this budget debate to ask the Taoiseach and the Cabinet, and particularly the Minister for Finance, to join the forces at EU level which are now seeking the establishment of such a single currency compensatory fund.</P>
      <P>It is critical from the point of view that after 1999 our own funds from the EU will start to taper off and largely dry up.  A statistic which I had to double-check because it seemed high but which is accurate is that after we join the single currency &mdash; in the event that Britain does not, which is now likely &mdash; 60 per cent of our trade will still be in currencies other than the euro; we will still be trading in sterling, in dollars and in other international currencies.  That means that only 40 per cent of our business will be in the euro which leaves us extremely open and vulnerable, particularly if one accepts the view of the German finance minister and the Bundesbank that once a country joins this currency it is on its own, that it has no safe haven if its economy gets into difficulty and its exports cannot keep up because of competitive devaluations, and that there will be no mechanism to move funds around inside the system to help individual countries.</P>
      <P>When the United States launched the dollar a number of states were behind, but it was clear that a central fund would have to be established. A federal fund was established to assist individual states in the United States to keep up with the currency and to even out the turbulence which took place as some states emerged into the new dollar regime.  I am extremely angry at the lack of appreciation of this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been rather short tempered with me on this issue in that whenever I seek to raise this matter he reminds me that we voted for the Maastricht Treaty and that there is no other way to go.  I have no difficulty with that.  I am a supporter of the single currency, but I am not a supporter of not seeking to mould the kind of single currency with which we can live.  In signing the Maastricht Treaty we did not agree to enter <Col N="287" /> the single currency and that the Germans could make the rules.  We said we would enter the single currency and European Monetary Union.  My intention at that time was that we would take part in moulding the conditions and mechanisms around which that currency would operate.  To join the single currency without demanding, and getting in place, a federal type of compensatory mechanism to assist individual countries out of difficulties, after 1999 in particular, would be absolutely reckless of the financial members, the economic members particularly, of the Cabinet and the Government as a whole.</P>
    <P>A second aspect of that, of course, is that the Government was silent on these issues.  There is no word either from the Government on the question of the Bundesbank's control of this new currency.  In an article in the financial pages of today's <i>Irish Independent</i> entitled, ECB blast by Tietmeyer, we are warned that the central bank of Europe will be totally independent and not in any way subject to political pressure.  Has the Government inquired about the nature of this central bank?  Is it, in effect, a souped-up Bundesbank dominated by German financial planners and economics or is it a genuine European central bank in which Ireland will have a strong say?  Will Ireland have a veto at its board table?  The Government is silent on that issue.</P>
    <P>It is silent on another single currency issue, the question of Northern Ireland, and I regard that as extremely reckless.  There is no discussion about how Ireland will operate in a new single currency regime if Northern Ireland remains outside that currency.  That will establish yet another economic border.  There has been no preparation. There are no cross-Border <i>fora</i> or discussions. The Taoiseach, as I understand it, has not raised the matter with the British Prime Minister even though John Major did not rule out a dual or parallel currency, where the new and old currencies would operate side by side, for Northern Ireland in a speech some years ago.  The Government seems to take no account of that and every time I raise this issue with the Taoiseach he regards me as somehow unpatriotic for questioning the sovereign decision to join a single currency.  I agree that joining a single currency is a good decision but the Government must try to manage the transition and it must get assurances on these issues.  Most of all, there must be more debate in the House on this issue.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that trade with Britain is central to Ireland's economic health yet there is no demand from this Government to establish a new ERM where the new currency would operate within an agreed band with currencies which do not join the single currency.  In other words, why has the Taoiseach not had discussions with other Prime Ministers and Mr. John Major, in particular, in regard to whether the policy of the British Government will be to keep sterling in a relationship with the new currency in an expansion of the existing ERM band, which is about 15 per cent, <Col N="288" /> or whether he intends to let it float freely?  Will the EU allow one of its members states to behave in such a way that it can devalue at will and mess up the other economies?  Will the EU tell that member state that it cannot do so and that sterling must join in a new relationship with the new currency?  In the latter case, we would at least know the size of the jump, we would be able to protect ourselves against competitive devaluations of sterling and that would be a much safer situation for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The four points, the compensatory fund, the control by the Bundesbank, the question of Northern Ireland and the link with sterling, are important issues in managing the transition to the new currency and yet I have not heard any comment from the Government on these issues not do I see any political will from the Government to resolve these issues to our satisfaction.  This is in exactly the same league as if Ireland did not speak up and demand the establishment of the CAP, the Social Fund or the Cohesion Fund.  We did; we were to the forefront of demanding the establishment of these funds yet there is no voice on the Government side of the House demanding the establishment of a similar fund to deal with the management of the new currency.  The Department of Finance should comment on these issues.  Unfortunately, the Minister does not seem to have addressed any of them in the budget.</P>
    <P>The second area in which I have real difficulty with the budget is on the Government's economic strategy.  I called it a bookkeeper's budget already and that is what it is.  It involves 50p here, £2 or £3 there and tax reductions of 1 penny.  It involves nit-picking and small money.  It works out at 40p per week for some pensioners.  Nobody even got the price of a daily newspaper from it so it is very much a bookkeeper's approach.  There is no vision in it.</P>
    <P>The budget contains no developmental strategies, such as those which gave us the IFSC and export tax relief or which attracted all the multinational companies.  There is also no indication of how we will fund the capital programme after 1999.  There is no sign of any buzz or sparkle in terms of economic planning and only a dull, bookkeeping strategy of &ldquo;one for everybody in the audience&rdquo; which, it is hoped, will get the Government past the general election.  That is a pity because I know Deputy Quinn would have been capable of much better than that were his hands not tied by his political allies because I worked with him in the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>He knows as well as I do that approaching the budget from just a bookkeeping point of view was not what was required by the economy at this time.  He is adding to demand in good times and not allowing himself the luxury of running a deficity when the bad times come.  I do not know of any economist who would recommend a strategy which boosts an economy when it is doing well, as this Government seems to be doing.  It is inflationary.  The Government is still borrowing <Col N="289" /> some £700 million per year when there is economic growth.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Broughan spoke about the extent of economic growth, he mentioned a figure which I want to challange.  He said that in three years there had been accumulative economic growth of 33 per cent and, therefore, there was no problem in increasing public spending by 20 per cent.  By my calculations, there was, at most, economic growth of 15 per cent in three years. If that is the case and Government spending has increased by 20 per cent, the Government is clearly spending at a rate five percentage points above the rate of economic growth.</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, have been challenged for complaining about the 20 per cent increase in spending over three years.  I know Deputy Quinn had not planned to do that as he made some fine speeches which I support fully. He talked about holding spending to the rate of inflation and about holding spending to the rate of inflation plus 2 per cent.  They were his policies, so what happened to Deputy Quinn in the past two or three years?  What happened to the man who made those speeches?  He must have received a mauling at Cabinet which moved him from those stated positions which were correct.</P>
    <P>To his credit, he produced a three year budget and looked at matters with a five year view.  If one examines the public spending profile for the five year period, the Minister is committing himself to increased spending of 33 per cent at a time when combined inflation will be running at about 9 per cent.  That is quite horrific and Deputy Quinn knows it because that is what he said.  He promised to spend at the rate of inflation plus 2 per cent and he spent at a rate of inflation plus 7 per cent, plus 9 per cent, plus 8 per cent.  Every time we on this side of the House complain about the Government missing its targets somebody asks where we would make the cuts.  That is what I too would do if I were on the Government side. If the Minister, Deputy Quinn, had maintained his policy of holding spending to the rate of inflation &mdash; plus, perhaps, 1 per cent or 2 per cent &mdash; he would have £1.5 billion in the Exchequer. If 20 per cent is added to our current and capital spending it amounts to almost £2 billion.  The Minister has spent between £1.5 billion and £2 billion above what he committed to spend in his three budgets.  It is not a matter of asking me where we would make the cuts.  If the Minister had said no &mdash; as a former Minister, Mr. MacSharry, did many times &mdash; and held the line at inflation plus 1 per cent or 2 per cent and told his partners in Government to back off, he would have £1.5 billion stored up over three years.</P>
    <P>To put that in perspective, I telephoned the Department of Finance this morning to ask what it would cost to reduce the top rate of tax by 1p and was kindly informed it would cost £50 million. How many £50 millions are there in £1.5 billion?  There are 30.  I am not recommending that it would all be applied in that way.  The bottom line is that had the Minister kept spending to <Col N="290" /> the rate of inflation for three years he would now have enough money to cut the 48 per cent tax rate to 30p in the pound.  The profligate spending was not necessary.  It has been paid for directly out of taxation which was increased by £364 million in one year.  The economic strategy of the budget amounts to economic and financial madness. What has been done was extremely reckless. In its editorial on 23 January <i>1997 The Irish Times</i> stated:</P>
    <P>The bottom line however is that he has not brought spending under control as this Government promised.  And as a consequence, borrowing will rise significantly this year and higher still next year.  Not even a natinal debt of £30 billion, it seems, can diminish the urge to live now and let the next generation pay.</P>
    <P>This is not just being said by Deputy Seamus Brennan of Fianna Fáil.  <i>The Irish Times</i> takes the same view in what I regard as an objective editorial.</P>
    <P>Clearly this budget is the wrong economic strategy.  The tax rate of 48p in the pound could have been reduced by 5p or 6p at least, as well as the bottom rate, had the Minister kept to his own policies.  We do not need cuts in public expenditure but a sensible hold on the rise in public spending.</P>
    <P>Given that there has been no planning for the single currency and that this is basically a bookkeeper's budget, with a few bob for everybody but nothing real, my side of the House opposes this budget.</P>

      <P>The budget which was presented by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, last week was not an election budget.  Instead it was the logical culmination of the social and economic policies which have been pursued ably by the Government since assuming office in December 1994. However, it was a budget in an election year and, as such, this allows us to take stock of the clear choices which will confront the electorate.  That choice will be between the continuation of the present arrangement which has guaranteed both political and economic stability or a return of the ill-fated Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil experiment of the 1989-92 period.  That experiment, of which we have vivid memories, saw an extra 56,000 people signing on, mortgage interest rates were at a crippling 15 per cent and the hard pressed taxpayers were being squeezed by a phenomenal extra 17 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have disturbing memories of that Government which was rent by internal bickering and <Col N="291" /> external divisions.  In the past week we witnessed echoes of that dissension when Deputy Dermot Ahern gave what could be deemed a fine rendition of Banquo's ghost, lugubrious and full of foreboding.  These sentiments have not been expressed so openly by other members of Fianna Fáil but they have been expressed privately in the corridors of the House.  This is understandable as Fianna Fáil's experience of the Progressive Democrats during the period 1989-92 was not an entirely happy one.  Sadly, it was also not a happy experience for the country.  The consequences of that temporary little arrangement were anything but temporary.  It is important to put on the record that the effects of Deputy McCreevy's infamous dirty dozen social welfare cuts have only finally been reversed in this budget.</P>
    <P>Later this year the electorate will be asked whether it wants to return to the days of Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats mismanagement or continue on the steady course being pursued by the Government. This course has seen the creation of a phenomenal 100,000 new jobs, a reduction in interest rates to their lowest level ever, a near doubling of child benefit, an increase in social welfare payments to a level approaching the minimum rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and the creation of a climate of economic and investor confidence and a feel good factor.  The electorate will probably decide to continue along the path being pursued by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that for the first time the next Government will be determined not by ancestral political allegiances but by modern political realities. The choice voters will be asked to make later this year is a clear one between a centre right or a centre left Government; a choice between the sweatshop economics of the McDowell, Harney and McCreevy troika or the sharing vision of Deputies De Rossa, Bruton and Spring.  I use the term &ldquo;sweatshop&rdquo; advisedly as Deputy Harney makes frequent laudatory references to the ostensible success of the south-east Asian economies which have been built on the basis of low wages and minimal social protection.  These economies are in danger of crumbling under the burden of social divisions, as evidenced by the recent unrest in South Korea.  People who visit pound shops will see the fruits of sweatshop economics.  Goods sold here for £1 have clearly been produced by the Asian tigers for just a few pence.</P>
    <P>A society with low wages, few health and safety regulations and no social insurance only works for the wealthy.  It is also a vision which consigns countless thousands to poverty while they are working and to destitution when their days of useful labour are over.  That is the horror choice facing the electorate later this year.  The sooner the election campaign starts and we are able to expose the differences between a centre left and a centre right Government the better.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney is on record as asserting that <Col N="292" /> low paid Hong Kong workers are not rich but they are happy.  That line would not be out of place if it was uttered by an east end factory owner in some 3p Victorian novelette.  I envy Deputy Harney's insight into the lives and aspirations of Hong Kong workers.  I do not think Irish workers would choose to be the guinea pigs in the Progressive Democrats attempts to reproduce Hong Kong conditions here.  The &ldquo;I'm all right Jack&rdquo; creed of social selfishness of the Progressive Democrats has no place in the European Union of the 1990s.  However, given her statements on EMU it seems Deputy Harney's commitment to European integration is in some doubt.</P>
    <P>There is a better choice.  During the past two years the Government demonstrated that increased levels of social protection and economic confidence are not mutually exclusive. Deputies McCreevy and McDowell, together with their private sector echoers in the SFA and ISME, would have us believe small firms are competing with the social welfare and tax systems for workers.  Their rationale is simple and cock-eyed. Many small employers pay little more than starvation wages equivalent to social welfare payments. According to them, increases in social welfare provide a disincentive to people to take up jobs.  The solution to this dilemma presented in the code, of which Deputies McDowell and McCreevy are past masters, is a form of work fare.  At no point have Deputies McDowell and McCreevy, who represent the twin scourges of social cohesion, addressed the crux of the problem, that is the need for employers to raise wages to a minimum acceptable level which enables workers to support their families in a dignified manner and which makes working a more attractive option than not working.</P>
    <P>The budget is worker and family friendly.  It deliberately targets two sectors of the population. It targets families with children who are most likely to live in poverty and who have witnessed unprecedented increases in child benefit as well as changes in the criteria for eligibility for child dependant allowances since the Government entered office.  It also targets people on low pay, the working poor, not only through changes in taxation and increases in personal allowances but also through improvements in the family income supplement and the method of assessment for the adult dependant allowance.  These measures will not only alleviate the position of low pay workers but will encourage those without work to make the transition from the dole queue to employment. The State should not be in the business in the long-term of effectively subsidising low pay. In this context, Democratic Left has long argued for an expansion of the Joint Labour Council and Joint Industrial Council agreements to cover all sectors where low pay is a problem, thus moving eventually towards an effective minimum wage.</P>
    <P>During the past ten days we have heard much rhetoric from the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats benches.  Their job in Opposition is to <Col N="293" /> oppose the Government and there is no better platform on which to do this than on the budget platform.  Their rhetoric has been largely devoid of content and the main complaint is that (i) the tax changes and social welfare increases were insufficient and (b) in making these changes and giving more people more money in their pocket the economy is in danger of overheating.  I wish the Deputies opposite would make up their minds about the measures on which they wish to criticise us.  I am not sure how they reconcile the two complaints, but I am sure that the fiscally prudent course being pursued by the Government will result in a continued climate of economic confidence where investment will continue to flow in and jobs will continue to be created.</P>
    <P>What mainly irks the Progressive Democrats and the PD wing of Fianna Fáil is that the Government has decided to target the low paid rather than reduce the top rate of tax, the rate paid by PD constituents.  The Government does not represent PD constituencies.  High earners in this country are not overtaxed compared to our European Union counterparts; that is evident from the figures presented to the House yesterday by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats would have us believe that economic salvation begins and ends with tax cuts but what this Government has set out to do, and what Democratic Left has consistently advocated as tax reform rather than simple tax reduction, namely, an increase in personal allowances and the other complementary measures announced in the budget, benefits all earners while ensuring that the maximum benefit is derived by those on low incomes.  Unfortunately the PD Members are not in the Chamber to hear this critique despite the fact that they constantly tell us they participate in all debates; I hope they are watching their monitors.</P>
    <P>The view of taxation propounded by the Progressive Democrats has blinded them to the economic picture as a whole.  Tax reductions, even on the scale envisaged by the Progressive Democrats, are of little use to mortgage holders who are crippled by 15 per cent interest rates.  They are largely irrelevant to those without jobs such as the 56,000 unfortunate people to whom I referred earlier who were added to the live register between 1989 and 1992 during the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Last week's budget was the third in a package of three presented by this Government.  During that time poverty traps have been eliminated, the effects of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; welfare cuts imposed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have been reversed, an unprecedented number of jobs have been created and mortgage rates are at their lowest ever level.  The real impact of this budget will be felt in people's pockets as they benefit not only from increased welfare payments and lower taxes but also as they make the transition from the dole to work.  That is the challenge <Col N="294" /> to which the Government rose two years ago and which it happily met head-on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Government and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, on introducing what could be described as the most progressive budget since the foundation of the State.  It is a budget that meets the Fine Gael principle of shaping a more prosperous and inclusive Ireland for the 21st century.  The average PAYE worker will benefit by between £500 and £700 as a result of this progressive budget.</P>
      <P>Three years of prudent management of the economy by the Government has ensured that it pays to take a job and to make a job.  A pro-enterprise strategy of low inflation and low interest rates has fuelled the engine of the economy and earned Ireland the reputation of being a &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo;.  Approximately 100,000 jobs have been created and unemployment has fallen by more than 30,000.  As a result of this budget 10,000 low income earners will be taken out of the tax net by caring and intelligent reforms.  The Government's pro-enterprise and pro-jobs drive has not been achieved at the expense of the disadvantaged in our society.  The budget provides for social welfare increases of between 4 per cent and 7 per cent with the lowest of those increases at almost twice the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>In its three previous budgets the Government has increased the child benefit allowance by 50 per cent for the first and second child and by 60 per cent for all subsequent children.  The carer's allowance has been increased by 50 per cent to persons caring for more than one incapacitated person, and old age pensions have been increased substantially.  Maternity and adoptive benefit has been increased also to £82.30 per week and will be extended to the self-employed.  The number of yearly social insurance contributions needed to qualify for a pro-rata old age pension has been reduced from 20 to ten, provided the claimant has 260 paid contributions.  The period for which arrears are payable in respect of late claims for retirement pension, old age contributory pension and widow's contributory pension has been extended from six to 12 months from the date of claim.</P>
      <P>The conditions appertaining to free electricity and free telephone rental allowances are being streamlined from June 1997.  I welcome the Minister's decision to extend the free telephone rental allowance to pensioners in cases where constant care and attention is being provided by another member of the household or by another person resident with the pensioner, including recipients of the carer's allowance.  In regard to applicants for the free telephone rental allowance, I welcome also the Minister's decision to extend the age limit for dependent children from 18 to 22 years for those in full-time education and resident with the recipient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's decision to allow all pensioners over the age of 75 to qualify for the free electricity and free telephone rental allowances <Col N="295" /> regardless of their household circumstances is to be welcomed.  That is a major breakthrough for the underprivileged and elderly section of our community.  The Minister has also provided an additional £2 million towards the cost of security for the elderly, a measure first introduced in the 1996 Budget.  That is essential because many elderly pensioners live in isolated rural areas miles away from their nearest neighbour.  Those people must have direct access to an alarm system because there are too many cowboys plundering the homes of decent, elderly people.  Action must be taken by the Government to put an end to these crimes.  People in isolated rural areas have the right to live the remainder of their lives in peace and happiness.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he comprehensively dealt with the social and economic problems appertaining to the underprivileged section of our community.  Our economy has performed exceptionally well in recent years.  Growth rates are several times greater than the European Union average and employment rates have outstripped the EU average. Unemployment levels have continued to decrease since this Government assumed the reins of office.  European Commission data have conceded that our GDP per head of population increased from 76 per cent of the EU average in 1991 to approximately 100 per cent in 1996, a tremendous achievement for a coalition Government that was not supposed to last six months.  I guarantee Members opposite the Government will run its full term.  It will continue to ensure the ship of State is guided in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Stability has been maintained for the past three years.  We have a moderate inflationary rate, Government borrowing has been consistently below the EU average and, for the first time in more than a generation, our national debt has taken a downward plunge by a figure of more than £300,000 this year.  This is a step in the right direction and it must be maintained in the years ahead.  The good housekeeping of this Government and the Minister for Finance has led to lower interest rates and increased investor and consumer confidence in the economy.  The steady approach in successive agreements between the social partners has resulted in moderate nominal pay increases creating industrial peace and maintaining competitiveness.  With the strong growth evident in foreign direct investment and the contribution of EU structural and cohesion funds, which have considerably improved the infrastructure and productive capacity of this economy, the barometer is set for a continuation of strong non-inflationary economic growth in the next few years.  With a recovery evident in Europe our GNP is expected to increase by approximately 5.5 per cent this year and by approximately 4.5 per cent in 1998 and 1999, with the creation of 38,000 new jobs per annum over the next three years. Partnership 2000 is intended to increase further <Col N="296" /> the economy's capacity for high employment and outward growth as we approach the year 2000.</P>
    <P>It is paramount that the Government maintains our borrowing capacity comfortably within the Maastricht budget criteria and it is also essential that cost increases are minimised.  That is vital not only to maintain competitiveness and safeguard employment, but also to ensure we fulfil the inflation criteria for EMU membership.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on reducing the standard rate of tax by 1 per cent.  I hope this trend is continued in future budgets.  However, those caught in the 48 per cent tax net should also be considered and there are other anomalies the Minister should tackle.  The Minister for Social Welfare should consider extending the pro-rata pensions for people with a yearly average of between ten and 20 PRSI contributions for old age pension purposes to those in the survivor's pension category.  He should also consider increasing the winter fuel allowance to the price of a hundred weight of coal.  When that allowance was introduced some years ago it covered the cost of approximately 100 weight of coal per week, but the current rate would buy only a half hundred weight.  Surely the Minister knows that heat is important for our elderly citizens.  There is nothing more cheery than a glowing coal fire on a dull dismal winter's day or night.  Perhaps the Minister will see fit to increase the winter fuel allowance to £10 per week next year, which would enable old age pensioners to maintain a decent level of heat in their homes during the winter months.</P>
    <P>When the public assess the unfounded criticisms levelled at the budget by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, it will hear the hollow ring of two parties who failed abysmally when in Government together.  This Government is working, not standing idly by.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on abolishing water charges and residential property tax.  I urge him to extend the coastal resort scheme to Kinsale, Bandon, Skibbereen, Bantry and Castletownbere. I also compliment him on not increasing excise duty on spirits, wines, beer, stout and cider.  The proposal by the Licensed Vintners' Association to increase the pint by 5 pence in some Dublin pubs is deplorable.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on requesting the representatives of that association to explain why they are trying to siphon a further 5 pence from the public, while licensed premises in this city are making up to £4 million when put on the market.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his Ministers on their magnificent performance during the Presidency of the EU.  The Government was saddled with problems it did not create.  It inherited the BSE and the hepatitis C crises which have put a severe strain on the economy.  I hope those problems are resolved quickly.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance on introducing a budget with vision, capacity, courage <Col N="297" /> and determination to steer us into the next millennium.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>
      <Quest>if he will ensure that specific responsibility is given to an individual to oversee the budget end of the tourism market within his Department and organisations under the aegis of his Department and that this responsibility would include overseeing sports groups, activity groups, backpackers, walkers, cyclists, campers and other categories; the action, if any, he intends taking in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2743/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny) Enda Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's primary function in so far as tourism is concerned is to assist me in determining national tourism policy and development priorities and to monitor implementation of that policy.  In all the circumstances, I consider it neither appropriate nor desirable to nominate an individual in my Department to oversee the budget or any other specific end of the tourism market, as suggested in the question.  Such matters come within the statutory responsibilities of the State agencies working in co-operation with the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>While the question refers to &ldquo;overseeing&rdquo; sports groups, activity groups, backpackers, walkers, cyclists, campers etc., I assume it relates to plans to develop and market a niche tourism product in the categories mentioned.  There may be concerns that in our efforts to develop Irish tourism we are concentrating exclusively on the higher yield markets at the expense of niche tourism products, particularly those that might be perceived as budget tourism.  Such concerns, while understandable, are without foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of niche markets is a priority of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 under its product development and marketing sub-programmes.  This is in line with my policy to discourage the development of mass tourism in Ireland which could undermine both the quality of the tourism product and give rise to concerns about our environment and landscape.  It is also significant in terms of tackling the problem of seasonality which has beset Irish tourism for years.  We are making significant progress in addressing this issue which will not only allay fears about the dangers of mass tourism but will help to make the industry more profitable and help to sustain permanent jobs as distinct from <Col N="298" /> the part-time and seasonal employment traditionally associated with the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>To this end, the marketing of Ireland has now moved to a situation where the development of a strong and sustainable brand identity is agreed by all the major partners to be a strategic challenge in the coming years.  This newly developed brand image has focused on the specialist markets offering greatest potential and how best to target them.  The focus is on the production and marketing of high quality specialist interest holidays.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that the budget tourist does not continue to receive attention.  Bord Fáilte has been instrumental in establishing product marketing groups which include those involved in cycling and walking promotion and has elevated the status and promotional awareness of such activities. The groups' distinctiveness and success lies in the collaborative efforts of State tourism agencies and their tourism industry partners.</P>
    <P>From now on, the niche markets of culture, heritage and activities will be given focus under the umbrella of the mother brand.  The greater sophistication in the branding approach has led to a more focused market segmentation, long-term market planning and positioning.  It has not in any way sought to undermine the budget tourism market but rather to allow tourism marketing to convey that an Irish holiday is not a transient happening but something with lasting benefits. That is our unique selling proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>My question arises from a meeting I had with the Independent Holiday Hostels of Ireland organisation, which represents about 148 hostels in Ireland.  It estimates that its sector contributes about £90 million per annum to the economy &mdash; not an inconsiderable amount.  I am disappointed with the Minister's indication that he will not appoint a person to deal with budget or youth tourism.  The IHHI approached Bord Fáilte about the possibility of appointing somebody specifically to deal with budget tourism and, having received one response, has heard nothing since.  The Minister should use his considerable influence to urge Bord Fáilte to appoint somebody to have specific responsibility for this market. The young tourists of today will be the high yield spenders of tomorrow.  Indeed, they are generally the children of prospective high yield tourists. In that context they should receive specific attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's view that the young visitors will be the return tourists of the future.  The Deputy will be aware that the staff in the Department of Tourism and Trade has increased by 300 per cent since it was set up by a Government led by Fianna Fáil.  There are about 31 officials dealing with tourism policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The money which Bord Fáilte receives is transferred to it from the Department's Vote.  I am assured that the promotion of the niche holiday sectors to which the Deputy's question refers is part of the overall presentation of Ireland abroad. <Col N="299" /> The range of advertising and communication being carried out takes that into account.  I cannot pinpoint a specific individual in Bord Fáilte who handles this area but I am assured that the sectors in question are not forgotten in the promotion of activities.  I take note of the Deputy's point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is prevaricating slightly with some &ldquo;magic speak&rdquo;, as it were.  He should address the issue.  It is a matter which might be more properly dealt with by way of a motion in the House.  The Minister should consult with his officials with a view to assisting the hostels sector by appointing a person to take specific responsibility for this niche market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have met a number of people involved with the independent hostels sector.  The operational programme, with which I know the Deputy is familiar, under its product development sub-programme makes specific provision for grant aiding activity holiday products, including cycling, walking, hostel and other accommodation on branded walking routes and sports related activities, including golf, adventure and equestrian holidays.  These activities do not necessarily fall into the category of budget tourism.</P>
      <P>The sub-programme is not specifically for youth or budget tourism.  Much of what is eligible for grant aid under the sub-programme cannot be construed as budget tourism.  I recently opened a hostel in Gweedore, County Donegal, which is the largest single investment grant aided under the subprogramme in that part of the country.  It is not designed specifically for budget tourism but some of the people who will avail of its services and facilities will be in the categories the Deputy mentioned.  It has been noticeable in recent years that many of the 700,000 Americans who visit Ireland decide to stay, for example, in Ashford Castle for one week and in hostels or guesthouses for another week.</P>
      <P>The categories are not specific and they cannot be lumped together in a budget concept. However, I take the Deputy's point.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>
      <Quest>the action, if any, he intends taking in the event of a reduction in EU grant assistance in 1999 to the tourism industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Together with the tourism industry I have been conscious for some time of the need to plan properly for when the current round of EU Structural Funds expires at the end of 1999.  The issue has already surfaced in a number of fora such as the Tourism Council, the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative and in bilateral contacts between ITIC-industry representatives and my Department.  I referred to the <Col N="300" /> matter in many speeches over the past 2 years in which I exhorted the industry, to build on its successes, particularly during this decade, by taking on more responsibility for the development, training and marketing of its own product.  Consultation and discussion with the industry on this subject will continue as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I understand, from the Minister for Finance, that negotiations on the future financing of the European Union, including the Structural Funds, will not commence until the conclusion of the intergovernmental conference when the European Commission will submit a communication on the future financial framework of the Union as and from 31 December 1999.  This is likely to be in the second half of 1997.  Ireland's approach to these negotiations is under consideration and when the negotiations commence, the Government will ensure that Ireland's interests are pursued as vigorously and effectively as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>What action, if any, did the Minister take during the course of our Presidency of the EU to ensure that Ireland will qualify, post-1999, for additional funding for the tourism industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.  A specific set of measures, targets and objectives were laid down for our Presidency which, by and large, were achieved.  It is recognised within the Union that Ireland traditionally operates its Presidency of the EU in an effective, professional and efficient manner.  The negotiations will not commence until the latter part of this year.  In making arrangements to flag this in advance, we are consulting with the industry to receive opinions and advice on an ongoing basis.  The Commission will make a communication on what it perceives as the future financial framework of the European Union, post-1999, which is likely to occur in the latter part of this year.  The Government will pursue that communication as vigorously and effectively as possible in the interests of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the matter is not being pursued vigorously enough, in light of his reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in pursuing it vigorously at present because it is not under discussion with the Commission.  That time will come and I suspect that Ireland's case will be well prepared and presented.  As already stated, this matter has been flagged for the past two years and we know the current arrangements will cease in 1999.  Therefore, we must be prepared to make our case regarding the situation post-1999 and we will do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have set the following as my priorities in 1997 for the development of the tourism industry: to increase foreign tourism revenue by 9 per cent, or £160 million, keeping performance ahead of the six year target set under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994 to 1999, to achieve total foreign exchange earnings of £2.25 billion; bring total 1997 EU assisted tourism investment to £115 million, representing an increase of £20 million on the corresponding figure for 1996; secure approval for the necessary EU assistance to facilitate development of a major international conference centre for Dublin under the current Operational Programme for Tourism; maximise tourism opportunities as a result of the increase of 120,000 seats in transatlantic capacity already secured for the 1997 season, together with the introduction of a new gateway at Newark, and secure the launch of a separate initiative to boost continental European air traffic; and advance planning and establish options for the post-1999 period, following the completion of the current round of EU Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the result of the work of the steering group on Ireland-US access, particularly in respect of improving accessibility to Ireland from the western and south western states of the US?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy inquired about the steering group which comprised officials of the Departments of Tourism and Trade and Transport, Energy and Communications, Aer Rianta and Bord Fáilte.  It worked through 1996 to identify the best possibilities for increasing US-Ireland inbound tourism <i>via</i> direct air services. The group's priority objective was to increase capacity on the route and co-ordinate the use of the agencies, where possible, to support new services. As a result of its work, carriers have put arrangements in place to increase overall transatlantic capacity by an additional 120,000 for the coming season.  Aer Lingus capacity from New York will increase by 4 per cent, from Boston by 11 per cent and from Chicago by 134 per cent. A new gateway at Newark will help to increase capacity.  We also expect improved performance on the Dublin/Atlanta route following implementation of the new Aer Lingus/Delta code share agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a Bord Fáilte/Virgin Atlantic Airways initiative will enable passengers travelling on that airline to Dublin from several key US states to travel on to Dublin and Belfast free of charge.  Bord Fáilte and Aer Rianta will continue to work directly with American carriers &mdash; US Air and Continental &mdash; who expressed interest in opening new scheduled services at some future date.  However, the steering group is not optimistic in the short-term. <Col N="302" /> I am working closely with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, and we will meet next week to review the ongoing work in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not address my supplementary question which referred to western and south western states in the US.  Does he accept that the existing fare structure makes it more attractive for American tourists to travel to Ireland through London and land at Dublin Airport?  In view of the changes at Shannon, has there been an over-concentration on encouraging tourists, particularly American tourists, to land at Dublin?  Does the Minister agree that the western counties, which have a large economy dependent on tourism income, are not obtaining their share of the growth in tourism to which he referred and that access into Ireland &mdash; and access in Ireland into the western region &mdash; should be a priority for the Minister in 1997?</P>
      <P>Today's decision to postpone construction of the by-pass at Kinnegad, which tourists often spend two hours passing through, is a retrograde step and will interfere with the development of tourism and the economy in the west.  Were these factors not taken into account by the steering committee and other Cabinet committees with which the Minister is involved?  Is it not disappointing that access to the west, <i>via</i> the new motorway by-pass near Kinnegad, has been put on the long finger?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The steering group was not mandated to resolve the problem of the Kinnegad by-pass.  I read reports about people living in Kinnegad exercising their right to make their views known on this issue.  Obviously an element of western and south western traffic from the US will come through Chicago.  After all, there are 17 million Irish Americans living in the area between Chicago and Dallas.  In that context, Chicago is a major hub.  We expect improved performance because of new code sharing arrangements on the Dublin-Atlanta route.  Virgin Atlantic Airways carries passengers who want to fly to London directly from the cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and Dallas.  The arrangement is that they can fly on to Dublin or Belfast free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also concentrating on improving traffic into Shannon and Cork.  The Deputy is aware of the initiative announced recently by Aer Rianta which will run to 2001 and will eliminate any uncertainty in the period post-1999.  This initiative offers incentives to airlines to develop new traffic and routes on which airport charges will not be levied at Shannon and Cork for the first three years.  A discount of 50 per cent will apply in the fourth and fifth years.  The continental market obviously holds major potential.  In that context, I expect traffic into the west, particularly through Cork and Shannon, will increase as a result.  In terms of entry further north, the DER tour company continues to expand its services into Knock <Col N="303" /> Airport from several locations in Germany.  That will enhance the number of tourists coming into the western region from continental Europe.</P>

      <P>The three principal agencies operating under the aegis of my Department which disburse funds to tourism related projects are Bord Fáilte, Shannon Development and CERT, the financial allocations in respect of which are contained in the annual Estimates for the Public Services.  My Department serves as lead Department for the Operational Programme for Tourism under which EU grant assistance is provided to develop tourism over the period 1994 to 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following approval of grant applications by independent management boards, Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development make European Regional Development Fund funding available for product development and marketing.  In addition, CERT provides some ESF funding to the private sector for training initiatives to complement training provided directly by CERT.  The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is the implementing agency for the sub-programme for the development of natural and cultural tourism and the Department of the Marine <Col N="304" /> implements the tourism angling measure.  The main co-ordinating mechanism for these agencies and their expenditures under the operational programme is the national monitoring committee which is chaired by my Department and on which all relevant Departments and State agencies are represented.</P>
    <P>Funding for tourism initiatives can be provided under other operational programmes, including the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry and the operational programme for local urban and rural development, and a number of other Community initiatives such as the Leader Programme, INTERREG programmes, both Northern Ireland and maritime, and the special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.  The International Fund for Ireland also has a tourism programme.  My Department is involved in the co-ordination and operation of those programmes and initiatives through direct consultation, participation in decision making working groups and membership of the relevant monitoring committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree there is a major structural weakness in the position as outlined by him?  The fact that a plethora of agencies is involved dissipates efforts and resources and leads to lack of focus in developing the tourism product as well as to confusion for potential investors in this area.  Has the Minister plans to simplify this matter, perhaps through setting up co-ordinating bodies locally or providing a guide to these services which would facilitate those who wish to make an investment in tourism?</P>

      <P>The main co-ordinating mechanisms for all the agencies involved is the national monitoring committee chaired by my Department, on which all relevant representatives of the various Departments and State agencies are represented. The operational programme is run in co-operation with the European Commission. Information for would be investors or applicants for assistance is available.  It is very simple to issue a clear pamphlet or leaflet indicating the sources of assistance and when applicants apply to the regional tourism organisations there is a clear focus in terms of their application.  The national monitoring committee oversees and has a very clear analysis of applications, the way they are assessed and from what source the funding comes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the importance of tourism, I suggest that the Minister considers bringing under the remit of his Department tourism-related measures currently under the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Department of the Marine.  Not only would that clear up the confusion for investors but it would much more effectively focus the future strategy of tourism.  Will the Minister agree there is a very good case for doing that?  On the structure of tourism generally, is the Minister aware of the <Col N="305" /> confusion between the roles of Bord Fáilte, SFADCo and RTOs, leading to an ongoing weakness in the industry which needs to be addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The confusion is sometimes self-generated. A previous Government laid down the regulations relating to the remit of SFADCo and its responsibilities for tourism, and Government action would be required to change that legislation. As regards bringing all these measures under the one Department, I do not agree with the Deputy that there is confusion.  Deputy Andrews suggested during the Estimates debate last year that a single Department of Tourism be promoted.  I assume his intention &mdash; I do not believe he will have the opportunity to do so &mdash; is to being all the elements from the various Departments under a single Department, to be implemented under a single operational programme. That would require a decision by the Taoiseach of the day in co-operation with the European Commission.  It is not mentioned in the Fianna Fáil document published recently, which refers to amalgamating the Department of Tourism and Trade with the sporting element of the Department of Education.  I am not sure how the stand alone proposal by Deputy Andrews tallies with the document from the Fianna Fáil junior spokesperson in the other Department.  In any event Fianna Fáil will not have an opportunity to implement that aspiration.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that with so many agencies providing funding for tourism related projects, the amount of funds available is depleted?  There is lack of funding for items such as registered bed and breakfast accommodation. County enterprise boards, the IFI, Leader groups and Bord Fáilte have made a decision not to fund such ventures, particularly in Border areas and in Inishowen.  Priority should be given to these areas in terms of accommodation. Does the Minister agree that since funding is provided by so many agencies it is not focused on basic facilities for tourists?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keaveney has a strong attachment to her beloved Inishowen, and rightly so, but if all the funding was provided by one agency, sectors in various areas might suffer unduly.  For instance, under the Operational Programme for Tourism, all areas are eligible to apply for assistance.  In order to concentrate on specific areas which need attention, funding is made available through, for example, the INTERREG fund and the maritime fund, dealing with Border areas, the operational programme, the tourism element of the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, again dealing with Border areas and the tourism element of the International Fund for Ireland as well as the Leader II Programme and other programmes. The Border areas and Northern Ireland have an additional concentration of funds available to them under those headings.  However, that <Col N="306" /> might not be the case if funds were allocated under a central development agency.  In terms of the number and nature of the applications submitted, funding for areas referred to by the Deputy, such as accommodation in Border areas, which have suffered unduly over the past 25 years and longer, might lose out to an even greater extent.  That is why these funds are targeted to help specific areas in presenting their case for promotion.</P>

      <P>Accommodation is generally not grant aidable under the Operational Programme for Tourism, but under the Leader II programme, depending on the Leader group dealing with the matter, the group, if it so wishes, is entitled to consider some allocation for the provision of accommodation.  Under the peace and reconciliation initiatives there is some support for the provision of accommodation.  Such provision is a consequence of a commercial belief in investment. If one provides extra rooms which will bring in additional income, there is a belief that the overall product in the area will work and will be a thriving success.  Bord Fáilte has never grant aided accommodation in that context, but some assistance is available under some of the headings of those measures.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, agreed between the Irish Government and the European Commission, provides that in the case of the marketing sub-programme and in the case of Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development areas under the product development sub-programme, the decision making authority on grant applications shall be exercised by independent management boards, with the exception of large projects which also require the specific approval of the Government and the European Commission.  These independent management boards are required to operate within the policy guidelines as set out in the operational programme.  Each of these boards comprises three independent business-professional members, two relevant State agency personnel and one official from my Department.  The membership thus brings broad practical business and professional experience to the decision-making process to augment the tourism-related expertise <Col N="307" /> of the tourism agencies and my Department. Each management board is required to furnish me with an annual report listing all board decisions and advising of any significant developments or trends in relation to applications falling under their aegis.  The first of these reports for the period to end December 1995 were published and laid before both Houses of Oireachtas. The boards have their annual reports for 1996 in preparation at present.</P>
      <P>As part of the overall mid-term review of the community support framework and in common with other operational programmes, a review of all aspects of the Operational Programme for Tourism has already commenced.  This review process is due for completion by July.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the mid-term review offers an opportunity for him and for the Government to address the regional disparities which have arisen in relation to tourism growth and to make a policy intervention which would ensure that future funding by the Government is directed to those areas deficient in terms of product to give them an opportunity to compete on an even footing with the other regions?  What is the Minister's view on the recent report by Professor Dineen and Professor Deegan of Limerick University which referred to an absence of any serious attempt to monitor the return by the Irish tourism product?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The objectives of the Operational Programme for Tourism mid-term evaluation are to identify any adjustments which should be made, financial and otherwise, within and across sub-programmes and measures to the operational programme; to ensure the achievement of its targets; and, should it prove necessary, to make recommendations for the amendment of the programme's targets.  Paragraph 10 (20) of the operational programme provides the following:</P>
      <P>As this will be a six year Programme, it is planned to undertake the review of the operational Programme after three years.  The review may be undertaken by an independent evaluator.  The purpose of this will be to assess performance to date and to recommend to the Programme Monitoring Committee any changes needed to secure the aims and objectives of the programme by the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>The mid-term evaluator is concluding his work and the mid-term evaluation is due to be completed on 14 February this year.  It will then issue to each member of the monitoring committee of the operational programme.  A number of meetings will follow subsequent to that and in due course the CSF committee under the Department of Finance will discuss that matter with the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points raised by the Deputy about value for work and any necessary adjustment will be taken into account in that evaluation.  As Minister, <Col N="308" /> I can communicate directly to the European Commission if, following the mid-term evaluation, I consider there are other issues, such as those raised by the Deputy, not catered for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider making pay and conditions of staff one of the conditions under which projects would qualify for funding, as it is a matter about which there is a good deal of concern?  It would be inappropriate for the State to grant aid a hotel or any project in which there were serious questions about the pay and conditions of staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The pay and conditions of staff is a matter for employers under Programme 2000, and unions in regard to rates of pay.  It is not up to me or the Department to lay down such pay and conditions.  It is significant to note that in recent times the Irish Hotels Federation adopted a new code of practice on working conditions, pay arrangements, career prospects and other matters of concern to those working in the industry and that is as it should be.  The industry should be attractive, particularly to young people, with strong promotional outlets, long-term career prospects and good wages and working conditions. This is a matter outside my remit.  Applications for assistance under any of these programmes are only considered in the interests of long-term, sustainable and viable projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal decisions relating to the Internal Market taken by the Internal Market Council at its meetings on 25 October and 26 November 1996, which I chaired, were: approval of a directive on the protection of occupants of motor vehicles in the event of a frontal impact; adoption of a Council Resolution on the simplification and rationalisation of the Community's customs regulations and procedures; a decision authorising the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the EU, an agreement concerning customs co-operation with Norway; common positions on two amending directives in the area of public procurement contracts; and a common position on a directive concerning extraction solvents used in the production of foodstuffs.  Both Councils approved without discussion a large number of other decisions, some relating to the work of other Councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the October meeting Ministers met with their counterparts of the ten Central and Eastern European countries as part of the structured <Col N="309" /> dialogue process to assist these countries to prepare for integration into the EU's Single Market.</P>
    <P>The November Council held an open debate on the Commission's review of the impact and effectiveness of the Single Market.  Delegations expressed views in particular with regard to stressing the importance of the single currency for the Single Market; promoting convergence and generating employment through increased competition as a key to improved international competitiveness in a world wide economy; promoting and extending the opportunities for business and citizens to take advantage of the Single Market; recognising that the protection of consumers is a common concern in the context of the Single Market; ensuring mutual recognition of rules and regulations and the proper enforcement of Community rules across the entire Single Market; simplifying Community rules and regulations; and responding to the requirements of tomorrow's economy by extending the Single Market to new areas of products and services.</P>
    <P>The Commission's review was subsequently discussed at the Dublin European Council on 13 and 14 December 1996 which stressed the essential role of the Single Market in promoting growth and employment in the European Union. The European Council noted the Commission's intention to submit before the Amsterdam European Council an action plan and a timetable covering all necessary measures that must be taken to ensure that the full potential of the Single Market is achieved before the beginning of stage 3 of economic and monetary unions.</P>
    <P>The November Internal Market Council also noted the success of the Commission's Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market, known as the SLIM initiative, in which expert teams examined options and made a number of important recommendations for legislative simplification in the areas of construction products, recognition of diplomas, Intrastat and the marketing of ornamental plants.  The Council adopted conclusions which request the Commission to come forward with proposals in these four areas and also to identify other sectors of legislation which might benefit from review in a second phase of the SLIM exercise. This approach was endorsed by the Dublin European Council.</P>
    <P>The Citizens First information campaign, designed to inform citizens of the rights and opportunities created for them by the Single Market, was launched in Brussels on 26 November.</P>
    <P>All of the decisions taken at the two Internal Market Councils and the European Council will, in their own way, contribute to the consolidation and development of the Single Market which is so important to our exporters as it provides access to a market of 370 million consumers and accounts for 70 per cent of total exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, apart from the Commission's review and the simplification of customs procedures, progress has been <Col N="310" /> painfully slow in completing the internal market and that the SLIM initiative is inadequate in addressing the major issues of concern to those involved in trade in the European Union?  Much more progress needs to be made quickly.</P>

      <P>During the Irish Presidency two Internal Market Councils were held.  They had full agendas which were approved.  This did not happen during other Presidencies.  I do not know whether the Deputy will ever have the opportunity to chair the Council of Trade Ministers or an Internal Market Council but it is a daunting task.  In dealing with issues such as these, as Deputy Andrews is well aware, it takes considerable time to obtain the approval and agreement of all 15 member states.  There may be many more when the Deputy has the opportunity to chair the Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The four areas mentioned were chosen because they were the common denominator of the requests made by member states. Commissioner Monti and his officials did a good job.  They responded as quickly as possible.  The SLIM initiative is in response to the request for simpler and more effective legislation.  The Commission, the Parliament and the Council agree with this objective which will be difficult to achieve.  The initiative which has proved successful will be extended to other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is saying, in effect, is that, regardless of who is in the chair, worthwhile progress is unlikely to be made in dealing with these issues because of the structures in place.  The Government should find a new means of dealing with them, given their importance to exporters.</P>

It was run efficiently and professionally, and its achievements have been recognised by other member states.  It set achievable targets and objectives and did not get bogged down in intricacies.  The Taoiseach and the various Ministers who will participate in Council meetings will pursue these issues and keep in mind the achievements of the two Internal Market Councils held during the Irish Presidency which I had the honour and privilege of chairing. Some progress was made in pursuit of the objective of simpler legislation.</P>

      <P>As I informed the House on 17 October, the World Equestrian Games are scheduled to take place in Ireland in August 1998.  As I indicated previously, the allocation of the games to Ireland and their organisation are matters, in the first instance, for the Federation Equestre International, FEI, and World Equestrian Games (Ireland) Limited, WEG.  The policy of this and the previous Government has been to encourage and assist WEG (Ireland) Limited in its work, where appropriate, to ensure a commercially successful games that will reflect well on this country in equestrian and general promotional terms.</P>
      <P>Exchequer assistance is being provided through Bord Fáilte to WEG (Ireland) Limited to facilitate the holding of the games and to date an amount of £750,000 has been paid to the company. Provision for a further £250,000 has been made for this year.  As I advised the House previously, Bord Failte's guarantee to the FEI has been halved to £750,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>To date, £750,000 has been provided by the Department of Tourism and Trade. This is made up of £250,000 in each of the years 1994, 1995 and 1996.  There is a commitment to provide a further £250,000 this year.  There is, however, no commitment to provide funding over and above this figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The games will be held in the RDS and Punchestown.  I am sure WEG (Ireland) Limited will inform the Deputy of the number of participating countries.  It is difficult to put a figure on the overall number of visitors.  It is important, however, to avail of this prestigious international event to promote the equine species as a symbol of Ireland.  I hope the games will prove successful and act as a catalyst leading to further business in the horse industry.  I further hope they will result in an increased number of holidaymakers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is important to use this prestigious international event to promote the horse as a symbol of Ireland, it is almost as strong as the shamrock.

For example, we have hosted the Tall Ships and arranged funding for the Tour de France.  In due course I hope the Ryder Cup committee will make a decision to allocate the 2005 Ryder Cup to Ireland.  These are all events of international prestige and I am happy to be in a position to promote them.  Bord Fáilte will play its part in the international marketing of Ireland in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 8 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>It is my belief that the overall effect of EMU on Irish exports will be on balance, be positive. That view is supported by the ESRI study on the economic implications of EMU for Ireland which is the most comprehensive study of its kind to date on the subject.  The expected advantages of EMU from an exporter's perspective include the elimination of transaction costs and exchange rate risk for trade among participating member states; low and fairly uniform interest rates among participating member states; promotion of price stability, sound public finances and sustained low inflation in participating member states; increased attractiveness of participating member states to foreign investment; and a voice in decisions about the economic and the single monetary policy of the union.</P>
      <P>At the national level the critical strategies and preparations for EMU are aimed at ensuring that the convergence criteria for entry to EMU continue to be met.  These include a reduction in the debt/GDP ratio and keeping interest and inflation rates within the relevant criteria.  The implications of EMU are being taken fully into account in the formulation of policy and in controlling public finances.  This month's budget took full account of the need to keep the debt/GDP ratio on a progressive downward path and the Government has adopted a strategy that will keep our general Government deficit at no more than half of the three per cent Maastricht ceiling by 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the level of the exporter, I and my colleagues, <Col N="313" /> the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, recently launched the EMU business awareness campaign which is aimed at small and medium enterprises and is designed to ensure that Irish business is fully prepared to meet the practical challenges of EMU.  This campaign is being co-ordinated by Forfás with full participation by An Bord Tráchtála (ABT), the national trade board.  Forfás has commissioned a study to examine how companies can best plan for EMU.</P>
    <P>ABT, who have responsibility for export promotion activities, plan to publish a EMU guide for exporters in the next four to five weeks, which will deal specifically with the marketing challenges and opportunities presented by EMU. ABT is also stepping up its export development programme in Europe in 1997 and will invest a record £10 million in support of Irish exporters in continental markets as part of a medium-term strategy to increase the proportion of indigenous exports going to these markets by 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, the economy of my constituency is hugely dependent on the agriculture industry and in particular on revenue earned through food exports.  We have to bear in mind that the food industry, by its nature, is competitive and operates on very small margins.  Will the Minister assure me that adequate preparation and contingency measures will be in place to counter the difficulties that will arise if Britain remains outside the EMU and the Irish pound appreciates within EMU, bearing in mind our dependency on the British market particularly as regards the export of food products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, food exports are a matter for An Bord Bia and are not in the remit of the Minister for Tourism and Trade or ABT.  That change took effect some time ago.</P>
      <P>The overall conclusion of the ESRI study on the economic implications of EMU on Ireland is that, assuming prudent policies, EMU membership will be favourable for Ireland and that will hold whether or not the UK joins.  If the UK remains outside, the ESRI say that the balance of quantified effects is favourable, though only to the extent of about 0.4 per cent of GNP and 10,000 jobs.  This Ministry and the trade board deal with non-food indigenous exports.  I am sure if the Deputy tables a question to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, or obtains the information directly from An Bord Bia, he will get the projections for food exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the financial institutions, who obviously have a huge interest in EMU, involved in the strategy Forfás is preparing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that consultation has <Col N="314" /> taken place.  The Forfás promotion is quite detailed and is aimed specifically at small and medium sized enterprises because these are the ones on which any economy is built.  The promotion will go on the road in the next couple of weeks and I assume Forfás has taken the normal projections and consultations with financial institutions into account.  It is geared specifically at small and medium enterprises, to ensure that Irish business is fully aware of and prepared to meet, these practical challenges.</P>
      <P>I know that having established the National Trade Council, which comprises people from exporting companies and other professionals, there is a great lack of awareness of this impending challenge within Irish business, particularly in small businesses.  It is important that this awareness campaign be seen to be a success and that everybody participates in it.  I am sure the financial institution's projections have been taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">

      <P>The Minister's initial reply to my question relied heavily on the improved health of the economy since 1987 and the fact that progress made as regards public finances and debts has made it possible for us to aspire to membership of the EMU.  The financial institutions play a major role in our society and economy and I would have thought they would have a bigger part to play than just being part of the consultative process when a national EMU policy is being prepared.</P>

      <P>The Minister of Finance will give the Deputy a detailed account of the involvement of the financial institutions, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance in preparing this.  He can presume that the prudent management of the country's economy is in safe hands.  It is specifically for that reason that we are leaders in terms of the Maastricht criteria for entry into European Monetary Union.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be aware of severe difficulties facing some firms who rely on the export market to France and Germany, because of the appreciation of the Irish pound.

      <P>I have received a number of letters from employers and exporters in the Deputy's constituency who have great difficulty in finding people to work in their plants even while they are paying above the rates.  They have trawled counties north and south of the Border looking for employees and have been unable to find them.  There are difficulties exporting to Britain and beyond.  I am aware of difficulties in exporting to France and Germany because of currency fluctuations with the franc and deutschmark. <Col N="315" /> We had this problem in Britain last year. On that occasion we were able to set up a task force to help companies through ABT.  I have invited those with difficulties in the French and German markets to contact me and, in so far as we can, we will offer the same type of assistance through ABT.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of a survey conducted by the chambers of commerce of Ireland which showed that most business people look forward with some confidence to EMU.  It also discovered, however, that few of them had made any attempt to find out what would be the implications of EMU for their businesses. While I strongly welcome the Forfás initiative and the ABT campaign, perhaps it would be better if they were directed at particular types of company to ensure their future in the marketplace as well as their concerns are looked after.  Deputy Smith's questioning has pointed up an enormous structural weakness between the Department of Finance, ABT under the Minister, Deputy Kenny, and An Bord Bia under the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  A much more concerted and co-ordinated approach is required for such a fundamental question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I deal with ABT and other semi-state bodies under the aegis of the Department of Tourism and Trade.  ABT deals with indigenous non-food exporters.  It is in that context that I replied to Deputy Smith.  This campaign is quite detailed and includes the distribution to businesses of information packs which can be regularly updated, as well as advice on how companies should best prepare for EMU, and information meetings.  I strongly suggest that chambers of commerce and others involved in business, whether exporting or not, should consider attending the meetings arranged by Forfás on behalf of the Government.  They should raise questions relating to their business and the concerns they have.</P>
      <P>With the Trade Council we found there was a great lack of awareness among business people concerning the mechanics of how EMU will operate, and the practical challenges involved.  It is in everybody's interest, and specifically in our own economic interest, that exporters should be fully aware of, and competent to deal with that challenge. I hope they take it up because it is for their benefit and ultimately for the country's.</P>

      <Quest>the policy initiatives, if any, he has introduced to make tourism a year-round business both for providers of services to tourists and their employees; and the progress, if any, which has been made during 1995 and 1996 in this area.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Specific targets have been set under the operational programme for tourism 1994-9 for improving tourism activity in the shoulder and off-peak seasons.  At the beginning of the programme, 70 per cent of visitors came to Ireland during the off-peak season and our aim is to increase this figure to 75 per cent by 1999.</P>
      <P>The addition to the range and quality of weather independent facilities in recent years, together with substantial investment in marketing, is designed to improve the seasonality profile of the industry.  The assistance the industry has received under the tourism operational programme has been of considerable benefit in this regard.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the overseas tourism marketing initiative, which is a State-industry partnership marketing initiative, promotes Ireland on a year-round basis and many of its campaigns are directed at attracting visitors outside the peak season.</P>
      <P>The Celtic Flame music festival, which I launched recently, is an initiative based on a recommendation from the Tourism Council to further build tourism in the off-season.  Allied to this are the improved St. Patrick's festivities in Dublin which I am convinced have the potential to become a major attraction in the shoulder period.</P>
      <P>I should also mention the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan's, domestic tourism marketing initiative which continues to provide an added boost to tourism in the off-season.  The Government has provided £500,000 for this initiative this year and the 1997 campaign will be launched on 10 February by the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The launch of Tourism Brand Ireland formed a key part of a new strategic approach to marketing designed to address major issues such as yield, regional spread and seasonality.  The advertising emphasis is on aspects of the Irish holiday like human interaction, culture and historical heritage which are not season-dependent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that those directly involved in the industry have embraced the concept of year-round tourism with enthusiasm?  There have been some signs of progress but there also seems to be a belief within the industry generally that it is impossible to achieve any worthwhile level of tourism on a year-round basis.  The difficulty which policy makers need to address in the first instance is to make the industry believe it is possible to operate all year round and to prepare and market with that in mind.  That more than anything else has been the failure which has prevented the tourism product from being a year-round one.  That is what needs to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fair degree of truth in that.  In many parts of the country the industry has assumed for far too long that it should close down at the end of September and not re-open until the following Easter.  Only a few years ago <Col N="317" /> this city used to have spare bed capacity for extensive periods during the year, but that is no longer the case, even given the phenomenal increase in bed-nights available through hotel development and investment in other accommodation. People across the country, including the midlands, west, north-west and south-west, now recognise that there are people who will travel here outside the traditional shoulder season.  For instance, the Notre Dame versus the US Navy football game in Croke Park in November brought some 14,000 Americans &mdash; the single biggest movement of people here from across the Atlantic.</P>
      <P>Ireland rates as ninth in European terms as a sun destination but ranks number one as a non-sun destination.  We also know that if there was a ceasefire declaration with a return to peace, at least five million extra people in Great Britain would consider taking their holidays here annually. Even a small percentage of those on an annual basis would be important in terms of our economic development.  The message is getting through that people are prepared to travel here year-round, and it is my objective to promote tourism on that basis.  I hope they respond by travelling here all year round.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has asked for details of the national campaign to market tourism employment.  This falls within the day-to-day responsibility of CERT, the State tourism training agency, and I have already taken the opportunity to ask them to write directly to the Deputy as soon as possible with details of their plans for 1997.</P>
      <P>As regards regulation of pay and conditions in the industry this matter is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not really the answer to a reasonable question.  The Minister could have obtained the information from CERT, which is a good organisation and would have been forthcoming about the information the Deputy sought. As the Minister did not answer the second part of the question, it is fair to say that the industry itself has expressed concern about an image problem in that area.  Can the Minister be more forthcoming about the information sought in the Deputy's question?  Surely, even without consulting either of the organisations concerned, the Minister would have that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  The State tourism agency <Col N="318" /> plans to target more than 5,000 new recruits, both school-leavers and adults, for the industry this year.  To achieve this target its national recruitment campaign and a variety of actions will be intensified during 1997.  These actions comprise a media campaign including a weekly update of training vacancies on Aertel.  The advertising campaign will feature in four national newspapers with more than 500 slots planned for national and local radio.  Public consciousness about job opportunities will be raised through radio interviews and press releases in the national and local media. A new development this year will involve the publication of a 16-page supplement in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on careers in tourism during the month of February.  An additional 5,000 copies of the supplement will be published for use at career events throughout the year.  In addition, talk shows on the tourism industry are planned on the local radio network four times a week over a six-week period to coincide with the media advertising campaign.  There will be workshops for career guidance counsellors and career talks and exhibitions in schools, of which there are over 90 planned for 1997.  There will be a telephone information line on freephone 1800, open days in hotels, and it is planned to organise a special promotion campaign in Donegal, Leitrim and Cavan in eight hotels.  Career open days will also take place in four CERT training centres.  There will be circulation of careers information to over 1,400 schools, FÁS offices, libraries and youth organisations. There is more.  I can give it all to the Deputy if he wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>My question arose out of the lack of response in the first instance.  It is clear that the Minister is anxious to give the information. The answer only confirms my view that CERT is an excellent organisation going about its business in an extremely professional way.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister have a point of view about pay and conditions in the industry?  Mr. Matt McNulty, chief executive of Board Fáilte, who very kindly came before a committee of the House yesterday and was very forthcoming in his response to questions said there was not much of a problem in relation to pay and conditions.  I do not agree with him, given the information I have at my disposal from very reputable members of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly be prepared to meet the Deputy and deal with that if it is not in accordance with what we would wish.  I would like to see work in the tourism industry strongly promoted as a concept among young people because it is in their careers that its future strength lies. This should be seen and understood by parents as an area where good career prospects exist with good working conditions and rates of pay.  The IHF have come around to that view.  The industry itself understands that this is critical for its development.  If Deputy Andrews knows of specific instances where this does not apply, I would <Col N="319" /> be very happy to take the matter up on his behalf with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and with the relevant agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative in putting the kind of information he mentions before school leavers, but would he agree that there is not much point in making such presentations to people if they already know from their own experience and that of their peers that some of these jobs are very poorly paid and that the hours are very long?</P>
      <P>I also welcome the IHF intervention.  They, more than anybody, realise the damage which is being done to the industry.  While it is, strictly speaking, the function of the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, it is a very important element of the tourism product in Ireland that the employees be well looked after and be in a position to reflect a good image of Ireland to those who come here.  Unless this is addressed we will continue to have serious difficulties in this area.  Would the Minister be prepared to push a little harder on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The tourism awareness programme continues to raise the profile of tourism in second level schools and contributes to CERT's long-term recruitment to the industry. Deputy Killeen will also be aware that CERT assists employers to promote employment and training opportunities by allocating training places to employers who wish to nominate staff for training.  I launched a number of these during the year.  Also, for the first time, in 1997 under the CERT-NTCB industry qualification scheme employers in tourism who give training on the job will have access to a national qualification.  This scheme has the broad support of employer bodies in tourism like the IHF, the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the Vintners Association of Ireland, and is really designed as a powerful motivation to employees who have no formal qualifications.  I am very happy with the progress that is being made in shifting this industry from one with a backward perception to one that is outgoing, upbeat, progressive and rewarding.  I admit that there are cases where everything is not perfect but we have to work in the overall context and pull them all up rather than pull them all down.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>In April 1996 Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, joint owners of the Gulliver system, announced their intention to seek potential private sector partnerships to assist in the development of the system in the longer term future.  As I indicated to the House on 17 October last, the work of the steering group established to oversee the securing of new partnership arrangements for Gulliver has been progressing.  In recent months, discussions have been ongoing with a number of potential private sector partners, and in late December, discussions with one particular private sector company were extended, with a view to reaching a commercial partnership agreement.  The discussions with this company are ongoing and are expected to conclude shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>When the steering committee conclude their discussions with the company involved, they will have to finalise the position for consideration by Bord Fáilte and NITB.  The Gulliver system as an entity will, I expect, certainly be in a much better position to achieve its potential.  We all hope that will be the case.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State made a comprehensive statement in the House on 26 November in reply to a range of similar questions in relation to the new tourism brand.  In that reply, it was indicated that the development phase of the brand project had now been completed and Bord Fáilte, working with its tourism industry partners throughout the island and overseas, had assumed responsibility for the management of the brand and putting the necessary resources and effort behind its successful deployment.  Matters in relation to the cost and rollout of the brand fall within the day-to-day responsibility of Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in reply to previous questions on the subject, Bord Fáilte estimates that up to a total of £60 million per year is spent on a broad definition of tourism marketing, funded by the Exchequer, the EU and industry sources.

It is all very well to say that this Government has done a wonderful job with the budget but we must look more closely at history and how we achieved the present state of economic development.</P>
      <P>The three party coalition Government is not working.  Public and other spending has had to be increased in order to stick the Government of three parties with conflicting ideologies and policies together.  That is very unfortunate for future economic development.</P>
      <P>As far as the tax measures which were introduced are concerned, in order, again, to keep the three parties satisfied all the promised tax cuts for future years have been brought forward to this year and I do not think we can expect tax reductions in the future.  This three party coalition may be working according to Deputy Sheehan, but, unfortunately, it is working at a cost.  The conflicting demands within Government from three and not two parties have had to be conceded, Ministers threatened to resign but, at the end of the day, did not do so out of political expendiency and this budget was eventually cobbled together at the expense of increasing public expenditure which will cause many difficulties down the road.</P>
      <P>One issue I want to focus on in the short time available to me is the increase in stamp duty on residential property.  Obviously, everybody welcomes the abolition of property tax, particularly people living in the greater Dublin area.  No doubt it resulted from a discovery made by Labour Party Deputies that the public deeply resents paying property tax and the fact that new found yuppie voters which the Labour Party brought on board had to be accommodated.  Despite the fact that the Labour Party fought tooth and nail in Cabinet for a Property tax and other more draconian measures as far as home ownership is concerned, the Government has now come around to the view that the property tax must be abolished. It is another electoral ploy, albeit a welcome and belated one.</P>
      <P>However, the increase in stamp duty to 9 per cent from 6 per cent on transfers of certain residential properties valued in excess of £150,000 is most unwelcome.  These new proposals are biased against Dublin house buyers and young people in general who are struggling to buy their first house.  It will directly affect the average Dublin family.  With house prices rising by 15 per cent a year, it will not take more than three or four years for a house worth £100,000 at present to rise above the threshold.  It means that a family buying a house costing £175,000 must find over £15,000 on top of the price of the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These new measures will also fuel inflation directly by increasing the cost of home purchases. It will also cause price increases within all sectors of the second-hand home market.  The new stamp duty rates will discourage home ownership, a tradition <Col N="324" /> in this country which brings many benefits for society.  More pressure will also be put on the private rented sector, which is completely under siege particularly in the Dublin city area as the accommodation situation worsens.</P>
    <P>The absence of measures to assist first time buyers and the further reductions in mortgage interest relief are an attack on young people and home ownership.  The Government refuses to increase the first time buyers' grant of £3,000 which has remained static for three years while the value of a young single person's tax relief on a £50,000 mortgage has halved since 1993-94.  It is incorrect to say that money invested in rented accommodation is preferable to house buying.  It is clear that the lower level of home ownership in France and the UK has not translated into economic growth as some economists would suggest.  In Dublin, young people are unable to afford houses in their neighbourhood due to spiralling house prices which have increased by between 31 and 50 per cent in the last three years.  A very real problem is being created for young people who are first time buyers.  The stamp duty increase will do nothing to help but on the contrary will worsen the position.</P>
    <P>I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance on 17 December 1996, Official Report, volume 473, column 225, as follows:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Finance why interest can be paid by the Revenue Commissioners to self-employed taxpayers who have overpaid tax, whereas interest cannot be paid by the Revenue Commissioners to PAYE taxpayers who have overpaid tax; his views on this apparent anomaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response was as follows:</P>
    <P>...The PAYE system is designed to be self regulating by spreading payments evenly over the year as far as possible so that, as a general rule, significant underpayments are minimised. Hence there is no legislation specifically imposing a charge to interest on underpaid PAYE by individual taxpayers or providing for its payment in cases where tax has been overpaid.</P>
    <P>If it comes to light that a PAYE taxpayer has overpaid tax there is no provision for paying interest to that taxpayer.  In many cases the sums involved are substantial so far as that taxpayers is concerned.  In the interest of fairness and equity this needs to be changed.</P>
    <P>The position of the mentally handicapped in our community is serious.  There are strong demands for further activity in that area.  There are 2,950 mentally handicapped people who do not have access to a service.  Some 1,500 have no day service and 1,450 are awaiting residential care.  This service is a basic human right.  The budget made provision for £10 million in addition to the extra £2 million already provided in the <Col N="325" /> published Estimates towards enhancing further our services for people with mental handicap. Unfortunately much more needs to be done.  The State has an obligation to ensure that mentally handicapped people can live full and fruitful lives. We need more positive action in that areas as we are only hitting the tip of the iceberg.  The small amounts provided in the budget are unsatisfactory. We need radical reform to ensure these services are provided for some of the most vulnerable in society.</P>
    <P>Up to now probably only about £15 million per annum has been provided for youth services.  All the agencies working with young people believe this is hopelessly inadequate.  The problem of drug addiction is rampant in some of our communities yet we are providing only a miserly £15 million.  The Catholic Youth Council and many other groups recommend this should be increased to £30 million, most of this coming from national lottery funding.  We need also a radical reappraisal of our youth services, including the funding aspect.  There was little or nothing in the Estimate or in the budget to deal with that important matter.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the budget.  During the past few days like most other Members, I have listened to the debate in my office.  It is interesting to note the political hue put on the budget by people from all sides.  Clearly there is a growing expectation that we are facing up to an election very soon and it would be useful for all concerned if the date was announced.  The Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, would like to know the date too.</P>

That is the way of political life here whether we like it or not.  It would be very interesting in the autumn.  However, we will wait and see what will happen.</P>
      <P>I listened with great enjoyment to Deputy Sheehan as he studiously and carefully delivered his contribution.  No doubt it was to the delight of his constituents in the deepest reaches in County Cork who can hear it on the unique transmitter system which he operates from the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Members use the budget debate to speak on their own brief or a particular matter in which they are interested.  I intend to go back to the mission statement of the IDA about the regionalisation of its policy and the need for jobs outside the major urban centres.  At a time of unprecedented economic boom the IDA is announcing 18,000 jobs per year but areas outside Dublin and Kildare are not getting a look in.  Of <Col N="326" /> the 17,725 jobs announced by the IDA in 1996, Dublin received 12,559 &mdash; 71 per cent; Cork received 1,246 &mdash; 7 per cent; Limerick received 1,038 &mdash; 6 per cent; Galway received 477 &mdash; 3 per cent; Waterford received 301 &mdash; 2 per cent, while the rest of Ireland which includes Connacht, Donegal and Clare got 152 &mdash; 0.86 per cent and the midlands suffered equally badly.  The acting Chairman would say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; except that the is precluded from saying so because he is in the Chair.</P>
    <P>Not one of the new projects announced by the IDA in 1996 went to the west, with the 152 new jobs coming at three existing projects in Sligo and Roscommon.  In 1995, 80 per cent of new overseas industrial projects went to four major cities, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  By 1996 this had risen to 89 per cent.</P>
    <P>When the IDA was established in 1950, following the passing of a Bill in the Houses of the Oireachtas, one of the burning issues of concern was attracting industry to areas outside urban centres.  I have read in the Official Report what Deputies from various political parties said.  It was a time of an inter-party Government when a Labour Minister, Mr. Morrissey, introduced the Bill.  Speaking on Second Stage of the Industrial Development Authority Bill &mdash; Official Report of 9 March 1950, volume 119, column 1590 &mdash; he said:</P>
    <P>In carrying out its functions relating to the establishment of new industries and the expansion of existing industries, the authority is giving and will continue to give special attention to the question of promoting industrial activity outside the main centres of population.</P>
    <P>The theme of locating industry outside urban areas was a dominant one throughout that debate in 1949-50.  The IDA was set up in 1949 on an interim or <i>ad hoc</i> basis and ratified by legislation the following year, following the massive work done by Sean Lemass who was unfortunately out of office when it was implemented.  It is ironic that the issue is back on the agenda 50 years later when one would imagine we should have a developed jobs policy.  This mission statement appears to have been forgotten in these modern times.</P>
    <P>The ongoing imbalance makes no sense from many perspectives.  I welcome the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, who lives in Dublin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, who lives in County Kildare, but I would prefer to address my remarks to a Minister from a rural area.  A national jobs policy which concentrates all developments into a few square miles on the east coast is self-defeating.  It also deepens the frustration and sense of hopelessness which permeates the west and many other areas outside Dublin.  That sense of hopelessness was particularly palpable in many areas during Christmas. People were told they never had it so good, spending was up, shops were busy and people were buying luxury items in greater quantities. <Col N="327" /> However, that phenomenon was confined to the east coast in many respects.  Building shopping trolleys and car boots jammed with goodies were not apparent in rural areas.</P>
    <P>One of the by-products of the boom in Dublin is the traffic gridlock.  The Taoiseach cannot announce a free-flow operation every day.  More people are moving from rural areas or commuting into a city which cannot cope because of its infrastructure. Traffic is choked up not only during peak hours in the morning and evening but throughout the day.  The idea of an on-street light rail system in the city centre now seems like a joke.  Traffic is so disjointed that if it is decided to build a light rail system people will stay out of the city centre.</P>
    <P>Most of the new jobs created in Dublin are going to people from rural areas.  Even though 46,000 jobs were created in Dublin during the past four years the unemployment figure for the city has decreased by only 1,000.  This is a startling figure when one takes account of the figures I gave earlier for IDA job announcements and realisations in Dublin.  Rural people are being crammed into the capital city to fill jobs while Dublin people have to cope with increased traffic, inflated property prices and increasing social problems.</P>
    <P>This migration is having a devastating impact on rural areas.  Most country towns are denuded of young people until weekends or holidays and rural vibrancy is very much confined to Saturday nights.  It is not correct to concentrate all development within a few square miles on the east coast.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the huge investment by the State in providing a countrywide industrial infrastructure of telecommunications, water, roads, sewerage and electricity services goes unreturned.  These services are not being fully utilised in many cases. The last massive transche of EU funding was to be used to improve training and education and the physical infrastructure through building bypasses, bridges and sewerage and water schemes.  The idea behind this was to enable industrial development to take place in all areas and to provide for a tapering off in the requirement for finance for such projects.  I hope we will continue to pitch our tent energetically, so to speak, in seeking funding.  We welcome membership of the EU by eastern European countries but we still have some way to go before we catch up with our European partners in terms of infrastructure.</P>
    <P>There must be a greater balance in the jobs policy.  Many successful international companies with world-wide markets operate successfully and profitably in the west and other areas outside Dublin.  Those companies were attracted to locate in these areas during the 1970s when job targets for the regions were set and there was a precise commitment by various Governments to exploit the first mission statement of the IDA.  Last Saturday night I attended the annual chamber of commerce dinner dance in Claremorris.  The predominant <Col N="328" /> view among people at the dinner dance was that they had lost out and the IDA did not seem to have the same motivation when it came to encouraging enterpreneurs to set up in areas outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>Other companies would also set up in the west if the advantages of these areas were highlighted, for example, the potential of a good educated and dedicated workforce, a better quality of life at a lower cost and supportive communities.  The mission statement of the IDA and the Department of Enterprise and Employment must be focused on this type of promotion.  The wide range of advantages of setting up in rural areas are not being brought to the attention of industrialists.</P>
    <P>The IDA's original mission statement is as relevent today as it was 50 years ago.  All we need to do is refocus our policy and reset the mission statement.  Fianna Fáil in Government will insist on a better geographic distribution of new employment.  We will also require the IDA and other State industrial promotion agencies to appear before Oireachtas committees to ensure greater transparency and accountability on matters such as the distribution of employment and grant payments.  I do not understand why the IDA cannot come before a committee to explain its policies, funding and message.  I am not taking from the fine people who work in the IDA, but there is frustration at the lack of precise information on its activities.</P>
    <P>This, like many other issues, was a missed opportunity in a budget which lacked focus.  The Minister for Finance fiddled with everything but did nothing substantial for anyone.  The budget was particularly disappointing and minimalist for small industries.  Despite all his talk about the introduction of special measures for small businesses, the Minister for Finance produced nothing of substance in this area.  There is nothing in the budget which encourages and fosters enterprise or rewards risk-takers.  The rainbow coalition Government has proven that it is useless at controlling spending.  Instead of targeting specific areas, it has adopted a wide canvas approach. This could well lead to overheating and inflationary pressures on the economy.</P>
    <P>Last January Democratic Left was very active in promoting a very good idea which Deputy McCreevy and I later included in a document in a different form.  It concerned giving special tax incentives to employers who take on employees and sustain that employment, and to deprived urban areas where advance factories are set up and workers employed in them.  It was an interesting document produced by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, two weeks before last year's budget.  He said it would be included in that budget but it was not.  There was no mention of it this year; it seems to have been taken out of the equation.</P>

      <P>The numbers are there for everybody to see and all commentators talk about the hard core of unemployment.  I believe a collective decision was made in Government &mdash; perhaps the Minister of State was not part of it &mdash; to do nothing about that hard core.  A moral dilemma will be created for all of us in politics if we do not recognise that hard core and take measures to deal with it.</P>
      <P>We were told 5,000 people would benefit from the Jobstart and Workplace initiatives but the true figure, given in reply to a Dáil question, is 750.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who should be given a gold star for good housekeeping, gave back to the Exchequer for the second year in a row some of the special money he was given for tackling long-term unemployment. I am in favour of good housekeeping but the Minister is far too thrifty.  That money was to be used for tackling long-term unemployment, yet he handed back £2 million in 1996 and £1,400,000 in 1995 given to him in the budgets for those years.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance made a passing reference to long-term unemployment in his Budget Statement.  Despite the strong economic tide the figures for long-term unemployment did not budget in 1996, and it is an even more searing indictment that the budget documents provided by the Minister indicate that overall unemployment will fall by only 7,000 this year, even less next year and less again the following year.  At a time of economic boom the numbers should be decreasing at a faster pace if we are to make any inroads into this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the 1997 budget.  This third budget introduced by the Government shares all the best qualities of its two predecessors.  It contains innovation and reform while continuing to ensure that the foundations for the sustained growth of our economy remain rock solid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, I am better placed than many to see at first hand the absolute necessity for ensuring that all sectors of society are enabled to benefit from the success of our economy.  In my role as Minister of State I have travelled to all corners of the country to see the work being undertaken by voluntary and community organisations and to meet the people involved.  I have seen the positive effects of the money advice and budgetary services offered by my own Department and have heard the concerns of representatives of those who are, for one reason or another, at the margins of our society today.  In light of this experience, <Col N="330" /> I am particularly pleased that this budget contains many provisions which are aimed at tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>The 1997 budget was framed against a backdrop of a healthy economy which has blossomed under the stewardship of this Government.  The economy is expected to grow by more than 5 per cent in 1997, following an equally successful 1996. Substantial numbers of new jobs continue to be created &mdash; 50,000 net new jobs last year alone. Inflation averaged 1.9 per cent in 1996 and will remain low in 1997.  The health of the economy is beginning to be reflected in the live register, with the December 1996 figure being the lowest December figure recorded for five years.</P>
    <P>Given these circumstances, it would have been easy to abandon the careful management of the economy which has brought us this far.  There has been much talk recently about &ldquo;give-away&rdquo; and &ldquo;election&rdquo; budgets, but the Minister for Finance got it right when he said this is not an election budget &mdash; it is a budget in an election year.  The Government has remained true to its commitment to manage the economy prudently and effectively so that the gains of the past number of years will not be lost.</P>
    <P>The healthy economic and fiscal circumstances I have mentioned have enabled the Government to bring forward a budget which strikes the right balance in terms of our social and economic objectives.  The reduction in the standard rate of income-tax, the widening of the income tax bands, the increase in personal allowances and tax exemption limits and the reduction in employee PRSI and corporation tax rates will improve the position of workers and employers.  These measures provide incentives and rewards for enterpreneurs, employers, employees and the self-employed.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the equation there are a range of measures to improve the position of the less well-off in our society.  The social welfare elements of the budgets cover a wide areas embracing substantial improvements in the weekly rates of payment.  These include innovative reforms such as the introduction of a new sickness allowance and the removal of the final traces of discrimination from the social welfare code; the provision of further substantial support for the voluntary sector; the introduction of enhanced measures designed to ease the transition from unemployment to employment; and a package of measures aimed at improving the position of pensioners and carers.</P>
    <P>There are two measures about which I have long been concerned and which I am especially pleased to see included in this year's budget.  The introduction of pro-rata pensions is one of the most enlightened measures among all the &ldquo;good news&rdquo; items in this year's budget, and one I have sought for a long time both in and out of Government. I raised this issue on numerous occasions in Opposition and my concern about it was and is shared by my colleague, the Minister Deputy <Col N="331" /> De Rossa.  For that reason I am particularly pleased it has been included.</P>
    <P>Over my period as a public representative, I have come across numberous cases where pensioners have failed by the narrowest of margins to satisfy the average test condition requiring a minimum of 20 contributions over a specific period. In a number of other cases, the fact that insurance contributions were paid a long number of years ago, perhaps in the 1950s and 1960s, has had the effect of disqualifying a pensioners rather than helping him or her to qualify as one would have thought.</P>
    <P>The present conditions require a minimum average requirement of 20 contributions over a working lifetime to qualify for the minimum rate of pension.  The new arrangements for pro-rata pensions will provide for a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate where the yearly average is between 15 and 19 and a pension of 50 per cent of the maximum rate where the yearly average is between 10 and 14.  Given that the current minimum rate of pension is 92 per cent of the maximum rate, the rates of pro-rata pension payable are reasonable by reference to the low averages required.</P>
    <P>These new arrangements coming into effect in November will be of benefit mainly to people who have had broken or sporadic contribution records over their working lifetime and will go a long way towards restoring confidence and credibility in the PRSI system in so far as pensioners are concerned.  It will also be of benefit to women, particularly married women, who worked for a number of years before they married then spent a long period outside of the paid workforce and who may have returned to paid employment in recent years.  It will help returned emigrants whose work period abroad cannot be reckoned for pension purposes here and also self-employed people who started their employment before 1988 when PRSI for the self-employed was introduced. I am particularly delighted that the measure is included in this year's budget packet of social welfare improvements.</P>
    <P>An important change is being made in the rules relating to requalification for unemployment benefit which will have a substantial beneficial effect on the incomes of many workers, particularly those in atypical employment &mdash; casual, part-time and so on.  Those workers were precluded from requalifying from unemployment benefit until they had a further 13 PRSI contributions paid after they had exhausted their entitlement to unemployment benefit.  As a result, until such time as they acquired the necessary 13 PRSI contributions, they had to have recourse to unemployment assistance which is means-tested and which took account of whatever earnings they had from their casual employment. The method by which those earnings were assessed caused particular difficulties in areas where the volume of casual work available is declining.  Many workers were entitled to only a <Col N="332" /> reduced rate of unemployment assistance &mdash; or indeed no payment at all &mdash; on the basis of projected earnings which had not materialised.  This matter was brought to the attention of public representatives by various deputations and I am pleased it was addressed in the budget.  Prior to the budget the previous earnings of those applying for social assistance were assessed in such a way that they could not possibly qualify for assistance. The detrimental effects of this measure should have been obvious when it was introduced in 1992.</P>
    <P>I have been aware of these difficulties for some time and have had regular meetings with representatives of casual dockers, meat processing workers and part-time firemen with a view to ascertaining what could be done to rectify the problem.  At those meetings I undertook to have the Department review the existing arrangements in the context of introducing proposals for consideration in the budget.  I am pleased the Government addressed this problem by providing for a restoration to the position which applied prior to 1991 for requalifying for unemployment benefit.  This will benefit local economies as well as the workers concerned.</P>
    <P>A person can now requalify for unemployment benefit by having the necessary 13 PRSI contributions paid at any time after the 156th day of unemployment.  This means that where the 13 requalifying contributions are paid between the 156th day &mdash; six months &mdash; and the 390th day &mdash; 15 months &mdash; the claimant can requalify for unemployment benefit immediately after the 390 days have exhausted.  Rather than having to have recourse to unemployment assistance, a claimant in those circumstances will requalify for a further 15 months of unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>It is expected that at least 5,000 casual workers, currently receiving reduced rates of unemployment assistance, will benefit by an average of £11 per week under the new arrangement.  This change will be provided for in the Social Welfare Bill, 1997, which is expected to be enacted before the end of March.  The problems that have beset casual workers, dockers and part-time firemen will be addressed in that Bill.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements for requalifying for unemployment benefit, allied to the changes introduced last year for casual workers whereby an unemployed person who works for up to three days a week may, subject to his or her earnings level, qualify for the full rate of unemployment assistance for that week, will improve significantly the quality of life of casual worker, and put an end to the lie that one is better off on social welfare than at work.  All our efforts must be directed at ensuring those at works stay at work and those on the live register are given every encouragement and incentive to get back to the workforce.</P>
    <P>Another pro-employment measures introduced in the budget relates to the back-to-work allowance scheme.  This scheme, which provides social welfare recipients with a reducing level of payment <Col N="333" /> over three years while they re-establish in the active labour force, whether in employment or self-employment, has proven successful.  Under the scheme we are providing for an increase of 5,000 places, from 17,000 to 22,000, and approximately 1,000 of the new places will be earmarked for people on disability allowance.</P>
    <P>To further enhance the scheme, the technical assistance fund &mdash; an important element of the service available to participants &mdash; is being doubled from £600,000 to £1.2 million, and a further £500,000 is being provided towards the extension of the loan guarantee fund to enable credit unions to provide low interest loans to recipients of the allowance.</P>
    <P>We are also establishing a special fund which will provide financial support for projects aimed at helping the unemployed return to work.  Such projects include intensive guidance and training courses for the unemployed.  A sum of £300,000 is being allocated for this purpose in 1997. Deputies may recall that one of the measures introduced last year provided for unemployed people returning to work to continue to receive child dependant allowance for a period of 13 weeks.  This measure will be extended to additional categories, including community employment participants who move directly into employment or who take up employment under the Jobs Initiative and people who move directly from the live register to work under the Jobs Initiative.</P>
    <P>The role of the voluntary and community sectors in enhancing the quality of life for people dependent on social welfare and in enabling them to better their circumstances cannot be undervalued. The Department of Social Welfare has taken a lead for some years in supporting local self-help and community development initiatives. I have been privileged to witness the fruits of these efforts at first hand and I am delighted the budget is providing additional resources, to the tune of £1.3 million, for this sector.  This increased provision will bring the total allocation for 1997 for voluntary and community services to approximately £10.7 million.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with some of the other notable improvements in social welfare announced in the budget.  The budget provides for an increase of £3 per week in all the personal payments and an increase of £1.50 per week in all adult dependant allowances.  In percentage terms, this means an increase of between 4 per cent and 4.7 per cent for various schemes at a time when inflation is expected to be approximately 2.2 per cent.  Some years ago Government could only give increases in line with or below inflation, which did not register a net improvement for the recipient.</P>
    <P>The budget also provides for the allocation of resources towards further enhancing the value of child benefit.  Following the substantial increases provided for in the past two budgets, the primary concern this year is to target large families who would generally be at greater risk of property.  This <Col N="334" /> is being achieved through an increase of £1 per child per month for the first two children and £5 per child for the third and subsequent children. The cumulative effect of increases in child benefit is illustrated by the fact that a three child family will have more than doubled their child benefit in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>The dedication of resources towards child benefit reflects the approach recommended by the Expert Working Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare, whose final report I launched last June.  I am pleased the budget also takes account of a number of other recommendations made by that group, notably the improvements in family income supplement and the introduction of a tapered adult dependant allowance. The budget has provided incentives for people to take up employment rather than remain on social welfare.  It provides for significant improvements in the family income supplement with a view to increasing a return to work in families with children. The income thresholds governing entitlement to FIS are being increased by £10 at each point.  This will give virtually all current recipients an increase of £6 in their weekly payments.  FIS entitlements will be determined on the basis of gross earnings, less PRSI contributions, levies and superannuation contributions.</P>
    <P>Another crucial reform in the budget relates to the property and unemployment trap which existed because of the way the adult dependant allowance and half of any child dependant allowance is withdrawn once the earnings of the spouse of a claimant exceed £60 per week.  The Government has made strides towards stripping disincentives to employment from the social welfare system. The measure being introduced to provide for a trapered adult dependant allowance is a further demonstration of the Government's commitment to ensuring the social welfare system acts as a springboard into employment rather than leaving people with little option but to remain dependant on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will be familiar with the negative aspects of current treatment of the earnings of a spouse of a social welfare claimant.  For example, where the spouse of a person claiming unemployment benefit earns £60 a week, a £1 increase in the spouse's earning leads to a drop of £38.50 in the weekly rate of unemployment benefit payable.  The budget provides for the introduction of a trapered withdrawal of the adult dependant allowance in the case of recipients of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit, disability allowance and pre-retiremen allowance.  This measure is expected to benefit almost 10,000 families in which the dependent spouse of a social welfare recipient is in low paid employment.  These families will gain, on average, about £19 per week.  We intend to extend these new measures to the other social welfare payment schemes, such as invalidity, retirement, old age and blind pensions, at an early date and to further improve the way in which the tapering operates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> The budget provides for real increases in the living standards of those who depend on social welfare.  It provides enhanced supports for families, unemployed people, pensioners, the ill and the disabled.  Above all it seeks to ensure that the fruits of our successfully managed and thriving economy are shared by all.  The cost of the social welfare improvements in the budget is £114 million this year and £215 million in a full year.  These are the largest amounts ever provided in a budget for social welfare.  Over the last three budgets the Government has provided almost £590 million for social welfare improvements &mdash; a clear commitment to social protection for those who are unable to look after themselves and for those marginalised and excluded from making a full contribution to society.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest and scepticism to the contradictory messages from the Opposition parties. On the one hand, I am amused by Fianna Fáil's suggestions that this budget benefits the better off in society.  On the other hand, the Progressive Democrats say it is a budget hijacked by the Labour Party and Democratic Left and that they have great pity for Fine Gael's lack of influence on the budget.  The budget incorporates the combined wisdom of the three parties in Government and a great measure of the input of each party is reflected in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Fianance was presented with a unique opportunity this year.  He could have followed the calls from the Opposition and gone for a &ldquo;free for all&rdquo; budget and injected huge amounts of money into the economy.  Such a strategy has been practiced in other jurisdictions with disastrous results.  The Progressive Democrats drew a comparision with Germany, although very different economic circumstances exist there.  The measures needed in the two economies are totally different, a fact which seems to have escaped the thinking from that quarter.</P>

      <P>On the 25th anniversary of the massacre in Derry on Bloody Sunday, it is appropriate that the House should consider the need for truth, justice and the rule of law to prevail for the victims of the British troops.  On that day 13 people were killed and one other person died later.  Those of us who were presents in the church in Creggan for the funerals recall seeing the coffins at the altar.  We felt a sense of grief, agony and pent up anger in the community as it tried to <Col N="336" /> come to terms with the murder of its relations, friends and neighbours.  That anger was shared by the nation.</P>
      <P>It is agreed by all that the victims were innocent. The British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, in a letter to Mr. John Hume in 1992 made it clear that the victims were to be considered innocent. Why then were they shot?  The British Government established the Widgery Inquiry, a whitewash tribunal, which was nothing but a cover up. Successive Governments have called for the Widgery Inquiry's findings to be quashed and for a new inquiry to be set up.</P>
      <P>The case for such an inquiry has been strengthened by the new evidence which has become available recently through Channel 4 television. It gave details from British army witnesses and recordings of radio transmissions which were available to the Widgery Inquiry.  Mr. John Hume has succeeded in securing more than 60 signatures from Members of the House of Commons calling for a new inquiry.  I support that call on behalf of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The Government should press the British Government to establish a new inquiry into the massacre so that justice may be done.  We will not allow the Government to be fobbed off by the British Government.  Justice and the memory of the victims demand that we have a new inquiry so that the facts might be made known.  If the Government does not succeed in persuading the British Government it should pursue the matter at EU, European Court of Human Rights and UN level and it would have our support.</P>

As democratic politicians trying to save the peace process, it is incumbent on us to prove that the rule of law and the ways and institutions of democratic politics must be seen to be thorough, impartial and above reproach.  The Widgery Inquiry was none of these things.  It proved to be a farce.  At the time I supported it because I thought it was a real tribunal of inquiry led by Lord Widgery.  However, I subsequently became aware of the limits of that futile exercise.</P>

      <P>I am replying on behalf of the Tánaiste who is unable to be present.  I thank the Deputy for providing the House with the opportunity to mark the 25th anniversary of the terrible events in Derry known as &ldquo;Bloody Sunday&rdquo;.  It is correct that this House joins in the commemoration and remembrance of the 14 who died.  It is also correct that we recall the trauma of all those directly caught up in the tragic events of that day, particularly those who were wounded and the families of the victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> Bloody Sunday deeply affected not only those directly involved but a whole generation who found nothing but disillusionment in the events of that day and their subsequent presentation by the authorities &mdash; a presentation which many believed was deeply, even perversely, at odds with the facts.  The account of Bloody Sunday offered by the Widgery tribunal blighted the cause of peace and reconciliation.  The trauma of Bloody Sunday endures as a living legacy of grief for the relatives of those who died.  They buried their loved ones but they can find no peace until the imputation of the innocence of the victims contained in the report of the Widgery tribunal is finally and unequivocally expunged from the official account of what happened that day.</P>
    <P>The Widgery tribunal remains the official version of events on Bloody Sunday.  It was never considered satisfactory either by those who were there or by the Government.  Over the years, the Government has supported moves to meet the legitimate concerns of the relatives.  It has indicated to the British Government on a number of occasions, including through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, that it would welcome any further steps which could be taken to meet these concerns, particularly the demand for a comprehensive and unequivocal statement that the victims were totally innocent, were engaged in peaceful protest and were not involved in violence.</P>
    <P>The trauma of Bloody Sunday has recently been powerfully evoked by the publication of a number of the 500 eyewitness accounts given to the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association in the days following Bloody Sunday.  These were made available at the time to the Widgery tribunal but were not used in any substantive way. Don Mullen, the editor and moving spirit behind the publication of those accounts in his book <i>Bloody Sunday, Eyewitness</i>, has done an immense service to the memory of the victims and the cause of their relatives.</P>
    <P>There are many others who have been working to establish the truth of what happened on that day and we have seen in recent days some of the fruits of their endeavours.  Their work for truth and justice has been undertaken without partisan interest and driven solely by the need to serve truth and help bring closure to the grief of the victims' relatives.  They deserve our commendation and support.  Those accounts help us realise the horrendous shock of violence and death, the reverberations of the pain and suffering of families affected by it which never quite fade.  It reminds us that the purpose that violence in Northern Ireland often claims is both evil and spurious.  Violence serves no purpose other than its own futile perpetuation.</P>
    <P>The demand for a new inquiry has been strengthened by the re-evaluation of the significance of the eyewitness statements and other findings contained in Don Mullen's book.  Investigations by the media have added to the belief that the Parachute Regiment was not alone in its <Col N="338" /> responsibility for the killings on that day and that at least three of the victims may have died as a result of shots fired from the vicinity of Derry's walls.  I understand evidence is emerging that statements made by soldiers to the Widgery tribunal are significantly different from statements they made earlier.  These developments are a serious cause for concern in that not only do they add to the widely shared view that the Widgery tribunal was flawed in its methodology and conclusions but, taken together, they point to a radically different version of events.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, already made clear both yesterday and today, it is incumbent on the British Government to investigate this new information and to do so as quickly as possible, in as thorough a fashion as possible.  Questioned on Bloody Sunday today in the House of Commons, the British Prime Minister, John Major, stated &ldquo;with fresh evidence, of course we will examine it.&rdquo;  We will be urging the British Government to act on this specific statement.</P>
    <P>The key issue is to redress the injustice done to the victims' families, and to the memory of the victims themselves, by the imputations of the Widgery report.  It might be open to the British Government to do this on the basis of new evidence in the public domain, or material privately available to them, without resort to the machinery of an inquiry &mdash; the objective is to ensure a just and dignified closure of this terrible chapter, not to relive it or perpetuate the pain and anger it caused.  To that end, the Tánaiste made clear his intention to raise the concerns generated by the current re-evaluations of the evidence at the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and has instructed my officials to make the appropriate arrangements through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.  He will also take the opportunity to discuss this issue with the Secretary of State when they meet in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to again raise the need to provide an adequate health care unit at Cootehill.  The Minister of State will be aware, from his Department's files, that I raised this issue by way of parliamentary questions on a number of occasions.  I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State to provide funding for this project within the 1997 capital budget allocation to the North Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cootehill is the second largest town in County Cavan with a population in excess of 2,000.  It also has a sizeable population in its large catchment area which stretches into north County Monaghan. Cootehill is a town of great importance to the east Cavan region.  Unfortunately, for a town of its size and for the population of its catchment area, there is no proper health care unit.  I have put forward a strong case to the health board for some time and, latterly to the Department of Health and the Minister, to have this project progressed as quickly as possible.  The Minister for <Col N="339" /> Health, Deputy Noonan, visited Cootehill some time ago and met representatives of the political parties, local public representatives and members of local voluntary organisations.  He was made aware of the keen local interest in having this much needed facility provided as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The people of Cootehill and its catchment area deserve to have a full range of medical and nursing services provided in a modern centre such as that proposed for the town.  The facility, when provided, will be of major benefit to the local population.  I am aware that health board officials have been anxious to make further progress with this proposal.  I was delighted when it was decided to plan this health care unit to encompass a wide range of facilities including provision for general practitioner services, speech therapy, dental, public health nursing, occupational therapy, psychological and other services, and a day care centre.</P>
    <P>There are many active voluntary organisations in Cootehill which do an outstanding job.  They will make a significant contribution to the successful operation of an adequate day care centre. The provision of a proper day care centre within the health care unit will be of great benefit to the local elderly population.  It is essential to have such facilities in towns such as Cootehill so that people of that age group can avail of them.  The people of this area deserve to have a comprehensive range of community health services provided in a modern and adequate facility.  Likewise, those responsible for delivering the health services also deserve access to proper facilities.</P>
    <P>The concluding paragraph in the Minister's reply to my most recent parliamentary question on this issue on Wednesday, 22 January is as follows:</P>
    <P>The question of funding for health centre priorities in 1997 is currently under consideration in my Department and will be communicated to the health boards in the near future.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to convey to the Minister the anxiety of local people and public representatives that the necessary funding should be provided to enable construction of the proposed centre at Cootehill to commence as early as possible in 1997.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a health care unit in Cootehill is a matter for the North Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  In 1995 the Department requested from each health board a detailed plan and approximate costings of health centres for development over a three year period, 1996-8.  In response, the North Eastern Health Board forwarded this plan of capital projects for those years.  Included in the programme was a day centre-health centre in Cootehill.  The board proposed that the new centre should provide the following services: reception-administration, environmental health, day care services for the elderly, <Col N="340" /> general practitioner services, dental services, public health nursing, public health medical service, outreach consultant services, mentally handicap services, speech and language and psychology and ophthalmology.</P>
      <P>The cost of the project has been estimated by the board at £600,000.  I understand from the board that the project, which is being progressed, is currently at design stage of planning and that a planning application will be lodged shortly with Cavan County Council.  Progress on the project will be subject to planning permission being received and availability of capital funding.</P>
      <P>The Department will shortly communicate to each health board the capital allocations available for health centre developments.  It will then be a matter for the North Eastern Health Board to prioritise the development at Cootehill in relation to the many other health centre projects for which it has sought funding.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned at the antirural bias of the Minister's decision of 19 December to abolish water charges in urban areas while totally ignoring the 150,000 households in rural Ireland connected to group water schemes.  This is a matter of fundamental importance in my constituency.  I wish to ask the Minister a number of questions.</P>
      <P>Was the decision thought out?  Why did the Minister announce it almost immediately after 88 local authorities spent weeks preparing their estimates for 1997?  They were undermined by the abolition of water charges and their replacement by motor tax.  Was there agreement between Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left on this matter? I have no doubt that Labour and Democratic Left would not worry too much about rural Ireland.  Why did the Minister discriminate against rural Ireland?  On 21 January when he tried to correct his monumental blunder, why did he not decide to abolish water charges for all people on group water schemes rather than only for those who receive their supply from local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Government believe that motorists should be responsible for local charges?  Nobody else believes that.  If motor tax went towards roads it would be acceptable but not in substitution for other charges in urban areas.  Does the Minister realise he has totally undermined urban councils by removing their source of funding? They will be unable to keep funding from motor tax, they will be similar to town commissioners. Does the Minister believe it is equitable that most people pay no charge for their water supply while some must be satisfied with a tax rebate of up to £150?  Will he guarantee that the funding provided this year will be sufficient for current needs of local authorities, particularly for the upgrading of the water supply to Environmental Protection Agency standards, about which the Minister made much fuss?  Did the Minister consult local <Col N="341" /> authorities about group water schemes?  Did he consult the group water schemes and, if so, how many of them want to be taken over by local authorities?  If that is done, local authorities will have power to limit the amount of water they receive and to charge whatever they wish.</P>
    <P>This decision, which was badly thought out, is anti-rural.  When the Minister found he was in a hole, rather than rationalise his way out of it, he dug himself deeper into it.  As he is aware, an important meeting will take place tonight in Tuam which will be attended by representatives of group water schemes throughout the country. Those people are irate at what they see as discrimination against people in rural Ireland, including those who receive their water supply from privately sourced group water schemes.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Dempsey, when speaking yesterday on the budget stated that Fianna Fáil in Government will ensure that all people in group water schemes will receive equality of treatment in recognition of their role in providing a vital service in rural areas.  Will the Minister at this late stage consult with representatives of group water schemes to ensure equity between urban dwellers and people living in rural Ireland?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Howlin, the Minister for the Environment, regrets that due to other official business he is unable to be present to reply to this debate.  I am glad, however, to have the opportunity of explaining to the House his position on this matter.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Better Local Government</i>&mdash;<i>A Programme for Change</i>, which the Minister published last December, lays down a comprehensive agenda for change which features increased devolution of responsibility to local authorities and a new funding system under which local authority charges for domestic water and sewerage services are being abolished.  Following on the decisions in that programme, the Minister recently announced a package of specific measures on group water schemes and small public water and sewerage schemes.  These measures include the devolution of responsibility for group schemes to local authorities, a policy that was signalled in the Department of the Environment's operational strategy, published in March 1996, and recommended by the Devolution Commission.  This policy was extended to small public water and sewerage schemes in the programme published last month. A capital provision of £15 million is being made available to local authorities in 1997 in block grant form to finance this package of measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the abolition of service charges for water and sewerage facilities, local authorities will no longer charge group water schemes for the supply of domestic water.  This will lead to a considerable reduction in the amount of charges made to members of groups supplied from public schemes.  The Minister is very much aware that there are a large number of rural households served by group schemes which have their own <Col N="342" /> private supplies and that a significant number of these supplies are not up to standard.  The most recent Environmental Protection Agency report on drinking water quality has drawn attention to the poor quality of private group schemes where chlorination and other suitable disinfection procedures are either inadequate, poorly maintained or not used.  It is essential at this time to concentrate greater resources on upgrading these schemes.</P>
    <P>For the first time, the Minister is making a special capital provision of £5 million in 1997 to establish a new multi-annual programme of works by local authorities to enable them to upgrade and take over existing group water and sewerage schemes, thus remedying substandard systems and eliminating domestic charges for the group scheme members concerned.  A number of large, efficient and well managed group schemes, including some from Deputy O'Hanlon's constituency, may prefer to remain fully private.  This preference will be fully respected and the necessary financial and technical assistance for the refurbishment of these schemes will be available through the normal group water scheme programme, in future to be managed by local authorities. The Minister is convinced that the key to improved operational efficiency in private group schemes is through greater local authority involvement in all aspects of the management and operation of the schemes.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment is proceeding immediately with arrangements for the devolution to local authorities of full responsibility for the administration of group scheme grant applications for new schemes, or the extension or upgrading of existing ones.  Full responsibility for small public water and sewerage schemes will also be devolved and capital funding in the form of block grants will be made available to local authorities for this purpose in 1997 and future years.  Local authority managers are being consulted in working out the detailed arrangements for the implementation of these measures.</P>
    <P>Submissions received from group water scheme committees will also be taken into account in this context.  The Minister has already assured local authorities that additional current costs incurred by local authorities in the implementation of the various measures will be among the factors taken into account in determining distributions from the equalisation fund being established this year.</P>
    <P>There is no question of inequity in the treatment of urban versus rural dwellers.  In the case of households served by local authority public water and sewerage systems, the objective was to remove charges in respect of domestic connections to these systems in the context of a new funding system for local authorities.  It was never the intention, nor would it be appropriate, to include every private water supply and sewerage installation in these arrangements.  The large number of group schemes connected to public water supply systems will no longer have to pay local authorities for the supply of domestic water. <Col N="343" /> Those group schemes not connected to a public supply stand to benefit directly from the special measures I referred to, as they are upgraded and taken over by local authorities.  Members of all group schemes will continue to benefit from income tax relief at the standard rate in respect of charges of £150 per year paid to groups.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to raise the matter of the price of the pint.  I was pleased to raise it this morning and to ask the Taoiseach his opinion on it.  He replied at great length, but there were concerted jeers, notably from the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan. The Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, said, &ldquo;There is not a man left in Fianna Fáil&rdquo; implying that it was not up to a woman to raise this matter.  The Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, said, &ldquo;I did not know that the Deputy prefers a pint&rdquo;.  I was doing my job raising concerns on behalf of consumers and those kind of comments were made across the floor by a particularly red neck branch of Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology at the Department of Enterprise and Employment say what he intends to do about the matter?  I read what he is quoted as saying in the newspapers yesterday.  I know he met representatives of the Licensed Vintners' Association today and I admire his alacrity in getting to grips with the matter.  It appears from informal soundings I made that a considerable minority of licensed vintners, perhaps up to 25 per cent to 30 per cent, jumped the gun by raising the price of the pint prior to, during and immediately after Christmas. I presume the Minister, when replying, will deal with that matter.  I also understand the Dublin sector of the Licensed Vintners' Association &mdash; this increase does not concern rural Ireland &mdash; were not in favour of this type of unilateral action and asked its members not to engage in it.</P>
      <P>At a time when we are told there is an economic boom and one can repair to hotels, lounges and various places of enjoyment, for many people a pint remains one of life's few pleasures, particularly for the unemployed or those on low wages. Consumers do not like and do not intend to be ripped off.  It appears consumers were put at a disadvantage because of the action of some, a minority of licensed vintners in Dublin.  Will the Minister of State invoke the Price Acts.  I know from my time in the Department of Enterprise and Employment that those Acts are not subsumed, they are on the Statute Book.  They are in abeyance, but that does not mean they cannot be revived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who raised the price of the pint injudiciously should now bring down their prices and, if they do not and are not in agreement with the Licensed Vintners' Association, the Minister of <Col N="344" /> State, the Department and Members of the House &mdash; in raising this matter I am speaking on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; they should be made do so.  Whatever mechanism can be used should be used to control prices, whether the Competition Authority and its new enforcement director, the Prices Acts or various legislation governing prices.  It was considered that competition would take care of prices and that there would not be any need to continue to enforce the provisions of those Acts, but I question that.</P>
    <P>The price increase imposed by a minority of licensed vintners represents shabby treatment of consumers.  They have suffered.  Because the pint could be considered one of life's few pleasures, even though the imposition of this increase breaks the law, it could be considered as not a very serious matter.  One could say that people who go out for a pint can afford it, but I do not hold that point of view.  The consumer, in some cases, has been fleeced.  What does the Minister intend to do about that?  If he intends to take strong action, I will support him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful the Deputy raised this important issue. She is particularly well informed about the issue. As Deputy O'Rourke said, about 25 per cent to 30 per cent of publicans in the Dublin area broke ranks by imposing an arbitrary increase of 5p on the pint before Christmas and since then the price has increased and in the past week the price continued to rise.  That matter has caused serious disquiet in Government.</P>
      <P>Habitually we have negotiations with the Licensed Vintners' Association of Ireland.  It represents an important trade, which is a major employer and a valuable source of revenue for the Minister for Finance and the Exchequer. However, representations were made to us concerning the imminent budget.  It will be noted that for the third consecutive budget introduced by the Government there has not been any increase in excise duty on alcoholic drink.  There has not been an increase in the price of a pint since 1994 when Deputy Ahern the then Minister for Finance imposed a 3p increase.  That is reflected in the CSO figures.  From February 1994 to November 1996 the price taken by the publicans was 8 per cent against a consumer price index for the same period of 6.1 per cent.</P>
      <P>The important point Deputy O'Rourke was getting at is that the take by the publicans over that period has increased; in March 1991 the publicans' take was 35.4 per cent, in June 1996 it was 40 per cent.  We got little enough credit for not increasing excise duties in the budget, but some publicans have increased the price of the pint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those reasons I share the concerns raised by Deputy O'Rourke.  Two courses of action are open to me.  As Deputy O'Rourke rightly said, the Prices Acts are still on the Statute Book.  Price controls have been put in abeyance, but as the Prices Acts have not been repealed the power is <Col N="345" /> there to take action.  Under the Competition (Amendment) Act passed last year the Competition Authority has the right to investigate and, depending on whether it finds contraventions of legislation or anti-competitive practice, it can initiate prosecutions.  In spelling out to the Licensed Vintners' Association the powers open to Government and the fact that the Government is incensed at what has happened, I was able to persuade them to agree to call back the increases that have been imposed.</P>
    <P>The joint statement agreed with the Licensed Vintners' Association reads:</P>
    <P>Mr. Pat Rabbitte, T.D., Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology this afternoon (Thursday, 30th January, 1997) met with representatives of the Licensed Vintners' Association to discuss the increases in the price of beer over the past two months.</P>
    <P>At the meeting it was established that a minority of Dublin publicans had taken a price increase over the last two months and this number has been rising over the last week.  At recent area meetings, the LVA had recommended <Col N="346" /> price restraint at this time.  It was noted that in the recent Budget, no further excise was imposed.</P>
    <P>Both the LVA and the Minister agreed to call on these publicans to take immediate steps to bring their price levels back to those obtaining in early November, 1996.</P>
    <P>If this doesn't happen forthwith, the Minister made clear that he will make a price fixing Order retrospective to, and freezing prices at, their November, 1996 level.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that for the male drinker and an increasing number of female drinkers, the pint of plain is &ldquo;yer only man&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The promotion of Irish exports from particular sectors to particular markets is a matter for the board of An Bord Tráchtála &mdash; ABT.  Under section 6 (1) of the Trade and Marketing Promotion Act, 1991, the board is charged with promoting, assisting and developing &ldquo;in any manner which the board considers necessary or desirable&rdquo; the marketing of Irish goods and certain services. Accordingly, any promotional initiatives of the type envisaged in the questions are day-to-day matters for ABT and inquiries, therefore, should be addressed directly to ABT.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 36 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>Overall the outcome of the World Trade Organisation's ministerial conference was highly successful from both a European Union and Irish Presidency perspective.</P>
      <P>The conference agreed a ministerial declaration which addresses the central issues relevant to the further strengthening of the multilateral trading system and sets out a work programme for the organisation.</P>
      <P>Ministers also approved a plan of action for least developed countries aimed at improving the capacity of these countries to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the multilateral trading system.  They also endorsed recommendations that action be initiated within the framework of the Food Aid Convention with a view to the establishment of food aid commitments sufficient to meet the needs of least developed and net food importing developing countries during the Uruguay round reform process.  The aim is to cover a wider range of donors and donable foodstuffs than currently covered by the Food Aid Convention, to develop guidelines so that an increasing proportion of food aid is provided in fully grant form and-or on appropriate concessional terms and to improve the effectiveness and positive impact of food aid.  The EU, under Ireland's Presidency, was to the fore in promoting the approval of these decisions in favour of developing countries.</P>
      <P>The conference also agreed to the setting up of working groups to explore the possibility of further WTO action in the areas of trade and investment and trade and competition.  The establishment of these groups was an EU priority.  On labour standards, WTO members renewed their commitment to the observance of internationally recognised core labour standards and noted the continuing collaboration between the secretaries of the WTO and the International Labour Organisation.</P>
      <P>In relation to the environment, the conference renewed the mandate of the WTO's Committee on Trade and Environment, following the acceptance of its report by all WTO members.  The EU had hoped for concrete decisions that would have confirmed the compatibility with WTO rules of certain trade measures taken for environmental reasons.  The EU did not achieve its ambitions in this respect mainly due to the position taken by many developing countries who fear that environmental measures may be used as a form of trade protectionism.  However, the renewal of the mandate of this committee, with its comprehensive work programme, will give an opportunity for the EU to pursue its aim of fully incorporating environmental concerns into the multilateral trading system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions at the ministerial conference also resulted in a ministerial declaration on trade in information technology products being adopted by a number of WTO members including the <Col N="349" /> European Union.  This provides for the elimination of customs duties and other duties and charges on information technology products by the year 2000.  The agreement is due to be finalised by 1 April 1997.</P>
    <P>In relation to negotiations on finalising market access arrangements in the telecommunications sector, considerable progress was made <i>en marge</i> of the conference in getting additional countries to come forward with improved offers.  These negotiations are due to conclude in February 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the European Commission submitted, in September 1994, a proposal for a Council directive on harmonisation of the main provisions concerning export credit insurance for transactions with medium and long-term cover.  While the principle of harmonisation was supported by all member states, there was strong opposition to the manner through which the Commission proposed this harmonisation should be effected.</P>
      <P>In late 1995, the issue was considered by the General Affairs Council, which requested the Commission to review its proposal.  I understand that the Commission is continuing to work on its proposal, and I would expect that a formal proposal will soon be made by it.</P>

      <P>The tourism investment referred to in Partnership 2000 relates primarily to the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 which will, it is expected, result in total investment of more than £650 million over the life of the programme. The actual schedule of expenditure under the programme depends, <i>inter alia</i>, on the pace of public and private sector investment.  To date, the pace of expenditure on product development has been somewhat slower than originally anticipated but the marketing and training sub-programmes are proceeding in line with the provisions of the operational programme. I am confident that the full investment of £650 million envisaged in the operational programme and as set out in the following tabular statement will be achieved by the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated on previous occasions, Bord Fáilte, as part of its day to day marketing and promotional activity, is responsible for managing tourism brand Ireland, including the monitoring of its costs and the sourcing of funding for the project.</P>

      <P>As part of the overall mid-term review of the Community Support Framework and in common with other operational programmes, the mid-term review of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99 has already commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> The review process of the tourism operational programmes began last year with the drawing up of detailed terms of reference for a mid-term evaluation, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the European Commission and the appointment by the national monitoring committee of a mid-term evaluator.</P>
    <P>I understand that the mid-term evaluator's report is being finalised at present and that it is the intention to have it considered at a specially convened meeting of the national monitoring committee of the tourism operational programme at the end of February.  The results of this consideration will then be fed into the overall CSF mid-term review process.  This is to allow the Government and the European Commission to review the general thrust and direction of CSF programmes, to decide on any strategic changes required and to determine any inter programme re-allocations which might be required in the first instance prior to considering changes within individual programmes.  The CSF review is due to be completed later this year.</P>
    <P>Any changes arising from this review process which result in amendments to the operational programme for tourism will, of course, be made public.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 45, 99 and 100 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, in response to previous questions on this subject, outlined the history and decision making process under the current operational programme for tourism in relation to this project and it may be useful in responding to the specific <Col N="352" /> questions put down by Deputies to also bring the House up to date on the whole issue at this stage.</P>
    <P>No departmental committee, as such, has given consideration to the issue of a national conference centre or made recommendations in this regard.  The tourism potential of a national conference centre has long been recognised and the first Operational Programme for Tourism, 1989-1993, contained provision for such a development. A steering group of experts from the private and public sector operating under the aegis of the Central Review Committee of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, better known as the PESP, was established by the then Taoiseach to help finalise proposals.  No progress was made, however, at that stage and the current Operational Programme fo Tourism 1994-1999, or Tourism OP as it is often referred to, makes provision for 50 per cent European Regional Development Fund support for a private sector proposal for a large dedicated conference centre capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates to be built in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In September-October 1995, Bord Fáilte organised an open tendering competition seeking interested parties to submit proposals for grant assistance towards the development of such a centre and 13 consortia submitted full proposals. These were rigorously assessed by a Bord Fáilte led assessment team and considered by the independent product development management board set up under the operational programme to consider such projects.  None of the applicants met the criteria which had been set and the tendering competition accordingly self-terminated. Following the failure of the competition to produce an acceptable private sector proposal, an alternative strategy was pursued whereby Bord Fáilte, under the aegis of the independent management board, examined an outline proposal from the Royal Dublin Society (RDS) which, as a voluntary body, is potentially eligible for consideration for a higher rate of capital assistance normally reserved, under the Tourism OP, for public and similar bodies.</P>
    <P>The possibility of a second proposal, involving a public-private joint venture, was also explored during 1996 but I was informed by Bord Fáilte, who are responsible for assessing such proposals, that the promoters were not in a position to submit the necessary outline details within deadlines set to allow assessment of suitability for inclusion in the alternative strategy.</P>
    <P>Upon completion of its examination of the RDS proposal, Bord Fáilte, on the recommendation of the management board, commissioned an independent cost/benefit analysis which is required under the Tourism OP in the case of all large projects.  This was undertaken by an experienced UK consultancy firm who were selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure.</P>
    <P>The Government, having taken into account a number of factors including the recommendations of the management board and Bord Fáilte, and <Col N="353" /> the results of the cost benefit analysis, agreed on 5 November to make a submission to the European Commission, recommending formal approval of the proposed development by the RDS.  The Government is recommending approval of 75 per cent capital grant aid subject to the existing financial provision for such project in the current tourism OP.  The proposal has now been submitted to the European Commission for its formal agreement, which is required under the operational programme for projects of this scale, and a formal response is now awaited.</P>
    <P>A specific timescale for commencement or completion of the national conference centre project cannot be determined until the proposal has been formally approved by the European Commission, and matters such as planning permission are in place.  There is, however, no reason to believe that the project cannot be completed and supported within the timeframe permissible under the operational programme.</P>

      <P>The UK market currently accounts for 25 per cent of total merchandise exports and for about 42 per cent of ABT client companies in the non-food sector.  In the context of our planned membership of economic and monetary union and having regard to the uncertainies surrounding participation by the UK in the single currency I have set the board of ABT a target to increase the proportion of indigenous exports going to continental EU markets by 2 per cent per annum up to 1999.</P>
      <P>The principal instrument which ABT will use to achieve these targets is the marketing initiative: &ldquo;Opportunity Europe&rdquo; under which £10 million will be spent this year by ABT specifically to assist exporters to commit themselves fully to developing the enormous business potential of the continental European market.</P>

      <P>However, it would be premature, at this stage, to speculate on precise changes which might be required up to 1999 and after, particularly in trade promotion policy.  The Operational Programme for Industrial Development, which includes funding for ABT promotional programme to the end of 1999 is, in common with all other operational programmes, currently the subject of examination under a mid-term review process.  The external evaluators of the operational programme have almost finalised their report, and are engaged in consultations at the moment with my Department on the trade promotion aspects.  Their report will then be considered by the national monitoring committee for this programme which will make final recommendations regarding the programme, including changes, if appropriate, to promotional programmes to run to end 1999.</P>

      <P>Public policy on trade promotion has always provided for the fullest possible participation by the private sector in the marketing and <Col N="355" /> promotion of their products and services.  Essentially, producers are in the best position to sell their products and the role of the State is really to assist and facilitate their efforts in pursuit of these objectives.</P>
      <P>However, under section 6 (1) of the Trade and Marketing Promotion Act, 1991 it is the board of ABT which determines the detailed manner and arrangements by which State promotional assistance is provided to firms.  There is currently a very significant private sector involvement in all of ABT's major programmes, and many activities are undertaken in partnership with both sectoral groups and individual firms.  I understand that the board keeps its programmes under regular review and industry's views are taken into consideration in the board's trade promotion plans.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the matchmaking component of the Conference on Trade and Investment which was organised by the US Department of Commerce in Pittsburg last October.  As I indicated in a previous reply on this subject, it is estimated that the 50 companies from Northern Ireland and the South who participated in the conference had some 400 matchmaking meetings with the 125 US companies who also attended.  I understand that some of the Irish companies present at the Pittsburgh conference were from the Deputy's constituency.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will realise, however, that details of the progress being made by individual companies on following-up on contacts made at the Pittsburgh conference are commercially sensitive. Furthermore, follow-up on conferences such as Pittsburgh and similar trade missions and events is very much a day-to-day operational matter for An Bord Tráchtála, ABT, and I have no function in this regard.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has any particular question regarding the details of the follow-up to the matchmaking event at Pittsburgh, I would be happy to ask the relevant officials in ABT to contact him.</P>

These efforts included the scheduling by my Department of a number of meetings of the council working group, a range of bilateral contacts with my ministerial colleagues and the development of compromise positions on certain aspects of the proposal.  However, given that the proposal required unanimity, it did not prove possible to overcome political difficulties on the part of certain member states and to adopt the proposal during the Irish Presidency.  Responsibility for the further advancement of the proposal now rests with the Dutch Presidency.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994 to 1999, sets out the principal objectives of Ireland's tourism policy and sets strategic targets for the development of the sector up to the end of the century.  The programme includes objectives, strategies and targets across such key areas as product development, marketing and training.  Progress in achieving key targets has been good to date and the industry is on track to reach foreign exchange earnings of £2.25 billion and total employment of 120,000 by 1999.  The operational programme is the subject of an upcoming mid-term evaluation following which certain refinements and adjustments may be made.</P>
      <P>Just before Christmas, my Department produced its strategic management statement, 1997-9, as part of the Delivering Better Government initiative.  This statement sets forth a comprehensive framework for the future role the Department will play in the development of the tourism sector over the period 1997-9.  The initiative is being extended at present to the tourism State agencies.</P>

I understand from the Minister for Finance that the negotiations on the future financing of the European Union, including the Structural Funds, will not commence until the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference when the European Commission will submit a communication on the future financial framework of the Union as from 31 December 1999.  This process and the continued improvement in performance and strengthening of the Irish tourism industry itself, will form critical starting off points in planning for the tourism sector for the first five years of the new millennium.</P>

      <P>As I stated last June in a reply to a question put down by Deputy Andrews, it is a matter for the Taoiseach of the day to decide on the allocation of functions among members of the Government within the constraints imposed by the Constitution.

The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it is not possible to have a stand-alone Department for each area of economic activity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>Estimates for visitor numbers and revenue for the whole of 1996 have not yet been published by the Central Statistics Office.  Estimates released to date by the CSO indicate that visitor numbers increased by over 11 per cent to 3.8 million in the period January to September 1996 and that revenue in the first half of 1996 increased by over 16 per cent over the same period in 1995 to £777 million.  According to CSO estimates, the number of visitors whose principal motivation in visiting Ireland was for holiday purposes increased by 25 per cent in the first six months of 1996.</P>
      <P>While, as I have said, CSO figures are not yet available for 1996 as a whole, Bord Fáilte has estimated the total number of visitors as being in the region of 4.6 million, an increase of 10 per cent on 1995.  Expenditure by overseas visitors, excluding receipts by Irish carriers, was estimated by Board Fáilte to be approximately £1.4 billion, an increase of 12 per cent.</P>
      <P>I understand that detailed information on European visitor numbers in 1996 is not yet available, but it has been estimated that European travel increased by some 5 per cent in the summer of 1996 compared with the same period in 1995. Bord Fáilte has also estimated that last year growth in US visitors to Ireland was 12 per cent compared to a European average of 6 per cent.</P>
      <P>This interim information suggests that Ireland continues to enjoy above average growth rates in visitor numbers and revenue and I am confident that 1997 will prove to be another very successful year for the Irish tourism industry.</P>

      <P>Ireland's ambitious tourism growth targets are based on the impact of active development policies in recent years, the proposed rollout of Tourism Brand Ireland, a range of promotional initiatives designed to attract more tourists and efforts to achieve a greater seasonal spread of travel plans.  These measures are backed by the commitment of such as the overseas tourism marketing initiative and the marketing efforts of an increasingly maturing industry, marking the most intensive phase in recent years of promoting Ireland as a tourism destination worldwide.</P>
      <P>Ireland is capitalising by positioning itself as a destination with a difference.  The combined efforts of all players together with more effective promotional programmes are reaching a greater number of consumers and influencing their decision to take a holiday in Ireland.</P>
      <P>This year a target of 7 per cent growth in overseas tourist numbers and 9 per cent in associated revenue is being set by Bord Fáilte.  This ambitious target compares with an expected growth of 1 per cent to 3 per cent forecast by national tourism organisations throughout Europe.  Ireland has consistently outperformed the average World and European performance in the past few years and I have no reason to believe that this trend will not continue.</P>

      <P>During Ireland's Presidency, progress was made on EU external trade policy in the context of the inaugural Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation, transatlantic relations and relations between Europe and Asia.</P>
      <P>One of our primary Presidency objectives was to ensure a strong EU contribution to the Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation held in Singapore in December and to achieve an outcome reflecting the union's priority of consolidating and developing the multilateral trade system.  This was achieved, with the EU playing a very active role in the process leading to the adoption of a ministerial declaration of the WTO.  The declaration addresses the central issues relevant to the further strengthening of the multilateral trade system and sets out a work programme for the organisation.  In addition, a ministerial declaration on trade in information technology products was adopted by a number of WTO Members including the European Union. This provides for the progressive elimination of customs duties on information technology products by the year 2000.  The conference also gave a renewed impetus towards a successful conclusion on the negotiations on basic telecommunications in February 1997.</P>
      <P>In relation to EU-US relations, significant progress was made on the new transatlantic agenda which was launched in Madrid in December 1995. Highlights include: the information technology agreement which, when finalised, promises to liberalise over $500 billion in trade annually; agreement in principle on a mutual recognition agreement on standards, with formal negotiations to be concluded by 31 January 1997; and initialling of a customs co-operation and mutual assistance agreement.</P>
      <P>An EU/Canada Summit was held on 17 December 1996.  One of the goals of the action plan and accompanying declaration signed on the occasion of the summit is the enhancement of bilateral trade flows between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Significant progress was also made on Asia-Europe relations in the context of follow-up activities to the first Asia-Europe summit meeting &mdash; ASEM &mdash; and preparation for the ASEM ministerial meeting in Singapore in February 1997.  From a trade perspective, the aim is to reinforce economic dialogue and co-operation between the two regions, with a particular emphasis on the facilitation and promotion of two-way trade and investment flows.</P>

The approach is aimed at ensuring the optimum outcome in the forthcoming negotiations for the renewal of the Structural Funds after 1999.  The Minister for Finance has overall responsibility in this area.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Minister for Finance that the negotiations on the future financing of the European Union, including the Structural Funds, will not commence until the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference when the European Commission will submit a communication on the future financial framework of the Union as from 31 December 1999.  This is likely to be in the second half of 1997.  Ireland's approach to these negotiations is under consideration and when the negotiations commence, the Government will ensure that Ireland's interests are vigorously and effectively pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy on tourism development takes full account of the value of the image of Ireland's clean, green environment and the consequent need to protect it.  The ambitious growth targets set for the tourism sector relate to growth in overseas revenue and job creation and emphasise the need to develop a sustainable industry concentrating on a quality product rather than quantity.  The strategy of increasing tourism revenue yield is an integral element of the &ldquo;Tourism Brand Ireland&rdquo; campaign launched late last year.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, acknowledges that a balance must be struck between tourism development and preservation of the environment.  Measures to achieve this objective as set out in the programme, include the following: improving the seasonality profile of Irish tourism.  The aim is that by 1999, 75 per cent of visitors will arrive in Ireland outside the peak July/August period compared with about 70 per cent at present; attracting high yield business.  Priority is given to marketing conference and incentive business and other quality niche and activity markets such as cruising, golf, equestrian, shoppers and users of paid services such as accommodation and car hire; where possible enhancing existing investment rather than creating new developments; a wide geographical dispersal to minimise capacity problems; capital projects recommended for assistance under the programme are required to comply with all environmental regulatory requirements as a condition for grant approval and support for overseas marketing under the programme is weighted towards projects that aim to extend the season; and progress on the consistency between tourism developments and the principle of sustainability will continue to be monitored as part of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statutory responsibility for environmental protection and the management of environmental problems generally rests with the Minister for the Environment while the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has certain statutory responsibilities in relation to the protection of heritage areas.  I understand that the heritage services &mdash; National Parks and Wildlife Service and National Monuments and Historic Properties Services &mdash; of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht operate an ongoing review of the impact of visitors on heritage sites in order that suitable <Col N="364" /> control and management procedures are exercised and applied as necessary.  Similarly, the National Monuments and Historic Properties Service aims to keep visiting levels at each heritage property to the optimum number of visitors consistent with site protection and presentation and to manage such properties accordingly.</P>
    <P>I fully acknowledge the need for the ongoing monitoring and management of the impact of tourism on the environment, particularly during the peak tourism season.  Such problems are already being addressed in the context of the strategies and monitoring arrangements that I have already outlined.  I am satisfied that the issue is afforded a high priority by the relevant agencies and there are no further plans by my Department at this time to introduce any additional measures in this regard.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the situation in Burma will be raised in the course of the EU/ASEAN ministerial meeting in Singapore in February 1997.</P>
      <P>The Government and the European Union remain gravely concerned at the continuing deterioration of the political and human rights situation in Burma.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that during the Irish Presidency of the European Union I had two meetings with the Burmese Foreign Minister, Mr. Ohn Gyaw; one as President of the Council in Jakarta on 22 July 1996, the other when I led the EU ministerial Troika in New York on 26 September. As I informed the House in the course of the Adjournment debate on 10 October 1996, these meetings gave me the opportunity to underline the serious concerns of the European Union in relation to the deterioration of political and human rights in Burma and the unwarranted restriction on fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, movement and association.  The meetings also enabled me to urge the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) to release unconditionally all political prisoners in Burma; to enter into meaningful dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and to bring about national reconciliation and democratic reform which would respect the aspirations of the Burmese people as expressed in the elections of May 1990.</P>

Notices to this effect are scheduled to appear in the national daily newspapers and in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on Friday 31 January 1997 and in local weekly newspapers circulating in the area for the week ending 31 January 1997.</P>
      <P>The public exhibition process will afford all interested parties an opportunity to submit their respective observations on the scheme proposals. These observations will be considered by the Commissioners of Public Works and where feasible the scheme amended accordingly before being submitted for confirmation to the Minister for Finance.

      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle the majority of social welfare payments, including unemployment benefit (UB), are therefore reckonable as income for tax purposes.  Treating such benefits as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.</P>
      <P>I draw to the Deputy's attention that the Government's programme of renewal stated that the method of taxing UB would be restructured in order to improve the position of those most adversely affected.  This commitment has been met in the first instance through the significant income tax reductions introduced in my three budgets.  In addition, a number of targeted UB measures were introduced in the 1995 Finance Act.  The first £10 per week of UB is now disregarded for income tax purposes and, to assist families, child dependant additions payable with UB are exempt from income tax with effect from 6 April 1995.</P>
      <P>These measures were introduced to help address the issue raised by the Deputy.</P>

It is not possible, at this stage, to state the total cost of the programme or the number of schemes that may be involved.  It will be a matter for each local authority to decide their own programme for the takeover of schemes in their area, having regard to the wishes of the groups, the standard of supply, etc.  As already indicated, the additional current costs incurred by local authorities in the implementation of this and associated measures <Col N="370" /> will be among the factors to be taken into account in determining distributions from the equalisation fund being established this year.</P>

      <P>To qualify for assistance under the voluntary housing capital assistance or rental subsidy schemes, a voluntary body must be approved under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992. An approved body must be: a limited company formed by guarantee of the members and without shareholders, and registered under the Companies Acts; a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, or a trust incorporated under the Charities Acts.</P>
      <P>Assistance under the schemes is provided by local authorities in accordance with the provisions of sections 6 and 7 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, the Housing (Accommodation Provided by Approved Bodies) Regulations, 1992 and terms and conditions laid down by my Department.  Assistance is conditional on, <i>inter alia</i>, the voluntary housing body letting the accommodation to eligible categories of persons in accordance with the schemes and appropriate consultation with the local authority in relation to lettings and rents.  The voluntary housing body must also enter into an agreement with the local authority creating a mortgage on the property in respect of which the loan is advanced which gives the local authority the right to exercise the usual powers of a mortgagee in the event of a breach of any of the conditions of the loan.</P>

      <P>Under the student support schemes, maintenance grants are payable at either adjacent or non-adjacent rates.  The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grant-holder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college which he or she is attending.  The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1995, students who were residing more than 15 miles from college and who could reasonably be expected to travel to college from home each day having regard to the journey and available public transport, were only entitled to the adjacent rate of maintenance grant.  I amended the schemes to provide that the non-adjacent rate would be payable in all circumstances where the student resides more than 15 miles from college.</P>
      <P>The existing arrangements are reasonable and I have no plans to review the qualifying criteria for adjacent/non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant.</P>

      <P>The figures available to my Department indicate that some 45,000 students attending third-level institutions during 1995-96 received grants under the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committee scholarship scheme and the ESF-aided maintenance grants scheme.  Based on these numbers and the weekly cost of an unlimited bus pass from Dublin Bus it is tentatively estimated that free travel passes could cost up to £15 million.</P>

      <P>Arising from the introduction of a revised syllabus for leaving certificate music, a major programme of in-service training for teachers of leaving certificate music is under way.  Four full-time trainers have been appointed with effect from September 1996.  The inservice programme, which is being co-ordinated by the Waterford Education Centre, is being delivered in a number of ways as follows: visits to schools by the trainers &mdash; approximately 200 schools nationally have been visited to date and further visits are planned in 1997; courses in several aspects of the new syllabus will be delivered in various centres throughout the country in 1997; organisation by the trainers of networking of music teachers in a town or geographic area.  Networks have been established in 30 areas throughout the country; and a telephone/fax service to answer teachers' and principals' queries.</P>
      <P>In addition to the leaving certificate in-service programme, my Department's in-career development unit has funded a range of other courses for music teachers in 1996-97.  These include two weekend courses in Limerick in 1996 and courses run by the Kodaly Society of Ireland, including the International Kodaly Music course during the first two weeks of July which was attended by both primary and post-primary teachers.  A further two Kodaly courses have been approved for 1997.</P>
      <P>The in-career development unit also approved approximately eighty primary in-service courses during 1996.  These ranged from applications received from individual schools, groups, summer courses and activity organised by education centres in Cork, Cavan, Carrick-on-Shannon, Galway and west Dublin.  Cumann Náisiúnta na gCór was supported in the provision of a programme of courses in Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Portlaoise and Cork.  A total of 28 approved music summer courses took place in various centres throughout the country.  Applications for the 1997 primary in-career summer programme have been invited from course providers.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the courses and other supports which I have put in place will meet the necessary in-career development needs of teachers of music.</P>

The committee included teachers, third level personnel and the inspectorate.  Changes in the practical tests were introduced immediately in 1995 followed by the remaining changes in the aural and written papers in 1996.  Sample questions were issued and the views of teachers were taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>Marking schemes and a report on the leaving certificate music examination 1995 have been issued to schools.  The marking schemes for 1996 will be available shortly.  This is part of the ongoing process of making information available for the benefit of schools, teachers and students.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the free travel scheme is to encourage elderly people to remain active in the community by giving them access to spare capacity on the various public transport systems.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception.  They are necessary on city and provincial bus routes because the transport services concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school in the morning and evening and they would be unable to cope with the additional volume of passengers arising if the restrictions did not apply.</P>
      <P>It should be noted however that time restrictions do not apply in the case of mentally handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses and certain other disabled or blind people.  Time restrictions apply generally from 7.00 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  Monday to Friday inclusive and on Bus Éireann long distance buses from 4.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. on Fridays for up to 20 miles out from Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  The removal of these restrictions would have significant cost implications for the transport companies involved who in turn would seek compensation from my Department.  Time restrictions do not apply to mainline rail services including Dart, or to Bus Éireann long distance cross Border travel.</P>
      <P>In relation specifically to Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann, I understand that neither company would be prepared to lift the current time restrictions, because of the major passenger capacity constraints operating in their case at those peak times of the day.</P>
      <P>It would not be feasible to introduce limited changes to the time restrictions in the manner suggested by the Deputy.  In the circumstances, I have no plans to alter the time restrictions which currently apply in the case of the free travel scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 93 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware Bord Fáilte Éireann is the executive agency responsible for promoting and developing tourist traffic in and to the State, through implementation of Government policy.  It is a statutory body and its powers and functions are set out in the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939 to 1995.  It is run by a board of directors appointed by the Minister for Tourism and Trade with the consent of the Minister for Finance and it reports to the Department of Tourism and Trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shannon Development promotes development in the mid west region, a role similar to that of <Col N="383" /> the regional tourism authorities.  It reports to the Department of Tourism and Trade on tourism issues and funds are provided through my Department's Vote to help defray its tourism administration and general expenses.</P>
    <P>The regional tourism authorities were initially established by Bord Fáilte in 1963 under section 5 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.  They are structured as private companies registered under the Companies Acts, limited by guarantee with memoranda and articles of association which contain, <i>inter alia,</i> stipulations relating to their management, administration and general business affairs. In accordance with their memoranda and articles, regional tourism authorities are accountable to, and obliged to operate in accordance with, the policies and directions of Bord Fáilte.  The last major review of the regional tourism authorities which was undertaken in 1993 concentrated on changes in their boards and representation.</P>
    <P>I have found all the tourism agencies to be responsive to and supportive of the tourism policies set by Government.  They work co-operatively towards the very demanding targets which have been set for the industry.  I have ensured an appropriate level of co-ordination and integration in that Shannon Development, the regional tourism authorities, Bord Fáilte and the industry are represented on the National Tourism Council which I chair myself and which advises me on policy matters.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Government policy for Irish tourism is being implemented in a co-ordinated and effective manner and that the structures in place are responsive to the requirements of our markets and customers, but, of course, all such structures must continue to evolve.  While I have no plans to alter existing structures, I can assure the Deputy that they are constantly under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in response to previous similar questions, the Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-1993, as agreed with the European Commission did not provide support for tourist accommodation projects.  Based on the ability of the commercial accommodation market to respond to growth in visitor numbers without grant assistance this policy was, in general, continued under the current operational programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current programme recognised however that there were a number of market segments where the quality of existing accommodation was <Col N="384" /> deficient and included a provision to assist on a selective basis, investment in certain areas.  These include accommodation-related conference and leisure facilities, a limited scheme of accommodation improvements to existing small and medium sized hotels with a current capacity of up to 100 bedrooms and graded up to and including three star; limited grant aid for certain specialist accommodation needs such as caravan and camping park facilities; upgrading and improvement of existing buildings for hostel or other specialist accommodation and associated facilities on branded walking routes; provision of new and improved accommodation at approved outdoor pursuit centres in remote areas currently without appropriate accommodation; improvement of existing accommodation at approved residential equestrian centres; horse-drawn caravan and motor-home investments; the additional cost of providing, in existing hotels, suitable access friendly accommodation for people with disabilities; and improved access for people with disabilities at hotels and major visitor centres.</P>
    <P>In general, in keeping with the overall strategy in the programme, support is aimed primarily at the enhancement of existing investment rather than supporting new development and all accommodation supported must be registered or approved, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>I should add that the funds provided under the programme for tourism development projects are generally over-subscribed and, unfortunately, those available for specialist accommodation related developments are fully committed.  These and other aspects of the programme's operations are being considered fully in the context of the current mid-term evaluation of the programme.  I am not in a position at this stage to anticipate the findings of this review.</P>
    <P>Other EU funded programmes such as the programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry and the Leader II programme administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the local urban and rural development programme provide support for smaller tourism initiatives.  In the Border counties assistance may also be available under the IFI and INTERREG programmes and the programme for peace and reconciliation, again on a limited basis.  This includes limited provision for accommodation projects, including, in some cases, guesthouses and bed and breakfast establishments, on a basis compatible with that in the operational programme for tourism.</P>
    <P>All registered and approved tourism accommodation has been deemed eligible for low interest loans under the access to finance scheme launched last September by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  A sum of £52 million of this £208 million fund has been specially earmarked for tourism projects throughout the country.  A similar scheme especially for the Border <Col N="385" /> counties, was recently introduced under the peace and reconciliation fund.  All the funds under these schemes have now been committed. Investment in registered or approved tourist accommodation in any of the resort areas designated under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas may also qualify for generous tax relief under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's domestic tourism marketing initiative continues to provide an added boost to the tourism business in the off-season. Over last year and this year £1 million has been allocated to this campaign.  In 1996 the domestic tourism market was worth about £600 million.  For the 1997 season the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, will shortly be announcing a multi-media promotional campaign co-funded by the industry to boost home holidays in the shoulder and low season.</P>
      <P>At the last Tourism Council meeting in Ballin-tubber Abbey, County Mayo on 11 October 1996 a progress report was presented to the council on a proposed national music festival, as a further response to the seasonality problem in tourism.  I officially launched the festival &mdash; entitled the Celtic Flame Festival &mdash; on 15 January.  This initiative which is also in receipt of sponsorship from the private sector constitutes an important new music festival which will benefit a number of regional locations.  It will help to address the seasonality problem by generating tourism into the country in the late February and early March period and will dovetail with the St. Patrick's Day festivities in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Celtic Flame Festival will feature high-profile artists capable of attracting visitors to the four main venues identified by the Tourism Council &mdash; Galway, Cork, Limerick and Dublin.  Visitors from Britain and Northern Ireland identify this country with the best in contemporary and traditional music and I am confident that the festival will be a strong motivator in attracting holidaymakers and those interested in short breaks.  It will also, of course, be of interest to Irish people and will help boost domestic tourism, especially to the regions.</P>

      <P>Last week in the Mansion House I announced the plans for the 1997 St. Patrick's festival in Dublin.  Many Deputies will have attended the St. Patrick's Day festivities in Dublin in 1996 and will have seen for themselves the improvements which have taken place.  My intention when I set up the festival company was to encourage the creation of a major international cultural and sporting festival by the year 2000 &mdash; a festival which would provide a focus for the promotion of Ireland internationally and concentrate tourism growth in the off-season.  The festival this year will build on the success achieved in 1996, spanning the weekend with music, dance, sport, art and theatre presented by professional community and amateur groups from all over Ireland and from overseas.  The Celtic Flame music festival launched recently at the initiative of the Tourism Council will also be part of the festivities.</P>
      <P>The St. Patrick's festival company which has been in receipt of pump-priming finance through Bord Fáilte and the EU co-funded tourism programme, is also lobbying the business sector whose sponsorship will be critical for the success of the festival in future years.  Last year ten foundation sponsors developed a fruitful business partnership with the company and the expansion and deepening of such arrangements will ultimately determine the future scope and scale of the festival.  I am satisfied with the progress of the festival company to date, particularly in making St. Patrick's Day more than just a parade but a fun festival with an international flavour, and in beginning the process of securing its long-term viability based on the fullest possible participation of Dublin's and Ireland's business and commercial community.</P>

      <P>Funding has been provided to FÁS for an average of 40,000 places on community employment schemes during 1997.  The present eligibility criteria for the programme came into effect in April 1996 following a detailed review of community employment and in respect to the recommendation of the task force on long-term unemployment and is designed to better target the programme at the most disadvantaged of long-term unemployed people such as those over 21 years and whose principle or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or lone parent's allowance.</P>
      <P>I keep all programmes under regular review in regard to their effectiveness in meeting their objective, which in the case of community employment is to provide quality temporary work experience and training opportunities that enhance the employment prospects of those priority groups at whom the programme is targeted. A commitment exists in Partnership 2000 that the range of labour market interaction measures, including community employment will be reviewed to ensure that priority is given to those most disadvantaged and that as resources permit there will be an increase of 10,000 places, with particular provision for those unemployed for more than five years.  It is the intention of the Government that this commitment will be carried out over the lifetime of the agreement.</P>

      <P>This measure is fully funded by the European Union without any national Exchequer contribution.  Ireland is the only member state operating the Scheme.  Following a recent review of the future of the scheme, the European Commission, in its report to the council, concluded that, while the scheme should be extended for a further two years at an unchanged aid level, the monthly entitlement should be halved to reflect the general decline in butter consumption in Ireland.  The Agriculture Council agreed in December to continue the scheme for a further two years on the basis of the Commission proposal.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the importance of the social assistance butter scheme to the less well-off in our society.  This was a major factor which, in the context of the recent review, led me to seek the scheme continued on a viable basis.  The reduction in the amount of butter available to beneficiaries reflects the decline in per capita butter consumption in Ireland, which, since 1980 has fallen from 2 lbs to under 1 lb per month.</P>

      <P>The negotiations referred to by the Deputy are taking place between officials of my Department and those of the UK Radio-communications Agency.  The need for these negotiations arise in the context of international agreements which make it obligatory for countries which lie within a certain geographic range of each other to agree, beforehand, the precise use of proposed frequencies for broadcasting. This process is known as the co-ordination of frequency usage.  The objective is to minimise the scope for interference to a transmitting station which might otherwise be caused by transmissions in another jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>This particular set of negotiations involves the co-ordination of frequencies in the Ultra High Frequency &mdash; UHF &mdash; band for the transmission of the national television programme services, including Teilifís na Gaeilge, from the RTE station near Moville, County Donegal as well as the co-ordination of frequencies for Channel 5, also on UHF, put forward by the UK side.  Co-ordination of these frequencies has proved difficult and time-consuming because of the overlapping coverage of Irish and UK networks in areas such as Inishowen.  In recent days officials of my Department have put various proposals to the UK side to overcome the problems which have been identified.  The UK side is now examining these proposals and hopefully the matter will be resolved in the near future.  This case is a good example of the problems involved in trying to accommodate the UK and Irish TV channels in the UHF band.</P>

The present eligibility requirements <Col N="392" /> for enlistment take account of the fact that service rendered on a part-time, voluntary basis in the Reserve Defence Force differs from fulltime service in the Permanent Defence Force. There is no plan at present to revise the height requirement for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force.  While there is no formal system of advantage for members of the FCÁ or the Slua Muirí who apply for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force it is considered that the type of person who gives voluntary service with the Reserve Defence Force is very often the type of person that the Permanent Defence Force wants to recruit.
