      <P>The Taoiseach assured the House yesterday that the hepatitis C tribunal legislation would be introduced soon.  From a report this morning, I understand there were differences at Cabinet yesterday about the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Bill has been sent for redrafting.  When will the legislation be introduced?  Will it be taken this session?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reports are not accurate to the extent to which they refer to differences at Cabinet.  This united Government wants to devise a fair system on a statutory basis to address this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, as usual, did as the Tánaiste told him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the subject of close attention from a health point of view and also from the perspective of the requirements of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When is the legislation likely to be introduced?  As the Taoiseach is aware, a member of the Government said the Government is taking too much legal advice on this issue.  Has it been sent for redrafting?  Will it be introduced this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of redrafting. The legislation is being drafted and various problems which emerge in the course of the examination of the drafting are being overcome. That is continuing and we are anxious to conclude <Col N="1159" /> it as speedily as possible.  I already indicated that the legislation is a priority as far as the Government is concerned.  However, it is important it is legally well founded and can stand up to scrutiny or challenge, if that arises.  Nobody should deprecate the value of legal advice in a matter which ultimately deals with legal rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not attempt to debate the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to debate it now. I seek an answer to my question.  The Bill is not on the Government's priority list issued last week.  Will the legislation be introduced this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dermot Ahern raised that matter last week and I explained to him then that the fact the legislation was not included on the list was of no significance.  It is a priority as far as the Government is concerned.  It is proceeding at due speed and the Government will have the co-operation of all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach continually tells the House that the Dáil and the legislative programme might continue until the autumn.  Is he aware that one of his Ministers of State announced on national radio this morning that the general election will take place in five weeks time?  Is this correct or is it another case of the tail wagging the dog?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we have so many good radio stations available to us &mdash; Deputy Ahern knows what my favourite station is &mdash; it is not possible for me to listen to all of the output on the airwaves, although I do my best to listen in to all of them from time to time.  I did not hear this speculation on the part of a junior member of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very early this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I can assure all those on the other side of the House who are in a somewhat frenetic condition that no decision has been taken as to the timing of an election, whether it be five weeks or five months.  It is probable we will have one within the next five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is still no sign of the heads of the legislation which has been promised to place the compensation tribunal on a statutory basis.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the State is behaving like a defendant which is a source of great concern and grief for the unfortunate women concerned who have been through so much?  Will he give an undertaking that he will consult with them and not treat them in the cold <Col N="1160" /> way in which they have been treated in the past by this Administration?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Soundbites stuff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody who has studied it will agree that this has been an extremely tragic and difficult issue.  There have been genuinely difficult questions such as the balancing of rights which have had to be looked at but the overriding concern of the Government in everything it has done has been to ensure the maximum degree of care and compensation is available to the women concerned so that they can, to the best of their ability within the limits imposed by the tragic events visited upon them, reconstruct their lives and move on.  Nobody can claim in this sad history that they have done everything right at all times.  Nobody is claiming this on behalf of the Government.  We are seeking to find a fair and soundly-based statutory solution to the problem. That continues to be a high priority of the Minister and the Government.  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister will be meeting representatives of the women concerned this week.  These points will be conveyed to them on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach state precisely when the MMDS-deflector system legislation promised yesterday by the Minister will be brought before the House?  Will it be introduced within the next week or two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation will come into effect, in terms of applicability, when the regulator is appointed.  As the House is aware, it is the regulator who will make decisions under the legislation.  I am glad to tell the Deputy we are moving forward rapidly in regard to the appointment of the regulator.  I understand interview processes will commence in the near future.  The matter is being dealt with speedily.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is anxious to remove the uncertainty and the difficulty created for so many people by the arrangements we inherited from the Deputy's party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister promised legislation would be brought forward to deal with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying it will be brought forward rapidly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, one can provide for a change or detail in the law in either principal or delegated legislation.  The matter may <Col N="1161" /> be dealt with in either delegated legislation, i.e. regulations or in principal legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It may well be that the speediest way of dealing with it is by delegated legislation, i.e. regulations, which the Minister will prepare with all due speed.  There will be no delay in the matter.  As the policy decisions were only taken yesterday, it is a little unreasonable of the Deputy to expect a precise timetable in regard to the implementation of every single aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing will happen until after the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes to be patient, it does not matter when the election takes place, the result will be the same.  The commitments the Government is giving will be implemented whenever it takes place.</P>

      <P>On the issuing of licences to television groups, will the Taoiseach accept that two and a half years ago during the by-election he told the people of Carrigaline a political lie?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>In relation to section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995 unless the position is regularised before the general election, we will have to wait a further six months.  I therefore ask the Taoiseach to regard the matter as urgent.  As he is aware, one will not be permitted to take a case against the State in the courts, such as an extradition case, unless its proper title &mdash; Ireland &mdash; is included in all documentation.  The notification to the registrar of intention to marry contains the words &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  This means that every marriage notified in this way is invalid and will require to be reregistered some time in the future.  Will the Taoiseach say if this legislation will be introduced shortly?  Otherwise it may take six months before&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy Ahern's interest in the greyhound Bill.  There are genuine legal difficulties in regard to the constitutionality of some of the proposals in the Bill. Given that legal advice has to be taken on some issues, it is not possible to proceed with this Bill as quickly as was intended.  There is no disagreement with the industry on policy issues but it is important that the legislation conforms fully with the constitutional requirements.  I have repeatedly answered questions on the greyhound Bill and indicated my commitment to it.  Contrary to the Deputy's implication, I have honestly indicated to the House the difficulties which have arisen.

      <P>The Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill, which we bring to Report Stage, is a much changed Bill compared to that debated on Second Stage.  This is as a result of a long, difficult, detailed but ultimately rewarding Committee Stage debate.  I take this opportunity to thank the chairman of the Committee on Finance and General Affairs, Deputy Jim Mitchell, and members of the committee from all sides of the House for their outstanding contributions on the Bill.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, in introducing the Bill on Second Stage, indicated our openness to constructive debate on the provisions of the Bill and our willingness to accept improvements by way of amendments from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Legislation is properly the principal concern of the Houses of the Oireachtas, in particular a Bill like this which will have a profound impact on the way Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann investigate matters of national importance. I am happy I have been able to deliver on many of the key concerns of Deputies as expressed, sometimes trenchantly, on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister of State moves the amendment, I acknowledge the assistance given by her and her officials on Committee Stage in relation to this extremely complicated Bill.  Those of us on this side of the House did not see this as a political issue between Government and Opposition.  We saw this as an issue which will have ramifications for this House into the future.  It is a Bill which has been in gestation for nearly 20 years and with which previous governments have struggled.  I thank the Minister for at least putting it forward.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to sound a sour note, but one of the Government Deputies, not a Deputy from the Minister's own party, Deputy Broughan, accused me and the Opposition on a radio station of filibustering on Committee Stage of this Bill.  I ask the Minister to acknowledge that there was no filibustering by the Opposition.  This is important because it was said on the public airwaves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Ahern says. We had a long and protracted debate which was difficult and at times trenchant, but it was above all constructive.  I accept that the issues are not political.  One does not know on which side of the House one might find oneself in years to come, and it is extremely important that the procedures we put in place, to enable the Houses of the Oireachtas to investigate matters of national importance, are operable and that natural justice is done and seen to be done to all concerned.  I accept the good faith of Deputy Ahern and his party in the interest shown in the debate on this Bill.  The contributions of my colleagues, particularly the chairman of the committee, and the sub-committee set up to deal with Committee Stage on this were extremely constructive and helped to progress debate.  I hope their contributions allowed us to reach the position where we have a much better Bill that will be able to do what we originally set out to do.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the appropriate subcommittee&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a) in relation to a committee appointed by either House of the Oireachtas or a sub-committee of such a committee, means a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of that House,</P>
      <P>(b) in relation to a committee appointed jointly by both Houses of the Oireachtas or a subcommittee of such a committee, means a subcommittee appointed jointly by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of each such House,</P>
      <P>that is authorised by the Committee or Committees aforesaid by which it is appointed to perform the functions conferred on it by this Act;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> This amendment provides for a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to decide if the powers conferred by this Bill should be invoked by an investigating committee.  During a thorough and wide-ranging debate on Committee Stage on amendment No. 7 in the name of Deputy Dermot Ahern on whether a subcommittee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should decide if powers conferred by this Bill should be invoked by an investigating committee, I was persuaded that we should examine this proposal, and I thank Deputy Ahern for his contribution.  Accordingly, I accepted the principle of Deputy Ahern's amendment at the time and, following detailed consideration by my officials and the preparation of the text by the parliamentary draftsman, I believe the Bill would be improved by the introduction of the kind of mechanism suggested by Deputy Ahern.  This was subsequently agreed by the Government and is incorporated in amendment No. 1.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 17, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; where it secondly occurs, to insert &ldquo;and any sub-committee validly set up by the committee under the terms of reference of that particular committee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment to allow all committees of the House, including subcommittees, to benefit from this Bill.  Members on this side of the House felt that if there was no reference to subcommittees they would not have the benefit of the privileges and immunities conferred by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection defined a committee for the purposes of the Bill as all Oireachtas committees apart from the Select Committee on Members' Interests.  That committee is excluded because of the powers conferred on it by the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, which allow the committee to investigate allegations of wrongdoing against Oireachtas Members.  This definition of committee will apply throughout the Bill except where otherwise specified.  The powers of compellability provided for in the Bill are to apply only to those committees which have the power to call persons and papers specified in their terms of reference.  As the sub-committee does not have this power in its terms of reference it cannot, therefore, use the compellability provisions of the Bill.  As amendments to an Oireachtas committee's terms of reference are <Col N="1174" /> the responsibility of the relevant House of the Oireachtas, it is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide when these amendments should be made. Moreover, I undertook on Committee Stage to introduce a Government amendment to give effect to the proposal made by Deputy Ahern to provide that the definition of a committee would include sub-committees.  The text of amendment No. 3 fulfils that commitment.  Accordingly, I am not in a position to accept amendment No. 2.  I will, when called on, move amendment No. 3 which deals with the substance of the matter.</P>

      <P>Yes, because it is dealt with elsewhere. I will reiterate the point I made, because it is quite convoluted.  This subsection defined a committee for the purposes of the Bill as all Oireachtas committees apart from the Select Committee on Members' Interests.  That committee is excluded because of the particular powers conferred on it by the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.  Those powers allow that committee to investigate allegations of wrongdoing against Oireachtas Members.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;document&rsquo; includes any class or description of document and also includes thing;&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The definition of a document was included in the Bill to ensure that there is no ambiguity about what this reference is intended to convey. However, discussion on Committee Stage raised the possibility that the definition of a document as a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; might not embrace documents.  To cover this point the Government amendment broadens the definition of &ldquo;thing&rdquo; to make it explicit that the definition includes all documents forming part of an investigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>In page 4, line 1, to delete &ldquo;Sections 3 to 14 and 17&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;This Act shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This was the subject of much discussion on Committee Stage.  I will not repeat everything that was said then.  However, we on this side of the House could not see why the Minister was proposing that the provisions of the Bill would relate only to certain matters.  We were of the view that the whole Act should apply to all committees, not just sections of the Act.  There are provisions in the Bill which would be relevant to all committees of the House.  I cannot see why the Minister has limited it to certain sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a comprehensive debate on Committee Stage on this point.  Deputy Ahern could probably pre-empt the response I will give him.  Most of the Bill applies only to those committees which are empowered to send for persons and papers, a category which currently excludes, <i>inter alia</i>, the select committees, other than the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Section 16 forbids a civil servant, garda or member of the Defence Forces from commenting on the merits of Government policy.  This exception applies to all committees.  The effect of the Opposition amendment moved by Deputy Ahern would be to confine the prohibition on public servants commenting on the merits of Government policy to committees empowered to send for persons and papers.  Thus it would remove the prohibition in regard to select committees and would permit public servants to make such comments before those committees.  To allow public servants to comment on the merits of Government policy would undermine the traditional neutrality of the public service in providing objective advice to Ministers.  For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that under the Bill the terms of reference of a committee may be amended by resolution of the House to allow the committee to send for papers and, therefore, it would be possible for most committees of the House to have that power?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that the amendment would muzzle civil servants coming before committees?  Section 16 &mdash; I am not sure which amendment relates to that section &mdash; restricts civil servants, members of the PDF and the Garda Síochána appearing before committees as far as expressing opinions on policy is concerned. We had a long discussion on that matter on Committee Stage and the view was expressed that civil servants and members of the Garda Síochána and the Permanent Defence Forces, perhaps in an effort to defend themselves against issues that arise from time to time, may be required from a historical point of view to give evidence before a committee and express an opinion on a particular policy at that time.  There are examples of difficulties in that regard.</P>
      <P>We are endeavouring to strike a balance here. A disgruntled civil servant may have a gripe against a Minister or a Department, perhaps because he believed he did not get his proper rights when he retired, but that person should have the right to defend himself.  I accept a difficulty would arise in that a person, who may be involved in an investigation, may wish to get his own back on the Department by expressing a certain opinion, but we want to ensure that the person is given an opportunity to defend himself while at the same time ensuring there is no vindictiveness.</P>

I understand Deputy Ahern's point, we must be absolutely sure we provide for natural justice in all cases.  Civil servants, gardaí and members of the Defence Forces would have to make their case through the relevant Minister. The balance of advantage in terms of the common good lies in ensuring that the traditional neutrality of the public service in providing objective advice to Ministers remains as it has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendment would be to confine the prohibition on public servants commenting on the merits of Government policy to committees empowered to send for persons and papers.  The amendment would remove the prohibition in relation to select committees and would permit public servants to make such comments before those committees.  While I understand the point the Deputy is making, I am not sure the amendment, even if I was in a position to accept it, would provide for that case.  I requested Government to consider this matter and there is no way in which we can accede to the amendment. <Col N="1177" /> The common good is best maintained by ensuring the traditional neutrality of the public service, and we must come down on that side.</P>

      <P>This amendment, which is a reintroduction of amendment No. 4 tabled on Committee Stage, would give compellability powers to all select committees.  In the interest of natural justice, witnesses should be compellable only to those committees with the power in their terms of reference to call persons and papers before them.  As the Oireachtas can determine which committees have those powers, by determining the terms of reference of committees, it is neither necessary nor desirable to provide in legislation who should have those powers.  It is up to the Houses of the Oireachtas to decide the terms of reference of committees.  Section 16, which provides that civil servants, members of the Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána shall not express an opinion on policy matters, is an exception to this rule.  This exception is to apply to all committees and not merely to those with the powers to compel persons and documents to be brought before them.

It is a question of the division between the Executive and the Government.  As the Minister of State is aware, the Government can force through or reject a resolution to include a committee if it so wishes.  It is important that all committees have the powers proposed in the Bill.  Otherwise, we will have to painstakingly go through all the committees to give them those powers or wait for an issue to arise to do so.  If a political issue arises, the Government could refuse to pass a resolution to give the relevant committee the powers provided under this legislation.  This is particularly relevant having regard to the plethora of committees that have been set up.  The Government is being over-restrictive in not extending the provisions of the Bill to all committees.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3&mdash;In all its deliberations under this Act, it shall be the duty of a Committee to take all necessary steps in order to protect and vindicate the good name of any person appearing as a witness or otherwise before the Committee.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was deliberated on when legislation was introduced to deal with the difficulties experienced by the Government in November 1994.  The Opposition, of which the Minister of State was a member, believed this type of amendment should have been included in that legislation. The amendment proposes to give the committee a duty to take the necessary steps to <Col N="1180" /> protect and vindicate the good name of any person appearing as a witness or otherwise before the committee.  We were trying to include the principles of the Jock Haughey case whereby any tribunal has a requirement to allow a person to vindicate his or her good name.  The four principles of that legislation apply to anyone appearing before a court or tribunal and they should be specifically mentioned in this legislation.  I commend the amendment to the Minister of State. On Committee Stage she stated an unwritten rule already exists in this regard, but these principles should be included in the legislation.  While she may claim people appearing before committees could take advantage of this section, I do not believe that would be the case.  It is important that people appearing before committees have such a reassurance in writing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is similar to amendment No. 5 which was tabled on Committee Stage and withdrawn so that I could examine the matter in more detail.  This amendment would put the onus on an investigating committee to protect the good name of a witness appearing before it.  I do not accept the need for such an amendment as section 10 already provides a redress procedure for a citizen who feels his or her good name has been compromised. Such an individual is given rights of audience and an opportunity to rebut an allegation he or she finds offensive.  Moreover, I am advised the amendment is unnecessary given the constitutional protection afforded by article 40.3.2º of the Constitution which provides:</P>
      <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws, protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the protection of the good name of any citizen is already guaranteed.  As the amendment proposes to put in legislation what is in effect already provided for in section 10 and as it refers to rights which are already protected by the Constitution, I deem it to be unnecessary. Accordingly, I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of this amendment would improve the section.  This issue was discussed extensively on Committee Stage.  For her own reasons the Minister rejected the amendment, but I recommend this amendment to the House.  It proposes <Col N="1181" /> that the powers of the committee will be brought into play in the event of a person refusing to give evidence and it has implications for later sections. I strongly recommend that the Minister accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the reintroduction of a Fianna Fáil amendment No. 6 on Committee Stage.  It proposes the introduction of a new procedure where witnesses would initially be invited to attend before a committee and would only be compelled to attend if the initial invitation was refused.  My legal advice is that if informal questioning, which would not involve a direction under paragraph (a), failed to elicit the required information from a witness, the formal procedure outlined in the Bill would then be invoked.  As this formal procedure would involve a direction under paragraph (a), fairness to witnesses dictates that this direction is used in all cases, irrespective of whether informal questioning has already taken place.  The introduction of preliminary voluntary attendance is unnecessary as all attendance can be covered under formal directions. Therefore, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 11 provides for the consent of the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to be obtained by investigating committees before the powers of directions set out in the subsection are invoked. It is a natural consequence of amendment No. 1 which provides for the establishment of the sub-committee. The principle of the matter has been discussed and I will not repeat those arguments. This is a technical corollary of changes to the Bill effected by amendment No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 30 deals with the question of a consent given by the compellability sub-committee provided through amendment No. 1 to an investigating committee to invoke the powers of <Col N="1182" /> the Bill.  Such a consent shall be given in writing by the chairman or acting chairman and shall specify the directions of the investigating committee to which the consent shall apply and list any conditions linked to those directions.  A document produced by the chairman or acting chairperson at a committee meeting or in court shall be evidence of the consent given and any limitations applying to it.  This is to clarify the conditions under which committees can conduct investigations.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 is the reintroduction of Fianna Fáil Committee Stage amendments Nos. 7 and 9 which were withdrawn.  Deputies will recall that on Committee Stage I signalled my intention to consider the introduction of a Report Stage amendment providing for an overseeing committee. Report Stage amendment No. 1 provides for the overseeing sub-committee as promised.  As I understand it, amendment No. 12 provides a compellability of witness would be decided by a new sub-committee on compellability and amendment No. 15 provides for the establishment of that new sub-committee.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(d) direct in writing any person to make discovery on oath of any documents that are or have been in that person's possession or power relating to any matter relevant to the proceedings of the committee and to specify in the affidavit of documents concerned any documents mentioned therein which he or she objects to produce to the committee and the grounds for the objection, and the rules of court relating to the discovery of documents in proceedings in the High Court shall apply in relation to the discovery of documents pursuant to this paragraph with any necessary modifications,&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment provides for a procedure to allow for the discovery of documents.  Amendment No. 14 also makes that provision.  Both <Col N="1183" /> amendments relate to discovery of documents procedure, which means that if so instructed by a court a person is obliged to swear under oath that he or she will provide all documents at his or her disposal relevant to the proceedings in question. The wording in the Bill in relation to compellability of documents is that a person will obey a direction from a committee in relation to documents in his or her possession and that there is no obligation on a person to produce relevant documents which are not specified by the committee.</P>
    <P>Deputies Ahern and McDowell made significant contributions to the debate on Committee Stage following which I agreed to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage which would provide for the discovery of documents procedure to be applied through this Bill.

Amendment No. 28 provides that a witness who fails to comply with the committee's direction in relation to the discovery of documents will be guilty of an offence.  Amendment No. 27 is technical to allow for the inclusion of the additional provision set out in amendment No. 28.  Since section 3(7)(c) is no longer the penultimate part of the subsection, there is no longer any need for the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; at its end.</P>

      <P>I welcome the inclusion of discovery powers in the panoply of powers that will be given to committees.  Although Deputy Ahern and I spoke strongly in favour of including this power, he and I would counsel our successors in this House and its committees that it is not a power to be used in the way snuff is flung around at a wake.  It is an onerous power and should not become customary.  I imagine guidelines for committees would stress it was to be used as a last resort in substitution for voluntary informal discovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One fundamental point has struck me since Committee Stage and it can be applied to all the amendments equally.  Is the Seanad to be equally competent in establishing committees to investigate the same matters as this House?  Under the Bill, the answer is yes.  Is this desirable?  It was assumed these powers should be given to Dáil committees and, therefore, to Seanad and joint <Col N="1184" /> Oireachtas committees.  A question mark is left over whether it is a good idea to give the Seanad the power to investigate anything the Dáil does on its own volition with its own powers.  It could summon the same witnesses before it as the Dáil, ask the same or different questions and come to the same or different conclusions.  This has been assumed during the debate but has not been addressed thoroughly.  What happens if the Seanad decides to investigate one matter rather than another?  Should there be an acceptance that the Dáil takes precedence in relation to investigatory matters?  I am not saying this to belittle the Seanad.  Should there be an acceptance that if there is a conflict between two committees the requirements of the Dáil come first?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of the Seanad is that it is not a House of public representatives, although under the Constitution it is a separate House of the Oireachtas and is given legislative competence.  The public representative role accorded by the Constitution to the Dáil and the answerability of the Government and the Executive to the Dáil as opposed to the Seanad should confer a much different status and function on committees established by the Dáil rather than those established by the Seanad.  I am most unhappy that the Seanad, whose role is not representative and not to hold the Executive accountable to public representatives, is being given the same powers and functions and certain overlapping powers and competence in respect of virtually any matter it chooses to arrogate to itself.</P>
      <P>The Bill will go to the Seanad and my point will not be flavour of the month.  Perhaps it should have been made here on Second Stage. We did not debate it, although it may have been discussed privately.  One can take the example of the Fr. Brendan Smyth affair.  I have a grave difficulty with the notion that the Seanad could decide to investigate a case such as that.  For instance, Senator Norris or any other Senator could establish a committee and come up with a report on X or Y so that the Seanad could satisfy itself that a Dáil committee was wrong.  It could summon the same witnesses, seek discovery of the same documents, demand production of the same material and come to a separate conclusion. That is most undesirable but there is no notion of co-ordination between the competence of both Houses in the Bill.  If one House directs discovery and the other House does not, there will be clashes and overlaps of jurisdiction which have not been thought out properly in this legislation.</P>

That would be totally unacceptable.  I will give a more considered reply later but I agree strongly with the thrust of the Deputy's contribution.  It is not the intention of the Bill to allow that scenario to develop.  Ultimately, it is up to the Houses of the Oireachtas to decide which committees can have the power of compellability, and at that point, they will be in control of who does what.</P>

    <P>The Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the President of the Circuit Court are already excluded from the provisions of the Bill. This amendment will also exclude An Ceann Comhairle, An Leas-Cheann Comhairle, An <Col N="1186" /> Cathaoirleach and An Leas Cathaoirleach.  They are people of a particular stature within the Houses of the Oireachtas and it would be inimical to the procedure of the Houses if a committee were entitled to direct them to come before it.  It would be far better to deal with this within the rules of the Houses.  A major talking point on Committee Stage was that much of the Bill goes further than the ability of the House to make its own rules under the Constitution.  That is why I propose these further exclusions.</P>

While it is unlikely that the chairpersons and deputy chairpersons of the Houses would be subject to investigation in that capacity, all other Dáil and Seanad representatives are to be compellable.

      <P>This issue also caused much discussion on Committee Stage.  The Government endeavoured to restrict the remit of the Bill as it applied to the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, to make them different from other personages.  The Minister allowed some leeway as to the DPP but not as regards the Attorney General. The tenet of these amendments is that the Attorney General should be referable to this legislation.  I know the Minister has a difficulty on this point but, on the broad principle of the Attorney General being directed to come before committees, there have been instances when he should have been amenable to committees of this House.  The Government, for some unknown reason, wishes to cloud that in restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the issue of who gave legal advice on this Bill.  I do not impugn the Attorney General in any way but it is up to us rather than to officials to decide who we want to come before committees and under what terms they do so.  The Government is listening to the view of officials in the office of the Attorney General as to how they should be treated but I do not accept that.  We should insist that committees of the House should have the same opportunity to bring the Attorney General and his officers before them as to bring others.  They should talk not only of issues of general <Col N="1187" /> administration but of specific matters which might arise from time to time.  The Bill provides that the Attorney General should come before the Committee of Public Accounts and no other committee.  That is not acceptable because all that takes place there is investigation of Estimates.</P>
    <P>I may return on this point.  These amendments were only received this morning and the Minister may have an alternative amendment which may deal with problems we have had on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Confinement of the compellability of the Attorney General to the general administration of his office is necessary to protect the client confidentiality of the Attorney General in specific cases.  Compellability is being confined to the Committee of Public Accounts only.  That is the committee to which accounting officers &mdash; that is, Secretaries of Departments and Heads of Offices &mdash; are accountable in their capacities as administrative heads of their areas of responsibility. The Government has decided this is the most appropriate form of accountability for the Attorney General and the most that can realistically be expected of him.  This is because his work in his capacity as legal adviser to the Government must remain confidential.  As officers of the Attorney General would answer questions on his or her behalf, it is logical that their accountability is the same as that of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General is an independent constitutional officer whose authority derives from the Constitution.  As Members of this Dáil have been reminded often enough, his accountability is to the Taoiseach by whom he is appointed rather than to Dáil Éireann.  It is possible to distinguish between those actions which an Attorney General takes as guardian of the public interest and those he takes as adviser to the Government.  The possibility of embodying that distinction in the Bill in a manner which widened the area of compellability applying to the Attorney General was explored.  In that context we were conscious of the interest expressed in the House about the initiatives taken as guardian of the public interest by a previous Attorney General on the X case and Cabinet confidentiality.  However, we were strongly advised that such initiatives were intrinsically connected with the independent status of the Attorney General's office and that the application of a compellability provision to them would impinge on that independence.  In the circumstances, it is not open to me to agree to any change in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 would make the Attorney General and his officers compellable to any committee. For the reasons already given I cannot accept this.  As this amendment would also make officers of the Attorney General accountable for a full range of business carried out at that office it cannot be accepted.  It could lead to such officers being questioned about specific legal cases.  It would also lead to a greater degree of <Col N="1188" /> compellability for the officers of the Attorney General than for the Attorney General and that would not be acceptable.</P>
    <P>Neither can I accept amendment No. 19 which would remove the provisions which currently confine the compellability of the Attorney General and his officers to the general administration of his office.  As this would allow him or her to be questioned on specific cases or his or her capacity as legal adviser to the Government, it cannot be accepted.  With regard to the officers of the Attorney General, as I already said I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important amendment because, as was said on Committee Stage, this is a key issue in the legislation.  It goes to the core of the division of powers under our Constitution &mdash; the Minister is nodding but unfortunately she is not accepting our proposal.  It was suggested that the Office of the Attorney General should be split into two offices, one for matters connected with his role as legal adviser to the Government and one for his role as protector of the public interest in the courts.  That is a valid distinction which should be made.  It is difficult for any Attorney General to look dispassionately at issues as he has been appointed by and is legal adviser to a Government.  At the same time he has a duty to the public interest.  A former Attorney General was verbally abused politically and publicly for actions he took in the interests of the public.  The passage of time has shown that he acted totally independently but at the time it was suggested that he had acted in a covert, political way.</P>
      <P>Regarding whether the Attorney General and his officers should come before committees, we have had many recent occasions on which the Attorney General refused to attend committees.  I was a member of a committee when the Attorney General would only allow a file to be tendered when certain portions of it were excluded from the committee's deliberations.  We reached farce when, at one stage, it was suggested that the committee's legal adviser see those sections of the file that the Attorney General wanted to exclude so that he could be satisfied as to whether the committee members should see them.  It was a crucial issue as we were trying to determine the connection between the Attorney General and his British counterpart regarding the extradition application concerning Fr. Brendan Smyth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those reasons, it is quite justifiable for us to ask that the Attorney General to come before committees.  I do not accept the Minister of State's point that an amendment might have the result of bringing the Attorney General and his officers to all the committees of the House.  It is not beyond the intelligence of the Attorney General and his officers to come up with an amendment which would take care of that and would allow him to come before a committee to deal with issues on a broad basis, not on a specific case by case basis.  The Minister of State accepted our <Col N="1189" /> bona fides that the Attorney General would not be asked or be allowed to be asked about specific cases.  That is not our aim.  We want to allow Members to hold people accountable, as is our constitutional duty.  To do so, we need to bring people like the Attorney General before the House.  The Government is restricting that issue with this section.</P>
    <P>We have had a litany of instances of the Attorney General's office being discussed in the House.  Different Taoisigh have had difficulties with the Attorney General's office and the House has not been able to investigate the matter properly because the Attorney General takes a &ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; approach.  Rather than listening to the advice of the Attorney General, the Government should look at this matter in a broader context. This is a Bill for the Houses of the Oireachtas, not the Government.  There is an important distinction in the separation of powers relating to whether the executive is to be held accountable by the Legislature under the Constitution. That is why, by restricting the Attorney General's power to come before the Committee of Public Accounts to talk about accounts and the general administration of his office, similar to the Minister of State's recently released strategic plan, which is an aspirational document it does not deal with key issues of interest to Members that might arise but that we have been unable to investigate properly.  For a Government that has espoused openness and transparency, this section is wrong and does a disservice to it.</P>
    <P>There should be a collegiate approach to this, taking all points of view into account.  We should determine who comes before committees, not the Attorney General.  If the Government had any wit, it would have come up with an amendment to take care of some of the problems with the Attorney General attending committees.</P>

      <P>The Deputy suggested splitting the functions of the Attorney General's office, and <Col N="1190" /> perhaps there should be time for that debate. However, it is not appropriate to Report Stage of this Bill and it is not for me to decide now that some of that division of labour should be compellable in relation to the powers this Bill confers.</P>
      <P>The Deputy knows the Attorney General has three roles.  He is the legal adviser to the Government; he is the defender of the public interest; and his third role relates to the administration of his office.  He will only be compellable to the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to his third role.  I cannot concede otherwise to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Lest anyone think it intransigence or stubbornness on my or the Government's part, the Attorney General is one of a number of constitutional officers of the State whose positions are created by the Constitution and not by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Under the Constitution, the Attorney General is not responsible to the Oireachtas for anything.  He is responsible to the Taoiseach in the sense that the Taoiseach appoints him and may dismiss him at will.  The Attorney General cannot therefore be made subject to the Oireachtas or its committees for the way in which he discharges any of his legal functions, nor can he be placed in a position where he might be called upon to give information to the Oireachtas about the discharge of his legal functions in individual cases.  To attempt to do so would be to compromise his independence, which has been recognised by the courts, and would contravene the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 2, to delete &ldquo;or an officer of the Director of Public Prosecutions&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The principle is the same as in the previous amendment.  The Government is endeavouring to restrict the Director of Public Prosecutions and the officers of the Director of Public Prosecutions coming before the committees of the House.  This was the subject of substantial discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was published the Government endeavoured to exclude the Director of Public Prosecutions completely from the remit of the Bill, something to which we objected.  Between publication and the subsequent taking of the Bill, when there was a considerable time lapse, the Director of Public Prosecutions answered questions on the Marian Finucane radio programme. Obviously the Government was obliged to accept <Col N="1193" /> some amendments in regard to having the Director of Public Prosecutions come before committees of the House.  For that reason we pushed the matter strongly.  How could a Director of Public Prosecutions go on the airwaves and answer questions from the public when he was not allowed to come before committees of this House, under this Bill by the Government, which came into office on the pretext of openness, transparency and accountability, and voted down the amendment in regard to restricting the Attorney General to coming before the Committee of Public Accounts and only then in relation to the general administration of his office?  The Director of Public Prosecutions is entitled to come before a committee of the House, the Committee of Public Accounts, but only in relation to general administration and statistics relevant to his office and is not allowed go before any of the other committees of the House.</P>
    <P>For instance, the Select Committee on Legislation and Security might want to know why a particular direction was given to the Garda in relation to prosecution or non-prosecution of offences.  From time to time the Director of Public Prosecutions issues directions.  Recently he issued a direction in regard to the non-prosecution of offences, the non-holding of people in custody pending charges.  Perhaps the Dáil or a committee would like to know the rationale behind that decision.  We are not asking that the Director of Public Prosecutions be asked about specific cases.  Recently I raised an issue with the Taoiseach concerning families one of whose children had been abused.  I had some child sexual abuse cases where no prosecution was taken. There was no proper communication between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the family. The communication was through the Garda Síochána and it was somewhat impersonal.  I asked the Taoiseach if there was some avenue through which there could be a better interlinking with the family to try to explain why a prosecution was not taking place.</P>
    <P>The DPP, whose actions impinge on the lives of citizens, should be made amenable to the Houses of the Oireachtas, although not with regard to specific cases.  However, the Bill shall not apply to the DPP or officers of the DPP, except in respect of the Committee of Public Accounts, which is only concerned with public accounts and then only in respect of evidence, documents or statistics in the possession of the DPP regarding the general administration of his office.  Better statistics have only recently been made available.  The Government was reluctantly compelled to include this in the Bill mainly because the DPP appeared on the &ldquo;Marian Finucane Show&rdquo;.  However, only minimalist amendments were allowed, which do not enable the House to do its duty under the Constitution and make officers of the State more amenable.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the DPP can never be other than fully independent he must become more directly involved.  For example, he and his officers <Col N="1194" /> make directions to the Garda Síochána in respect of files they receive and it has been suggested that in sexual abuse case this led to matters being handled very impersonally.  He should be made more amenable, not only to the Committee of Public Accounts but to other committees, such as the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister of State has not seen fit to allow this amendment.  It goes against the commitment by the Government, set out in the opening paragraphs of its programme, A Government of Renewal, to openness and to change the institutions of the State to make them more amenable and responsible.  People believed this rubbish for a time until the more perceptive commentators and independent observers concluded that this was the most secretive Government in the history of the State.  It was a Government whose members made their name on an issue in November 1994 about which people in my party knew nothing.</P>
    <P>However, nothing has happened.  In its first document on Dáil reform the Government proposed that matters of concern could be raised in the House, yet it quickly did a U-turn.  The Cabinet is highly secretive and wishes to suppress any ability the House may have to investigate issues that affect people, such as a direction from the DPP, which goes to all Garda stations, and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, issues which impinge on the daily interaction by the public with the law.  If the DPP is prepared to appear on the &ldquo;Marian Finucane Show&rdquo; he should be prepared to appear before a relevant Dáil committee, which is not necessarily the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Minister of State can act only on the direction of the Cabinet, whose record in this area is worse than that of previous Governments.  One political correspondent referred to it as the most secretive Government in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>I agree with amendment No. 20 in the name of Deputy Michael McDowell.  The purpose of the amendments in my name is more restrictive than the stipulations proposed for the Attorney General. While they provide that the DPP may appear before all committees of the House, if the Government had been willing to accommodate the view of this side of the House it would have been able to produce an amendment restricting the DPP to appearing before specific committees, for example, the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and some of the more important committees.  The Government agreed to reconsider these issues on Report Stage.  Officials are occasionally blamed for the restrictions they place on these issues.  However, in this case, members of the Government are being overly restrictive with regard to the attendance of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions before committees.</P>
    <P>The Bill was launched with a fanfare and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, said it would open up the institutions of the State.  The <Col N="1195" /> original legislation contained more exemptions than any other Bill for many years.  The Government was forced to amend the position in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions but it only made minuscule changes.  Who is pulling the strings?  Under the Constitution, the House has a right to ensure on behalf of the people that the Government and officers of the State are amenable to Parliament.  However, that is not facilitated in the legislation.  The measures are wrong, and I would say that if my party was in Government. The House should be more open.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why Oireachtas Members, who are public representatives, should be compelled to appear, as members of my party were forced to do a couple of years ago, and answer for mistakes made by others of which they were not aware.  That should not happen.  The Minister of State will mention the strategic management initiative but Deputies should not be held responsible for the mistakes, wrong doings and negligence of others.</P>
    <P>Members should give themselves more power to make people outside the House more accountable to it.  That is what the Constitution intended and, although I am probably wasting my breath, I implore the Minister of State to reconsider this matter.  Members of the Government may find themselves on the Opposition side in the future and they may take the view then that this is necessary. When I was on the Government side of the House, my area of responsibility included Dáil reform and I always took the view that procedures should be more open.  There were proposals at that time for more openness and reforms were, by and large, implemented by a Fianna Fáil led Government. Unfortunately, Government Deputies have shown that, once they get into positions of power, they take a different view from the one they held in Opposition.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the section are wrong.  It would be much better if, even in a limited way, the Director of Public Prosecutions could be called to appear before committees other than the Committee of Public Accounts and queried on policy in terms of the administration of the courts rather than general administration and statistics.  Deputies should have a say in that area. I accept the independence of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  This office is probably more independent than the Office of the Attorney General.  The Attorney General is a political appointee and is more involved in the day to day running of Government because he sits at the Cabinet table.  However, the Government's proposals in these areas are wrong and I ask the Minister of State to reconsider them.</P>

      <P>That is the way the game has been played.  However, this debate involves serious issues and I am disappointed at the Deputy because he has been constructive up to now in relation to this difficult legislation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy stated in his political broadcast that senior members of the previous Government were expected to answer questions on matters to which they could not respond.  I presume the Deputy was referring in particular to the most senior member of that Government, the Taoiseach, in relation to the matter of the Office of the Attorney General.  It is shocking that a Taoiseach of any political complexion would not be in a position to respond to questions and charges in the House in relation to the Attorney General or his office at any stage.  The Taoiseach appoints the Attorney General and is answerable to the House regarding the performance of the Attorney General and related matters.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said senior members of the previous Government were asked to reply to questions in the House for which they did not have answers.  He made a political broadcast.</P>
      <P>I understand the frustration and annoyance of Deputies about the fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions chose to take part in a popular radio 'phone in programme and talk his heart out within weeks of refusing to appear before a committee. I was also taken aback by his decision. However, the Government has responded to that position to the maximum appropriate extent.</P>
      <P>I would put money on it that the Deputy, if he was on this side and his party was part of a Government steering this legislation through the House, would do exactly what this Government is doing in this area.  It is possible he would not have gone as far in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I make this unequivocal point on the basis of the source of the advice I received, which is similar to the advice which would be available to the Deputy's party if it was in Government.  However, I understand Members' frustration and the Government responded to it by making the Director of Public Prosecutions compellable in almost exactly the same manner as the Attorney General is compellable before the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> As the Deputy will recall, that was not the original intention but the Government immediately moved on that aspect.  This is as far as the Constitution allows the Government to go.  Ultimately, all legislation is circumscribed by what the Constitution directs.  This is the point in this area and we must be careful that all legislation meets the spirit and letter of the Constitution.  We must not jeopardise the independence of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions by our actions in relation to the Bill.  The Government has moved significantly in terms of the position of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the original Bill where he or she was not compellable at all.</P>
    <P>The amendments are re-entered versions of Committee Stage amendments Nos. 17, 18, 21 and 22 relating to the compellability of the Director of Public Prosecutions and his officers.  The Deputy will recall from the Committee Stage debate that the Government decided that compellability should be the same for the Director of Public Prosecutions as the Attorney General.  As officers of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General could answer questions on their behalf, it is logical that accountability of staff of both offices should be the same as for those offices themselves.</P>
    <P>Accountability of the Attorney General to the Committee of Public Accounts in his capacity as head of his office is acceptable. However, as the Deputy is aware, the Attorney General is not accountable to the Oireachtas but to the Taoiseach.  As senior law officers of the State, the arguments for having the offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General treated similarly are compelling.  The Government has decided this is the best and most logical way to provide for compellability of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Regarding amendment No. 21, this would remove the exemption previously given to officers of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  As it is logical that accountability of staff of both the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions should be the same as those for the offices, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 22 would make the Director of Public Prosecutions compellable by any select committee.  As this would mean different levels of compellability for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General, I cannot agree to it.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 would have the same effect as a combination of amendments Nos. 21 and 22. The same reasons for opposing those amendments apply.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 would make officers of the Director of Public Prosecutions compellable by the Committee of Public Accounts or any select committee.  As it would make officers of the Director of Public Prosecutions accountable for the full range of business carried out in that office, it cannot be accepted as it could lead to such officers being questioned about specific legal <Col N="1198" /> cases.  It would also lead to a greater degree of compellability for officers of the Director of Public Prosecutions than for the director himself.  This would be unacceptable.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I undertook to introduce on Report Stage an amendment which would provide a means to speed up High Court action against reluctant witnesses.  This amendment provides for committees to apply in a summary manner to the High Court for an order compelling the witness to comply with the committee's direction. The principle of amendment No. 26, has, therefore, been met, although I appreciate fully what the Deputy is trying to achieve.  This amendment deals with the issue adequately.</P>

      <P> (a) a reference to the President, the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions or a judge of the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Circuit Court, the District Court or the Special Criminal Court is a reference to a person who holds or held that office in his or her capacity as such holder, and</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in response to comments made by Deputy McDowell and others on Committee Stage that Civil Service managers could prevent a civil servant from being questioned by spuriously transferring him or her to the Office of the President, the Attorney General or the DPP.  Such civil servants would then be immune from compellability, except in the circumstances provided for the Attorney General and the DPP in the Bill.  Inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;in such capacity&rdquo; means that civil servants could only avail of the special provisions on compellability for those offices for the time they spent working there.  If a civil servant was transferred to one of <Col N="1203" /> those offices, he would still be compellable in the normal way for his previous employments.  The reference to the professional legal services under a contract for services is to cover personnel in the offices of the Attorney General and the DPP engaged on terms different from those of civil servants.</P>

      <P>I tabled this amendment to remove any doubt about the procedures of this House.  The effect of the amendment is to maintain the supremacy of the House to regulate its own procedures under Article 15.10 of the Constitution.  It is important that we allow the internal procedures of the House be regulated by our Standing Orders and that Members dictate their own regulations rather than constantly having to refer to this legislation.

      <P>Last Wednesday, with the Ministers for Social Welfare and Finance, I met representatives of IBEC, ICTU and the CIF to discuss progress on social partnership.</P>
      <P>In that context pay developments in both the public and private sectors were reviewed.  I am happy that the meeting was very productive, where all the participants restated their full support for Partnership 2000 and the objective which it represents, namely, the growth in real living standards in tandem with improved competitiveness and more jobs.  Among the objectives which were discussed was deepening partnership between management and employees in both the public and private sectors, and in this regard the establishment of the national centre for partnership was agreed.</P>
      <P>I confirm that each side outlined its position in relation to recent pay and industrial relations developments and that my colleagues and I expressed concern on behalf of the Government that the normal procedures for dispute resolution would be operated fully prior to industrial action of any form being contemplated.  I strongly reiterated the Government's position in relation to adhering to pay norms and restated the Government's resolve to resist pay claims which would threaten the management of the public finances.</P>
      <P>Government, employers and trade unions restated their commitment to promoting industrial harmony both in relation to outstanding issues under the PCW and the future implementation of Partnership 2000.  It was agreed that officials of the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance would meet ICTU representatives as regards the public sector, while IBEC and ICTU will meet separately in relation to private sector issues.</P>
      <P>The consensus among those participating in last Wednesday's meeting is reflected in the joint statement issued on behalf of the Government, IBEC, ICTU and the CIF which I have laid before the House.  I am pleased to note that since our meeting there has been a satisfactory outcome to both the disputes involving ambulance drivers over the weekened, proving the case for the operation of agreed procedures in preference to industrial action.</P>

      <P>The fact that all parties have had to restate their commitment to Partnership 2000 when the partnership programme has been in existence for only a few months indicates the strains that have built up in such a short period. I suggest that too much has been taken for granted in social partnership over the past few <Col N="1206" /> years.  What is required is a hands-on effort by the Government, through a Minister.  I appreciate the Taoiseach has responsibilities and cannot always deal with these meetings, but some Minister should co-ordinate the effort.  If it is to work into the future somebody must be directly responsible and adopt a hands-on approach to dealing with all the social partners, particularly if we are to include more groups in future.  This concept has worked for a decade and if it is to work in future the Taoiseach should consider giving somebody the responsibility for co-ordinating it. It is not considered that anybody in the Government currently has that responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in what the Deputy said.  It should be stated that the meeting we had was part of the process of social partnership. It is agreed that the social partners should meet the Taoiseach and senior Ministers on a regular basis to review progress.  The meeting was timely, but it was also part of a regular process. As Taoiseach I have responsibility in this area for overall maintenance of social partnership, and I meet on a regular basis the social partners, together and individually.  My Department has a unit headed by an assistant secretary which maintains daily contact on an ongoing basis with the social partners relative to all matters, pay and non-pay, of concern to the social partners.  Also, it operates and services the National Economic and Social Council and other instruments that contribute to social partnership.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the workload has increased because, in contrast to previous agreements, under Partnership 2000 a larger number of people are now involved.  The unemployed, for instance, are more directly involved than ever before. Those involved in various types of work with the marginalised and the disadvantaged are involved directly in social partnership in a way they were not before.  This obviously imposes additional pressures on all those involved.  The Government's decision, announced at the meeting, to proceed rapidly with the creation of posts and appointment of the relevant staff to the centre for partnership will be of particular assistance to all concerned in ensuring that the partnership continues to work as well as it has done.  I have acknowledged on many occasions in recent times the very great contribution that social partnership has made to the comparative economic prosperity that we enjoy today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Taoiseach has listened to the points I made.  However, there is no Department of Labour.  What was the Department of Labour has been subsumed into the Department of Enterprise and Employment and effectively lost.  Anybody who knows anything about negotiations and industrial relations acknowledges that.  Nor is there any longer a Department of the Public Service.  Somebody other than the Taoiseach, who cannot deal with day to day issues, should be dealing with these <Col N="1207" /> issues.  There is nobody to do that at present and that is why, a few months into this programme, there is frustration.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned about the rash of special pay claims?  Some of these claims are being made under the PCW, but some are outside it.  The Garda Síochána are marching on the House today and, as far as I recall, they signed up to the PCW.  Their claim is a new one and I am not sure whether it is under Partnership 2000. Three thousand paramedics and a host of other people are following that lead.  Is the Taoiseach concerned that we seem to be drifting back to analogues and relativity and not moving, on the basis of the strategic management initiative, towards productivity and efficiency?  Is he not concerned that we are drifting back to the effectively bogus productivity claims that ruined the economy in the 1970s and early 1980s?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to agree to the Deputy's suggestion in the first part of his question, there is a risk that it would be seen as downgrading social partnership by hiving it off to another ministry and removing the responsibility from the Department of the Taoiseach.  It is appropriate that the overall responsibility for social partnership should rest with the Taoiseach. In the way in which the Government works, there are essentially three issues where overall responsibility on a reasonably frequent basis rests with the Taoiseach: Northern Ireland, overall management of our relationship with Europe because of participation by the Taoiseach in summits and, the most important area, social partnership. The Deputy put forward a constructive suggestion, but there are risks of misinterpretation of the kind to which I have referred.  I do not wish to argue the matter with the Deputy.  He put forward the proposal with the best interests of the country at heart and I acknowledge it on that basis.</P>
      <P>On the second part of the issue, we must make a distinction in terms of claims that arise under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work which have not yet been reached in the normal process of negotiation.  Most claims in regard to productivity arising under that programme have been settled.  However, a small number remain to be settled, one of which relates to paramedics. That claim arises under the old programme and is being processed in the normal way.  Such claims are in a different category from claims that are made anew by people who have already settled these matters under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the conditions in the Partnership 2000 agreement the 2 per cent local bargaining element, which was agreed, will be payable in mid-1999 on the achievement of real verifiable progress on the public service modernisation programme in each sector of the public service.  The only provision in Partnership 2000 for locally negotiated pay increases is as set out in clause 6 <Col N="1208" /> and it debars the submission and processing of claims other than those permitted under the terms of that clause.  The clause operates on the basis of verifiable progress in the area in which the people making the claim work, in terms of improved productivity and improved application of change under the Strategic Management Initiative.  That is the basis on which this matter will be considered and negotiated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to groups such as the Garda Síochána that are not party to that clause and were not at the table to negotiate it and on whose behalf the clause was not negotiated under the umbrella of the Congress of Trade Unions, what guidelines did the Government set down to influence their claims or claims from other groups now working outside that area?  Some of those groups ask how can they be party to an agreement in which they were not involved in terms of negotiation and voting.  I have not seen any guidelines laid down by the Government that cover the general workforce, whether in the private or public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The groups referred to by the Deputy negotiate with the Government and the Government's policy on pay for change and modernisation is set out in Partnership 2000.  That is not simply the policy of the social partners but is Government policy.  I outlined that policy when I referred to mid-1999 and the pursuit of claims in accordance with the procedures set out in clause 6.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Garda, in particular, a fundamental review of Garda efficiency and effectiveness is under way in which the role of the force, how it can function better and how it might be changed is being examined.  The review group will make recommendations very soon which will involve significant change.  It is the view of the Government that the best context in which to look at any changes in payment that might arise as a result of changes in practice, procedure and productivity is in the context of that report, which we expect to receive very soon.  This is the most thorough re-examination of the way in which the Garda function on behalf of the people that has been undertaken in recent years and it will prove to be a landmark in the development of the force. It will also prove to be a mechanism whereby those working in the force at every level will be able to do so not only with greater efficiency on behalf of the public but also in a more personally fulfilling way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter will be dealt with in the context of the provisions adopted as Government policy in regard to claims of this nature as set out in clause 6 of Partnership 2000, the main content of which I have read into the record.  All claims will be considered in the context of that Government policy, which provides for a local bargaining element, up to 2 per cent of which might be payable in mid-1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of what the report shows in terms of efficiency, productivity and changes in the structure of the Garda, the maximum that can be negotiated will be as set out in clause 6, that is 2 per cent, payable in 1999. Effectively we will be asking the Garda to make all these changes on the basis that they will receive only 2 per cent in two years' time.  Is that the Government's position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Government's policy as set out in Partnership 2000.  Obviously the issue will be negotiated on the basis, and within the constraints, of Government policy.  I am sure the Deputy will understand that there are also commitments in Partnership 2000, for instance, to reductions in income tax for the PAYE and other groups in the private and public sectors.  To the extent that additional resources are taken for the purpose of pay increases, whether for productivity or of a general kind, those resources are not available to reduce the burden of taxation. There is a very simple choice to be made.</P>
      <P>It is very important to ensure improvements in efficiency in the Garda Síochána, many of which will make the Garda Síochána a better place to work, involving in some cases no cost for those working under the improved conditions which it is intended to achieve.  When the report is available it will be the intention of the Government to sit down with all those involved and discuss the way in which the changes are to be brought about in a partnership atmosphere and with a partnership attitude within the context of the overall Government policy set out in Partnership 2000. We will approach the matter by way of consultation with a view to achieving major change for the better in the way the gardaí work and in the way the public service generally serves the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept there is a strong argument for ministerial responsibility for social partnership because of the pressures being put on the Labour Relations Commission? I compliment it on the way it deals with industrial relations matters, albeit in a crisis management way.  Surely prevention is better than dealing with matters in that manner.  As the Taoiseach correctly stated, with the advent of Partnership 2000 the agenda is much broader and includes matters such as unemployment and labour affairs.  Does the Taoiseach accept that ministerial involvement <Col N="1210" /> in matters such as consultation in the workplace and job sharing would be more appropriate than involvement by the Taoiseach's Department? Does he accept that the National Economic and Social Forum could feed into such a process and that this would be more appropriate from an employment prospective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy. The best way to emphasise the importance of social partnership is to place responsibility for it with the head of the Government.  Social partnership is too important to devolve responsibility for it to another Minister.  The Taoiseach should take responsibility for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Bodies such as the National Economic and Social Forum are appointed by the Taoiseach's Department and report on a regular basis to it.  To have those bodies report to another Department would create unnecessary duplication and division of responsibility, and that would not be in the interests of social partnership. I give high priority to social partnership and to the work I do with the social partners to ensure that their input is felt in every Government Department.  The Taoiseach is the member of the Government with the capacity to influence all Government Departments and issues that arise in social partnership affect all Government Departments. Therefore, the most appropriate Minister to deal with social partnership is the Minister with the capacity to influence all Government Departments, namely the head of the Government, the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the publication of our first report last October, the ministerial task force has been overseeing the implementation of the strategies recommended in that report.  As the Deputy will be aware, a Cabinet drugs committee and a National Drugs Strategy Team have been established at national level, while local drugs task forces have been established and are working in Dublin and North Cork city.</P>
      <P>We expect the task forces to submit their anti-drugs development strategies in the coming weeks.  The Government set aside £10 million of the £14 million allocated in the current year to support the non-mainstream elements of these strategies.  In our second report, we hope to give full details of the steps taken and the progress achieved to date in implementing all the strategies developed in our first report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> This work has proceeded in conjunction with a concentration on other aspects of the drugs problem with which we will deal in our second report. These relate to the nationwide misuse of non-opiate drugs, such as ecstasy and cannabis, drug abuse in our prisons and the treatment of prisoners who misuse drugs and the role of therapeutic communities in the treatment and rehabilitation of drug misusers.</P>
    <P>I hope that this second report will be finalised within the next few weeks and will then be submitted to Government, prior to publication.</P>

      <P>The sooner the second report is published the better.  Is the allocation of the £10 million proceeding according to plan or are the Minister of State and his officials waiting for the development plans from the various groups before allocating money?  Will he update me on what he said on 19 February regarding the level of consultation with the various communities? Have all the difficulties been resolved with the Ballymun, Crumlin and the other groups involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of the money is proceeding as planned.  The moneys designated will be disbursed to the local drugs task forces in terms of the plans they submit.  It would not be proper to allocate any money until the local drugs task forces submit their plans to the National Drugs Strategy Team.  We expect them to do that by the end of the month.  The £3 million of the £14 million allocated for the purposes of improving estates has virtually all been allocated.  Local task forces have been working on the preparation of a comprehensive plan for their immediate areas and the moneys will be allocated as soon as the plans have been submitted.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report that the difficulties in regard to Ballymun and Crumlin have been ironed out.  In virtually all cases the task forces are working satisfactorily.  This may be a suitable opportunity for me to take back some of the harsh things I said earlier about the length of time it took the community and voluntary sector to decide who should represent them on the task forces.  They have done that without exception, and work is progressing well.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State use his good offices as co-ordinator to deal with the ongoing drugs problem?  From his knowledge of the city, I am sure he is aware that success in some areas has forced the problem into other areas.  For example, people around the city can be given a fixed time at which to purchase drugs, in two locations, in particular.  While I accept this is not the responsibility of the Minister of State, will he use his co-ordinating role to resolve this problem?  People are being allowed to openly flout the law I do not want to have to name the areas concerned, but I have reported them to the authorities.  Those communities will not be able <Col N="1212" /> to put forward a coherent plan to benefit from the allocation of funds.  Action should be taken before the summer to deal with this problem.  I will submit the names of the two areas involved if the Minister wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that action taken by local community groups to protect their areas, as well as more effective policing, has caused the problem to move to other areas.  As Deputy Ahern suggested, it is true there is a problem of displacement in a small number of areas in this city, which we have been seeking to address.  The Cabinet sub-committee has had a formal meeting with the Deputy Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner for Dublin at which this and other aspects of the problem were discussed.  We have also had several informal contacts.  According to the statistical information available the problem has been very bad and concentrated in certain areas.  Because those areas are targeted for additional resources and so on, it does not mean that the Eastern Health Board is going out of business.  It is continuing to do its job and has greatly developed and enhanced its infrastructure to deal with this problem over the past few years.</P>
      <P>Because the 11 areas selected are the focus of attention in the sense of local drugs task forces and the focus of more resources, it does not mean that the Eastern Health Board, which is familiar with the problem to which Deputy Ahern referred, is not concentrating on those other areas.  Significant additional resources have been made available in the past few years to the Eastern Health Board.  I hope the phenomenon to which Deputy Ahern pointed can be dealt with. This is a very difficult problem.  Because there is some improvement in the worst afflicted areas it does not mean that the problem, to borrow a phrase, has gone away.  Those who have been pushing death in the form of drugs in certain communities in Dublin are still peddling their menacing trade and we are trying to reduce the demand for drugs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge what the Minister said.  I am fearful that people are bringing drugs into a small number of areas.  As the drugs trade in those areas is well-organised, well-structured and sophisticated, all the big players have moved into those areas.  If that trade is not broken, it will be very difficult to tackle the drugs problem in those areas.  Other institutions of the State as well as the Eastern Health Board must engage in addressing this problem.  The Eastern Health Board will find it impossible to operate in those areas.  The Minister of State has obviously talked to the Garda.  It is hard for law abiding citizens to watch the operation of this trade outside their windows and in their locality night after night. Though tactics are required to deal with it and should be adopted.  Notebooks will not solve the problem.</P>

      <P>The Strategic Management Initiative is the overall framework for change in the Irish Civil Service.  It includes a number of interrelated elements on which parallel action is being taken.  This detailed programme of action is set out in Delivering Better Government, published in May 1996.</P>
      <P>Among the significant milestones in the process are the following: the preparation and publication of statements of strategy for Departments and offices, setting out their key goals and objectives and the strategies to achieve them; business plans to give effect to the statements at divisional and individual level are now being prepared; multi-annual budgeting has been introduced and new models of financial management systems are being developed; on the legislation front, progress has been achieved with the passing of the Freedom of Information Act, the publication of the Public Service Management Bill on 6 March last and its completion of Committee Stage in the Seanad today, while the Privilege and Compellability of Witnesses Bill is today at Report Stage in this House; a Civil Service wide quality customer service initiative, based on the principles set out in Delivering Better Government is being finalised at present; and a performance management system is being designed and developed, with the assistance of external consultants, the design of which will be completed by end 1997, to be followed by its immediate implementation. As provided for in pages 78 to 80 of Delivering Better Government new institutional mechanisms have been put in place in the form of the overall co-ordinating group comprising representatives from the public and private sectors and from the trade unions; working groups, both management and front-line, on quality customer service, human resource management, financial management, open and transparent service delivery, regulatory reform and information technology; and regular meetings of secretaries and heads of offices.</P>
      <P>The working groups have submitted interim reports, which will form the basis of a comprehensive programme for future action in Departments and offices, which is currently being prepared for early submission to Government. Specific examples of the proposals developed by the groups in terms of progress include recommendations covering recruitment and management of staff prepared by the working group on human resources management which will be submitted to Government shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality customer service initiative will be <Col N="1214" /> launched shortly and will be based on principles developed by the quality customer service working group for the delivery of quality service.</P>
    <P>The process of public service change is long-term and strategic in nature.  The above actions represent solid progress.  This will be further helped by the implementation of the partnership approach to change, outlined in chapter 10 of Partnership 2000.  I am confident that the pace and depth of the change process will develop even more momentum during 1997, building on the achievements to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked this question before and I answered it at length some weeks ago.  I outlined milestones in implementing the Strategic Management Initiative on delivering better Government.  There has been much progress in the preparation of statements of strategy and the task of getting Departments and offices to set out their key goals and objectives and the strategic to achieve them has created efficiencies right through the different levels of the service. Much progress has been made on the financial side on multi-annual budgeting and accrual accounting.  The Deputy has asked questions on that in this House before.</P>
      <P>Under the quality customer service initiative many programmes of efficiency are in place and I will not tie myself to a date as the Deputy may say at a future date that I have not adhered to it, but in early May I expect to be back here setting out details of that initiative.  The way the service is delivered is more effective and efficient and thereby more cost effective.</P>
      <P>The Deputy knows better than I do the purpose of the Strategic Management Initiative on delivering better Government.  It is about providing excellent services across Departments and acting on the internal management systems that will put those in place.  Much progress has been made.  I cannot name a section of a Department and say that £X thousand has been saved in an area.  There will not be a great deal of saving in resources in the overall public sector bill, but there will be redeployment of existing resources to areas which need increased resources.  That is what the initiative is about.  Some areas which are efficient and effective will need less person power to implement the initiative.  In other areas where we need increased or new specialities, such as on the European front, Northern Ireland, the security area or other areas such as information technology where there are increased demands for new services, we will have to redeploy resources to get an effective and efficient service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is well aware of the timescale involved.  I am not in a position to pick a Department and say that £X thousand or £X million have been saved in the delivery of a service.  I <Col N="1215" /> outlined carefully in my reply areas of great strategic progress.  The Deputy will be aware that getting a Civil Service as large as ours to implement these changes, which involve a change of culture, and to do this in full consultation with all involved takes time.  It is being done strategically. It may not be moving fast enough but I am assured progress is being made as quickly as is possible.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree there has been a distancing between the public servant and the citizen?  She referred to the Freedom of Information Bill introduced by her colleague in the Labour Party.  Is she aware the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, has put the onus on the citizen to seek clarification rather than putting it on the authorities?  That does not lead to proper streamlining of management between the public and the public service.  Fianna Fáil put down an amendment which put the onus on the Minister or the local authority to state why such a matter should be secret but the Minister turned it around and put the onus back on the citizen to pursue it.  That has not been taken into account in the strategic management initiative. The purpose of the SMI report is to clarify the rights of the public and the public service so that each knows where it stands.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to go into detail on the Freedom of Information Bill.  That is a separate, specific question, although it merits an answer.  I was not involved with the passage of that Bill through the House; Deputy Fitzgerald was and I have no doubt she would not object to answering specific questions on it.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that Delivering Better Government or the SMI have put distance between the citizen and the public service.  Our focus in Delivering Better Government on a quality customer service is such that it will make front line delivery of all public services much more customer and user friendly.  A great deal of work and resources have still to be invested in the physical surroundings in which the public deals with the public service.  There has been a tremendous programme of capital investment in social welfare offices, for example.  Much remains to be done and it will take at least another two years before circumstances will be such that recipients of public services will be able to deal with the front line service provider in surroundings they deserve.  I do not accept there has been distancing of the citizen from the public service in regard to anything the Government has done.</P>

      <P>In my substantive reply to Deputy Ahern's question, I pointed out that a performance management system is being designed and developed and in recent weeks consultants have been appointed to work with the co-ordinating and human resource management working groups in this endeavour.  The design of the system will be completed by the end of this year and will be implemented immediately.  There is specific reference to that process in Delivering Better Government, the document published last May. We have assessed the working groups' deliberations and their report to the co-ordinating group on the performance management system.  On its recommendation, performance management specialists are being brought in to ensure performance management systems are tailored to work in various State agencies.  One management system could not be applied generically throughout the civil or public service because different types of services are being measured.  We must tailor the performance measurement system to the type of service being provided.  It will involve rewarding excellence, indicating areas where performance is below par and dealing specifically with under-performance.</P>

      <P>I would be pre-empting the outcome of the work of the consultant and the human resource working group if I were to state that an improvement will be measured in percentage terms.  That will be known when we know the performance management system they will put in place.  I am not sure if that is one of the criteria they will recommend but they will consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of redefining job descriptions, statements of strategy have been presented by most Departments and offices.  Four are outstanding but will be presented within the next week or two.  They set the key goals, objectives and strategies of the services which each Department and State must provide.  The teams that provide those services will, under the Public Service Management (No. 2) Bill, 1997, which moves responsibility for operational and day to day work from the Minister to heads of section and senior management, clearly know what they have to do and <Col N="1217" /> who is responsible for delivering services or aspects of services.  Team and individual performance will then be measured in terms of service delivery.  This will be included in the report of the consultants and the working group and will be in place at the end of this year.</P>

      <P>On the first point, the figures for unestablished civil servants appointed on <Col N="1218" /> a contract basis relate to the period from December 1994 to December 1996.  The cost was £172,697.  That is the normal complement of staff which a Minister in the Department of Social Welfare employs.  It is the same complement and incurs relatively the same cost as staff employed on a similar basis by Deputy Woods when he was Minister.  The additional cost in my Department as a result of my presence as Minister and party leader, over and above what it cost when Deputy Woods was Minister, is £100,893.  That relates to five staff in a research unit appointed by me, based on a Government decision in November 1995.  That figure is the cost to date.  The only public relations staff operating on my behalf are the departmental staff.</P>
      <P>The advisory group or research unit provides research, analysis and advice on policy issues which arise outside my departmental responsibilities as one of three party leaders in Government.

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the revised estimate by his Department for the number of unemployed people for the year 1997; the revised cost of unemployment payments; his views on whether this is a realistic projection; the new measures, if any, he is taking to ensure this figure is achieved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9913/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1997 revised estimate for unemployment payments provides for an average live register of 255,000.  The total money provision for unemployment payments in the Revised Estimates volume is £960.7 million.  This covers payments to all persons on the live register and to certain other unemployed categories of persons such as smallholders and short-time workers.  It also covers the cost of the significant improvement in payment rates provided for in this year's budget.</P>
      <P>The indications at this early stage are that the provisions made for unemployment payments are adequate.  Latest expenditure returns and the live register figures at the end of March are both in line with expectations.  The downward trend in the live register, for which this Government is responsible, is continuing and the indications are that it will be maintained.  For example, preliminary statistics for April show that there has so far been a further 4,000 drop in the number of people on the live register.</P>
      <P>This is due to a combination of factors.  First, the ongoing strong growth in the economy which is enhancing job creation, is being translated into reductions in the live register.  Second, the transformation of the social welfare system which supports people moving from unemployment into employment and the range of other work supportive programmes and measures which have been introduced have encouraged and motivated the unemployed to return to the active labour force.  Finally the intensive and comprehensive programme of measures which I have put in place to reduce the level of fraud and abuse in the system is having a significant effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of specific positive measures were announced in this year's budget designed to encourage the unemployed to get back to work. These include an increase of 5,000 &mdash; to a maximum of 22,000 &mdash; in the number who can <Col N="1220" /> participate in the back to work allowance scheme and the provision of an additional 3,500 places on community employment projects for unemployed people.  Since last August the number of participants in the back to work allowance scheme has increased by 4,000 to just over 17,000 at present.</P>
    <P>I have a team of 30 jobs facilitators in place in my Department's ten regions and they are responsible for ensuring that the unemployed and employers are fully aware of the Department's pro-employment, educational and training programmes at local level.  They also have a significant part to play in assessing the needs of the unemployed, supporting them in seeking job opportunities, informing and directing them towards the wide range of existing initiatives and options provided by various Government Departments, agencies, voluntary bodies and community groups.</P>
    <P>The programme of measures I introduced to tackle fraud and abuse in the unemployment payment system has contributed to the significant drop of over 25,000 in numbers of people on the live register.  Features of this comprehensive programme include a claims review exercise under which the continuing entitlement of all customers in receipt of a payment is being examined, a review of entitlement after six months duration on the live register, the youth progression measures introduced in last year's budget and an enhanced publicity campaign which is currently under way to promote and encourage registrants to avail of the variety of work supports available.</P>
    <P>I am fully confident that the existing measures to help unemployed people get back to work together with the excellent job creation prospects which currently prevail will result in an average live register of 255,000 being achieved for 1997.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>How many long-term unemployed people are included in the estimate of 255,000 for this year?  What is the current figure per 1,000 which is used in the calculation of the £916 million? Is it £3.6 million or £3.8 million?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in 1995 the Government's estimate of the number of unemployed was an average of 266,000 for social welfare purposes and the outturn at the end of that year was 279,000?  The Government's estimate the next year was 275,000, which became 279,000.  Currently, with an outturn of 279,000, the Government is setting an estimate of 255,000.  The Minister is confident that reduction can be achieved, despite the fact that last year, the number increased, notwithstanding media statements. The outturn at the end of the year showed an increase against the estimate of 4,200 on average per week every week.  In other words, there were an extra 4,200 people unemployed every week on the register during 1996 over the Government estimate of 275,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, does the Minister believe the weekly average of 20,000 now being estimated is a real estimate?  It has been increased to an average of 24,000 per week for every week. <Col N="1221" /> The base for that average must be running at 265,000, if one takes the end of month figures. What is the saving on that 24,000 against last year's outturn?</P>

    <P>There are, of course, significant numbers of people on the live register who receive no payment and, as a result, it is not entirely accurate to say that every 1,000 taken off the live register means a saving of £3.5 million or more.

      <P>The underlying purpose of the students' summer jobs scheme, which was introduced in 1993, is to provide summer work opportunities and income support for less well off third level students and students undertaking multi-year PLC courses who are in need of such support.</P>
      <P>A sum of £3 million was allocated towards this scheme in the 1994 Budget and this was increased by me to £6 million in 1995.  Improvements which I made in the scheme in 1995 involved the allocation of an additional £4 million.  In 1996, £10.2 million was allocated for the scheme and a similar amount has been approved by the Government for this year's scheme.</P>
      <P>I made significant improvements in the scheme in 1995 by increasing the amount payable per student from £520 to £600.  This level of support has been maintained this year.  I also allowed third level students with even a minimum entitlement under the means-tested unemployment assistance scheme to take part.  These changes resulted in a very significant increase in the number of students participating in the scheme &mdash; in 1994, 9,200 students took part, while in 1995 and last year the number increased to just under 16,000.  This year I expect a similar number to take part.</P>

      <P>It must be borne in mind that this scheme was first introduced following the abolition of unemployment assistance for third level students and is confined to that category who do not have an underlying entitlement of unemployment assistance.  The intention is to provide an income for students from families with low incomes deprived of unemployment assistance. That is the basis on which the scheme has been operated to date.  There would be substantial costs involved in extending the provisions of the scheme to second level students on completing their leaving certificate examinations.  My understanding is that approximately 60,000 students sit the leaving certificate each year. Bearing in mind that the scheme now costs £10 million to provide places for 16,000 students any extension would involve considerable cost.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give the House an indication of the activities undertaken by students who participated in this scheme in previous years and is it his intention to add any new range of activities in ensuing years?  Will he take account of the fact that a number of environmentally beneficial works could be undertaken by students, on completion of their leaving certificates, at almost no cost to the Exchequer if we could devise a framework within which that type of work could be tailored to the terms of the scheme, thus ensuring value for taxpayers' money and allowing those young people from families needing to benefit from this type of support to be usefully occupied immediately after sitting their leaving certificates?</P>

      <P>The jobs position has changed dramatically from what it was three or four years ago when the scheme was introduced. I am aware that, in summertime, the tourism and catering industries encounter great difficulty recruiting staff to fill vacancies to cater adequately for the huge numbers of visitors now coming to our shores.  Any suggestion that second level or third level students, ineligible under the provisions of this scheme, are left high and dry is not accurate because there are jobs available for many of them.  For instance, I know that many students before and after participation in the summer job scheme engage in other work; in some cases, depending on how they structure their working time, in part-time work.  There is a great deal of work available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey undertaken of students who participate in the scheme showed that approximately 86 per cent were satisfied with the basic rate of pay; many simultaneously having availed of the option of engaging in other part-time work.  The kinds of <Col N="1224" /> projects undertaken involve collection and research of traditional songs, surveys of energy consumption in homes and businesses, with recommendations being made, coaching in GAA and other clubs, golf course maintenance, rural research and surveys, care of and assistance for the elderly and children with a mental handicap, tourist information, summer camps for children from deprived areas and so on.  Some 30 sponsors undertook some type of work to help the elderly, varying from carrying out surveys to undertaking chores for them.  There is no real restriction on participants in the scheme other than the requirement that it be valuable community work unlikely to displace people already in work; in other words, funding of this type will not be provided to people who may be commercially orientated. It is not intended to provide a commercial service.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any information indicating that summer jobs may not be as readily available to young students this year because of the restrictions imposed by the provisions of the recently passed Organisation of Working Time Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any information on that matter.  It is a question which should more properly be addressed to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  I have no reason to believe the provisions of that Bill will impose such restrictions but my colleague would be in a better position to provide that information to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The full year cost of the increases announced in the three budgets introduced by this administration in 1995, 1996 and 1997 was £588 million.  The increase in the cumulative real value of social welfare payments announced in these three budgets ranged from 2.6 per cent to 8.6 per cent after taking inflation into account.</P>
      <P>The cumulative cash increase in the weekly personal rate of non-contributory old age pension, non-contributory widow's pension and long-term unemployment assistance was £6.50.  There were also increases in adult dependant and other allowances, where applicable.</P>
      <P>The real value of non-contributory old age pension, non-contributory widow's pension and long-term unemployment assistance was maintained in 1995, while substantial resources were concentrated on increasing child benefit by 35 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> The real value of non-contributory old age pension, non-contributory widow's pension and long-term unemployment assistance, after taking inflation into account, rose by 1.5 per cent in 1996.</P>
    <P>The full year cost of the increases in these three payments announced in the 1997 budget is over £45 million.  This will result in a further real increase of at least 2.5 per cent in 1997.  It should also be noted that the ESRI in its report on income adequacy commissioned by me as Minister points out that secondary benefits are worth approximately 15 per cent extra to a pensioner couple, which is approximately £15 or £16.</P>
    <P>This Government is determined to protect and enhance the value of social welfare entitlements. The increases implemented in the 1995 and 1996 budgets brought the widow's contributory pension, deserted wife's benefit and carer's allowance up to, and in most cases, beyond the minimum <Col N="1226" /> level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The increases implemented in the 1997 budget, which will take effect in June 1997, bring those payments and the old age contributory and retirement pensions further over the minimum level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and will also bring the invalidity pension up to that level.</P>
    <P>By June 1997, the lowest payments will be within 5 per cent of the recommended level, while most of the payments not already at or above the recommended level will be within 2 per cent of it.  Furthermore, the Government is committed to bringing all remaining rates up to the level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare during the lifetime of the Partnership 2000 agreement.</P>
    <P>Full details of the increases in all the various social welfare payments over the past three years are provided in the following Appendix.</P>

    <P>At the time the budget was introduced in January 1997, inflation was projected to be 2.2 per cent in 1997.  Inflation since then has been very low.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree he has reached a new low when he must include secondary benefits to justify the level of increases granted in the previous three budgets?  It is the first time I have heard a Minister of any party in this House emphasis that, if one includes the secondary benefits, they represent an additional 15 per cent.  When one examines the cumulative position over those three years one readily realises the Minister needs to lean on something. Since he has mentioned that the increase for, say, widows was 1.5 per cent in 1996, in these times of great economic growth and development, with the Celtic tiger spreading largesse in the lead up to the general election, does he not agree that was very poor treatment of widows, old age pensioners and of those genuinely unemployed?</P>
      <P>The Minister has emphasised that the levels for the unemployed were maintained in 1996.  The average increase over the three years for a widow is only £2.20 and for a pensioner is less than £2.20 per week.  That is all this wonderful Rainbow Coalition has meant to widows and old age pensioners. For the long-term unemployed the average increase is only £2.17 per week.  There is no point in speaking in global figures of £588 million. The reality is that the increases are negligible. This has been borne out by various commentators and the people have been badly treated.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's thesis.  It is legitimate to point out that many people on social welfare benefit significantly from secondary benefits other than the cash received, ranging from free television licences, free telephone allowances, fuel schemes, rent supplements under SWA and free travel.  When seeking to measure the support which the taxpayer provides to pensioners, widows and various other categories this contribution is equivalent to roughly 15 per cent on top of the cash received. That is not an insignificant figure.  As regards the figures quoted by Deputy Woods, for the three budgets introduced by me on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare and the Government for the years 1995-97, inclusive, the increases were greater than in the cumulative three budgets introduced by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in its term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  I have no less an authority than Vincent Browne who gave accurate figures.  He said the sad reality is that in the social welfare area the performance of this Government does not match what was done even by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats between 1989 and 1992.  He goes on to show the increases were zero, 1.4 per cent and 1.7 per cent, and the Minister has confirmed this today.  Will the Minister agree that under the Fianna Fáil-Labour partnership in the years 1993-94 the increase over the two years &mdash; taking the total Estimate &mdash; was 10 per cent while under the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition between 1989-92, a three budget period similar to that of the rainbow coalition, the average increase was 29 per cent whereas the rainbow coalition's percentage is only 18 per cent.  The average increase for an adult dependant of a non-contributory old age pensioner, of whom there are 112,000, mainly women, was £1.17 per week per year.  That is the sad reality of what the rainbow coalition has done to old age pensioners.  Admittedly it tried to make it up before the election. The deficit is so great at this stage and even though the Minister has taken the three years together they are left in a bad way.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister embarrassed quoting these figures and attempting to justify what can only best be described as a miserly, mean and most unjust increase to the most deprived and marginalised, most of whom are destined to a life on the dole?  Coming from a Minister of his political background and a party that claims to be from the extreme left, his failure to match the overrun in public expenditure in the area of social welfare allowances is a sad reflection on the socialist agenda of this Administration. Will he accept there has been a cumulative or an aggregate 20 per cent increase in the overrun in public expenditure in the past three years?  The social welfare increase in 1995 for a number of the categories outlined was in line with inflation.  We are all aware of that.  In 1996 the increase was 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent in 1997. I described this expenditure overrun in my budget speech as a most irresponsible cost overrun across all Government Departments.  Incidentally, all Government Departments failed to account for it to the public in reply to Dáil questions I had tabled and it is unacceptable to quote a 1986 commission report at a time when the economy has money flowing into it.  The Minister should admit that his tenure of office in the Department of Social Welfare has been a dismal disaster.</P>

Will he also confirm that it was only in this year's budget, in the run up to the general election when one can get anything one requests, that something decent was done for pensioners and those on social welfare?

These were real increases to those at the lowest level.  The Minister and Government should stop trying to fool the public with statistical lies and realise that they made a blunder in leaving pensioners, widows and the long-term unemployed in the cold for two years.

The woman receives a carer's allowance. Another woman, who lives three streets away, takes care of two people, both of whom, when dressed and fed, can be left to fend for themselves in the house for a few hours until she comes back and looks after their lunch and other needs.  The significant difference in terms of the quality of life of the two carers and the persons for whom they care should be reflected in the increases.

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 37 to 47 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P> 4.&mdash;(1) A committee may not direct a person to give evidence, or produce or send a document, to it, or attend before it to give evidence, or produce a document, to it, that is not relevant to the proceedings of the committee.</P>
      <P>(2) Where a direction to which paragraph (a) relates is given to a person and the person is of the opinion that evidence or a document to which the direction relates is not relevant to the proceedings of the committee concerned and so informs the committee &mdash;</P>
      <P> (a) the committee shall either withdraw the direction or refer the question whether the evidence or document is so relevant&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  if the committee is a committee of Dáil Éireann or a subcommittee of such a committee, to the Chairman of Dáil Éireann,</P>
      <P>(ii)  if the committee is a committee of Seanad Éireann or a subcommittee of such a committee, to the Chairman of Seanad Éireann,</P>
      <P>(iii)  if the committee is a joint committee of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann or a subcommittee of such a committee, to both such Chairmen,  </P>
      <P>(b)  if the question is referred to either or both of such Chairmen, he, she or they shall decide it, and</P>
      <P>(c)  if he, she or they decides or decide or (if there is an appeal from the decision) the High Court decides that the evidence or document is not relevant to the proceedings of the committee, the committee shall withdraw the direction.  </P>
      <P>(3) Where the Chairman or Chairmen aforesaid make a decision under subsection (2), he, she or they shall cause the committee concerned and the person to whom the direction concerned was given to be notified of the determination and the person may, within 21 days of the notification, appeal against the determination to the High Court.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is in response to comments made during Committee Stage that Government amendment No. 20, which provided for an adjudication <Col N="1237" /> procedure in cases where there were disputes on whether a committee's questions fell within terms of reference, made no provision for the Seanad.  I undertook to introduce a Report Stage amendment to rectify this and the text of the amendment so provides.</P>
    <P>The parliamentary draftsman used the phrase &ldquo;not relevant to&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;outside&rdquo; with regard to a committee's terms of reference on the basis that the former is more accurate drafting term.  The basic meaning remains unchanged.  The procedure provides for the Ceann Comhairle to decide if directions are within a Dáil committee's terms of reference.  The Cathaoirleach will decide for Seanad committees and both officers for joint committees.  If questions are held to be not relevant to the proceedings of a committee, the committee shall withdraw the direction.  Witnesses will have 21 days to appeal to the High Court on the determination made under this section.</P>

      <P>A person will have 21 days in which to appeal to the High Court.  This is an extensive time limit and may hold up the deliberations of a committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>A time limit has to be included. One could argue that the figure should be 14 days or 28 days but a period of 21 days is reasonable and rational.  I suspect there is a precedent, although I am not in a position to quote it for the Deputy.</P>
      <P>We are covering some of the ground covered by Deputy McDowell this morning.  I was out of order in responding.  He referred to the relationship between the Seanad and the Dáil and what may be included in the terms of reference for Seanad and Dáil committees.  The Seanad has the same right to conduct its business through committees and to address issues within its role as a House of the Oireachtas.  Deputies will be aware of the unique role of Dáil Éireann in relation to the collective responsibility of Government.  This confers a particular status on the actions of Dáil Éireann and Dáil committees.  I would not presume &mdash; Deputy McDowell did not do this morning &mdash; that the Seanad would conduct its affairs in a manner which would cause difficulties for this House.</P>
      <P>When the legislation comes into operation, I imagine the matters that come within the remit of Seanad and Dáil committees will be made clear.  We cannot have a committee of the Seanad and of the Dáil investigating separately the same issue, compelling the same or different witnesses to attend and seeking the same or different documents. One does not find parallel operations in the case of courts of law or tribunals.  I do not envisage that it would be acceptable in this House.  The matter will be resolved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 1, after &ldquo;committee&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(&lsquo;Oireachtas Committee&rsquo;)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment to avoid any confusion, that the committee referred to in section 5 (1) is an Oireachtas committee.  This is necessary as there are references in other parts of the subsection to a Government appointed committee.</P>
      <P>In section 1 a committee is defined for the purposes of the Bill, save where the context otherwise requires, as a committee apointed by either House of the Oireachtas or jointly by both Houses of the Oireachtas, other than the Committee of Members' Interests of Dáil Éireann or the Committee of Members' Interests of Seanad Éireann or a sub-committee of such a committee. While this is adequate in most sections where the term &ldquo;committee&rdquo; occurs, there are two references in section 5 to a committee, one of which refers to an Oireachtas committee and the other to a committee appointed by the Government. While a careful reading of section 5 will show that the context conveys the appropriate meaning in each case, there may be a small risk of ambiguity. On the advice of the parliamentary draftsman, therefore, this amendment is being made to remove any risk of confusion as to the meaning of the section.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 36, as I indicated on Committee Stage and in my comments on the previous two amendments, I accept the principle that only the proceedings of properly organised Government meetings should be exempt from compellability under the Bill in deference to the Supreme Court ruling on Cabinet confidentiality.  The amendment provides that all formal Government meetings will be exempt from compellability.  The proceedings of Government appointed committees will be exempt only if the following conditions are met: membership of the committee consists of members of the Government together with one or more Ministers of State and the Attorney General; the holding of the meeting was authorised by the Government; the proceedings of the meeting are to be reported to Government, and the Secretary to the Government is to confirm in writing to the investigating committee that the last two conditions listed were met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment removes the extension of confidentiality to meetings involving civil servants. Deputies will be aware this issue was the subject of a protracted debate on Committee Stage.  We <Col N="1239" /> have not removed Ministers of State, however, from the scope of the section as would be done by amendment No. 37.  Deputies will be fully aware of the roles of Ministers of State, particularly in relation to crucial cross-Department matters, which from time to time is reflected in their involvement in Cabinet committees in their own right or as substitutes for the member of Government responsible for the Department of State to which they are assigned.  The arguments for excluding discussions held at meetings of the Government can be said to apply also to the many essential functions performed by Ministers of State concurrently as Ministers of the Government.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 37 is a repeat of Committee Stage amendment No. 28a.  As amendment No. 36 provides for the principle set out in the amendment, I ask Deputy Ahern to consider withdrawing it.  The only Government appointed committee meetings which are to remain exempt from compellability are those involving members of the Government together with one or more Ministers of State and the Attorney General.  This new definition captures the essence of the amendment. Only those meetings authorised by and reporting to the Government and certified as Government meetings by the Secretary to the Government will be exempt from compellability.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 38 seeks to define and introduce verification procedures for Government appointed committee meetings.  As I stated on Committee Stage, I can see merit in the principle as none of us would like to see a situation where informal conversations between members of the Government could be regarded as a meeting of a Government committee.  On the basis and in fulfilment of the commitment I made on Committee Stage to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage on this point, Deputies will see from amendment No. 36 that the essence of Deputy Ahern's proposals in both amendments has been provided for.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 46 is a natural consequence of amendment No. 36 and is introduced in response to comments made by Deputy Ahern on Committee Stage that, for convenience, meetings could be retrospectively deemed to have been Government appointed committee meetings for the purpose of avoiding compellability in regard to the proceedings of such meetings.  The amendment provides that meetings of people who meet the qualifying criteria of a Government appointed committee but whose meetings were not authorised by the Government will not be retrospectively deemed to have been Government appointed committee meetings and, therefore, exempt from compellability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her lengthy explanation of the amendments in her name.  This is one of the most important sections of the Bill.  When drafted, it extended the principle of Cabinet confidentiality not alone to meetings <Col N="1240" /> of one Government Minister and, say, five Ministers of State but to meetings of one Government Minister and a plethora of say, ten civil servants. I understand programme managers were not included for a particular reason.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister and the Government listened to the strong views of Opposition and Government Deputies who believe this proposal goes totally against what the Government said about the relaxation of the Cabinet confidentiality rule.  The Bill as initially drafted would have tightened up Cabinet confidentiality by extending the principle to other meetings which the framers of the Constitution never intended should be covered.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to restrict the principle of Cabinet confidentiality to meetings with a Cabinet Minister and perhaps some junior Ministers but she has not gone far enough.  She is extending the principle to committees of the House.  Most people agree that, in view of events of recent years, we should in some way relax the Cabinet confidentiality rule.  This is one of the reasons I endeavour in my amendments Nos. 37 and 38 to neuter, so to speak, the Government's proposal in section 5(1)(a) and to restrict the principle of Cabinet confidentiality to Members of the Government and the Attorney General. Even though the Government's original proposal has been watered down as a result of very strong representations, the Bill still goes too far.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has stated that the Government will introduce a Bill to relax the Cabinet confidentiality rule.  If this is the case then the proposal in this Bill goes in the opposite direction.  If the Minister's attempts to let in the light under this Bill are anything like those we will see under the Cabinet confidentiality Bill then we will be very disappointed.  The Bill dealing with Cabinet confidentiality will seek to release the 15 Members of the Government from the principle of Cabinet confidentiality in certain cases.  However, this Bill goes in the opposite direction.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment No. 46, which she tabled as a result of representations made by me and others on Committee Stage, deals with the retrospective authorising of confidentiality to a committee meeting in cases of political strife, for example, where a Minister or Minister of State of one party in a coalition Government refuses to come before a committee.  One may say that this is stretching the imagination but, as history shows, there are numerous such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not doing ourselves a favour by restricting further the ability of Oireachtas Members to inquire into issues which arise from time to time.  By restricting this ability further the Minister is setting at naught all the honeyed words uttered by the Taoiseach during the past two years about openness, transparency and accountability and all the fine words uttered by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Social Welfare when they were in Opposition.  This proposal is wrong as it will tie the hands of Deputies and will extend rather than <Col N="1241" /> restrict the rule of Cabinet confidentiality.  The Government appears to be going in two directions on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be aware of the proposals in the Cabinet confidentiality Bill which apparently will be published within the next week or so.  I do not know if Ministers of State attend discussions on such issues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government made an exception by allowing the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, to sit on the high chair at Cabinet meetings as a two-thirds Minister.  Once one gives way on this issue then one is effectively giving way on the entire issue of Cabinet confidentiality. This decision raised serious questions about whether the concept of collective responsibility would also apply to him.  I accept that the Chief Whip and Attorney General also attend Cabinet meetings but they do not have voting rights and their positions are time honoured ones. The only reason the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was allowed to attend Cabinet meetings was to make up the numbers and to keep people happy.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister has received her instructions on this issue and will not accept my amendment, but it is important to point out that this proposal is wrong and that the Government is extending, not relaxing, the rule on Cabinet confidentiality.  If it could have got away with it, it would have extended it to cover meetings between Ministers and civil servants.  This would have been wrong and I am glad it has seen the light on this point.</P>
      <P>Under the Constitution a meeting with a Minister or Minister of State is not covered by the principle of collective responsibility.  Under the Minister's proposal it will not be open to a person affected by the deliberations which arose out of a meeting with a Minister or Minister of State to raise the matter at a committee meeting.  I wager that this person will be entitled to take a case to court on the basis that his constitutional rights have been infringed by the extension of the collective responsibility rule to such meetings.  This proposal is wrong and I ask the Minister to accept my amendments.</P>

      <P>I could have written the Deputy's script as we had a protracted debate on Committee Stage and I know his views on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He conceded that I have substantially amended this section and the defination of &ldquo;Government committee&rdquo;, as it applies to this section, since the Bill was originally published on foot of representations made to me and trenchantly expressed by Deputies on all sides of the House on Committee Stage.  I am unable to go the last step with him in relation to the point made about Ministers of State.  To remove Ministers of State from the concept of a Government committee in regard to <Col N="1242" /> what we are talking about would not be recognising the reality of the role of Ministers of State, particularly in relation to crucial cross-departmental matters, which is reflected in their involvement in Cabinet committees.  Ministers of State are involved in Cabinet committees in their own right or as substitutes for members of the Government.  Given the enormous increase in the demands on Government Ministers to be here, there and yonder at the one time, Ministers of State regularly substitute for their line Minister at Government committee meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy is making that a next step, legitimately in the context of the debate, but I mentioned Government meetings and sub-committee meetings.  The role of a Minister of State has been expanded beyond recognition compared to what it was ten or 20 years ago. Ministers of State substitute or partake in their own right on Government sub-committees and at Government committee meetings on a range of issues by virtue of the role of Ministers having greatly extended on the international, European and Anglo-Irish scene generally.  As demands on Cabinet Ministers increased, the role of the Ministers of State was upgraded so they could substitute for their Minister or another Minister at Government meetings or committee meetings generally.  The arguments for excluding discussions held at meetings of the Government can be said to apply also in relation to the many essential functions performed by Ministers of State concurrently with Ministers of the Government.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to accede to the point being made.  I do not know nor am I privy to what is contained in the forthcoming legislation on Cabinet confidentiality.  Other Ministers of State may know &mdash; they may have been part of the negotiations &mdash; but I was not in that particular loop.  That does not mean the point being made is not valid.  I do not know how that legislation will define Government meetings or sub-committee meetings, but there would be lack of logic if what we were doing was not in step with what will be done in that Bill.</P>

      <P>Anyone with a rational thought process would assume they would have to be moving together.  We will know soon enough when we debate the legislation on Cabinet confidentiality. The role of a Minister of State would mean we cannot omit them from this definition of a Government committee or sub-committee, <Col N="1243" /> thereby excluding them from this compellability provision.  They must be excluded as part of a Government committee, along with others already defined in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The proceedings of Government-appointed committees will be exempt from compellability under the Bill only if the following conditions are met: membership of the committee consists of members of the Government together with one or more Ministers of State or the Attorney General; the holding of the meeting is authorised by the Government; the proceedings of the meeting are reported to Government; and the secretary of the Government is to confirm in writing to the investigating committee that the last two conditions, namely, the holding of the meeting having been authorised and the proceedings of the meeting reported to Government, were met.</P>

      <P>I do not subscribe to the principle that Ministers of State are, in effect, the Government for the purpose of Government meetings.  Under the Constitution, the Government alone is governed by the principle of collective responsibility.  If there is a move to dilute that in some way, which the Government apparently intends to do by putting it to a referendum, it is going in the opposite direction.  If we had ordered the business differently and waited until the Cabinet confidentiality Bill had been produced, we might have known where we were going on this issue.</P>

      <P>I accept that, but the Ministers may be from the one party which, in a state of political flux, might cause difficulty.  The secretary to the Government could be in difficulty in regard to whether it is a meeting of the Government.  I <Col N="1244" /> am merely trying to tease this out.  The Minister's amendment does not suggest that the secretary to the Government would be in attendance at one of these meetings.  The proceedings of the meetings have to be reported but it does not necessarily say the secretary to the Government has to be in attendance.  Perhaps the Minister of State would indicate whether that is the case.  From my reading of it, any secretary or somebody else could be in attendance but it does not have to be the secretary to the Government.  The secretary to the Government merely has to sign a document to say the meetings was authorised by the Government.  There is a difficulty in that it is a diminution of Cabinet responsibility.  It is spreading out Cabinet confidentiality over a much wider area than has ever been envisaged.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  We are extending the basic principle to include Ministers of State.  We are reflecting the reality of the role of Ministers of State in relation to Government meetings and sub-committee meetings.  I have made that quite clear.  That is as it should be because Government would not function without the role of Ministers of State.  All of the meetings deemed to be Government meetings or sub-committee meetings, and so excluded from the compellability provisions here, will have to meet the four points I have already mentioned and they will be presided over by one Cabinet Minister.  The secretary to the Government does not have to be at all Government meetings or sub-committee meetings, but meetings will have to be reported back to the Government and the secretary will have to confirm in writing to the investigating committee that that condition was met and that the meeting was originally authorised by the Government.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 14 to 18 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) if the evidence or document could, if given, sent or produced to it, reasonably be expected to prejudice a matter the subject of proceedings currently before a court in the State,&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This subsection exempts matters which are the subject of court proceedings from compellability. This amendment narrows the exemption by limiting it to matters which might prejudice court proceedings rather than matters which are merely the subject of court proceedings.  I withdrew an amendment on this point on Committee Stage in deference to comments made by Deputy O'Malley and others as to whether it is appropriate to include international courts in this provision. Therefore, references to European courts have been removed, which limits application of the subsection to courts in this State.  As Deputy Ahern's amendment No. 40 would have the same effect as amendment No. 39, there is no need for a separate amendment.</P>
      <P>Regarding amendment No. 41, my legal advice is that the words &ldquo;at issue in&rdquo; could involve some of the matters in a court case being compellable whereas others in the same court case could be exempt.  As amendment No. 39 removes the phrase &ldquo;the subject of&rdquo; from the text, replacement of that phrase by &ldquo;at issue in&rdquo; is no longer relevant and there is no need for the amendment.  For that reason I am not in a position to accept it.</P>
      <P>The subsection as amended by amendment No. 39 would require a value judgment as to whether proceedings are being prejudiced.  For this reason amendment No. 45, outlined in section 5(2), provides for an adjudication procedure which gives the High Court the power to decide the issue. This amendment also makes the form of words used in this instance consistent with those in the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>The intention of the proposal in amendment No. 42 is to reduce recourse to the <i>sub judice</i> rule by making reluctant witnesses prove that the issue under investigation has been listed for hearing in court.  As the new section 5(2) provides for an adjudication procedure to decide if investigations prejudice court proceedings, the onus is primarily on the witness to provide an opinion that the investigation is prejudicing proceedings.</P>
      <P>This proposal is also covered by amendment No. 45. Deletion of the section cannot be agreed as the <i>sub judice</i> principle cannot be ignored. However, the Government amendment restricting application of the role to cases which might be prejudiced means that the present text is consistent with the proposals made by the counsel for the sub-committee of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on this point.  The limits on exemptions imposed by the Government amendment and the adjudication procedure outlined in amendment No. 45 show that the Government has gone as far as legally possible on this issue.  As the principle of the amendment has been provided for, I cannot agree to the amendment proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5(1)(b) provides that the committee may not direct a person to give evidence on a matter the subject of proceedings currently before a court in the State, the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the European Court of Human Rights or the European Commission of Human Rights, etc.  Amendment No. 41 which proposes replacing the words &ldquo;the subject of&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;at issue in&rdquo; seeks to restrict the scope of that paragraph.  Difficulties have arisen in this area before and we changed the rules of the House to ensure that outsiders could not issue a High Court summons and stop the discussion in this House on the matter in question.  Amendment No. 41 seeks to concentrate on a subject the issue of pleadings where a person involved in proceedings that are the subject of dispute in a court case would justifiably not be able to come before a committee of the House under the compellability rules.</P>
      <P>The intent of amendment No. 40 is similar to that of amendment No. 41.  I accept what the Minister said about section 5(1)(b).  Her amendment seeks to make it less specific.  Does amendment No. 45 set out the conditions under which the provisions of section 5(1)(b) will come into operation?  I regret the need to clarify this, but we have only recently received these amendments.</P>

      <P>Where a committee does not withdraw the direction, a person can go to the High Court for a determination as to whether the issue is prejudiced as a result of a committee dealing with that matter.  That seems logical.  It was the view of most Members on Committee Stage that section 5(1)(b) was too restrictive.  The Minister has gone some way to redress that.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 42 seeks to ensure that the situation is not <i>carte blanche.</i> For example, it would be up to a person relying on the <i>sub judice</i> rule coming before a committee to prove that he or she is prejudiced and the proceedings he or she is taking are prejudiced.  I support amendment No. 39.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 21, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or to be prejudicial to the State in its relations with other States&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection 6(9) of the Committee Stage text is to be deleted by amendment No. 57.  While there were many calls for the deletion of that subsection, there was support for retention of the provision that would have exempted evidence which could be prejudicial to the State in its relations with other states from compellability.  With the deletion of subsection 6(9), that provision would also be deleted.  It has, therefore, been decided to include the provision among the categories listed in subsection 5(1) which are always exempt from compellability.  This amendment, by expanding the provision on security of the State to include evidence which could be prejudicial to the State in its relations with other states, allows for such evidence to remain exempt from compellability.</P>

    <P>Who determines what adversely affects the security of the State?  There could be conflicting opinions as to what constitutes the security of the State.  Will the Minister give an example to illustrate what she proposes?  There was a great deal of discussion on the treatment of ordinary people compared with that of civil servants, gardaí and members of the Defence Forces.

      <P>I refer to the question of who decides issues under section 5.  The machinery is provided in section 7 to determine these matters. On the question of relations with other states, there is a long established practice in the courts which existed before the independence of the State and which is assumed to have been carried on since.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs issues a certificate of the courts on any matter where our relations with other states are an issue.  I am surprised at the powers given to the Secretary to the Government in section 7 because the Minister for Foreign Affairs is the person responsible.  I accept that in matters relating to external relations the Constitution vests Executive power in the Government to avoid any friction on the committee but one person would have to be empowered to make a determination.  The correct person would be the Minister for Foreign Affairs because he or she is accountable to this House in a way the Secretary to the Government can never be.  It is inappropriate to give the certifying function to the secretary or any officer in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Minister should be given the certifying function and if a contentious issue arises from the certificate, a political issue can be raised.</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides for the exemption of certain evidence.  It states that persons who have documents in their possession or are in a position to make statements about certain matters are not compellable before a committee.  I assume the chairman would have to so rule.  Then, in certain circumstance, the Bill provides that exemptions can be declared as such by certain persons.  We will deal with that later but the question of the security of the State also arises as regards who is the determining agency.  If the Chairman's powers are removed under any subsequent provision, the determination must be made by a person with political responsibility to this House.</P>

      <P>We will deal in greater depth with these points under section 7 but in terms of relations with other states and the issue of compellability, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be asked for an opinion and the Department's view will be taken.  The final decision will be made by the Secretary to the Government to ensure a non-political decision is taken on the <Col N="1253" /> issue.  The same applies to State security matters. The relevant Department, such as the Departments of Justice or Defence, will be consulted but, at the end of the day, the Secretary to the Government will make the call on such matters also.</P>

      <P>Does the Secretary to the Government take any advice from members of the security forces in the State?  How does he or she arrive at a determination?  Where are regulations laid down other than in section 7 of this Bill?  Is there a precedent in other legislation in regard to how the security of the State is determined?</P>
      <P>Section 7(2)(d) provides that where such a request is made the Secretary may, on application to him, state that the evidence relates to an issue in this paragraph but the Taoiseach may, in the public interest, refuse to give such a declaration. In that instance I would have thought the Taoiseach could affirmatively and positively make a political decision as to whether the public interest so determines.  I am not trying to hamstring the Taoiseach or the acquisition of evidence. However, if a determination of the Secretary to the Government may be overidden by a political person, that causes difficulties.</P>

      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 22 to 27.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to delete a subsection.  I cannot remember why I wanted to do this because I can see why evidence gathered for the prevention or detection of offences should not be brought forward.  If one considers the timespan, a committee of the House may be hamstrung if an investigation has not been concluded by the Garda Síochána and no final determination has been made.  Might it be necessary to revisit this in the Seanad to take up this point?  Most Deputies would accept that garda investigations should not be discussed by a committee until they are finalised.  However, issues such as the Brendan Smyth affair have not been finally determined to this day and a committee of the House might be prevented from investigating related matters, if one was overly technical.  That may have been why I put down this amendment some time ago.</P>

      <P>This subsection currently exempts certain evidence from compellability.  It is designed, <i>inter alia</i>, to protect confidential Garda sources.  The form of words now used is consistent with the Freedom of Information Act.  To be fair to the Deputy, when he tabled the amendment that legislation might not have been available to him.  As the amendment would remove protection from confidential Garda sources I am not in a position to agree to it.  As with the timespan question, the ultimate arbiter as to whether one could reasonably expect that something would prejudice or impair the prevention, detection or investigation of offences, etc., in terms of compellability of witnesses or documents, would be the Secretary to the Government.  If there was an undue delay he would make the final decision.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> (b)  the objection to giving such evidence or producing such document is reasonably based upon the preservation of anonymity assured by him to the person the source of such information.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a resubmission of an amendment I moved on Committee Stage, on which we had some considerable discussion.  It would allow journalistic privilege to a journalist coming before a committee. It is not included in the Bill as drafted.  It proposes that a committee may not direct a journalist to give evidence or produce any document if he satisfies the committee that such information was obtained by him or her in the course of his or her occupation as a journalist and that the objection to giving such information or producing such a document is reasonably based on the preservation of anonymity assured by him or her to the person who was the source of such information.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable amendment which gives committees the power they would need.  Issues will arise from time to time which had not been investigated properly by the arms of the State because of legal constraints but may have been investigated by journalists who were of a view that they could not disclose their sources.  I was surprised the Government was not able to accede to the request and allow the subsection to be included.  I was also surprised that it did not come forward with its own amendment on Report Stage &mdash; perhaps the Minister could indicate if it has one?</P>

      <P>That is all very well but the Bill is going backward rather than forward.  This Bill endeavours to give committees ample power but they will not have that power if a committee attempts to force journalists to disclose a source, although they will not.  The legal counsel for our committee suggested that ultimately the courts would widen the scope and allow journalists some element of journalistic privilege.  That may ultimately be the case but we have the opportunity to effect change now and we should take it.  This situation relates to the case of Goodwin <i>v.</i> the UK.  Mr. William Goodwin, a journalist, was threatened with imprisonment in 1989 for refusing to disclose the identity of a source who provided him with information relating to a story on Tetra Business Systems, a computer software company.  Mr. Goodwin was a graduate trainee on his first job, examining the financial restructuring of the Tetra firm.  He was fined £5,000 for contempt of court and, after a number of successful appeals, he won at the European Court.  The <Col N="1257" /> NUJ provided the funds to take his case to that court and in September 1993 it found in his favour. The court ruled that the order to reveal his source constituted a breach of his right of freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  If we proceed on this basis with the Bill and do not allow journalists this privilege before our committees, we could be in breach of that Article.</P>
      <P>The Goodwin case was again referred to the European Court in April 1995, when the British Government declined to reach a settlement.  This case was a very important one in the area of journalistic privilege.  Section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act in England states that no court may require to disclose, nor is any person guilty of contempt of court for refusing to disclose, the source of information contained in a publication for which he is responsible, unless it is established to the satisfaction of the court that it is necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime.</P>
      <P>The Government has spoken honeyed words about attempting to redress cases where journalists are dragged before courts from time to time. We have had umpteen instances since the Kevin O'Kelly issue.  Recently, a reporter for <i>The Star</i> was lucky to get away without having to disclose his source.  It would be detrimental to the power of our committees and the status of the House if a journalist with whom Members might be friendly on a day to day basis was pressurised at a committee in an attempt to force disclosure of information.  Such a journalist might then go to the High Court for a determination as to whether he or she needs to disclose the source and then we are in the area of contempt of court.</P>
      <P>We must accept that journalists regard it as a right of theirs not to disclose sources.  In France, a journalist who appears as a witness in a civil or criminal case concerning information gathered in the course of journalistic activities has an absolute right not to disclose his or her source.  In Austria, journalists have a right to refuse to answer questions referring to an author, contributor or source of information.  In Germany, under the <i>lander</i> laws, journalists are protected from disclosing their sources even when they are suspected of involvement in a criminal offence.  In the Netherlands, the courts have recently shifted towards offering journalists the right to protect their sources and in Norway, because of case precedents, it is extremely unlikely that a court would order the disclosure of sources.  In Sweden, a journalist who reveals his or her source without the consent of the source may be subjected to criminal prosecution if the source demands and the First Amendment of the US Constitution gives US journalists and their sources significantly greater rights to protect the identity of their sources than British law does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going against the flow in this matter. This Government has spoken of openness, transparency and accountability, but if we insist that a journalist discloses a source, the committees will <Col N="1258" /> fall into disrepute.  Article 10 says that everyone has the right to free expression.  This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information without interference by public authorities and regardless of frontiers.  The Article goes on to say that the exercise of these functions may be subject to certain formalities, conditions and restrictions necessary in a democratic society in the interests of justice or national security or to prevent disorder or crime.</P>
    <P>That would not apply to a journalist coming before a committee of this House.  By ruling in favour of William Goodwin, the European Court established in principle that the right of journalists to protect the identity of sources is a fundamental part of the right to freedom of speech, and that right is as defined in the convention I have read from.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State probably wants to accede to our request, but forces greater than her are working here, be they the permanent Government or, as I suspect, the non-permanent Government. It is their view that this should not be allowed.  In 1983, <i>The Guardian</i> was ordered to disclose confidential documents in the interests of national security and the British courts have tended to be very restrictive in this regard, going against the spirit of Article 10.  The various bodies interested in this matter, such as the National Newspapers of Ireland, made submissions to the Constitutional Review Committee.  They made the point that this should be enshrined in our Constitution.  The review group recommended that Article 46º1º1 should be replaced with an Article modelled on Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, of which Ireland is a signatory.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister of State is not accepting my amendment, given that we have signed this convention.  The Minister cited the Constitutional Review Group saying that the Constitution should be changed in order to mirror Article 10.  Adoption of Article 10 would allow journalists to do what they have to do normally and allow them to come before committees without being obliged to reveal their sources. That would be advantageous to the investigative system of our committees.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Article 10 are already fully understood by Members of the Oireachtas, lawyers and citizens.  Its inclusion in our Constitution would be following the trend of our European as opposed to our British neighbours.  The vast majority of European countries have provided for journalistic privilege.</P>
    <P>In the 1981 British Steel Corporation <i>v.</i> Granada Television case in the United Kingdom Lord Salmon said:</P>
    <P>The freedom of the press depends on the immunity from disclosing their sources.  Were it to disappear so would the source from which its information is obtained.  The public would be deprived of much of the information to which the public of a free nation is entitled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> I accept that there are drawbacks in relation to journalistic privilege, that there may be some unscrupulous journalists, but our general experience of cases already brought before the courts in regard to journalistic privilege has been that the vast majority of our people have accepted that the journalistic profession has behaved in an honourable manner in regard to disclosure of its sources.</P>
    <P>This general issue is a very important one and has been the subject of discussion in committee. I recommend that the Minister accept my amendment. I know it has the agreement of the Progressive Democrats and that some members of the different parties in Government are also of the view that we should enshrine this provision in legislation.  It ill behoves this Government, which espoused openness, transparency and accountability, not to accede to this request.  If a journalist refused to disclose his or her source of information or, worse still, if a journalist refused to appear before a committee, he or she would have to be directed to give evidence.  How would the Minister propose to address circumstances in which a journalist found himself or herself in that position?  The reality is that committees would divide on political lines as between Government and Opposition and we could be confronted by an extreme difficulty <i>vis-à-vis</i> relationships between Government and Opposition and the media.</P>
    <P>I exhort the Minister to think again.  I suppose I will be informed that the Government has refused to accede to the request to allow some journalistic privilege before committees of this House.  If that is the case, shame on this Government that came into office on the basis that it would reform the institutions of State to render them more relevant to the electorate.  It would be a disgraceful move to prevent journalistic privilege being included in this Bill.  I hope journalists are taking note of the fact that this Government is not acceding to this request, thus demonstrating for ever more the fallacy that it is open, transparent and accountable.</P>
    <P>We are not doing ourselves any favour if we allow circumstances to arise in which we may find ourselves in weekly confrontation with journalists at committees on whether they should be forced to reveal their sources.  Perhaps the Minister will explain why the Government is not accepting this amendment, why it is insisting that any journalist who comes before this committee will be obliged to reveal his or her sources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing the section overall. The intention of this amendment is to extend the absolute privilege of protection of sources to journalists as well as to Members of the Oireachtas.  As the proposal would put journalists on a par with elected Members of the Oireachtas and afford them a higher level of protection than that of a High Court witness, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>The position is being examined by the Department of Justice in the light of a report of the Law Reform Commission and a European Court case. Any consideration that we might be in violation of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights will result in an adjustment of this Bill in line with any arrangements introduced for the courts, but we cannot move ahead of the courts on this issue.</P>
      <P>The important point is to achieve a balance.  A journalist may be granted exactly the same immunity and privilege as any other citizen; we are not offering anything less to journalists. However, we do not propose to go beyond the privileges and immunities journalists have as witnesses in a court.  I fully acknowledge the important role of journalists in preserving and defending political, civil and human rights. However, this Bill is not the right vehicle within which to adjust the legislative protection given to journalists with respect to confidentiality of their sources.  That is for another Bill and another day and I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>If we were to concede this point to journalists ahead of adjustment of legislative provisions for the courts, a question might be posed about other professionals and their right to protect sources.  I have in mind people such as teachers, social workers and others who may know quite a lot about child abuse and problems within families but who have no privilege in this area.  They may be privy to a lot of local happenings and issues, but cannot protect their sources.  This question might be extended to the media generally, apart from journalists specifically.  If and when legislation is changed elsewhere, this Bill will be amended to bring it into line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that we should wait for the Department of Justice to move on this subject.  That Department has sufficient reports on the matter, including the report of the Commission on the Review of the Constitution and sufficient cases and precedents within Europe to make it quite feasible for someone in that Department, if he or she so wished, to propose an amendment of this or any other Bill to take care of this issue.</P>
      <P>Neither do I accept that teachers and other professionals are on a par with journalists. Journalists play a particular role in society which may sometimes be taken for granted.  Recent history has shown that members of the journalistic profession have entered into areas where the arm of the State would never have reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> We have only to look at the hepatitis C scandal, much of which was made known by investigative journalists.  Recent history is littered with examples where, were it not for journalists, issues would not have come to the fore.  There is a heavy onus on them not to be scurrilous but even-handed in their reporting.  The Bill gives Members of the Oireachtas those privileges and we have an opportunity to give journalists the same facilities because of their special investigative role.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons we are giving the committees these powers of compellability balanced with privilege is that, over the years, many Members have said we do not have the power, as an Oireachtas, to fully investigate issues.  Apart from giving ourselves increased compellability powers <Col N="1262" /> what better way to protect that profession which does most in regard to investigating issues which are of concern to those of us on those side who would wish this House to be more than just a Legislature which, according to the Constitution, has a role in keeping tabs on the Executive?  That is one of the main reasons I proposed this amendment.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's refusal to accept my amendment.  It runs counter to what the Government has said in regard to letting in the light and being open and transparent.  Its refusal to accept this amendment will make journalists much more circumspect in the way in which they will deal with committees of the House when they come before them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;(1)  No action or proceeding whatsoever shall lie against either House of the Oireachtas or any member thereof, any committee or any member thereof, or any officer, servant or agent of either House of the Oireachtas or of any committee arising from, or in connection with, the broadcasting, or rebroadcasting by any person whatsoever of the proceedings of either House or of a committee referred to in section 2, or any portion of such proceedings.</P>
      <P>(2)  <i>Subsection (1)</i> shall have effect notwithstanding that the broadcasting, or rebroadcasting, concern was authorised by, or on behalf of, the Houses of the Oireachtas or either of them or by a committee whether in consideration of the payment of a fee or otherwise.</P>
      <P>(3)  In this section&mdash;&ldquo;broadcasting&rdquo; means the transmission, relaying or distributing of communication, sounds, signals, visual images or signals by means of any form of wireless, telegraphy (including satellite) or by means of wire or cable relay whether or not such communication, sounds, signs, visual images or signals are encoded and whether or not such communications, sounds, signs, visual images or signals are intended for reception by the general public;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Wireless telegraphy&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 2 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926 (as substituted by section 2 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926) (as substituted by section 2(1)(b) of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act 1988).&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>This amendment has been drafted on behalf of the Broadcasting Control Committee and has been the subject of considerable discussion by the committee.  It deals with the possibility of Members or officials of the Houses of the Oireachtas being sued for defamation in respect of defamatory utterances made by witnesses before committees.</P>
      <P>The amendment deals with two contexts.  The first is in respect of the in-house transmission of the signal from the Houses and, in this instance, the committees.  The second is in respect of the provision of footage from committee meetings by the Broadcasting Control Committee to RTE or other stations.</P>
      <P>Article 15.12 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>All official reports and publications of the Oireachtas or of either House thereof and utterances made in either House wherever published shall be privileged. </P>
      <P>Article 15.13 states:</P>
      <P>The members of each House of the Oireachtas ... shall not, in respect of any utterance in either House, be amenable to any court or any authority other than the House itself.</P>
      <P>This, and the advent of broadcasting technology for the Oireachtas, present legal problems to Members and the institutions of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There would be a difficulty if a person took proceedings against a Member in relation to defamatory utterances.</P>
      <P>My amendment is based on the recommendation of the senior counsel attached to the committee on broadcasting.  A number of Bills, which tried to address the issue of privilege over the years, glossed over this aspect.  Given the advent of the televising of Dáil proceedings, the Bill provides an opportunity to ensure that Deputies, the Houses of the Oireachtas and officials of the Houses are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attempted to raise this issue in the context of the case involving Deputy Foley in amendment No. 33.  I wanted the Minister to provide full indemnity to any Member of either House of the Oireachtas while acting in their position as chairman of a committee in respect of any damages or awards made against them as a result of items which arose in the discharge of their duty. However, the amendment was ruled out of order as it involved a potential charge on the Exchequer.  A solution would have been if the Minister of State had acceded to this request on <Col N="1265" /> Committee Stage and introduced a Report Stage amendment.</P>
    <P>The ludicrous position is that Deputy Foley, who is the chairman of a committee, is being sued in a personal capacity by an outside person as a result of issues which arose during the deliberations of a committee.  Deputy Foley as the chairman of the committee was asked by officials to respond by letter to an article published in a newspaper.  He did so on the advice of the officials.  They drafted the document which he signed and the letter was published in the newspaper. However, Deputy Foley is being sued in a personal capacity for defamation by the person implicated in the letter.  Despite our best efforts to secure indemnity from the permanent government with regard to his exposure in that respect, the Deputy is in the middle of a full blown High Court action for defamation which he must defend.  If the party is successful, he will have to pay damages and all the costs himself.  No Deputy should be exposed in that way.</P>
    <P>This matter is related to broadcasting in terms of protecting ourselves during deliberations of committees.  I accept Deputies have absolute privilege with regard to utterances at committee meetings or in the House.  However, this complex issue needs to be addressed.  As I said on Second and Committee Stages, the Bill provides an opportunity to address these aspects.  That opportunity still exists, but for some unknown reason the transient Government &mdash; which hopefully will be gone soon &mdash; or the permanent government is objecting to moves in this direction which would protect Members of the House.  The Minister of State should accept the amendment, which was recommended by the broadcasting committee and drafted by the senior counsel attached to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to accept the amendment on two grounds.  First, the matters dealt with by the amendment have a wider application.  It provides a particular definition of broadcasting and the implications of the provisions in the amendment extend beyond the matters specifically addressed in the Bill.  These provisions do not belong in this Bill, which is concerned with the power of committees of Houses of the Oireachtas acting within their terms of reference to compel witnesses and provide privilege and immunity and not directly with the implications of the broadcasting of proceedings of those committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I am advised that broadcasting of committee proceedings is sufficiently covered under Article 15 of the Constitution and existing legislation, the Procedure and Privileges Act, 1976.  I am not sure there is any need to prevent an action being taken against the Houses of the Oireachtas. Only one such action has been taken.  That was at the start of this Dáil and the High Court judge ruled that the Houses could not be sued.  I am concerned that the exemption proposed in the amendment in relation to a specific aspect of Oireachtas activities could be cited in the future <Col N="1266" /> to overturn that High Court ruling.  It might have the opposite effect to what Deputy Ahern seeks to achieve.</P>
    <P>Members are protected in respect of their utterances and Deputy Ahern's point in relation to indemnity of committee members and chairmen is well made.  More protracted debate on this aspect was not possible earlier because the relevant amendment was technically out of order. This issue arises from specific difficulties encountered by Deputy Foley, the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, as a result of the publication of an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on an issue which arose before the committee.  Deputy Foley's publication was retrospectively approved by the committee.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to deal with the circumstances or merits of a particular case on which litigation may be pending as it would be extremely unwise of me to do so, I cannot conceive of provisions in the Bill which would in effect put a committee in a position to define, even retrospectively, whether an action by a member fell within the definition of his or her duties.  This could have serious implications for the rights of other persons outside the House, particularly the right to their good name which the State is bound by the Constitution to vindicate. To provide for an indemnity by the Minister for committee members against any action taken against them in the discharge of their duties as committee members, including an order for costs, would not be appropriate.  As Members currently have absolute privilege in respect of utterances made in the Oireachtas or in committees, I suggest there is no need to specifically indemnify them against action taken against them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Deputy Ahern's point in relation to Deputy Foley.  None of us would wish a colleague of whatever political persuasion to find themselves inadvertently in the position in which Deputy Foley finds himself. However, we cannot legislate to allow retrospective validation of what is said before committees. That would have serious implications for the right of persons outside the House to their good name, which the State is bound by the Constitution to vindicate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister of State's point that it might not be wise to personify the Houses of the Oireachtas in an amendment because it might constitute them as a defendant and they are not yet recognised as such.  However, before the Bill goes to the other House, will the Minister of State consider this issue?  The issue of broadcasting could be easily addressed by extending the current constitutional provision and expressly stating that it also applies to broadcasting.</P>

      <P>It would be possible to extend the current constitutional protection to broadcasting. There is no objection to doing that by statute and it might be a preferable way of drafting the section to overcome the objection raised by the Minister of State about the personification of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That would allow the matter to be addressed.  While I accept it does not strictly arise under the Bill, it would be a desirable change.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of committees and witnesses appearing before committees, the proceedings of which are broadcast, are sometimes put on the spot and have to give an immediate answer.  They may find themselves exposed as a consequence.  The Chief Whips and members of the broadcasting committee recently visited another parliament to investigate how it deals with this matter.  As the definition of broadcasting has been broadened to include advances such as the Internet, we find we are being exposed more and more.  I do not accept, therefore, that the amendment is not necessary or that it would impose restrictions, rather it would protect witnesses appearing before committees.</P>
      <P>It may be highly unlikely that anyone would succeed in an action but we did not envisage the scenario in which Deputy Denis Foley was involved.  He has had to bear the consequences. The Department of Finance is, in effect, stating that the amendment would allow <i>carte blanche</i> but I do not accept this.  In Deputy Foley's case, where there was retrospective acceptance and acknowledgment by all members of the committee that what he did was right in the circumstances, he still found himself exposed.</P>
      <P>All these issues are interwined.  There is now a quicker reaction to the way we do our business in the House.  As a consequence, we need protection. It may well be the case that the broadcasting committee will have to make recommendations to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which, in turn, will have to make recommendations to a future Government which will have to introduce legislation to deal with the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 45 and 46 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  is of opinion that, by virtue of section 11<i>(1)</i>, he or she is entitled to disobey the direction,&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This section provides for a witness to inform a committee, either orally or in writing, that his or her opinion is that the committee's direction relates to a category of information exempt from compellability by virtue of High Court privilege. In providing this amendment, the Government has shown that it was persuaded by the arguments made on Committee Stage that the High Court should be the sole determinant on the issue of whether questions relate to High Court privilege and that there should be no distinction between public service and non-public service witnesses.</P>
      <P>The amendment is the mechanism which the Government has decided upon to remove the categories listed in section 6(2)(9) of the text debated on Committee Stage.  These categories provided exemption from compellability in particular circumstances.  The amendment means that witnesses will be obliged to answer questions, unless they relate to a category covered by High Court privilege.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 50, 53 and 55 provide that the High Court will decide whether questions are covered by that court's privilege.  The combination of these amendments means that the separate adjudication procedures for public service and non-public service witnesses set out in the previous text have been removed.  Therefore, provisions on the role of the Public Offices Commission and provision of declarations by the Taoiseach in sections 6 and 7, respectively, have been removed in amendments Nos. 57, 60, 61 and 64.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 49a, as amendment No. 57 deletes section 6(3), as amended on Committee Stage, there is no longer any need to mention that subsection in section 6(2).  The amendment deletes the reference to section 6(3) from section 6(2).  It is a drafting amendment and does not alter the meaning of the subsection.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 50, 53 and 55 remove the roles of the Taoiseach and the Public Offices Commission in what was a separate adjudication procedure for public service witnesses.  As there will no longer be such a procedure, the amendments provide for the principle of amendments Nos. 51, 52, 54 and 56.  I appreciate fully the concerns of Opposition Deputies which gave rise to their amendments.  I am happy to be in a position to meet their concerns.  I hope they will agree that, as a consequence of the amendments in my name, their proposals are no longer necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments provide for a committee to apply to the High Court for a decision as to whether questions asked of a witness under direction relate to High Court privilege.  If the High <Col N="1269" /> Court decides that the questions do so relate, the committee shall withdraw the direction.  If not, the witness will be obliged to answer the questions. As the High Court alone is to determine this issue, the roles set out in the earlier text for the Public Offices Commission and the Taoiseach are no longer relevant and have been deleted.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 51 would remove the distinction between public service and non-public service witnesses in informing committees that their opinion is they are exempt from following certain directions given by the committee.  As amendment No. 50 provides for the High Court only to adjudicate in cases of dispute, the principle of the amendment is met.  There is no need, therefore, for a separate amendment on this point.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 52 would remove the option for a public service witness to furnish a committee with a declaration from the Taoiseach that questions asked are to be exempt from compellability. Amendment No. 50 covers this point also as it removes from the text references to the Taoiseach's powers to make declarations in this area. There is no need, therefore, for a separate amendment on this point.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 54 would remove the provision that witnesses who seek declarations from the Taoiseach have 30 days to do so.  As it is almost identical in wording to amendment No. 53, the principle is covered.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 56 would remove the requirement in section 6(2)(d) for a committee to withdraw a direction where a witness furnishes a declaration from the Taoiseach that the information sought is exempt from compellability.  As amendment No. 55 deletes that subsection entirely, there is no need for a separate amendment on this point.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 57 follows from amendments Nos. 50, 53 and 55 which give the High Court sole power of adjudication as to whether a witness is entitled to disobey a direction.  It effectively deletes the text of section 6 as debated on Committee Stage, apart from subsections (1) and (2).</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 58 would provide that the categories of information which a witness can refuse to provide, that is, private life, information given in confidence, information prejudicial to business of a third party and information prejudicial to relations with another state, would be substituted by a single category of information, that is, information which would not have to be disclosed in the High Court.</P>
    <P>As Government amendment No. 49 provides that a witness may refuse to obey a direction if it relates to categories of information covered by High Court privilege the thrust of this amendment is met and there is no longer any need for a separate amendment on this point.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 59 in the names of Deputies Ahern and McDowell would allow information given in confidence to be disclosed unless it came within the categories of information which would be privileged in High Court proceedings.  As <Col N="1270" /> Government amendment No. 49 allows witnesses the defence of High Court privilege in relation to directions from committees the thrust of this amendment is met and there is no longer any need for a separate amendment on this point.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 60 deletes section 6(11) of the earlier text which provided that the terms of the section would not apply to directions which witnesses would be entitled to disobey on the grounds that they relate to matters covered by High Court privilege.  The thrust of this subsection is contained in section 6(1) as amended by Government amendment No. 49.  The amendment also deletes section 6(12) of the earlier text which deals with the Public Offices Commission. As the role of the commission has been removed by this amendment and by Government amendment No. 57 there is no longer any need to provide for it.  In other words, this amendment is consequential on the earlier amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister has taken considerable steps to amend section 6 which caused extreme difficulties because of the proposed restrictions.  Section 6(9) basically provided that information given to, or received by, a person in confidence, information relating to a business or profession, information relating to the family life or private affairs of a person and information whose disclosure would be prejudicial to the State could not be inquired into.  It was generally accepted that this section was too restrictive and that ultimately such matters should be determined by the High Court.</P>
      <P>There may be no legislation under which the High Court can be directed to make a determination and it may be entering uncharted waters. Nevertheless this is better than setting out the information which is exempted, only to find later that we have omitted certain information or included other information which may cause a difficulty.  I accept the reasons put forward by the Minister for these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister has met the objectives of Deputies Ahern and McDowell but I see a difficulty in simply saying that it is as if this matter is before the High Court. A parliamentary committee is not the High Court, which developed its law and jurisprudence on the question of privilege on the basis of adjudicating in a private dispute between, say, two citizens or a company and a citizen.  What the High Court has said is that one can claim privilege and that, while there is a public interest in the production to it of all relevant information, if one can establish a competing public privilege in the non-disclosure of the evidence which would prevail over it then one has a privilege.  However, we are now saying to the High Court that in relation to a parliamentary committee it must make a determination on the public interests involved.  A parliamentary investigation into a matter of public interest is different from a private dispute in the High Court.  One assumes <Col N="1271" /> there is a public interest in having all relevant material put before the committee and the High Court will have to determine what competing public interest should prevail against that.</P>
      <P>In the Bill as drafted very widely drawn interests were covered.  We objected to these and the Minister has, in effect, left it to the High Court to decide in appropriate cases what the competing public interest is without any guidance from the Legislature.  Perhaps there should be some guidance, and I ask the Minister to reflect on this.  I do not want to be taken to disagree with the points made by Deputies Ahern and McDowell on Committee Stage that the section was too widely drawn but I query whether the High Court should be left to decide the matter without any guidance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We all want to ensure that we enact good legislation.  If I read the section correctly, a person directed by a committee to give evidence who decides, by virtue of section 11, that he is entitled to disobey that direction must inform the committee which must, if necessary, ask the High Court to make a determination on the matter.  Section 11(1) states that a person whose evidence has been, is being or is to be given before a committee shall be entitled to the same privileges and immunities as if he was a witness before the High Court.  In other words, a person who believes he is not being given High Court &ldquo;privilege&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When the matter goes to the High Court the committee shall adjourn the proceedings until such time as the High Court makes a determination.  I am concerned that we could end up going around the mulberry bush a few times before we finally get a decision.  The High Court will probably deal expeditiously with urgent cases but I foresee a problem.  Maybe there is no other way of getting around the matter.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Farm Incomes: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Joe Walsh on Tuesday, 15 April, 1997:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann notes the sharp decline in the incomes of farm families resulting from the <Col N="1273" /> collapse of commodity prices, including cattle, beef and milk prices paid to farmers; calls upon the Government to cease in its hitherto unsympathetic approach to our farming industry; further calls on the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to pursue at a political level their responsibilities in relation to important agricultural issues, including export refunds and the reopening of lost third country markets; and also calls on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to fulfil his promise of 4th February to farmers to secure matching national compensation for revaluations of the green pound. </P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann recognises the income difficulties arising for beef and dairy producers as a result of the reductions in export refunds and the recent revaluations of the Irish Agricultural conversion rate and changed circumstances in export markets and approves the action taken by the Government to maintain access for Irish cattle and beef exports to all markets and endorses the approach adopted by the Government in its efforts to alleviate these income difficulties.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the crisis in cattle prices and the 1 per cent drop in prices on 1 April, which has been damaging in a number of ways.  The factories set the prices.  They were assured of supplies over the next few weeks because from yesterday there has been a £15 drop in slaughter premiums.  They rail-roaded producers into continuing to sell cattle.  In addition to the 6p per pound decrease there has been another 3p per pound drop today, making a total decrease of 9p per pound, with some plants now paying as low as 78p per pound, the lowest price for cattle in 20 years.</P>
      <P>This crisis is affecting farmers in that, for many years, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry made efforts to do away with the valleys and peaks and get a continuity of supply.  In future people may not have that supply during the winter months because there is no confidence in cattle production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put some questions to the Minister. Did he consider the proposals put to him last week to retain the full slaughter premium to 1 May?  That would have eradicated part of the <Col N="1274" /> problem to which I referred.  It would reduce the rush of farmers to dispose of cattle to avail of the full slaughter premium.  Did the Minister have any meetings with the slaughtering plants since the drop in prices?  It is the Minister's job to do that.  What is the Minister's view of meat slaughtering plants paying a flat rate for beef which, in the long-term, will affect the carcase formation because quality beef will not be reflected in the price paid?  That is a serious question for the Department which should be working hard to pay farmers a flat rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Leonard for sharing his limited time with me.  There is a serious crisis of confidence in Irish farming, clearly spelled out here last night by our party spokesperson and my colleagues, which is not being addressed by the Government.  The BSE crisis was handled badly, both by the Government and at EU level.  The difficulties facing farmers have been made worse by currency fluctuations, and more export refund cuts are on the way.  Our beef prices are well below European levels and the milk prices are soft.  Sheep quotas are not being fully taken up.  The number of people in farming continues to fall rapidly year after year. There is a question mark over the future viability of the smaller family farms, particularly in the more disadvantaged areas.  This has implications both for rural life and the environment.  Last night, my colleagues explained in great detail the way this crisis is affecting rural communities, the confidence of Irish agriculture and those people who work extremely hard to make a just living from it as best they can.</P>
      <P>At all times agriculture needs an experienced political hand and a Government that is prepared to act with energy and maintain farm incomes. On many occasions in the past, Fianna Fáil in Government adopted a vigorous, hands-on approach to counter threats to the livelihoods of farmers and of rural communities.  Fine Gael has once again failed the farming community.  The Government as a whole, which is seeking re-election, has failed farmers.  It should be noted that since 1981, when Fine Gael came into Government with Labour, farm incomes have fallen. Over the period from 1982 to 1987, under the Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government, which provides a real index of social misery, farm incomes fell in real terms by 12 per cent.  Between 1987 and 1994, under Fianna Fáil, they rose by 36 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Central Bank, as independent a source as one can get to quote in this House, farm incomes this year will, in nominal terms, be slightly below what they were in 1994.  In real terms that is a drop of approximately 7 per cent. While the rest of society has moved ahead by even more than that amount, we must be clear about one matter.  Were it not for the Ray MacSharry CAP reform payments coming to their peak, negotiated by Deputy Joe Walsh as Minister, farmers' incomes would be far worse based <Col N="1275" /> on the independent figures from the Central Bank.  In many cases, direct payments now amount to 30 per cent or 40 per cent of farm incomes.</P>
    <P>We have a fair weather Minister who retreats to his constituency when serious negotiations are necessary and gets down on his knees to the EU Agriculture Commissioner.  As the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> so eloquently put it, the Minister has lost his way in Brussels.  Not only is he weak in negotiation, he has no support from his colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's notion that he can instruct traditional Fine Gael farmers to transfer their votes to parties like Labour and Democratic Left, who are hostile to the farming community, shows a laughable naivety.  Not many years ago, a Democratic Left Member stated in this House that direct payments such as headage and set aside disproportionately benefited large farmers, and that this would continue to be the case unless the Common Agricultural Policy was subjected to a root and branch overhaul.  I was involved in the negotiations on those payments in 1993 with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and we worked extremely hard to secure them.  Farmers voting for their political enemies who make these kind of promises is akin to turkeys voting for Christmas, to quote a former Deputy of this House.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party Leader, Deputy Spring, did not have a single word to say about the problems facing the farming community or rural Ireland at his party conference.  He had nothing to say to farmers in his own constituency of North Kerry. It is no wonder a Kerry delegate complained that the Labour Party has nothing to say about rural Ireland.  Fine Gael does not have any policies of its own and the Labour Party has nothing to say about agriculture.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left never misses an opportunity to play class politics and bad mouth those who work on the land because of its ideological hatred of those who own property, even if it is only 30 acres of poor land.  Democratic Left never misses an opportunity to take a swipe at the Common Agricultural Policy which it regards as money down the drain.  Listening to Democratic Left Members, one would think the farming community consisted mainly of a few large farmers who own hundreds, if not thousands, of acres of land.</P>
    <P>There is hardly ever a word of sympathy for the average farm family that faces a tough and often uphill working life and never any solutions put forward to meet its needs.  There is hardly ever a word about rural poverty, although every Deputy is well aware that there are parts of rural Ireland where there is genuine poverty.  If farming were such a cushy number, as some members of Democratic Left seem to think, why have the numbers in farming continued to fall?  If Democratic Left wants to create a country in which rural Ireland can go to hell, I hope it gets little <Col N="1276" /> support.  Why should the rural community vote back into Government an anti-farming coalition in which a Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry operates on sufferance as far as his Labour and Democratic Left colleagues are concerned and who, when special measures are needed, will not be able to persuade his colleagues to make that extra effort?  It is obvious that a farm family should vote for parties that support the farming community, that understand the importance of the industry.</P>
    <P>A Fianna Fáil-led Government will do a better job, be more experienced and understanding and far tougher in negotiations.  As leader of such a Government, I will give the highest priority to the reopening of third country markets which are vital to healthy competition.  In Government, I will also look sympathetically at how resources can be made available with EU approval to maintain farm incomes to the maximum extent, particularly in times of difficulty.</P>

      <P>I would be the first to admit that winter fatteners are going through a nightmare for the second year in succession.  These farmers are the innocent pawns in a strategy that was brokered in the last GATT agreement and the MacSharry proposals on the restructuring of the CAP.  This will come back to Fianna Fáil's door because farmers know exactly who outlined the football pitch.  Everybody knows the constraints within which we are dealing.  Fianna Fáil will know that too well very shortly.</P>

      <P>The revaluation of the currency is causing havoc for Irish farmers, but it is torturing the winter beef fatteners in a dramatic way.  The devaluation of 9.5 per cent makes a difference of 6p or 7p per pound at the factory.  The price that winter fatteners could get at the factory went automatically from 86p to 80p.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The meat processors are a disgrace.  Everybody understood that there would be a price reduction.  There had to be if there was to be a 9.5 per cent revaluation, but when the meat processors got the chance two weeks ago, in due haste and in concert, they dropped their prices.  The meat processors are taking at least 3p <Col N="1277" /> a pound out of the pocket of the winter fatteners. If that were paid things would not be so bad, despite what is happening.  If the intervention price for steers drops, that has nothing to do with heifers, but the price of heifers dropped at the same time as the price for steers.  It will take something to square that circle.  There is only one time-honoured way to beat the factories, and that is to have a better live trade.  I am delighted the Minister will be travelling to Egypt in a couple of weeks to do the best he can to open that trade.</P>

      <P>During the past 13 months we have been subjected to the greatest upheaval in the food industry ever seen here because of BSE.  People who did business with us turned their backs the next day and did not want to know us.  Our own consumers turned their backs, as did every country in the world, yet the Deputies opposite say that everything should be as normal.  Our Minister for Agriculture has been the best Minister in these adverse circumstances.  It is very easy to be a good Minister for Agriculture in good times.  It is a different matter to be a good Minister for Agriculture in bad times, and that is what Deputy Yates has been.</P>
      <P>Compensation should be given to winter fatteners. I believe there will be a top-up.  I have done everything humanly possible to ensure their views are known at every level, and this Government will not turn its back on any sector of the farming community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will get his answer very shortly.  As to some of the comments made by Members on the Opposition benches about the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, a poll in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> last December found that Deputy Yates was believed by farmers to have done an excellent job during the BSE crisis, so good that Fianna Fáil appointed a new spokesman on agriculture.  If everything was all right on that side, why the change?  It is against that background that we can knock at every farmer's door over the next couple of months.  Deputy Yates is regarded for what he is, an excellent Minister in the most difficult circumstances.</P>

      <P>I appreciate it is extremely disturbing for the Members on the Opposition benches that their marriage to the Progressive Democrats has proved extremely difficult, and that is <Col N="1278" /> why they are so touchy.  The reality is that there is a GATT agreement and nobody knows that better than Deputy Walsh.  It was he who agreed it and who did not want to discuss the cutbacks and the potential unavailability of intervention or price supports in the future.</P>
      <P>Farmers are having a difficult time.  Coming from that background, I have every sympathy for them.  The Fianna Fáil leader said that he would have sympathy for farmers if he were in Government. Farmers know that people have sympathy for them but what they want, and what they got from this Minister, is compensation to help them over a very difficult period.</P>
      <P>Members of the Opposition seem to think that all one has to do is get on a plane and go to Egypt.  Why was it that for two years there were no live shipments during their period in Government, and only slight discussion about BSE?  They said there was no real problem as far as the international media were concerned, but those markets are closed.  I will do everything I can to support the Minister in his efforts to get those markets reopened.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Fianna Fáil spokesman on agriculture who spoke about all he did during his time in office.  I remember sitting where he is sitting now and asking about the pig farmers.  He promised he would look after them, but the following Monday he was out of office and had never even met them.  Farmers were promised by him, by Commissioner MacSharry and by the leader of the then Government, Charles Haughey, that one area in which they could go into production was deer farming.  Letters were issued by the Minister and speeches were made by Ray MacSharry encouraging people to go into deer farming, but many of those farmers, having borrowed thousands of pounds, went bankrupt.  It is difficult to listen to that, but we must face facts.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Yates, has done a spectacular job in difficult circumstances.  He has tried to maintain farmers' confidence.  Milk prices have fallen for a number of reasons and the Minister is trying to get assistance for dairy farmers.  When the price of milk fell by 19p per gallon in 1991 there was no question of compensation.  The Minister was sympathetic and farmers were simply told that things were bad.  As a farmer and a backbencher, I am proud of the work done by the Minister and the Taoiseach who have the support of a united party and a united Government. When we look back to 1994 when heads were delivered on a plate, there was little unity at that time.</P>

When Fianna Fáil in Government allowed inflation to increase to 21 per cent in 1979 I had to go to financial institutions, cap in hand, to bail out farmers, some of whom are under threat again today.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of the sub-committee on EU legislation and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which pointed out to Deputy Walsh, as Minister, the implications of GATT for Ireland.  Because of the importance of beef to the economy and our dependence on exports, particularly to non-EU countries, the problems arising from that agreement were magnified. Beef is 11 times more important to the Irish economy than the overall EU economy. Since only 12 per cent of beef production is consumed here, none out of every ten animals have to be exported, and net exporting countries are more vulnerable to market over-supplies.  This country accounts for about 7 per cent of total EU beef production and about one-quarter of EU beef exports.  We are the largest net exporter of beef in the EU to third country markets.  I make those factual observations to indicate that we knew well that the combination of the reformation of the CAP and the new GATT agreement would impact on beef prices.  A new subsidy regime for each male animal was put in place to compensate for the reduction in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is encouraging that farming organisations have put on the record that in light of the BSE crisis their concern is for the consumer.  I welcome their statement that the health and safety of the consumer is at the forefront of their objectives when producing food of either plant or animal origin.  I called six months ago for the introduction of detailed integrated traceability systems, which are very important to farmers.  I meet farmers on a regular basis and I am aware of the importance of tracing food from the field <Col N="1280" /> to the dinner plate.  Major advances have been made in that regard.  Recently the Irish Cattle Traders' and Stockowners' Association called for the establishment of an independent office of ombudsman for food.  That proposal merits serious consideration as such an office would be totally independent of Government Departments and agencies as well as sectoral interests in the food industry.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the current problems experienced by farmers in all the main sectors of agriculture, particularly the beef sector.  Coming from County Westmeath, one of the premier beef producing counties, I am particularly aware of the problems for this sector.  The current crisis in the beef sector affects many beef producing farm families, particularly those engaged in winter finishing. The recent drop in price of 8p per pound, £65 to £70 per animal, has had a devastating effect on producers in the wider industry.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat the reason for the 75 per cent cut in export refunds, the three green pound revaluations, totalling 8.8 per cent, and the closure of some third country outlets for live cattle, all of which have a cumulative effect on prices. The cut in export refunds of the magnitude of 17.5 per cent has a major effect on the beef sector. I castigate the EU for utilising an appallingly simplistic approach to management of the beef market.  As a result of excess applications for export licences, it took the soft option to cut refunds instead of dealing with the matter in another way.</P>
    <P>There are cartels in operation at factory level. Is it a coincidence that all export licences expired at the same time?  Surely there were export licences available three weeks ago, yet all the licences coincidentally expired at the same time, resulting in a drop in price of 8p per pound.  This matter should be referred to the Competition Authority.  The cut in price is not benefiting the consumer, so who is making the profit?  That question must be answered.  The Competition Authority should investigate the matter and find out whether there is a cartel in existence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The export trade is critically important because it provides competition.  Dr. John O'Connell of the department of agri-business and rural development at UCD, a former mentor of mine, recently prepared a paper for the Irish Live Stock Exporters' and Traders' Association in which he indicated that the price and revenue enhancing effect came about for three main reasons &mdash; first, increased competition engendered purely by extra numbers of cattle purchasers when there is a strong live trade; second, the preference, which has become stronger since the BSE crisis, in most countries for beef which <Col N="1281" /> is stamped as having been domestically produced; and, third, the livestock trade serves distinct demands in certain countries for home-slaughtered fresh beef which cannot be served by the factory sector.  Those worthwhile views of an eminent researcher should be taken on board.</P>
      <P>Winter finishers are seriously affected.  I know a farmer who purchased 200 cattle to finish in 1995, but did not purchase any in 1996, which saved him £20,000.  Is it not time to focus some EU supports on the finishing sector?  Seventy per cent of the farmers in County Westmeath are beef farmers, many of whom are engaged in winter finishing.  The rural landscape will change if we do not focus EU supports on that sector.  The viability of winter finishers is being threatened for the second or third consecutive year.</P>
      <P>This is not a political issue.  EU supports have been and disbursed without proper focus.  I wrote an article on this matter in 1979.  We did not focus on our particular needs when disbursing EU grants and implementing the farm modernisation scheme.  Beef farmers, particularly beef finishers, will have to receive compensation.</P>

        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I support the comments of my colleague, Deputy Penrose.  The position he outlined applies particularly to the Offaly end of my constituency.  Last autumn many traditional winter finishers did not purchase cattle.  This impacts on family farms, store and calf prices and employment in the factories.  I reiterate my colleague's call for an investigation by the Competition Authority into the lack of competition in this area because neither the farmers nor the consumers are benefiting.</P>

      <P>As Members are aware, I do not believe the farming sector should be exempt from criticism.  The Common Agricultural Policy <Col N="1282" /> is unsustainable in the long term.  I will continue to make a case for PAYE taxpayers who shoulder a disproportionate share of the tax burden. However, I also believe farmers should be supported when confronted by a crisis not of their own making.</P>
      <P>Several unrelated factors have conspired to force dairy and beef incomes down and grain producers have also been affected.  The GATT agreement meant that export refunds had to be cut throughout the European Union.  This cut would have been sustainable had farmers not been hit last year by the BSE crisis, which has its roots in the gross mismanagement of the UK beef industry. Irish farmers have been forced to pick up the tab for the Tory Government's gung-ho deregulation of the beef industry.</P>
      <P>Within the EU beef consumption fell by a massive 50 per cent in the immediate aftermath of the BSE scare and, despite the recovery, consumption is still well below 1995 levels.  This is not simply due to the BSE crisis.  There is increasing public concern about food safety in general and beef consumption had been in a slow decline even before the BSE scare.  BSE has caused enormous problems for Irish farmers, but this Government is determined to resolve them.  Despite cries from the Opposition, the Minister has battled to regain lost markets, maintain existing markets and open up new ones.  Consequently, today only Libya, Iran and Egypt remain closed to Irish beef cattle exports.</P>
      <P>Even without the BSE scare, farmers would still be battling against the GATT ceiling which strictly limits exports.  The only viable alternative to exports is to sell beef into intervention, a short-term solution which does nothing to develop the beef sector or to ensure that the sector is market rather than subsidy led.  I am pleased the Minister does not agree with the strategy being adopted by the European Commission to comply with the GATT limits.  I understand he is having ongoing discussions on this issue with the relevant Commissioner.</P>
      <P>While the beef sector is being squeezed, the picture may improve.  The destruction of UK cattle will reduce beef production by an annual 230,000 tonnes.  By 1998 beef production is likely to fall by nearly 600,000 tonnes per annum.  This may not be sufficient to rebalance the beef market, given that the GATT ceiling will also fall progressively, but it will represent an improvement.</P>
      <P>The Government is aware of the pressure on producers' incomes not only from BSE and the export ceiling but also from the currency policy, something which should be examined in greater detail.  A £20 million compensation package for the beef sector has already been adopted and I understand from the Minister's statement last night that a further agri-monetary compensation package is likely to be introduced.  The income support measures negotiated by the Government during the past year will also have an impact on the sector.</P>

      <P>We inherited it.  The scourge of BSE originated under successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who introduced a mickey-mouse ban on the importation of British meat and bonemeal in 1989 and 1990.  They allowed its importation for poultry and pig rations, but failed to make it a serious offence to include it in cattle rations.  We are now reaping the results of that Government's sorry act in not placing a complete ban on the importation of meat and bonemeal.  That was the time the problem should have been nipped in the bud, but irresponsible Ministers failed to face up to the challenge facing them.  They could not guarantee the imported meat and bonemeal would not find its way into cattle rations.  From 1989 to 1991, successive Ministers failed to take steps to depopulate herds in which an outbreak of BSE occurred. The request I made to the House at that time fell on deaf ears.  The current beef price difficulty is related to three factors, the cut of 17.5 per cent in export refunds since January 1997, three green £ revaluations totalling 8.8 per cent and the closure of third country outlets for the export of live cattle.</P>

      <P>This is a serious issue for all Members and our citizens.  Not alone are we facing the current crisis but we will face a further crisis in the autumn if something is not done to resolve this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to compare current beef price with prices 12 months ago.  This week's edition of the Bord Bia bulletin states that prices have dropped by 13.9 per cent for U3s, 12.6 per cent for R3s and <Col N="1285" /> R4s and 13.4 per cent for O3s and O4s.  That is a serious drop in prices, regardless of any level of compensation that might be paid to make up that loss.  There is a danger that gluts may be created in the market in the autumn.  Cattle kept over the winter by store farmers, especially in the west, in the hope that prices might rise are overhanging the market.  There is also an overhang in terms of finishers who have not seen any merit in investing extra concentrates to ensure their cattle are finished and ready for sale.  Farmers who had cleared their sheds and replaced stock now find they have lost their potential profit because of losses due to price reductions in the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>A number of serious Government actions will cause major problems down the road.  Will the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry tell us if his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, informed him prior to the withdrawal of our Ambassador from Iran last week?  A number of EU countries did not take similar action and tried to maintain their position in that country.  I am reliably informed that Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal did not withdraw their ambassadors from Tehran.  Was the Minister consulted in view of the fact that we were told by the media that his officials had planned to visit that country at the end of the month to try to reopen that major market?  Can the Minister tell us if those officials will visit that country or if it has been cancelled because of the political action by the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  This is a serious situation and I hope the Minister can clarify the position.  Was he or the Taoiseach consulted prior to the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs?</P>
    <P>That political decision should not surprise us because the Tánaiste promised to visit Egypt, Libya and Tehran in the past 12 months, but he has not visited any of those destinations.  The Minister visited Libya last year with the intention of getting a contract, but was told no contracts were available.  Yet the following day the Australians got a market share of 50,000 head of cattle.  They took that share of the market that was left for us because the Minister was not able to give any commitment in terms of what was sought by Libya.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>That loss was made up by Irish exporters selling cattle to Australia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy. Courtesy on all sides can be of benefit to those outside this House who are concerned about their future and where it lies.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to live shipping is clear.  If we do not regain those markets in the next six to eight weeks, there will be serious problems again in the autumn.  We also face the problem of shipping live weanlings to Europe which needs to be dealt with.  I hope the Minister will use his influence with his colleagues to ensure that full shipping facilities are available for the transport of weanlings in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> The Minister on 4 February in the Davenport Hotel promised compensation to our farmers equal to that given by Europe.  When will he get clearance from his Cabinet colleagues to pay that compensation?  I hope he can tell us tonight.  Will he consider the position regarding intervention? The beef intervention price is 86p per lb, yet the price being paid for steers going into intervention is only 80p per lb.  Does the Department not have the right to control who gets that difference of 6p or is it open for everyone to take a slice?  That needs to be addressed urgently.  EU money is being used for intervention and 6p in the pound is being taken.  Why is beef in mainland Europe worth 20p a lb more than similar beef here?  That is where our problem arises.  I could talk on this matter for much longer, but I wish to share the remainder of my time with my colleagues.</P>

      <P>The interest of Members on this side of the House and of the members of our party is such that we could debate this issue for two days.  It is grossly unfair that we are only given minutes to participate in this debate.  There is an agricultural crisis and milk prices are falling.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the beef sector which is facing a crisis that has been developing for some time. The Minister showed poor vision and a lack of any affirmative action in dealing with the problem. The serious price slump in winter finishers is exerting backward pressure on prices for stores, weanlings and calves.  The beef industry is more important to this country than to any of the other 14 European Union member states.  Management at European Union level should have taken account of that fact and that 80 per cent of our beef is exported.  There should be flexibility in regard to export relief which has reduced in terms of export refunds that have fallen by 17.5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The green £ has been revalued by 8.8 per cent. What did the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister do about securing markets for Irish beef?  It is significant that the number of cattle exported in 1994 was 404,031.  For the first quarter of this year, 13,559 were exported which indicates the seriousness of the situation in regard to live exports.  I put down a parliamentary question yesterday asking the Minister where he had gone outside the European Union to promote a market for Irish beef.  He went to just two countries, Libya and Russia, even though it has been over 12 months since the BSE announcement in the House of Commons.  A golden opportunity was lost during our Presidency of the EU when we had more muscle, but no effort was made to <Col N="1287" /> address the serious situation.  No effort was made by the Taoiseach or Tánaiste to try to secure markets for Irish beef.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Government's problems as it consists of three parties with differing ideologies. It does not give much encouragement to farmers to hear Deputy De Rossa, leader of Democratic Left, say that farmers &ldquo;are rolling in it&rdquo;.  The Government created a serious situation in regard to group water schemes when it totally ignored 150,000 householders in rural areas.  The Democratic Left leader said that farmers were looking for free water.  He should have known that was not the case.  There has already been a reference to the fact that at the Labour Party conference last Saturday night its leader did not once mention agriculture.  I have a certain sympathy with Fine Gael members of Government but they should assert their authority even though the Labour Party leader says each party is of equal standing in Government.  Fine Gael has more members in Government and should assert its authority in addressing such issues.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to address the reduction in export refunds and the green £ revaluation and to suspend the reduction of the slaughter premium for a few months to try to tide farmers over the current difficult period.  Will the Minister impress on the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste the need to secure markets for live cattle?  If he did, he would go some way to alleviating the current problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  Fine Gael is not in touch with the pulse of rural Ireland.  The future is disturbing and frightening for the farming community.  Huge change is being proposed in Europe where a price freeze for 1997 has been mentioned.  This is the reason the Minister and the Government have been hiding.  There will be a serious reduction in the price support for the cereal sector and if those involved do not accept it, the dairy and beef sectors will face a loss of £1 billion.  This is a major problem and is not being addressed in the proposals before us.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to blame the Minister because urban Fine Gael Deputies share the same view as Democratic Left and Labour Deputies.  If Fine Gael was the true agricultural party it used to be, the compensation package would have been put in place.</P>

I am shocked at someone putting a charter in place without being prepared to honour it. All payments have slowed down.  This can be seen on the Order Paper every day, where Deputies on all sides put down questions on the subject.</P>
      <P>Live exports have been the backbone of the cattle industry but the Minister has placed so many impediments to the system through over-regulation that he has gummed it up.  That is the major problem and until he withdraws many of the regulations, no animal will leave Ireland.  We must have live exports because we have dual purpose animals, dairy and beef.  The hindquarters of our Holstein Friesians are of no value but they appeal to a certain market, so they must be exported live.  I urge the Minister not to allow Democratic Left, Labour and some of his own Deputies to wreck our economy.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe.  The Progressive Democrats are pleased to support the Fianna Fáil motion.  The farming sector is experiencing severe difficulties and our party believes it must be supported.  The family farm must be protected and everything possible must be done to prevent people drifting from the land.  The farming sector is in need of help.  The price of cattle has fallen sharply &mdash; farmers are now receiving £120 a head less than they were at the start of the year.  The worst of the BSE crisis has passed, consumer confidence is being slowly restored but the price of cattle going into factories <Col N="1290" /> continues to fall.  If this trend continues then despite all the subsidies and supports available, farmers will go to the wall.</P>
      <P>Life is already tough for those involved in the production of cattle.  Many are in dire financial straits and not all will survive if the present price trend continues.  They are operating in an environment of total uncertainty.  When they buy cattle they have no idea what price they will ultimately be able to get or whether there will be any market for them.  Farming is a business and any well-organised business expects to know the cost of its raw material, the costs associated with production and the expected selling price of its product.  Why is it impossible, despite the safety net of intervention and a framework of price supports, to apply these basic principles of business success to farming?  The conclusion must be that the apparatus constructed by the EU to underpin farm incomes is failing hopelessly in its objectives.  This leads to the further conclusion that the Government and the Minister must be far more pro-active in shaping and directing the course of European agriculture policy.  Despite all the Minister's bluster and public relations hyperbole he has singularly failed, even during our EU Presidency, to convince his European partners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the necessity to direct the money where it is most needed, that is to farm families.  If, as we are told, he must go down on his knees before the EU Agriculture Commissioner in an attempt to secure a pre-election slush fund to paste over the cracks in Government policy, he should have done so much earlier and to more effect.</P>
      <P>It is no exaggeration to say that beef farmers, and beef finishers in particular, are facing into the peak cattle disposal season this autumn with considerable trepidation.  It is time we had a formal investigation into the workings of the beef market. A number of questions need to be answered. Why are people quitting farming at a time when the EU is pumping £30 million per week in subsidies into Irish agriculture?  Why is there a crisis in farm incomes at a time when the total value of subsidies has never been higher?  Why is there no evidence of full price competition between the processing plants, even though we have adequate laws to prevent anti-competitive practices?  Why is the consumer not benefiting in terms of the retail price of beef at a time when farm gate prices for cattle have fallen so sharply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the EU Commission is reacting on a unilateral basis to large applications from Ireland to pre-fix export refunds.  Apparently it can act without any reference to or intervention from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Ireland, therefore, pays a large penalty for its huge dependence on the export beef trade relevant to other European member states.  The Minister has been unable to <Col N="1291" /> convince our European partners of the central importance of agriculture to our economy and its dominance as an export earner.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of the BSE crisis market after market has been closed to Irish carcase beef and live cattle.  The Minister repeatedly promised he would spare no effort to have these markets re-opened.  Even the Tánaiste offered hopes of a restoration of the Egyptian market.  Visits by third country buyers have been used to create an aura of activity and hope.  The reality, however, is different from the rhetoric.  Markets remain closed, prices continue to slide and the competition required to support the cattle trade never materialises.</P>
    <P>Because of the strength of the Irish pound and the revaluation of the green currency, the price of milk has fallen by more than ten pence per gallon while beef prices are cut by seven and a half to eight pence per pound.  In February, the Minister told the IFA in the Davenport Hotel, Dublin that he would introduce national compensation to offset the consequences of the revaluation. Nevertheless, on 26 March, the Minister told the House &ldquo;there are no proposals to supplement the EU compensation from Exchequer funds.&rdquo;  Which is it?  Will the Minister make a clear and unambiguous statement on this issue? Will he or will he not pay compensation?  Is this another part of the slush fund which will be produced to buy the farming vote a few days before the general election?  If the money is to come farmers need it now, not in five weeks' time.  The Minister must also ensure that payments legitimately due to farmers are paid on time and not held back until just before the election.  Third country markets for beef are hugely important but we must not lose sight of the value of European markets.  What practical proposals does the Minister have to ensure that our beef and live cattle find profitable and improved markets within the EU?</P>
    <P>This Government, ensured by its left wing ideology, has presided over an unprecedented collapse in farm incomes.  It has brought one of the engines of our national prosperity to its knees.  Today's difficulties have not been caused by BSE, low beef consumption or factors outside the Minister's control.  Consumption has recovered significantly and there is demand for beef. This crisis could have been avoided if the Government was prepared to have more than a token presence in Brussels, more than a non-existent presence in third country markets which have been closed to us, and more than a passing interest in the profound difficulties confronting the industry and farm families.</P>
    <P>All the rural development initiatives and supplementary measures to boost alternative enterprises and off-farm activity will be worthless if the commercial heart of agriculture is unprofitable. Pre-election gimmicks may win votes but they will not stop the slow death of rural Ireland. Stopping that decline and restoring some confidence <Col N="1292" /> in farming is the task confronting the Minister and the Government.  The record to date does not inspire confidence.  We need fewer photo-opportunities and more action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to address the House on this motion.  It is quite evident, after some two and a half hours of debate, that the motion tabled by the Opposition is both misguided and inaccurate.  As the current difficulties in the beef sector can be put down to decisions taken at EU and international levels some years ago, combined with one of the worst public health scares ever encountered in the food sector, it is obvious that the motion tabled reflects a total poverty of understanding on the part of the Opposition.  The motion also fails to acknowledge the enormous and significant collective efforts made by my colleague the Minister, Deputy Yates, my Department, the Government, various Government agencies and myself over the past year to protect our most important indigenous industry, thereby securing the incomes of producers in the sector.  Accordingly, I believe the amendment moved by the Minister accurately reflects the position and I fully support it.</P>
      <P>The current difficulties in the sector are predominantly due to the surplus beef in the Community. The beef surplus in the European Union is significantly greater than the quantity of subsidised beef which can be exported to third countries under the GATT agreement.  The limit for the current marketing year, which ends on 30 June, is 1.19 million tonnes and already export licences for over 80 per cent of this quantity have been taken out by traders.  Fearing that the limits could be breached, the Commission reduced the export refunds by 10 per cent in January and 7.5 per cent at the end of last month, in the expectation that fewer licences will be taken out.  We have continually disagreed with the Commission's approach to managing the licensing system and have suggested what I believe are workable alternatives. The GATT limits could be more effectively adhered to through shortening the validity period for licences and the application of a reduction coefficient.  The Commission has accepted our approach to the validity period.</P>
      <P>The second element of our proposal should also be taken on board.  The Minister will seek the support of his colleagues at the Council of Ministers next week to bring some order into this critical area and put an end to the <i>ad hoc</i> approach which is currently creating uncertainty in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fall in beef consumption in the EU since the BSE crisis has resulted in a higher proportion of Irish beef now going to third countries.  The demand for Irish beef on these markets remains undiminished.  We are doing everything possible to reopen the few markets still closed.  However, the closure of the third country trade for live cattle since the beginning of the year has removed <Col N="1293" /> a very important competitive element from the cattle market and every effort is being made to get boats moving again.  No effort has been spared in that context and every possible initiative has been taken and continues to be taken.</P>
    <P>Opening those markets is not just simply a matter of getting on an aeroplane as seems to be implied by the Opposition.  Such a facile view shows contempt for the concerns of the authorities of those countries, and scorns the intelligence of producers who have been down this path many times before since the BSE problems arose first in 1990.  Dare I point to the abortive attempt by the then Fianna Fáil spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Brian Cowen, who took it on himself to intervene in Iran with much hype and ceremony, and returned to Ireland with his tail between his legs and empty-handed to boot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is really required to reopen these markets is not platitudes or simplistic gestures, but painstaking effort at technical level to assure the authorities in those countries about the safety of Irish beef.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent reopening of the United Arab Emirates serves to illustrate the success of this approach.  I am confident that reopening will be followed shortly in the few remaining markets still closed.  In recent weeks a technical delegation from Libya visited Ireland to see our controls.  They were impressed with our measures and will make a favourable report to their Government in Tripoli.  Technical discussions are also continuing with Iran with a view to agreeing an acceptable veterinary Protocol. Some weeks ago the Egyptian authorities approved a revised veterinary certificate, thus enabling the beef trade to continue.  The Minister will continue his efforts to have the live cattle trade reopened at the forthcoming Cairo Food Fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the long-term solution to the beef problem in the Community is to rebalance the beef market, my immediate concern is to protect the income of beef producers through adequate market supports and direct payments.  Apart from export refunds, we will continue to ensure that flexible intervention arrangements remain in place to provide a floor price for cattle.  Some £30 million will shortly be paid out of the very sizeable BSE compensation packages agreed last year and that will relieve the hardship suffered by producers.  In addition, £20 million is being paid out as a result of the revaluation of the IR£.  Win ter finishers are being particularly targeted under this fund by way of top-up of the winter slaughter <Col N="1294" /> premium.  It is worth noting that the continuation of the slaughter premium in 1997 was a notable achievement in last year's negotiations for BSE compensation, as a result of which £20 million will be paid out to winter producers this spring.</P>
    <P>Further compensatory payments due to the more recent IR£ revaluation will also be paid out. As far as 1997 is concerned the cumulative value of the various measures which we have negotiated for beef producers amounts to £96 million when the deseasonalisation premium is included.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully aware of the problems encountered by beef producers and the beef industry generally, both as a result of EU policy, international obligations and the BSE crisis. Effective action has been taken and I am confident the Minister will reopen the market in countries involved in the very near future.</P>

      <P>There are no Labour or Democratic Left Deputies present for this debate, which proves how seriously they view the problems of beef farmers.  They have no interest in farmers or agriculture, although those Deputies will vote against this motion.</P>
      <P>I commend Fianna Fáil for this motion and reject the Minister's assertion that it is misguided and inaccurate.  The crisis in confidence in Irish farming over the past 18 months is evident.  I met a number of farmers in the past fortnight and have never before experienced anything like the crisis of confidence among beef farmers in particular. Farmers have been accused of crying &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; too often in the past, but nobody who has recently met small to medium-sized farmers who have been caught with stock they cannot sell and whose bank managers are beginning to lose confidence in them, would agree with that.</P>
      <P>A Government with a commitment to agriculture would say it was serious about doing something, but nothing has been done to open our foreign markets.  The Minister and his Fine Gael colleagues have paid lip service to opening markets that have now been closed for months to Irish exporters.  Nothing has been done about the way Irish meat factories are abusing their monopoly of the beef prices being paid to farmers. Farmers received £1.07 a pound for beef two years ago; now they are receiving 80p a pound when it is accepted by economists and farmers alike that the price necessary to break even is 88 to 90p a pound.  It is not good enough for the Government to say it is doing its best.  In this case, its best is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste's lack of concern has been mentioned. In a wide-ranging address to his party's annual conference last Saturday night, the Tánaiste did not once mention agriculture.  There <Col N="1295" /> is a serious crisis in confidence in agriculture which is not being addressed by the Government. It is not good enough to say this started with BSE and the consumers' lack of confidence in buying beef.  I implore the Minister to take on board the plight of the Irish farmer, the beef farmer in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in calling on the Minister to wake up to the crisis in Irish agriculture. We read a lot about the roar of the &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo;.  That tiger is silent in rural Ireland. It is not just the farmers who are experiencing terrible difficulties but rural communities generally. There can be no doubting a strong anti-rural bias in this Government against farming and rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>There are 150,000 farming families affected by this crisis.  The Minister and the Minister of State are well-intentioned and hope to do what they can for the farmer, but they are not supported by their left wing partners in Government, the Labour Party and Democratic Left.  It is eminently clear to many farmers that this Government is openly hostile to them and this has been adequately demonstrated on several recent occasions.  The fact that the Tánaiste omitted to refer to farmers in his speech to his party conference last weekend has been referred to.  When discussing water charges some weeks ago I was amazed that the Minister for Social Welfare found it necessary to launch an attack on farmers, stating that they wanted free water: nothing could have been further from the truth.  We had been talking about those living in rural Ireland, not about farmers, yet he availed of that occasion, and never loses an opportunity, to launch a blistering attack on them.</P>
      <P>Farm prices have collapsed to their lowest level for many years, beef being retained in factories at 80p per lb, the lowest in 20 years.  Every aspect of Irish farming has been affected, including the price of milk, grain etc.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand the lack of effort on the part of the Tánaiste, the Minister or the Cabinet in general to reopen markets for our live exports trade.  I have no doubt that Irish factories, whenever afforded an opportunity, operate a cartel. For example, in the years 1993 and 1994 almost 400,000 head of cattle were exported.  The total for the first quarter of this year was 12,740, which would amount to fewer than 50,000 in any one year.  This amazes me because markets exist for these exports.  The Egyptian, Libyan and Iranian markets have been closed, as has portion of the Russian market which absorbed almost 40 per cent of our beef exports.  This clearly demonstrates the failure of the Government to make any effort to restore them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Farmers Association and other farming organisations have submitted several proposals and called on the Minister on numerous occasions to honour his commitments, but he has reneged on them.  Thirteen per cent of our total <Col N="1296" /> workforce, in excess of 140,000 people are involved directly, in addition to those indirectly involved, in agricultural activity, the bedrock of life in villages and small rural towns which allows people to live and obtain employment within their local communities.</P>
    <P>No Member of this House is endeavouring to score political points.  There is a crisis and the Minister is the only person who can do something about it.  No effort should be spared at top level within Government to grapple with the problem. The Minister should call on his colleagues and partners in Government to wake up to the horrendous problems in agriculture.  The collapse in farm prices, the closure of foreign markets, repeated cuts in export refunds and the failure to deliver on the promise of matching compensation for green £ revaluations all indicate the failure of the Government to grapple with them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take seriously this awful crisis in agriculture and that something positive will be done even at this late state.</P>

      <P>Once again the Fianna Fáil Party has had to initiate a debate on a very serious crisis confronting the agricultural industry.  There is anger and concern among the farming community, particularly those dependent on beef production who face enormous financial difficulties, who know this Government has totally failed the agricultural sector and that farming will not receive the support it needs.  It appears the attitude of the Government is one of complete indifference to the plight of rural Ireland.  The Minister and Government have failed to deal adequately with any of the difficulties facing the agricultural community since the end of 1994.  The political and diplomatic effort needed to safeguard our markets and restore those lost has not been forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The BSE scare, the revaluation of the green £ and several cuts in the rate of export refunds, have seriously dented the confidence of the farming community.  In order to maintain a vibrant beef industry we must have markets for our beef products and live exports.  The farming community is quite rightly convinced that the political leadership and commitment needed for such a large industry will be lacking as long as this Democratic Left and Labour-dominated Government remains in power.  The electorate, the farming community in particular, are aware that the only way to restore confidence in farming is to call a general election, which hopefully will take place as soon as possible, allowing for a change of Government following on which one must hope that agriculture will receive the necessary <Col N="1297" /> leadership and support from a Fianna Fáil Minister.</P>

      <P>An essential ingredient of any business is confidence.  It is quite evident that there is a complete lack of confidence in this Minister and Government, not because of some efforts undertaken by the Minister and his Minister of State but because they are undermined by the left wing members of this Government. Everybody in Fine Gael knows that is the case and Fine Gael affiliated farmers will confirm that. It is time there was a change in Government so that the industry will be restored to its healthy state of two years ago.</P>
      <P>The cereal, beef, potato and dairying sectors are in dire straits.  One example relates to export refunds.  On 5 February last the Minister informed us there was to be a 10 per cent cut, adding that this represented a first step in reducing the valid period of licences to 30 days, hopefully, a first step in the process which would presage refunds increasing to their former level.  Yet, they were cut a further 7.5 per cent before being finally abolished yesterday.  Therefore, we can deduce that, even at that stage, the Minister did not know what was happening.  It is time he did the honourable thing, fell on his sword and allowed an efficient Minister to take over his portfolio.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion and endorse what my colleagues have said about the inability of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to grapple with the crisis in the agriculture industry.  As someone who was born on a small family farm in east Galway and spent half my life working for the farmers of Galway, Mayo and Clare, I know what Ministers for Agriculture have done in the past to ensure that whenever a crisis arose in agriculture they were able to approach their Cabinet colleagues, obtain the wherewithal, muster the initiative and support to guarantee opportunities and the creation of markets.</P>
      <P>It is tragic that, for the first time in the history of the State, every investment in farming has been suspended by the Minister, although a feeble effort was made in the budget to ensure that larger farmers, who traditionally support the Minister and his party, are given some tax allowance for investment purposes but there was none for small, developing farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no gainsaying that there is a serious crisis in the agriculture industry at present, particularly within the dairying and beef sectors where farm incomes have dropped by some 20 per cent. <Col N="1298" /> For the past three years cattle finishers have had their incomes reduced each winter, yet the Minister has done nothing about it.  He told the nation on the national air waves that he was negotiating with the Russians, working ferociously for the nation and our farmers, when he was actually in Enniscorthy enjoying beverages or whatever.  To tell the nation that he was committed to working for our farmers while actually in his constituency and not interested in discharging his constitutional responsibilities renders him unfit for office.  When he spoke to members of the Joint Committee on Sustainable Development in July 1995 he told them he expected to restore the combat farm pollution programme by September 1995, yet some two years later that has not been done; that is what the Minister's commitments are worth.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we export livestock, yet no markets have been negotiated or guaranteed.  The Minister failed to take the initiative and obtain any support from the smoked salmon socialist deputy leader of the Government or the whiskered compatriot within the Cabinet to do anything. It appears they did not want live exports thus ensuring a competitive environment for our farmers, producers and finishers within the relevant markets.</P>
    <P>There are markets in Europe for live cattle but the Minister was unable to protect them.  What was the Minister's dismal response yesterday? Resulting from our exporters having to fill their traditional markets from Australia and elsewhere, the Minister's only response to this motion is that this Herod-type system will be a panacea for farmers' problems.  He should not have accepted that because in doing so he accepted a slaughtering programme that will reduce our numbers and discontinue the additional support from Brussels which is vital to underpin Irish agriculture. The <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> is correct. Time and again, and as recently as 5 April, its editor made it clear that at the end of the day responsibility for the present mess rests with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and his Government colleagues who have taken no action to redress the problem and ensure people are not put out of business.</P>
    <P>If we do not have support from the eastern part of the country for the livestock producers in the west, farmers in the west will be put out of business. It is time for the Minister to wake up or move aside and allow a Government, with a Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, to take over and ensure the traditional markets for live cattle are restored for Irish farmers, underpin the markets and deliver an equitable and fair investment to the agricultural community as in the past.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 64 is related to amendment No. 61 and amendment No.62 is an alternative and all may be taken together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  If amendment No. 61 is agreed, amendment No. 62 cannot be moved.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 61:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 11 to 19. </P>
      <P>This amendment provides for the deletion of section 7(1) of the text debated on Committee Stage.  That subsection provided for the Taoiseach to give a declaration in writing to public service witnesses that information sought from them was exempt from compellability through being listed in section 6(9).  As section 6(9) has already been deleted through Government amendment No. 57, the issue of the Taoiseach giving a declaration is redundant and is, therefore, being deleted.  This is effectively a consequential amendment on those that have been just discussed.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 62 would delete all of section 7, which deals with the Taoiseach giving declarations to certain public services witnesses and the Secretary to the Government giving declarations to all witnesses.  Government amendments Nos. 61 and 64 delete section 7, subsections (1) and (3), from the text, which removes the role of the Taoiseach from the section.</P>
      <P>However, the Government has decided that the role of the Secretary to the Government in determining whether questions relating to State security, international relations and crime intelligence should be retained and has decided to retain section 7(2).  Therefore, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 64 provides for the removal of the provision for the Taoiseach to refuse to furnish a declaration to a witness if he considers such a refusal to be in the public interest or that the information sought by the committee is exempt from compellability in certain circumstances. As the giving of a declaration by the Taoiseach is removed by this amendment, and amendment No. 61, there is no longer any need to provide for the Taoiseach to refuse to make such a declaration.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the amendments which relate to one of the core issues of the Bill.  Although she has not conceded some issues, the amendments go a long way towards addressing a concern this side of the House had about the original Bill which was drafted in such a way that civil servants, members of the Army and others were treated differently. The terms of the original Bill in several areas worried many Members on this side but particularly <Col N="1302" /> in relation to this matter.  It appeared the Taoiseach, who professes openness, transparency and accountability, was suggesting sections which effectively meant he would be the final arbiter with regard to whether a civil servant, a member of the Garda Síochána or a member of the Army could give evidence to a committee of the House. I thank the Minister of State, and members of her party, for the manner in which they addressed this issue on Committee Stage.  The amendments are a way forward which most Members would welcome.</P>

      <P>In page 9, lines 28 and 29, to delete &ldquo;, the committee shall either withdraw the direction or&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and the committee does not withdraw the direction, it shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 7(1)(a)(ii), formerly section 7(2)(a)(ii) prior to deletion in the previous amendment of section 7(1) of the text debated on Committee Stage, provides for a witness to inform a committee that it is his or her opinion that questions relate to the security of the State, international relations or information kept for the purposes of preventing offences and are, therefore, exempt from compellability.  If it is so informed, the committee can either withdraw its direction or ask the witness to provide a declaration from the Secretary to the Government that a committee direction relates to those categories.  It is a drafting amendment to clarify this point and it does not alter the meaning of the subsection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 65:</P>
      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 4 to 14 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>8&mdash;(1) Proceedings in the High Court under section 6(2) shall be heard otherwise than in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) In proceedings in the High Court under this Act, the chairman of the committee concerned, the person to whom the direction concerned was given and any other person concerned (including, where appropriate, a person specified in subsection (1) of section 10 who is referred to in proceedings before the committee <Col N="1303" /> and a person referred to in <i>subsection (2)</i> of that section) shall be entitled to be heard and to adduce evidence.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a new section which replaces the text debated on Committee Stage.  Subsection (1) provides for the holding in private of High Court hearings to determine whether a witness is entitled to disobey a committee direction on the basis that the information sought would be privileged in that court.  Subsection (2) provides that the committee chairman, the witness and any third party identified in evidence shall be entitled to be heard and to provide evidence.  As this subsection has been substantially amended, I oppose amendment No. 66.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State outline the reason the proceedings should be heard otherwise than in public?  Section 6(2) relates to certain exemptions and the committee would apply to the High Court in a summary manner for a determination.  Why should all the hearings be held in private?  In this day and age, the proceedings should be in public.  Will the Minister of State consider that aspect?  My amendment No. 66 relates to the exemptions in section 6(9), which this side opposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Deputy correctly, his query relates to why proceedings should be in private.  I am advised that the element of discussion held <i>in camera</i> could involve a witness refusing to disclose information and being pressed by the chairman on his or her reasons for that.  The committee may go into private session to allow an explanation to be provided. There will be circumstances in which proceedings will move into private session as distinct from being reported throughout.  However, it is expected that generally the proceedings will be held in public and in the presence of the press.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister reconsider this issue before the Bill goes to the Seanad?  The amendment states that individuals &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be heard.  It does not give the court the option.  It should be up to the judge to decide whether the proceedings should be held in private or in public. I tabled a later amendment in that regard because I considered this aspect was restricted to private sessions in the High Court.  I do not understand why this provision is included in the Bill.  The judge involved should have discretion in this area and I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>My initial response was inaccurate. I understand proceedings will move to the High Court or before a judge if witnesses refuse to disclose certain matters.  Hearings will be held in private to enable the judge to determine the case being made without the person incriminating himself or herself, or others who may be linked to the case, in public.</P>

      <P>Section 6 has been dramatically changed by previous amendments.  If a person is directed to give evidence and he or she forms the opinion that they are entitled to High Court privilege under section 11, they may then decide that they are entitled to disobey the direction.</P>

      <P>This section provides for committees to notify employers that one of their employees and, in the case of bodies one of their representatives, has been given directions by the committee.  It provides for the employer or body concerned to nominate another employee or representative to attend.  The amendment would allow the committee to decide if an employer can appear and give evidence before it in person or through a nominated employee or representative.  The onus would be on the committee to determine whether an employer or his or her representative can appear and give evidence.  There would be no automatic right of audience under the section, as amended, but an employer or body identified by name or otherwise would retain a right of audience. In view of this, I am not in a position to agree to the amendment.</P>

      <P>Concern has been expressed on this side of the House that the heavy hand of an employer may be used to intimidate a potential witness, be they an employee of a State or private company.  If an employee of a State or private company is directed to appear before a committee, the company must be notified within ten days.  Where the relationship between employer and employee is difficult, the employer may wish <Col N="1305" /> to dictate to the employee.  The amendment would give the committee discretion to decide whether the employer should be asked to appear before it to give evidence.</P>

      <P>In page 11, line 37, to delete &ldquo;committee&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;committee,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section confers High Court privilege on witnesses acting under a committee's direction.  This means that proceedings cannot be used against a witness for the purpose of defamation or self-incrimination. These amendments are designed to make subsection (1) more readable by making it clear that privilege will apply to evidence or a document given following a direction.

      <P>I move amendment No. 70:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 43 to 47.</P>
      <P>This section places an unacceptable onus on chairpersons of committees who, in effect, will be the arbiter of whether the evidence of a witness is covered by High Court privilege.  Chairpersons of committees will be in the same position as a High Court judge who can say to a witness that they are straying from the matters covered by privilege.  Chairpersons of committees, particularly those who do not have a legal background, will find it impossible to determine, as evidence is being given, whether a witness is straying from matters covered by High Court privilege towards matters covered by qualified privilege.  In view of the fact that committees will not have the ability to retain a legal adviser &mdash; amendment No. 73 in my name which deals with this matter has been ruled out of order as it involves a potential charge on the Exchequer &mdash; chairpersons of committees will be placed in an invidious position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has highlighted the responsibility that will be placed on chairpersons of committees under the Bill.  This matter was discussed on Second and Committee Stages.  Legal advice will be available at all times to chairpersons of committees, if necessary during proceedings. The matter is being dealt with separately by the House through the provision of a legal adviser.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides for the loss of High Court privilege for witnesses who continue to give evidence on a particular subject despite having been instructed to stop giving such evidence by the committee chairperson.  Qualified privilege only will apply to any evidence given after such an instruction.  The amendment would delete this provision which would remove the discretion of the Chair in conducting committee meetings.  I am not in a position, therefore, to accept it as it would dilute the power of a committee as exercised through the Chair.  Amendment No. 71 will provide that the only loss of High Court privilege under subsection (2) will be in relation to defamation. Witnesses will retain High Court privilege for other areas.</P>

      <P>This section provides that material supplied by a person to a committee cannot be used as evidence against that person in criminal proceedings.  The amendment ensures that only evidence provided to a committee, either directly in a document or in an affidavit, following a direction by that committee shall be inadmissible as evidence in such criminal proceedings.  This is to prevent a situation whereby a person could voluntarily send material to a committee for the sole purpose of rendering that material inadmissible in criminal proceedings against that person.  The amendment provides that evidence included in an affidavit cannot be exempted from criminal proceedings, unless the affidavit is produced following a direction from the committee.</P>

      <P>(3) Proceedings of a committee may be heard otherwise than in public.</P>
      <P>This is a rewording of a Committee Stage amendment in the name of Deputy Ahern which I accepted, subject to the actual form of words being consistent with other provisions of the Bill. The amendment achieves what Deputy Ahern's amendment achieves in that it allows the Oireachtas to appoint a committee or subcommittee to issue guidelines which investigating committee's using the provisions of the Bill would follow and provides that hearings may be heard privately.  The wording is consistent with Government amendment No. 1 to section 1 which provides for the establishment of a subcommittee to oversee committees in their use of the powers conferred under the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 76 is a technical amendment and is consequential on amendment No. 74.  As subsection (3) of amendment No. 74 provides that hearings of a committee may be heard otherwise than in public the section providing for the same matter is superfluous.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quill tabled this amendment on Committee Stage.  She was unable to be present for part of the debate due to other pressing business in the Dáil Chamber and perhaps she did not have time to read my explanation. I said that during my discussions with the parliamentary draftsman I had sought to include this type of amendment.  I was advised, however, that such a time limit would not be appropriate in this section.  The point was made to me that time limits were appropriate where the Registrar was discharging administrative functions. However, where the Registrar was discharging judicial functions, the parliamentary draftsman, supported by the Attorney General's office, advised that time limits should not be inserted. They referred to the fact that as a general principle courts are given a wide latitude to reach their decisions without any specific or artificial time limits being imposed.  In the case of this section, what is involved is the Registrar deciding whether a separate corporate entity should be established.  The view of the parliamentary draftsman was that this was a judicial function by the Registrar and that a time limit on his decision in this case would not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, I moved a number of amendments on Committee Stage to reduce time limits where the Registrar was exercising administrative functions.  Section 49, which deals with the approval of additional services, is a case in point.  I have also acted to insert time limits in a number of other sections where no limits had previously been included.  Sections 103 and 104 are cases in point and I draw the attention of the Deputy to those.  Consequently, I have acted to impose or reduce time limits in response to the views of the credit union movement in cases where it was possible for me to do so.  Unfortunately, based on the legal advice I have received, it is not possible to accept Deputy Quill's amendment.</P>

      <P>I accept the explanation of the Minister of State.  I am grateful a time limit has been set on the administrative side of transactions relating to the provisions of the Bill because delays have been a damning feature of bureaucracy. In any new legislation we seek to enact, we should seek to minimise, in so far as possible, unnecessary delays.  The Minister of State has attempted to do that in this Bill.  I regret we cannot seek to impose the same restrictions on judicial decisions.  I do not know the reason for that but the Minister of State has access to advice not available to me.

A substantial portion of the Bill is being deleted in section 27, from line 24 to line 35.  That is the result of a demand from this side of the House to change the limits. The existing limit was ridiculous in the way it was structured.  The Minister of State has gone even further than we requested, to 1 per cent of the total assets, which is welcome.  Much criticism was made of the contributions from this side of the House but we realised the importance of changing the limit.

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 33, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The circumstances referred to in subsection (2)(c) are those where, were a loan to be made to a member, the amount of the member's outstanding liability (including a contingent liability) to the credit union, whether as borrower, guarantor or otherwise, would exceed whichever is the greater of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a) £30,000, and</P>
      <P>(b) 1.5 per cent. of the total assets of the credit union.&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>During the course of our debate on Committee Stage I undertook to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage which would have the effect of limiting a member's liabilities to a credit union to either £30,000 or 1.5 per cent of the total assets of the credit union, whichever was the greater.  This is the purpose of the amendment before the House.  Its effect is to provide that every credit union will be able to lend up to £30,000 to an individual member.  For the larger credit union, however, this ceiling will increase by reference to the size of the total assets of the credit union.  For the largest credit union, which would have assets of approximately £50 million, the individual limit could, in theory, be as high as £750,000.  In any event, the preceding section 35(2) effectively curtails the prospect of such a large loan.  This provides <i>inter alia</i> that loans for periods exceeding five years may not constitute more than 20 per cent of the credit union's loan book.  In practice, therefore, few large individual loans will be offered by credit unions who will be under pressure to accommodate the widest number of members with loan finance.</P>
      <P>Clearly, a credit union would find it difficult to justify refusing 100 members seeking loans of £1,000 each in preference to a single member looking for a loan of £100,000.  I have at all times indicated that I do not wish the credit unions to become banks or building societies, that I wish to see them continuing to plough the bulk of their lending resources into meeting the financial needs of their members.  This is the strength of the credit union movement, and the proposed lending conditions in the Bill effectively safeguard this position.  Accordingly, I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

    <P>Great efforts were made by Members on this side of the House to have this change made.  We highlighted what effect it would have on the <Col N="1313" /> members of credit unions and on credit unions generally if this was not done.  The Minister took what we said on board and it will be passed into law tonight.  I welcome that, but it took major effort by several Opposition Deputies who had to speak repeatedly and were accused of filibustering which was unfair because open discussion is what this House is about and we are often criticised for not being in the Chamber at all times. Had we not contributed so vigorously, our demands might not have been met.  I welcome the amendment which is the icing on the cake for the credit union movement which was genuinely concerned. The Minister has seen fit to take on board and redraft the Opposition's amendment which will now become law.</P>

That is what propelled us into putting down the number of amendments we did.  I am very glad the Minister has come this far to meet the substance and the spirit of our amendments.  We would not seek to do anything that would destroy the essential culture of the credit union movement.  As against that, we would not seek either to strangle or limit the capacity of the credit union movement to grow and develop in accordance with the wishes and the means of its members.  The Minister has struck a good balance in this amendment which is one to which, on behalf of my party, I will give my support.</P>

We have no reason to doubt that they will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> The Minister tabled an amendment on Committee Stage which dealt with the 1.5 per cent limit.  We asked him to look at the proposal that the total amount outstanding in respect of loans to members in excess of £30,000 should not exceed 5 per cent of the total loan book.  The Minister gave an undertaking following our discussion and offered to change it on Committee but, on the chairman's advice, it was agreed that he would come back on Report Stage.  My concern was that a 5 per cent limit would have confined larger loans to a small number of members of the credit union and that the boards of directors would not have been free to use the members' shareholding in the best way possible, by giving out loans, if such a limit were imposed upon them.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has honoured his commitment.  As has been said here, he has proved himself capable of listening at all Stages of debate.  As a backbencher, it is refreshing and rewarding to have a Minister who will listen to what we have to say at all Stages of a Bill because we end up with much better legislation.  This Bill certainly meets the concerns of the credit unions in my constituency.</P>

It highlighted the benefits of Committee Stage that we had a Minister who was prepared to listen and to take on board what backbenchers were saying.  The Opposition made a strong plea to the Minister.  Likewise Government backbenchers were able to do the same, which was not the case in the Dáil over the years when backbenchers were muzzled and not allowed to express a point of view that differed from the Minister's because he might take umbrage.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point that he did not wish the credit unions to move into the realm of the banks or the building societies.  I would not like to see them do so either.  However, competition in that field will do no harm, and there are many who would welcome it.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on the way he has dealt with this amendment and, indeed, all the amendments.  At the end of Second Stage I also felt there was a certain amount of filibustering going on, but I take on board the comments made by Deputy O'Keeffe.  On the basis of what was happening at that stage I did not think we would get to a stage where this Bill would be passed in the Dáil, and that was my great fear.  In the context of the representations I received and the commitment of everyone in this House to getting this legislation through, we have seen democracy at work at first hand.  Since I became a Member of this House in 1989 I have <Col N="1315" /> seen various Ministers adopt a different approach; they were not prepared to take amendments on board.  This Minister was prepared to meet the credit unions and to take amendments on board.</P>
      <P>As a member of the credit union in Donabate since it was set up I am aware of the significant and vital role played by the Irish League of Credit Unions in getting the Bill to this stage tonight. Their lobbying of public representatives gave us all an insight into what was required in this Bill. All Members played a role in bringing about this legislation.  The Minister, who received some hassle, particularly on Second Stage, was strong enough to say that, in the interests of the credit union movement involving thousands of members, he was prepared to take on board the representations and legitimate concerns expressed.  The Bill is better for that and I compliment the Minister on his achievements.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been practical and common sense has prevailed.  When he was in Opposition and Deputy Bertie Ahern was spokesman on labour affairs similar communication and understanding was evident.  On many occasions Deputy Ahern conceded amendments to the Minister, but things are changing and the Minister is now more magnanimous.  It would have been unacceptable not to remove the cap originally proposed as much good business would have been transferred from the credit unions to other institutions.  The removal of the cap is worthwhile.  It is better to lend to one's members than engage in third party investment.</P>
      <P>There is less investment now than in the past, involving greater risk, and investment without a return is not worthwhile.  Government stocks are the most secure investment.  The equity market, which is going through a turbulent period, is experiencing changes and there are great risks in that area.  The changes to the legislation, which result from representation by the Opposition, are prudent.  The section has been further improved from Committee Stage and I am grateful for that. I welcome the consensus between the Government parties and the Opposition.</P>

I have no intention of changing the disposition I had when on that side of the House.  If the House is reduced to an Opposition proposing and an Executive disposing, the quality of legislation is likely to be poorer.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate to take seriously Committee Stage debate on a Bill that affects so many people.  We should take seriously the views of representative organisations, in this case, the Irish League of Credit Unions.  As with the Catholic Church, it is a body with which it is not easy to deal, but it is made up of the most honourable men and women with whom I have dealt.  In the Irish tradition they start bargaining very high and it is difficult to meet all their concerns.  I think that body agrees we have struck about the right balance in the Bill, which will go to the Seanad tomorrow.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate to again record that the Irish League of Credit Unions was involved from the genesis of the Bill.  The level of consultation since then has been a worthwhile exercise and the Bill will stand the test of time.  We forget we have provided for the Minister of the day to change, by order, as he or she deems appropriate, the limits applying if circumstances change.  We have gone a long way to meet the requirements and I thank Deputies for their remarks.</P>

      <P>This is a simple but important amendment which I hope the Minister will take on board.  We propose that the term &ldquo;officer&rdquo; should not include an employee of the credit union.  If an employee wishes to take out a small loan the application should not have to go before the board.  I do not wish to weaken the control of the credit union, but the term &ldquo;officer&rdquo; should not include an employee.  Loans of £1,000 or so to employees of credit unions should not have to go before the board of the credit committee.  I would like the Minister's views on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the intention of the amendment is to place the loan appliing <Col N="1317" /> cations of employees of the credit union on the same basis as the loan applications of all other members rather than on the level of directors and other credit union officers.  Employees are in a different category from that of other members because they work in the credit union and, therefore, special arrangements are necessary to ensure transparency and good practice in regard to their loan applications.  It is appropriate that their loan applications should be treated in the same way as those of directors and other officers.</P>
      <P>The effect of the present subsection (3) when read in conjunction with subsection (5) is to have the loan application of an employee, which does not exceed the value of his savings in the credit union, approved by either a credit officer or the credit committee.  It is only where the amount of the loan exceeds the value of savings that the special committee, constituted in accordance with subsection (4), would come into play.  Unlike other members whose loan applications would be dealt with by the board of directors in such circumstances, it is appropriate that the committee approving such loan applications for employees and other officers should have a membership wider than the board of directors and that it should include specifically at least one member of the supervisory committee, which is generally responsible for overseeing the operations of the credit union.  I regret, therefore, I am unable to accept this amendment.  In the interest of fair play and transparency, the arrangements for approval of such loans set out in section 36 (3) is appropriate to employees of credit unions and, accordingly, I ask Deputy O'Keeffe to reconsider his amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 37, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a credit union from giving security over property within its objects, accepting security over property, within its objects, participating in ownership of property with an association or body corporate the majority of whose members are credit unions, assisting or promoting or investing in charitable, social, cultural and enterprise activity in the community by providing or making property available to an organisation involved in such activity.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In this amendment Deputy O'Keeffe is reopening the question of credit unions being able to engage in property transactions within the objects of the credit union.  As I mentioned on Committee Stage, I have accepted, following legal advice, that it would not be appropriate to deal with the property issue in this manner without creating major difficulties in curbing temptation on the part of credit unions to speculate in property.</P>
      <P>The alternative way to proceed, which is now adopted in the Bill, is the best way to deal with this issue.  The extended section 44 allows a credit union to engage not only in social, cultural or charitable matters, but specifically allows it to use its resources to support community development whether in the form of an enterprise or community centre or in any other manner deemed appropriate by the members.  The amendment also seeks an explicit reference to a credit union giving or accepting security over property.  My officials have consulted with the Land Registry, the Parliamentary Draftsman and the Attorney General's office on this issue and I am advised that the relevant provisions are already enshrined in sections 33(1) and 35(1).  Section 33(1) indicates that in borrowing money, a credit union may give security for those funds.  Similarly, section 35(1) indicates that in making a loan to a member, the credit union may accept such security in accordance with the provisions of the credit union's rules.  Consequently, I am legally advised that these provisions are unnecessary.</P>
      <P>I hope those remarks will reassure Deputy O'Keeffe in terms of the intent of his amendment.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the proposed amendment to section 41(6) is to effectively allow a credit union to ignore a direction of the registrar to dispose of a building or other land held by a credit union, even though he may have good reason for considering it would not be in the credit union's best interest.  In practice, the registrar will be very slow to issue such a direction. However, where he feels compelled to do so, any such intervention on his part should be effective. Consequently, I am not prepared to accept amendment no. 14.</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposed deletion of section 41(7), certain directions issued by the Registrar will be subject to rules made under the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947 while others may be issued independently.

    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate, I undertook to consider an amendment tabled by Deputy Quill, the effect of which would be to preclude from the requirement of registrar approval those <Col N="1320" /> additional services which had been exempted in ministerial regulations.  Having considered the matter further, I am prepared to exempt from approval those types of additional service which involve no risk to credit union or members' funds. Examples could include advisory services, whether taxation, budgetary or similar services, or services where the local credit union merely acts as an information point for services provided by third parties and where members contract directly with the companies concerned without any funds passing credit union accounts.  In such circumstances, there should be no requirement on the registrar to approve the additional services concerned, as no risk to the funds of the credit union or to the funds of members in the credit union would be involved.</P>
    <P>In advance of drafting the appropriate ministerial regulations, it would be my Department's intention to consult with the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Credit Union Advisory Committee to determine the precise scope of such services which can be exempted from the registrar's approval.  Accordingly, I commend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's amendment goes a long way towards taking on board the concerns I had when I tabled amendment No. 17 on Committee Stage.  It makes sense for the Minister to seek to defend a function which should properly belong to credit unions and to ensure that credit unions are not required to submit decisions on routine matters to the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  The Bill as originally drafted gave excessive powers to the registrar to deal with the day to day activities of credit unions, thereby stripping from them a great deal of the discretion they exercised with good judgment in the past and which they have the capacity to exercise with good judgment in the future.  For that reason I am pleased the Minister has taken on board the concerns I expressed on Committee Stage and brought forward this amendment.  It goes a long way towards meeting my concerns and, therefore, I withdraw amendment No. 17.  I am grateful the Minister has streamlined and refined the process in respect of this matter as a result of which this is a better Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I support the Minister's amendment.  On Second Stage I, as well as many other Deputies, argued strongly that as much freedom as possible within the bounds of reason and good regulation should be allowed for additional services to be developed by credit unions.  On Committee Stage the Minister made a substantial change in terms of the length of time available to the registrar to make a decision on these matters by introducing a fast track approach for agency as opposed to principle services offered.  This is a sensible addition to those changes.  Decisions on the provision of information services or services which do not involve <Col N="1321" /> any risk to the funds of members can be precluded from the requirement to go before the registrar for approval.  That reflects the current position.</P>
      <P>The credit union in Tullamore of which I am a member has offered foreign exchange services for years.  Since last year it has offered an ATM facility to its members.  Like many other credit unions it is an active and worthwhile participant with the Department of Social Welfare and the local health board in providing a money advice and budgeting service, which I commend to all credit unions.  Many people in my community have been helped out of the clutches of money lenders and into the practice of good money management through the assistance of the credit union.  This amendment increases the measure of flexibility available and encourages credit unions to provide additional services for their members, for which they may be charged substantial fees in other financial institutions.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this change introduced by the Minister.  It is worthwhile to simplify the process and consider the provision of additional services.  Many credit unions provide additional services and have broadened their base.  We live in the age of modern technology and electronic banking.  If credit unions do not follow the modern concept and there is too much bureaucracy or impediments in their way they will not make progress and will not be of service to the community.  Credit unions provide a service for 1.5 million people and that level of service must be given recognition.  We are aware of the substantial fees charged by other institutions for small transactions, which in many instances credit unions provide free of charge, and that assists the community.</P>
      <P>The Consumer Credit Bill was introduced by Fianna Fáil and ended up with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  It was one of the most comprehensive Bills to come before the House. It is somewhat like the Credit Union Bill, but a change of Government provided a reason for the many amendments to that Bill.  Deputy Rabbitte was on this side of the House and when he progressed to the other side he had to rethink and rejig a good deal of what he said when he was on this side.</P>
      <P>This amendment simplifies and lifts the process out of bureaucracy.  Decisions will be left to the credit unions and that is to be welcomed.  They can expand their provision of services without having to become involved in a great deal of bureaucracy.  I know the registrar from another area of work in which I am involved.  While he does an excellent job he may not have sufficient staff to deal with matters related to the daily operation of credit unions, or if something went wrong there could be a delay in dealing with matters and business and services could be lost to the community.  The credit union organisation provides an excellent service to the community.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their remarks.  It was not the intention to shackle the credit union movement.  I wish to let the House in on a secret.  I finally met the Bankers Federation and the building societies after all these months of having been accused of calling them in when I was preparing the Bill and allegations that the Bill was authored by the banks.  Deputy O'Keeffe will be pleased to know we had a meeting. Their main complaint was that the regulation generally provided for is not adequate, given the significance of credit unions in the economy.  The phenomenal rate of growth we have seen in the past decade or more will be accelerated in the next decade.  I stick by my maxim that it is not desirable that the ethos of credit unions should be undermined to the extent that they become banks or building societies.  They are nonetheless a significant stream of competition for banks and building societies and that is only right.  The banks and the building societies made the case that compared with the strictures and regime with which they must comply under the aegis of the Central Bank, this Bill is still too lax on the regulatory environment it provides for credit unions. I do not agree with that argument but it is important to mention it, given that I have been subjected to a good deal of legitimate lobbying by Deputies on all sides of the House who have studied the Bill in a little less detail than the Deputies present and who may take the line they were given and put it on the record.  It will be helpful in the dark nights of November and early December when we are knocking on doors looking for votes.</P>

That is all we seek to do here.  I do not believe the financial institutions are right.  The track record of the Credit Union Movement, the established role of the registrar and the prescriptive measures in this Bill are adequate to meet the exigencies of the position, but nonetheless it is important that point is put on the record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter.  There has been a crisis in St. Joseph's Hospital since the end of December 1996 when the occupancy rate rose from 20 per cent to 50 per cent.  Many people had influenza and suffered from serious chest ailments.  At one time the hospital had up to 40 extra patients.  The normal overrun has been 15 to 20 patients.  Yesterday an old lady in a wheelchair waited for admission from 2 p.m. until 8 p.m.  She is a venerable lady from a well-known family in the town but she was left in that position.  Another man waited from 12 p.m. until after 8 p.m. yesterday.</P>
      <P>Wards in Cashel hospital are closed and I do not understand why they have not been opened. Bureaucracy and maladministration has taken place.  There is an overall plan to make Cashel a surgical hospital but since the excess occupancy rate has risen from 30 per cent to 50 per cent surely those wards should have been opened, as they were during the influenza crisis.  Each time a crisis arises, the opening of wards has to be negotiated and discussed through the administrative bureaucracy.  That should not take precedence over people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Howlin, for putting in place a plan for the county hospitals in Tipperary.  However, that will not be implemented until 1999 or 2000.  There are 59 beds in the Clonmel medical unit, with an overrun of 20 to 50 per cent.  This has had an effect not only on patients but also on the staff who are reaching crisis point.  They cannot continue to bear the pressure, continually reassessing how many extra hours they will have to work and the effect this will have on their families. That applies to nurses and doctors alike.  In the continuing over-capacity, eight beds are used where there used to be six, or ten beds used <Col N="1326" /> where there used to be eight, with no increase in the nursing staff.  It takes away from the day treatment unit when a nurse must use her free time to help the nurses on the wards.  It does not help the hospital overall.  We are meeting administrative and bureaucratic problems.  When wards in Our Lady's Hospital are closed, why should less sick and less urgent cases in St. Joseph's not be transferred automatically to fill those beds? Why is this allowed to continue?</P>
    <P>The £12.3 million plan introduced by the Minister will not be in operation for three years.  The contracts will not be ready until the end of the year.  I accept the delay if the plans are well made. However, extra toilets and capacity must immediately be provided in St. Joseph's Hospital.  One toilet facility is currently shared by 36 men and 29 women, which is not acceptable in a hospital today.</P>
    <P>Small administrative measures can be taken to alleviate the matter.  The total cost would only be £250,000 and it could be spent immediately, not just for the sake of the staff and the patients but for the image of south Tipperary.  We are 25 years behind the other south-eastern counties because we suffered a civil war over hospitals.  Let us make up for that in the best possible way by giving the money to ensure patients in Clonmel are looked after and an old lady does not have to wait for six hours and an old man for eight hours to get a bed.  Let us also open the wards in Cashel hospital so that the less seriously ill can receive attention.  Above all, let us put people before administration.  I ask the Minister to look at the hospital administration.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank the Deputy for raising this matter because it gives me the opportunity to set out the position in relation to St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel. The hospital service has at times encountered problems in the provision of services, especially general medical services, in the past years.  The causes of the problems have been well documented.  It is accepted that it is not possible to predict the volume of patients who will require admission to hospital at a particular time.  This is not a phenomenon confined to Ireland but is a feature in other developed countries also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ageing of our population has also contributed to the difficulties in the provision of services. Our elderly population has particular needs and sometimes this leads to an upsurge in the number of patients requiring admission to hospital.  Many elderly patients require acute hospital care initially but much of their recovery period could <Col N="1327" /> be spent in step-down/sub-acute accommodation. The shortage of sub-acute beds has caused problems in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers or quickly enough to cater for new patients seeking the services of the hospital.</P>
    <P>In recent months many hospitals have experienced heavy demand for general medical beds and the demand for extra beds is not only confined to St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel.  Different solutions to these problems have been applied by the health boards and voluntary hospitals.  I understand that in the case of St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, there has been a 25 per cent increase in the number of medical in-patients discharged in the first three months of 1997 as compared with the same period in 1996.  I also understand that the South-Eastern Health Board has applied extra resources to deal with the situation. For instance, in Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel medical beds have been opened to relieve St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel.  The appointment of a physician in geriatric medicine in south Tipperary has facilitated the opening of extra medical beds in Cashel.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to other solutions which hospitals use to alleviate overcrowding in medical wards.  One of the main solutions is to transfer medical patients into surgical beds on a temporary basis.  Unfortunately, because St. Joseph's Hospital has no surgical beds at this time, this solution cannot be adopted in Clonmel.  When surgical beds come on stream in Clonmel the options available to deal with such difficulties will increase dramatically.  Approval has been given to proceed with the planning stages of phase one of the development of St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel.  Phase one of the development will consist of a surgical ward, an accident and emergency department, an operating theatre department, a day care unit, an intensive care unit and a central sterile supply department.  The building cost of phase one will be £5 million.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the difficulties in relation to medical beds being experienced in St. Joseph's Hospital will be resolved and that we can get on with the business of upgrading health services in south Tipperary and, in the case of Clonmel, upgrading hospital services.  I can assure the Deputy the £12.5 million investment package for health services in south Tipperary will be implemented.  In that context, I am glad to have been able to resolve a difficult situation with the health services in south Tipperary.  There was dissension between Cashel and Clonmel and many people voted with their feet by seeking hospital services outside south Tipperary.  Confidence has now been restored in the health services in south Tipperary and people are availing of the services.</P>
    <P>In finding the solution to this problem, I thank Oireachtas Members of all parties for their co-operation. Often there is a temptation to exploit a contentious situation and this had existed for years.  I could not have solved this problem without <Col N="1328" /> the assistance of Deputies Davern, Theresa Ahearn, Michael Ferris and Senator Seán Byrne. The Ceann Comhairle also advised us in his own quiet way.  Everyone helped on a non-party basis and Deputy Davern can, with the assistance of Deputy Ahearn, seek the implementation of this package because they had a significant influence on its development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the matter of the Government bringing forward more than the draft heads of legislation regarding the hepatitis C scandal. The heads of a Bill have no legal effect.  They are a general outline and the details of the Bill could be considerably different.  The victims of this scandal have asked that the Bill be enacted before the general election.  Fianna Fáil has given a commitment to facilitate the Bill provided it meets the demands of victims.  That commitment stands and should be availed of as a matter of urgency.  Unfortunately, the Government continues to display unbelievable arrogance in this matter which was highlighted last Wednesday. The victims set 16 April as the deadline for receipt of the proposed legislation.  That deadline was set because in the past the victims were double-crossed by the Government and promises not honoured.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was told of the deadline last Wednesday, his response was not to be humbled by his Government's handling of the scandal.  He said that the Government set its own deadlines.  This arrogant and dismissive response proved that the Government has not changed its attitude.  Although the victims have been waiting nearly two years for justice, the Taoiseach still thought they had a cheek.  This proves he has not grasped the enormity of the scandal or the State's responsibility in the matter.</P>
      <P>Today's events prove that the victims were very wise to have set a deadline.  The Minister met the victims tonight because they had set today as the last date for the receipt of the proposed legislation. Despite knowing that today was the deadline, the Minister did not have the final heads of the Bill ready; he had a draft that the Government could change, and this was only available after pressure was applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has had two years' notice of the requirement for this legislation.  In December 1995, lawyers for the Government and for the victims met to draft it, but the Minister pulled the plug on the process.  Some of the work was done because the victims had submitted a draft Bill drawn up by senior counsel.  The Government must now assign every resource in the parliamentary draftsman's office to getting the Bill published by the end of this week.  The Minister has <Col N="1329" /> promised to do many things for hepatitis C victims; it is no doubt an effort to keep the focus off his own failures in this scandal.  This damage limitation exercise included the cynical relaunch of a document on women's health which was only done to present the Minister in a positive light on those issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a poor track record of delivering on promises made to hepatitis C victims. In the programme for Government, there was a promise to pay fair compensation.  This may happen after two years and four months.  Another commitment victims remember is the Minister's promise to consult them before publishing the Healthcare Bill for hepatitis C, but that did not happen.  They also remember his announcement of the <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal while negotiating with them about it.  The Minister must put what he has promised in law.  He must take the concerns of the victims on board, including the points of Positive Action and Transfusion Positive.</P>
    <P>The Government should come clean on its involvement in the despicable legal strategy used in the case of the late Brigid McCole.  The Tánaiste failed to clarify this in his speech last weekend.  He and the rest of the Government have failed to account for their involvement in the strong-arm legal strategy.  Despite many calls to do so, the Tánaiste has failed to confirm that he spoke to the Minister for Health in early summer 1996 about the McCole legal action.  It is clear that the Tánaiste acquiesced in the legal strategy and the attempts to force Mrs. McCole to go to the compensation tribunal rather than face an admission of liability in court.  If this Government continues to refuse to divulge in full the circumstances in which the legal strategy was devised and to lay before the Oireachtas all relevant documentation, including documentation from the Chief State Solicitor's office, when in Government Fianna Fáil will investigate the matter in full.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the House will be aware, I have already announced the Government's decision to place, as a matter of priority, the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal on a statutory basis.  In line with the terms of the motion which I put before and was agreed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 25 March and 26 March, I have since then engaged in a process of consultation with the four representative groups &mdash; Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, Irish Haemophilia Society, Irish Kidney Association &mdash; and the chairperson of the Compensation Tribunal in relation to the reappraisal of the compensation scheme.  As set out in the motion agreed by both Houses, the reappraisal of the scheme must also take account of any necessary legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this extensive consultation process was to ensure that the Government's legislative <Col N="1330" /> proposals should encompass, in so far as legally possible, the views of the representative groups.  A number of very difficult and complex issues have been raised during the consultative process over recent weeks.</P>
    <P>Earlier today, I met Positive Action and gave them a copy of the draft heads of the Bill placing the Compensation Tribunal on a statutory basis. Positive Action has agreed to consider the heads of the Bill and to let me know their views as soon as possible.  A copy of the draft heads of the Bill has been forwarded also to the three other representative groups with whom meetings will be arranged tomorrow.  I have also sent a copy of the draft Heads of the Bill to Mr Justice Egan, Chairman of the Compensation Tribunal who was involved in the consultation process.</P>
    <P>When I spoke in the Dáil on 20 and 25 March, I made a number of commitments in respect of the present compensation scheme.  I said it would be placed on a statutory basis and that the prohibition in the present scheme on the payment of exemplary or aggravated damages would be removed.  I also said there would be a right of appeal to the High Court on awards made by the Compensation Tribunal.  All these commitments which I made to the House are now reflected in the draft heads of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen, as a former Minister, will readily appreciate that the legislative process cannot be completed overnight.  In this instance, the process requires of necessity a degree of consultation with a number of representative groups on a range of complex issues.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this factor, I confirm that the Government is committed to enacting the legislation at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important issue.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Education did not think it worth her while to attend, but maybe the news is good.</P>
      <P>Bridgetown vocational college is probably one of the most successful second level colleges from both the academic and sporting viewpoints.  The extra-curricular activities at this college have to be seen to be believed.  Enrolment has increased unbelievably because academic achievement is so high.  Bridgetown vocational college services south Wexford: Kilmore, Rathangan, Bannor, Lady's Island, Ballymore and Rosslare.  The school was built 12 years ago for 450 pupils. Enrolment for September 1997 is expected to be 800.  That is a fantastic success and the reason is that the teaching staff is brilliant and totally committed to all activities in school, academic and extra-curricular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the school was built for 450 pupils and there are now 800 pupils, there are severe problems with classrooms.  There is severe pressure <Col N="1331" /> on toilet facilities, staff rooms and specialised accommodation.  A schedule of accommodation was agreed approximately two years ago by the Vocational Education Committee and the Department.  I take this opportunity to commend the chief executive officer on his activity not only in this school but in others in the county where we have done fairly well.  Our schools can compete with any others nationwide but I cannot say the same of Bridgetown Vocational School where we have not moved with the times.  When that schedule of accommodation was agreed two years ago, because of past experiences we had justifiably anticipated we would be given the green light to appoint a design team and proceed with the building.  Yet at a recent vocational education committee meeting &mdash; I am a member of County Wexford Vocational Education Committee &mdash; we were informed that this project is now on hold. Why is this so?  The pupils, parents, teachers and staff of the vocational education committee have been very patient.</P>
    <P>In Bridgetown there are 16 prefabricated classrooms which are not conducive to good education, being too cold in winter and too hot in summer.  I ask the Minister of State whether that is fair for the pupils and teachers.  Does he agree it is a disgrace that any such project be put in abeyance?  The Government can contribute to the success of the schools in our county by acceding to our request.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Hugh Byrne for raising this matter and affording me the opportunity to outline the current position in regard to the provision of an extension to Bridgetown Vocational School, County Wexford.  The school is the sole provider of post-primary education in the catchment area.  It opened in 1965 and a major extension was provided in 1984 to cater for a projected long-term enrolment of 500 pupils.  A number of prefabricated classrooms on the school site was provided in recent years to accommodate the school's short-term requirements.</P>
      <P>A schedule of overall accommodation to cater for a projected enrolment of 650 pupils has been agreed between the Department and County Wexford Vocational Education Committee.  The schedule of residual accommodation of over 1000 square metres for the proposed extension to this school has also been agreed, comprising general classrooms, specialist rooms and general purpose accommodation.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy the Minister for Education is fully aware of the need for additional accommodation at this school.  The appointment of a design team for the architectural planning of the proposed extension is at present under consideration. Officials of the Department of Education will be in contact with County Wexford Vocational Education Committee as soon as a decision is taken on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine for coming into the House to respond to the concern of the fishing industry off the south west coast in relation to the inadequacy of fishing patrols, in particular the position in regard to the <i>modus operandi</i> of flagships in the region.  There is an excellent fishing industry in that peninsular area such as that at Castletownbere, the Bantry mussels industry, Union Hall, its processing facility in Skibbereen, Schull, Courtmacsherry and Kinsale.  It is vital that it be adequately supported and protected.</P>
      <P>However, 150 flagships are operating off that coast, 12 of which are registered in Ireland, as I was informed in reply to a parliamentary question last week.  In Question No. 340 on 8 April, I inquired about the volume of the catch and was informed that the information currently available related to direct landings into Ireland.  The Minister informed me that his Department was currently compiling information in regard to landings into other member states and said he would communicate with me as soon as possible.  I have not yet received a response from his Department, which is not good enough.</P>
      <P>Again in reply to a parliamentary question I was informed by the Department of the Marine that the average age of vessels in our fishing fleet is just over 24 years &mdash; they compete with some 150 flagships &mdash; that we have a total of only seven vessels patrolling the area of which one is undergoing a major overhaul to replace and refurbish obsolete and deteriorated equipment to extend its operational life and another will undergo similar refurbishment commencing in August next.  In other words, we have a fishing industry that is inadequately equipped and supported, in terms of patrols to protect our fleet and ensure that the rammings and terrorisation perpetrated by these flagships off our south west coast is stamped out once and for all.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, a fisherman, Danny Boy O'Driscoll, lost his life in one of those rammings a few weeks ago, the circumstances of which remain unclear.  We know that a British registered, 32 metre Spanish longliner called <i>The Sea Horse</i> collided with the late Mr. O'Driscoll's 16 metre <i>Exodus.</i> The Spanish vessel was not licensed to fish in that area and had a record of two previous detentions by our Navel Service in Irish waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express my sympathy to the O'Driscoll family, to the entire fishing industry and those involved in it off our south west coast.  I want the Minister of State to give me a categoric assurance that there will be adequate patrol vessels and that his Department will give a serious commitment to ensuring that this valuable fishing resource is protected. Regrettably, yesterday's agreement in which the Minister acquiesced does not augur well for the future.  I want the report which was promised following the investigation of this recent collision to be made publicly available.  To date nothing has been seen of the report on the <Col N="1333" /> loss of the <i>Carrickatine</i> or the <i>Jenalisa</i> incident which took place a couple of years ago.</P>
    <P>The industry is less than impressed with the support it is receiving.  I look forward to a positive response from the Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House the Government takes a very grave view of anything which poses a risk to the safety of Irish fishermen.</P>
      <P>All fishing activity in the Irish 200 mile zone is monitored through a co-ordinated fishery control programme involving the Air Corps, Naval Service and the Department of the Marine.  There is close liaison between the Department and the Naval Service to ensure there is a high level of surveillance patrolling by the Naval Service in areas where there are particular concentrations of fishing activity.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the south-south-west coast is that at least one naval vessel is on patrol in that area at any given time and other naval vessels in transit to patrol areas elsewhere off the coast are available to assist in fishery protection and other operations in this area.</P>
      <P>An indication of the level of naval presence is provided by the current level of surveillance inspections carried out by patrol vessels.  Since the beginning of the year a total of 329 vessels was boarded.  While the main objective of patrols is to protect fish stocks through the enforcement of fishery regulations, the presence of Naval Service vessels also acts as a deterrent against dangerous or reckless behaviour.</P>
      <P>Ireland employs significant resources on fishery protection in our waters.  Over £35 million is spent by the Naval Service each year and over 1,000 are employed in the service.  Ireland has seven patrol vessels and two state of the art CASA fishery surveillance aircraft have been deployed since 1994 at a cost of £35 million.  Over £5 million is spent by the Air Corps on fishery protection activity each year.  The two Air Corps CASA aircraft overfly waters each day to identify vessels and monitor fishing activity.  Where specific aerial surveillance is required in a given area the CASA can be tasked at short notice to this area; the Department of the Marine employs 18 landbased fisheries inspectors and is in the process of recruiting a further ten inspectors. Between all the services Ireland is spending over £40 million a year in operational costs protecting the fish stocks in our waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the European Union will provide £6 million to Ireland for the purpose of both capital and operating expenditure on fishery protection. The planned capital expenditure for Naval Service, Air Corps and the Department of the Marine will continue the job of equipping and supporting <Col N="1334" /> the protection services to high standards of efficiency, effectiveness and capability.</P>
    <P>Specific items of investment this year will include a total refit for an existing vessel and the development of a new high technology system for the CASA surveillance planes which will allow high level identification of all fishing vessels through the use of the fishing vessels' radar signature. Plans are well advanced for the purchase of a new state of the art fishery patrol vessel.  Tenders for the new naval vessel are being evaluated.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine will seek to investigate all incidents reported to it and cases on which it receives detailed reports from the Naval Service.  Where incidents are formally reported to the Department it would seek to get signed statements outlining the nature of any incident. In a number of other cases in recent years, it has been possible to obtain such statements identifying the vessels involved in the alleged incidents.  If, on the basis of these statements, the Department considers that malicious or dangerous actions have occurred, a strong formal complaint is conveyed via the Department of Foreign Affairs to the flag state of the vessel involved.</P>
    <P>In the past it has proved difficult to identify vessels involved in incidents occurring during the hours of darkness.  Similarly, in instances where unattended gear has been damaged it has proved impossible to know whether the damage was the result of accidental or deliberate action or which vessel was involved.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate the difficulties in pursuing these matters satisfactorily in the absence of hard evidence.  This problem was borne out in an alleged incident off the south-west coast.  On 14 March the <i>LE Ciara</i> responded to a request relating to an alleged illegal ramming incident reported by the captain of a UK registered fishing vessel, the <i>Holly Jane.</i></P>
    <P>A statement was taken from the captain of the vessel but he was not able to identify the vessel which allegedly rammed his vessel.  The area was searched but no evidence was discovered which could facilitate any further investigation of the incident.</P>
    <P>The legal position is that offences committed by foreign vessels outside our jurisdiction are dealt with by informing the flag state and asking that appropriate action be taken.  This procedure will be pursued assiduously in all substantiated cases and the adequacy of the naval presence in the area of contention will continue to be monitored. In this way, it is hoped a repetition of the unfortunate incidents which have occurred in the past will be avoided.  Everything in our power will be done to protect the safety and wellbeing of Irish fishermen.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 April 1997.</P>

      <P>Following the publication of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, the Government decided to prepare a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities. In this regard, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has established an interdepartment task force comprising representatives of relevant Government Departments to prepare the Government's plan of action in response to the report.</P>
      <P>My Department, which is represented on the task force, is currently analysing and evaluating the wide range of recommendations contained in the report which are of relevance.  The task force is due to report to the Government by the end of June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Deputy will be pleased to know that I have already taken significant steps to improve the position of people with disabilities, in advance of the Government's action plan being finalised.  This year's budget provides for the introduction of a comprehensive package of measures, costing over £10.5 million in 1997 and over £18.5 million in a full year, to further assist people with disabilities, many of which are in line with the Commission's recommendations.  These measures include: special increases in social welfare rates over and above the rate of inflation, which brings the invalidity pension up to the target rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare (CSW) and disability allowance, blind person's pension and disability benefit up from 95 per cent to 98 per cent of the CSW rate; a new part-payment of disability allowance for those in part-time residential care; two personal rates to be paid to couples where one is getting disability allowance and the other either invalidity pension or old age pension; the disregard of earnings from rehabilitative employment is being increased to £36.30 a week in the case of disability allowance, blind person's pension and supplementary welfare allowance; an additional payment of 50 per cent is to be paid to recipients of carer's allowance providing care to more than one person; the full-time care and attention condition is being relaxed for carer's allowance purposes where the care recipient is attending a recognised rehabilitative course or day care centre; constant attendance allowance payable under the occupational injuries benefit scheme is being extended to disablement pensioners who are also receiving another social insurance payment; survivor's <Col N="1336" /> benefit under the occupational injuries benefit scheme will be paid where disablement of 50 per cent or more has been assessed, regardless of the cause of death; and the free travel companion pass is being extended to all registered blind persons and the conditions for entitlement to the free telephone rental allowance are being relaxed to allow certain other persons to reside with the recipient without affecting their entitlement.</P>
    <P>I am also introducing a new social assistance scheme sickness allowance from November for people who are incapable of work and not entitled to disability benefit or not permanently incapacitated.  Taken with the take-over of the disability allowance scheme last year by my Department, this means that we now have in place, for the very first time, a comprehensive system of income support for people who are sick and people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In parallel with this measure, the disability benefit and invalidity pension schemes are being renamed sickness benefit and disability pension, in line with the Commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>In addition, 1,000 places are being reserved under the back-to-work allowance scheme for a pilot scheme for people with disabilities, to facilitate their integration into mainstream employment. The scheme, which will be open to people who have been in receipt of disability allowance or blind person's pension for at least 12 months, is currently being finalised and I expect that it will be in operation by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>As soon as the Government's plan of action has been agreed, I will be in a position to indicate the further steps which I intend taking to implement those recommendations for which my Department has responsibility.</P>

      <P>The total full year cost of the 1 per cent reduction in PRSI for employees introduced in this year's budget is £79.4 million.</P>
      <P>A similar 1 per cent reduction in the employment and training levy for old age pensioners and low paid civil servants, such as those on or below the average industrial wage, would in effect mean the removal of this levy which stands at 1 per cent.  Confining the removal of the levy to those at or below the average industrial wage would entail raising the threshold from £10,250 per annum to some £15,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1337" /> that income tax statistics do not generally distinguish between individuals who have income from pensions and from other sources.  The only relevant information available is in respect of all individuals aged 65 years or over, including individuals with incomes from pensions.  In addition, the relevant distributional information available on civil servants relates to all public servants who are not liable to the full range of social insurance.</P>
    <P>It is tentatively estimated that the cost of increasing the current threshold for the employment and training levy from £10,250 to £15,000 in respect of people aged 65 years and over, and public servants who are not liable to the full rate of social insurance, would be of the order of £5 million in a full year in terms of the income tax year 1997-8.</P>
    <P>Introducing such a measure would, of course, add further significant complexity to an already complex tax, PRSI and levies system.  Furthermore, as incomes under £10,250 are already exempt from the employment and training levy, as well as from the health contribution, such a measure would be of no benefit to people in the two groups in question with incomes under £10,250 per annum of £197 per week.</P>

      <P>The Western Women's Link is one of five women's networks which was funded by the Combat Poverty Agency from 1993-5 as part of a pilot programme.  My Department took over funding of four of these networks in 1996 at the levels recommended by the agency.  The women's networks resource and support women's groups in their area through information and advice, joint training, sharing of experiences and considering the policy issues arising from their work.</P>
      <P>The Western Women's Link network experienced a number of difficulties during the course of the pilot programme mainly surrounding the geographical spread of the network and ability to provide the level of support needed by the women's groups in its area.  The group's development worker post became vacant in mid-1996 and has not been replaced.  The Department has agreed to provide funding of £15,000 to Western Women's Link for 1997 on submission of a satisfactory workplan.  I am satisfied that this is sufficient assistance from the Department to this group for now, having regard to the funding available to women's groups and networks generally and the current level of activity.  The position for future years will be kept under review.</P>

The Commission produced an interim report in November 1996 and has been asked to make its final report to the Government by June 1997.  The recommendations of the Commission will form the basis for the development of an integrated policy to support families for the future.</P>

      <P>There are a number of social welfare schemes available to people who wish to participate <Col N="1339" /> in full-time educational courses while continuing to receive their social welfare payments. The schemes administered by my Department are: the third level allowance, the second level allowance and the part-time education option.</P>
      <P>Unemployed people and lone parents wishing to pursue a third level education course may participate in the third level allowance scheme.  To qualify under the scheme a person must be aged 21 years or over and be unemployed for at least 6 months.  As a result of improvements to the scheme which I introduced in October 1996, participants now receive an allowance equivalent to the full standard rate of unemployment benefit while attending their course.  An annual book allowance of £100 has also been introduced and participants will be paid for a full 52 weeks while engaged in the third level course and they may work during the holiday periods.  Participants may pursue a full-time third level course at any university, third level college or institution provided that both the college and the course involved are approved by the Department of Education for higher education grants purposes.  There are also opportunities available to pursue courses at post-graduate level provided the person is aged at least 24 years and is the holder of a primary degree. There is no limit on the numbers who may avail of this option and recipients of deserted wife's benefit and widow's pension, with at least one dependent child, may participate.</P>
      <P>The second level allowance is available to unemployed persons and lone parents attending full-time second level education courses at any community, comprehensive or vocational school. Their entitlement to social welfare payments is not affected while attending such courses and there is no limit on the numbers who wish to avail of the scheme.  Recipients of deserted wife's benefit and widow's pension, with at least one dependent child, may participate.  I am at present considering improvements to the second level allowance along the lines of those introduced to the third level allowance and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement in this regard shortly.</P>
      <P>An unemployed person or lone parent including recipients of deserted wife's benefit and contributory widow's pension with dependent children who fails to qualify for a full-time education course may attend a part-time education course and retain their entitlement to unemployment payments.  However, unemployed persons availing of this option must satisfy my Department that they continue to be actively seeking and available for full-time work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education operates the vocational training opportunities scheme which provides an opportunity to pursue a second level education course which can lead to qualifications such as junior certificate, leaving certificate and certain city and guild certificates.  To qualify under the scheme an unemployed person or lone parent must be at least 21 years of age and have <Col N="1340" /> been unemployed for at least 6 months.  Participants are paid the equivalent of their unemployment payment directly by the vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>Over the years, the qualifying conditions applying to the various educational opportunities have been eased so as to include not only long-term recipients of unemployment assistance but also other categories of unemployed such as recipients of unemployment benefit and lone parents.  I will continue to seek to improve the opportunities for people in receipt of social welfare payments to gain access to educational opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996, provided for the extension of class A PRSI to community employment workers.  Class A PRSI provides cover for the full range of benefits and pensions available under the social insurance system including, for example, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, maternity benefit, retirement pension, old age contributory pension, widow's contributory pension, treatment-dental and optical-benefits and occupational injuries benefit. The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy relates to the position of those community employment workers who return to the live register when their period of community employment finishes.  By virtue of having paid class A PRSI contributions, persons returning to the live register after completing community employment may qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit rather than reverting to long-term unemployment assistance. In the case of persons who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit, their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them.  However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondary benefits can, however, be retained if the person transfers from a community employment scheme to a back to work allowance scheme or Jobstart etc.  As regards income-related secondary benefits such as rent allowance or mortgage <Col N="1341" /> supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, medical cards and differential rents, the position is that, in the normal course, former community employment workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment should continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.</P>

      <P>I do not have information on the overall number of cases of marital desertion or separation in the country, or of the overall number of spouses who are failing to maintain their families as a result.  However, the social welfare system is supporting a significant proportion of families where spouses have deserted them, or where couples have separted for other reasons.  At present, a total of 28,600 deserted or separated spouses are receiving a one-parent family payment from the Department.</P>
      <P>It is a matter primarily for separated or deserted people themselves in the first instance to seek maintenance from their spouses, using mediation services or by taking action through the courts under appropriate family law provisions. In recognition of this, one of the qualifying conditions for social welfare payment for separated or deserted people requires them to make appropriate efforts to obtain maintenance from their spouses.  The purpose of this is to ensure that spouses provide maintenance where appropriate and in accordance with means.  Where the maintenance is inadequate the Department of Social Welfare will provide income support based on means.  Statistics are not readily available in my Department on the total number of spouses who are successful in their maintenance efforts in this regard as only those who fail to get maintenance or get insufficient maintenance will apply or be eligible for social welfare support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where separated or deserted people are receiving a relevant social welfare payment, the Department has powers under the liability to maintain family provisions of the Social Welfare Acts to seek a contribution from the former spouses, or liable relatives, towards that payment.  To date some 20,000 cases have been examined to determine liability on the part of liable relatives to contribute to the Department.  Of these, 26 per cent of spouses have not been traced, 47 per cent are receiving social welfare payments.  The Department has concentrated on the subset of these cases &mdash; some 5,300 &mdash; where the liable relatives concerned are in employment and in a financial position to make some contribution towards the relevant benefit or allowance to their families.  This has proved to be a difficult and protracted <Col N="1342" /> process.  However, a total of nearly £1.35 million has been collected to date by the Department through this system.  Of this subset, some 20 per cent are not in a position to pay, over 7 per cent are paying and 7 per cent are in default; the balance are under investigation.  It is intended to extend this process, particularly in relation to spouses who have not been traced to date or who are defaulting on their contribution obligations under this legislation.</P>

      <P>I am concerned to ensure that social welfare beneficiaries receive their full entitlements. A variety of means are used for this purpose and these are improved on in the light of experience.</P>
      <P>Information on entitlements is widely available. This is disseminated in response to telephone and other inquiries, through booklets and leaflets which are available from a variety of sources, through radio and TV interviews and articles in the newspapers and through pre-retirement courses.</P>
      <P>Information leaflets and booklets relating to each scheme are available from any of the network of 58 social welfare local offices around the country.  Staff at these offices are in a position to provide detailed information on the full range of services available.</P>
      <P>The National Social Services Board and the independent voluntary sector also provide a very valuable service to the public.  They complement and enhance the information services provided at local level by my Department.  The transfer of responsibility for the National Social Services Board to the Department recognises this and was part of an ongoing process aimed at improving information services to the public.</P>
      <P>In addition to these general information services, my Department advises current beneficiaries of their potential entitlements as they approach pension age.  People who qualify for old age pensions are also eligible for additional benefits such as free electricity allowance.  Full information on these entitlements is supplied to each new pensioner.</P>
      <P>The provision of information has been examined as part of the Departments ongoing review of customer service under the strategic management initiative.  Arising out of this review I have decided to use paid advertising, starting this year, to publicise pensioner entitlements and the time limits and procedures for applications.  This is intended to complement the various initiatives mentioned and to ensure full and timely take-up of benefits to which people are legally entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past two years, a National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS) has been developed, an initiative that is now in its final stage of development. The NAPS is the principal domestic initiative aimed at tackling the problem of social exclusion in Irish society and is expressly designed to ensure that poverty will be among the issues at the top of the national agenda.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 states that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...the parties to the agreement are committed to putting a National Anti-Poverty Strategy in place as soon as possible.  Appropriate institutional arrangements will be put in place to support a NAPS, in particular by facilitating consultation, monitoring and evaluation, with a view to securing a targeting of resources and a mainstreaming of poverty issues.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The endorsement of the strategy in the Partnership 2000 national agreement is a clear indication that social exclusion, its causes, effects and repercussions, will be a central concern of both Government and the social partners.  Social exclusion is also a reality in virtually every EU member state.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, well aware one of the main causes of social exclusion is unemployment.  We made a significant contribution, during the Irish Presidency, to focus attention on what can be done, particularly by social protection systems, to combat unemployment.</P>
      <P>Drawing on the consensus reached at the informal meeting of Social Affairs Ministers in July, I and my EU colleagues agreed, at Council on 2 December 1996, a Resolution (Ref: Council Resolution 96/C 386/02) which set out the broad principles which would be applied, within national systems, in this regard.  Ministers indicated their commitment to develop new approaches aimed at helping to prevent people falling into unemployment; they also indicated that they would co-operate, under the aegis of the Commission, in the exchange of information between member states on practices and policies in this area.  Such commitments were directly reflected in the Dublin Declaration on Employment &mdash; The Jobs Challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality of social exclusion has also been addressed at EU level under three anti-poverty programmes conducted by the Commission since 1975, in which Ireland has fully participated.  The Commission presented a proposal to Council in November 1993 for a fourth programme, Poverty 4 to run from 1 July 1994 to 31 December 1999. Agreement for these programmes required unanimity, <Col N="1344" /> but this has not been forthcoming in the case of Poverty 4.</P>
    <P>One of the main stumbling blocks is concern on the part of two member states that the Council of Ministers does not have the necessary competence under the Treaty to adopt the proposal. The member states concerned continue to maintain that position, the main effect of which is to stymie effective action on social exclusion at EU level.</P>
    <P>EU programmes are not a substitute for effective measures to combat social exclusion at national level, of the type which we will be taking under the NAPS.  They can, however, provide significant added value to national programmes by encouraging and facilitating co-operation between member states through initiatives aimed at: improving knowledge; developing exchanges of information and best practices; promoting innovative approaches, and evaluating experiences.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the question of future EU competence in relation to social exclusion be clarified by an appropriate Treaty revision at the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC).  I therefore developed a proposal for a specific Treaty change and arranged to have it tabled at an early stage in the Intergovernmental Conference process by my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  This provision, if adopted, would not only provide the necessary competence for appropriate measures to be taken at EU level, but would also make combating social exclusion more central to the objectives of the Community.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Irish Presidency, I explained and discussed this proposal at numerous bilateral meetings with other EU social affairs Ministers.  I also addressed the European Parliament on the matter which adopted a resolution broadly supportive of our initiative.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to keep closely in touch with developments, particularly as the Intergovernmental Conference process is now in its final negotiating phase.  I intend taking advantage of my attendance at the meeting of the Social Affairs Council in Luxembourg tomorrow to have further informal discussions with my colleagues on the matter.  In the coming weeks, I will be doing whatever is required, in consultation with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, to bring this initiative to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>Although adoption of proposals under the Intergovernmental Conference process requires unanimity, I am hopeful from the wide degree of support which has already emerged for an initiative in this area that a clear basis for EU social exclusion measures will be included among the new Treaty provisions.</P>

      <P>The number of non-nationals currently in receipt of unemployment assistance from my Department is estimated at 3,000, the vast majority of whom are nationals of other EU countries.</P>
      <P>Social Welfare legislation does not require a minimum period of residence in Ireland before a person may apply for unemployment assistance. The entitlement of non-nationals to unemployment assistance thus falls to be determined in accordance with the same conditions as claims by Irish nationals.</P>

      <P>Under the Treaty of Rome, citizens of member states are entitled to travel to other member states to seek employment.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The study in question presents a detailed implementation plan for a basic income scheme, along the lines previously proposed by CORI. The study is a welcome addition to the growing volume of research on the topic of basic income in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will clarify what basic income means.  It would be a payment, made by the State, to all citizens, regardless of other income, family circumstances or labour force status.  Two main forms of basic income can exist: a full basic income would be high enough to replace all existing social welfare payments, while a partial basic income would be paid at a lower rate, and would thus require retention of part of the social welfare system for those with no other income.  The idea of basic income is not a new one; many such schemes have been discussed in the past in both academic and political circles.  However, the evidence to date for Ireland has suggested that the tax rates needed to fund such a scheme would make it <Col N="1346" /> extremely expensive.  This new study states that the growth in the economy in recent years, and the consequent growth in the tax base, means that the tax rates needed to fund the BI scheme now appear to be somewhat lower than previous studies have indicated.  While obviously the figures underlying this will need to be examined carefully, the topic of basic income clearly merits further consideration.  The current National Programme Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to carry out a further independent appraisal of the concept of, and full implications of, introducing a basic income payment, taking account of the work of the ESRI, CORI and the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare, as well as international research.  This latest report from CORI will be an important input into that study.</P>
    <P>The new study puts forward a number of basic income options, with different basic income rates and different tax implications.  All of these raise a number of issues which would have to be clarified further.</P>
    <P>First, the implications for some people on low incomes would need to be examined carefully. The ESRI research on basic income, and the expert working group on tax-social welfare integration both identified people on low incomes who would lose out under basic income. Examples would be some lone parents, some pensioners, and people on social welfare schemes which allow them to combine income from social welfare with income from employment &mdash; for example, the back-to-work allowance.  While CORI indicate that they would not intend these groups to lose out, the report does not give details of how this would be done.</P>
    <P>Second, the proposals involve substantial increases in marginal tax rates for most taxpayers. While CORI argue that there are individuals in the current system who face even higher tax-benefit withdrawal rates &mdash; for example, people in receipt of family income supplement who pay tax &mdash; the fact is that relatively small numbers of people are currently in this situation.  By contrast, in the basic income scheme, everyone with income apart from the BI itself would pay a marginal tax rate of between 44 per cent and 50 per cent on all such income.  Such high marginal tax rates could discourage participation in the paid labour force and could have an effect on the black economy.</P>
    <P>A third problem with basic income relates to migration.  There could be a tendency for people who have opted out of the market economy in other countries to choose to live in Ireland, to claim BI.  At the same time, young highly educated single people, with high earnings potential, would find that the tax rates in Ireland compared unfavourably with those abroad.  Given that one of the elements of our current economic boom has been foreign companies who are attracted here by our highly educated young workforce, this could have adverse economic, as well as social effects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> I look forward to seeing all these issues discussed and analysed further, particularly in the context of the overall appraisal of the scheme promised in the programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain disabled persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of last January the numbers availing of the scheme totalled 8,548.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget I announced that provision is being made for the payment of an additional amount equivalent to 50 per cent of their existing entitlement to carers who are providing full-time care and attention to more than one person.  This measure will come into effect from next June.</P>
      <P>Statistics are not maintained by my Department as to the number of carers who are providing two or more people with full-time care but it has been estimated that it may be as many as one in four.</P>

      <P>The voluntary sector has a long and valued tradition of meeting social needs in Ireland.  Many essential services are provided by voluntary organisations, and the voluntary and community sector is playing an increasing role in the areas of social service delivery, combating poverty and community development.  The important role of the sector is reflected in the substantial amount of funding &mdash; more than £425 million &mdash; annually which it receives from the Irish State, including national lottery funds, and EU sources.  I am satisifed that this level of funding <Col N="1348" /> represents a very considerable level of support for voluntary and community activity.  This funding is available from a range of Departments, with the largest amount being available through the health services for provision of personal social services for the elderly, mental handicap services, services for people with disabilities, child care services, women's refuges and other services.  A range of statutory and non-statutory, once-off and ongoing funding arrangements apply.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare administers the community development programme, the money advice and budgeting service and a number of grant schemes for women's groups, men's groups, lone parent groups etc.  The total allocation for these schemes in 1997 is £12.525 million. This represents an increase of over £4 million on the corresponding end-1994 figure.</P>
      <P>As already announced, I will be publishing a Green Paper on voluntary activity with a view to moving forward the debate about the role of the voluntary community sector and its relation with the State.  The Green Paper is intended to stimulate further debate and to facilitate further engagement between the statutory and voluntary sectors in relation to the issues involved.  The debate will help shape future Government policy in relation to the voluntary community sector.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper will cover issues such as suggested principles which should underpin the relationship between the State and the voluntary sector including the matter of representation in national policy making fora; suggestions regarding the method and source of funding for national representative structures for the voluntary sector; criteria to be attached to funding generally by statutory agencies; issues relating to charitable status and taxation issues; effective consultation mechanisms already in place both nationally and at EU level and the reasons for their effectiveness; and areas which could usefully be explored where models of statutory-voluntary sector co-operation should be actively encouraged.</P>
      <P>The finishing touches are being put to the Green Paper at present and it will be published in the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>A free telephone rental allowance is normally available only to people who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments such as old age and invalidity pensions, and who are either living alone or only with certain excepted people.  The categories of excepted people include children aged under 18, persons who are so incapacitated that they could not get help in an <Col N="1349" /> emergency and recipients of the carer's allowance from my Department.</P>
      <P>From next June, the conditions defining the categories of excepted people are being eased to include children aged under 22 years where they are in full-time education and persons providing full-time care and attention to any member of the household.  In the latter case, it will not be a requirement that the carer in question is receiving a carer's allowance from my Department.</P>
      <P>The free telephone allowance covers the cost of the normal telephone rental charges and up to 20 free call units in each two-monthly billing period.</P>
      <P>Last July, the free schemes of telephone rental allowance, electricity allowance and colour television licence were extended to low income pensioners who did not previously qualify because they did not get a social welfare pension.</P>
      <P>The further extension of the free telephone rental scheme to include all incapacitated persons needing full-time care, would have major cost implications which would have to be examined in a budgetary context and in the light of the resources available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The underlying purpose of the student summer job scheme which was introduced in 1993 is to provide summer work opportunities and income support for less well-off third level and post-leaving certificate students who were precluded from entitlement to unemployment assistance in that year.</P>
      <P>The scheme does not apply to students who have completed diploma or certificate courses in regional technical colleges, as they are not precluded from entitlement to unemployment assistance if they cannot find work.  It is not my intention to extend the scheme to include such categories.</P>
      <P>When the scheme commenced in 1993 a sum of £3 million was allocated.  As a result of improvements which I made in 1995 and 1996 a sum of £10.2 million was allocated towards last year's scheme and this year the Government has again approved expenditure of £10.2 million.  This will allow close to 16,000 students to participate.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> To date, 3,334 sponsors have registered over 23,000 jobs for the 1997 scheme.  Details of all the projects available under this year's scheme will be included in a sponsors' booklet which will be issued to all approved students with their job certificate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 25 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, one of the recommendations of the special task force on security for the elderly established in 1996, was that my Department introduce a once-off £2 million grant scheme to provide grant-aid to voluntary organisations in relation to security initiatives for the elderly.  That recommendation was accepted.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, I established a National Advisory Committee, on which the National Council for the Elderly, the Irish Association of Victim Support, the Reach Out Campaign, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Countrywomen's Association and the Garda Síochána Neighbourhood Watch scheme were represented, to advise on a suitable scheme that would ensure that the available funds were targeted on the most vulnerable older people and the best possible value for money was achieved.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the advice of this advisory committee and taking into account the amount of money available and the cost of security equipment, I decided that funding could be provided for: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems.</P>
      <P>The scheme was operated on a once off basis and was reviewed by the National Advisory Committee at the end of December 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> Expenditure under the scheme in 1996 was £2.562 million.  A total of 528 voluntary organisations received funding with some 14,944 individuals receiving assistance.  It is expected that a similar number of individuals will benefit in 1997.</P>
    <P>Based on the recommendation of the National Advisory Committee and the obvious need to ensure that the most vulnerable older people continue to be assisted I obtained a further £2 million in this year's budget to enable the scheme to continue in 1997.</P>
    <P>The scheme was advertised in the national papers on 12 March 1997 and the closing date for receipt of applications is 25 April 1997.  It is open for all community and voluntary organisations working with, or providing support for, the elderly to apply.  The scheme will operate on the same basis as it did in 1996.</P>
    <P>It was a recommendation of the special task force on security for elderly that to make the funds available through voluntary organisations was the most appropriate way of ensuring that the most vulnerable older people are targeted by the scheme.  I was aware that many voluntary organisations were already providing services such as those covered by the scheme and had developed expertise and local contacts.  Voluntary groups operate close to the ground and are aware of the greatest need in their communities.  Working with the voluntary sector to deliver these funds to the most needy has the advantage that individual older people need not make an application and can have their needs met with the minimum of administration and without the need for a formal assessment of their circumstances and visits by departmental staff.  I am satisfied that this is the most appropriate way in which to structure my Department's response to the situation. However, if there are pensioners who are concerned, they should contact their local office-regional office where they will be advised on how best to apply and every consideration will be given to meeting their concerns regarding confidentiality etc.</P>
    <P>Those who can benefit from the scheme include older people i.e. people aged 65 or over living alone or living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable. Priority in allocating available funds will be given to the most vulnerable older people.  Vulnerability is defined in terms of advanced age, disability and isolation.</P>

      <P>I have had a review of the insurability <Col N="1352" /> position of share fishermen and women for social insurance carried out in the Department.  Taking account of the working arrangements which apply to this group of workers, and the ruling of the European Court of Justice in the &ldquo;Agegate&rdquo; case, the legal advice available to the Department confirms that those persons who are employed under contract of service conditions are insurable at the ordinary class A rate and are eligible for all benefits. This situation applies under the present legislation and, therefore, amending legislation is not required.</P>
      <P>Persons who are employed under contract for service conditions, such as self-employed persons or partners in the venture are insurable at class S i.e. the self-employed categories.  The situation was explained to representatives of the fishing industry whom I met on 14 January last.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements come into effect immediately and share fishermen who are not self-employed nor partners in the venture should apply to their local social welfare officer if they have a claim for unemployment assistance &mdash; unemployment benefit, disability benefit or occupational injuries benefit, and their claims will be processed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Because of the long and complex history of this issue, there are a number of issues with regard to eligibility which have to be resolved and a small number of cases may have to be referred for decision to the scope section of the Department which deals with insurability matters.</P>
      <P>A working group in the Department examined these issues and an explanatory leaflet is being issued which includes guidelines about insurability of employment, registration for payment of PRSI and review by the Department of claims to benefit which may have been affected by the change in treatment regarding the rate of PRSI payable.</P>
      <P>The leaflet will be issued this week to each such person paying class S contributions.</P>
      <P>Any person who wishes to have a decision regarding the insurability of his or her employment should apply to the scope section at Marlborough Street, Dublin 1.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, entitlement to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance is subject to satisfying certain conditions provided for in law which require, <i>inter alia,</i> that the person concerned is capable of work, is available for work and is genuinely seeking work.  Where those conditions are not satisfied, payment of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance may be disallowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> Partnership 2000 also addresses the conditionality issue in relation to unemployment payments. Paragraph 4.33 states that</P>
    <P>in the context of the focus on unemployment and exclusion, enhancement of the real value of payments to the unemployed is based on the reciprocal obligations of society to provide decent incomes and worthwhile supports in job seeking for the unemployed, and of the unemployed to seek and accept reasonable employment, development and training oportunities.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the trend of successive significant reductions in the numbers signing on the live register in recent months give reassurance that those reciprocal obligations are increasingly being met.  The social welfare system itself is now more and more geared towards providing positive support to people who are making the transition from unemployment to employment.  A range of pro-employment measures has now been introduced to this end, including the expansion and enhancement of the back-to-work allowance, the retention of the medical card for three years by the long-term unemployed when they take up work; the retention of child dependant allowances for 13 weeks for unemployed people who take up work; improvements to income thresholds and the calculation of family income supplement; and the easing of requalifying conditions for unemployment benefit designed to be of particular benefit to casual and atypical workers.</P>
    <P>Overall, the impact of these measures has been very good.  We are now sending out the clear message that, with a combination of social welfare benefits and income from employment, people will always be better off at work.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be assured that I will continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure that weekly payments go only to those who are genuinely unemployed.</P>

      <P>Over the past few years the Government has introduced a wide ranging programme of new initiatives and extended existing programmes to encourage the unemployed to leave the live register and take up employment.</P>
      <P>In so far as my own Department is concerned I have adopted a pro-active and work supportive approach to encourage the unemployed and particularly the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force and a comprehensive programme of initiatives is in place.</P>
      <P>The back-to-work allowance scheme was introduced by my Department in 1993 to allow people who have been long-term welfare dependent to test employment and self-employment options and retain a foothold in the labour market while retaining some financial security for up to three years.</P>
      <P>There are over 17,300 people currently in receipt of the allowance along with secondary benefits such as medical card, rent or mortgage subsidy, fuel allowance etc.</P>
      <P>A number of other pro employment measures have been introduced by my Department to help unemployed people make the transition to full employment.  These measures include the following:</P>
      <P>Family Income Supplement</P>
      <P>The weekly income thresholds will be increased again by £10 from next June giving an additional £6 per week to most recipients.  FIS will now be calculated on earnings net of PRSI contributions and levies.</P>
      <P>Child Dependant Allowance</P>
      <P>This allowance was introduced by me last year and is payable for 13 weeks to those taking up employment who have been unemployed for at least 12 months.</P>
      <P>Part-Time Job Incentive</P>
      <P>This allows the long-term unemployed to take up part-time employment and receive a special income tax free supplement.  It helps people to make the transition to full employment via part-time work.</P>
      <P>Unemployment Assistance</P>
      <P>Changes have been introduced in the way earnings are assessed.  These have been designed to enable people to retain more take home pay when they take up part-time or casual employment.</P>
      <P>There are also a number of measures in place to encourage employers to create new job opportunities for the unemployed and to assist employers in the hard pressed labour intensive industries.  Significant improvements have been made in the PRSI system over the past few years to ease the financial burden on employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following measures have been introduced by other Departments as part of the Government's <Col N="1355" /> wide range of initiatives to tackle the unemployment problem and to ensure that people are significantly better off in employment: retention of the medical care for three years for those taking up employment after at least 12 months on the live register; and the work-place, Jobs Initiative and Jobstart schemes administered by FÁS.</P>
    <P>I will continue to take a pro-active and work supportive approach to job creation and retention of benefits and I will ensure that all the relevant programmes administered by my Department are geared towards this objective.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, as well as certain incapacitated people under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments. The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  Currently, about 470,000 people qualify for free travel at an estimated annual cost this year of some £32.6 million.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception.  They apply generally from 7.00 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  Monday to Friday inclusive and on Bus Éireann long distance buses from 4.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. on Fridays from up to 20 miles out from Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally-handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses and certain other disabled or blind people.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated to the House on many occasions, the central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints.  The time restrictions I have described have been put in place on city and provincial bus routes because the transport companies concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school in the morning and evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free travel scheme, in common with the other free schemes operated by my Department, is kept under constant review with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements.  The operation of the scheme is based on the use of spare capacity.  While the issue of time retrictions has been discussed with the CIÉ companies on a <Col N="1356" /> number of occasions, their position remains that the capacity constraints they face at peak hours do not allow for an easing of those time restrictions.</P>

      <P>Foreign Ministers from each of the member states of the European Union, with a representative of the European Commission, traditionally hold an informal meeting &mdash; the so called Gymnich-type meeting &mdash; during each Presidency.  During the Irish Presidency, I hosted such a meeting in Tralee.  These meetings are intended to allow for a more free-ranging discussion than is possible during the more formal sessions of the General Affairs Council.  I should stress that no formal decisions are taken or conclusions reached at such meetings.</P>
      <P>In the case of the informal meeting arranged by the Dutch Presidency on 15 to 16 March 1997 in Apeldoorn, a number of current topics were chosen for discussion, such as Albania and Zaire &mdash; on which Presidency declarations were subsequently issued &mdash; and EU enlargement.</P>
      <P>In this context, relations between the EU and Turkey were the subject of discussion by Ministers. It was agreed that the Presidency would pursue efforts to improve and develop relations between the Union and Turkey in the framework of the Customs Union.  Following the meeting, the Presidency indicated that discussion by Ministers had confirmed that the perspectives set out in the Association Agreement of 1963 and the Commission Avis of 1989 in respect of Turkey's application for EU membership remained valid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs: (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC) was established in 1991 by the UN Security Council to deal with claims for compensation from Iraq to individuals, companies, Governments and international organisations in respect of damages and losses incurred as a direct result of the invasion and occupation of Kuwait.  The Commission divided claims into six separate categories.  Category C is claims from individual for losses or damages up to US$100,000.</P>
      <P>The one claim of this person was lodged with my Department in April 1992 and, along with 160 others, was transmitted to the Commission by Ireland's permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva in June 1993.  Each country's category C claims all had to be presented to the Commission simultaneously.</P>
      <P>The Commission is still processing category C and other claims, giving priority to categories A and B over category C and giving the more straightforward category C claims priority over others in that category.  UN Security Council Resolutions 705 and 986 of 15 August 1991 and 14 April 1995 authorise the allocation of funds for payments to claimants.  However, the Commission has been in a position actually to make payments only since funds became available in January 1997 after the UN reached agreement with Iraq in May 1996 to allow a resumption of oil exports on condition that a percentage of the proceeds would be used for compensation purposes.</P>
      <P>Of the 174 Irish category C claims including 11 transferred from category B 61 have been recommended for payment so far and initial payments in respect of 20 of these are expected to be made in August 1997.  The Commission is to take decisions on others of the more straightforward category C claims, including Irish category C claims, in June and December 1997 but it will not consider the more complicated claims, including that of the person to whom this question relates, until 1998.</P>
      <P>The UNCC has received a total of some 2.64 million claims amounting to over US$200 billion. I am satisfied that the Commission is processing them systematically and fairly.  The main reason for the delay has been the non-availability until relatively recently of funds for payments.</P>
      <P>We are keeping all Irish claimants informed of the progress of their claims.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Training for people with disabilities is part of the Operational Programme for Human Resources 1994 to 1999 (OP).  Training agencies including the National Training and Development Institute receive European Social Funds in <Col N="1363" /> respect of their vocational training operations for people with a disability.</P>
      <P>The National Training and Development Institute (NTDI) is a subsidiary of the Rehab Group.  The Rehab Group which is a private company, has, I understand, taken a decision to close down its training centre at Ashtown, Dublin 15.</P>
      <P>However, NTDI does not intend to discontinue all aspects of apprenticeship training and in this regard plans to transfer its Apprenticeship Foundation and metal fabrication courses to its Tallaght centre and the material handling and carpentry-joinery courses to its Ballyfermot centre. There are currently four trainees on fitting apprenticeship in Ashtown under the old time served apprenticeship system.  NTDI has undertaken to support these trainees through the completion of their apprenticeship and the parents of the four trainees are being invited to a meeting with NTDI today to discuss the proposed arrangements.</P>
      <P>Outside of the OP under the new FÁS standards based apprenticeship provision has been made for persons with disabilities who meet entry requirements to undertake on-job-training with employers and off-job-training in FÁS designated training centres.  The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, <i>A Strategy for Equality</i>, recommended mainstreaming of training for people with disabilities.  In this regard, Partnership 2000 has a commitment for the reservation of 1,000 training places for people with disabilities on existing mainstream training courses.</P>

      <P>Following the publication of the task force's report in 1995, I established an interdepartmental group to examine the recommendations and report back within a fixed period.  The group's report was accepted by Government on 26 March 1996 and a comprehensive package of actions and services relating to the travelling community was announced.  The interdepartmental group has not met since then and it is not intended that it should meet further having regard to the fact that the various functions are the responsibility of individual Departments though, of course, I maintain an interest in the implementation process.  I regret that, when answering questions in the House on 11 March, I inadvertently stated incorrectly that the group still exists.</P>

      <P>Details of unestablished civil servants employed in my ministerial and constituency offices, to which I assume the Deputy's question is confined, are as stated in my reply to Question No.77 of 27 June 1995 (Volume 455 columns 108-110). It is not the practice to furnish the address of any staff members.</P>
      <P>The information sought as to whether any of the unestablished civil servants covered by section 19 of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, is a relative of the appointing office holder, is contained in statement under subsection (4) of that section, which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  In so far as I am aware, none of them is related to any of my ministerial colleagues.</P>
      <P>The initial date of appointment of unestablished staff, and commencement basic salaries, is contained in documents laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas under section 19 (4) of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 and is available in the Oireachtas Library.  My personal assistant and special adviser were also employed during my previous term of office, in the previous administration from July 1993 and January 1993, respectively, until November 1994.  I refer to reply to Parliamentary Question No.513 of 26 January, 1994 (Volume 437, No.6, column 1663-1664).  The salaries stated include an increase of £886 in respect of the latter, over his commencement salary in 1993.  Current total salary for these staff is unchanged since the Deputy last inquired in that regard &mdash; reply to Questions Nos.99 and 100 of 8 April 1997 refers.</P>
      <P>The expenses these staff received are included in my reply to Question No.120 of 22 October 1996 (Volume 470 columns 853-854).  Additional expenses were incurred to the amount of £1,674 in 1996.  In 1997, to date, expenses of £1,370 have been paid.  Expenses in 1993 were £446.</P>
      <P>None of the above named officers has changed grade or received any promotion since taking up duty.</P>
      <P>All of the staff in question are located in the head office of my Department which is based in Dún Aimhirgin, 43-49 Mespil Road, Dublin 4.</P>

      <P>I announced on 25 March 1997 a new scheme of water supply grants for houses not connected to either a public or group scheme water supply. The grants will amount to 75 per cent of the cost, up to a maximum grant of £1,600 per house, and will apply to the provision or necessary upgrading of a water supply.</P>
      <P>While I recognise that a general house improvement grants scheme would help to promote the conservation and improvement of the housing stock, I am particularly conscious of the cost of the previous scheme.  The Government's priorities in the housing area, as set out in A Government of Renewal are to expand the local authority and other social housing programmes and to upgrade deficient local authority dwelling. As the available resources will, accordingly, be concentrated on these programmes, I have no proposals, at this stage, to reintroduce a house improvement grants scheme.</P>

      <P>The management of their dwellings, including arrangements for rent collection, is a matter for each local authority. However, guidelines on best practice in housing management, prepared by the housing management group for local authorities, recommend that authorities should make available a range of convenient and flexible methods of rent payment, including the use of the household budget scheme, where it is available.  This matter is also being pursued with authorities in the context of workshops currently being held for local authority staff to promote the implementation of the guidelines.</P>

Where schemes have already been approved, the local authority will issue the grant allocation to the group as soon as possible.

Block grant allocations were notified to local authorities on 26 March, 1997 which take into account the commitments made.</P>

      <P>Since 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to primary schools in respect of clerical and caretaking services has been expanded in line with the PESP-PCW undertakings.  The scheme has been extended to more schools by a reduction of the qualifying enrolment with an ultimate target of all schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>A further stage of this phased programme will be introduced from September 1997.  It is not possible at this point to state the number of schools in South Tipperary who may benefit under this phase of the programme.</P>

      <P>I regret that due to the level of competing demands on limited resources I am not in a position to increase the capitation grant at primary level for 1997.</P>
      <P>I should point out, however, that since taking office I have made significant improvements in the level of funding for primary schools.  The standard rate of capitatation grant has been increased from a level of £28 in 1992 to its present level of £45 per pupil, an increase of more than 60 per cent.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across the whole education spectrum.  I must determine priorities and try to allocate resources to optimum effect.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to seek further increases in the level of the capitation grant as resources permit.</P>

I have now completed this review and have authorised my Department to proceed with the tender and contract process for a number of other projects.</P>
      <P>There were substantial cuts in the capital funding of primary schools in the 1988-92 period and there is a backlog of deserving projects.  The Government has provided additional resources for primary school buildings over the last four years and significant progress is being made in reducing the backlog.  However, there is a need to keep a tight control on public expenditure and it is not possible to allow all deserving projects to proceed simultaneously.</P>

      <P>The Government requested the Higher Education Authority (HEA) to undertake a general review of outreach centres of higher education institutions. A technical working group was established by the HEA, chaired by Professor Noel Mulcahy.</P>
      <P>The technical working group has made a draft interim report to the Higher Education Authority which proposes a model for outreach centres of education based on a mixed mode approach involving a range of levels of provision, to include a balanced provision of higher education, post leaving certificate courses and adult education.</P>
      <P>Additional work needs to be undertaken by the technical working group as the basis for a detailed review by the HEA.  However, the Higher Education Authority considered the model proposed by the technical working group to be sufficiently worthwhile and innovative to merit a pilot project. It recommended that Skibbereen would be the location for this.  A strong co-ordinated local involvement, including local financial support for the provision of facilities, was seen by the technical working group as critical to the success of the venture.  The Higher Education Authority envisages a focus on the telematic dimension of course delivery in the pilot project.</P>
      <P>Funding for the project will be determined in the light of detailed consideration of the implementation arrangements and specific proposals from Cork regional technical college.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of an application in respect of Clonmel for the installation of a Garda CCTV system.</P>
      <P>The CCTV schemes currently sanctioned for funding by my Department are the Temple Bar scheme, which has been operational since October, 1995, O'Connell Street, Dublin, the first phase of which became operational on 11 April 1997, and Finglas.  Work on the O'Connell Street system is expected to be completed shortly.  Preliminary work has commenced on the Tralee and Finglas systems.</P>
      <P>An advisory committee has been established by the Garda Commissioner, comprising higher officers in the Garda Síochána and an official from my Department, to examine all applications and proposals for CCTV systems as an aid to policing. I am informed that to date applications have been received in respect of over twenty locations for the installation of CCTV schemes and that these will be considered by the advisory committee with a view to determining priority.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that funding of CCTV systems is on a shared partnership arrangement with local business-community interests.  However, the capacity or otherwise of local business-community interests to provide funding will not be the sole criteria in determining whether State funding should be allocated to these schemes.  The Deputy should also note that the stimulus for these schemes has come from Chambers &mdash; Business Associations &mdash; Community Councils etc.  She may wish to pass this information on to local organisations in Clonmel so that they can consider planning a scheme for application.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.101 and 102 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of the prisons or places of detention under the aegis of my Department provide both outdoor and indoor recreational facilities for inmates.  The actual facilities available varies from institution to institution.  The outdoor facilities provide for exercise on a group and individual basis, where jogging, football, volley ball, and other such activities can take place.  All institutions have a supervised gymnasium which is used by inmates for a range of activities.  Supervision <Col N="1387" /> is provided by a qualified instructor.  Other facilities which are available in all institutions include television and video showings in a communal area.  Indoor activities such as snooker, pool, table tennis and board games are available at set times.  Limited library facilities are available in all prisons and newspapers and magazines are available on request.</P>
    <P>The level and standard of all services, including recreational ones, provided for prisoners are closely monitored by my Department and are reviewed, on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>The pay cost of a qualified prison officer-gym instructor including allowances is £19,110 per annum, based on the mid-point of the scale.  The cost is the same irrespective of the number of prisoners being supervised.  Prisoners tend to use the gymnasia extensively and one-to-one instruction would be extremely rare.</P>

Newpapers and magazines are, however, purchased for official purposes as is the practice in the rest of the Civil Service.  In addition, newspapers and magazines are purchased for use in prison libraries and education units as part of literacy and reading programmes &mdash; these incorporate reading material for all levels of literacy.  The total cost to the Exchequer for the supply of newspapers and magazines to prisons in 1996 was £16,049.59.</P>
      <P>The newspapers and magazines supplied in 1996 are broadly similar to those provided in 1995, as outlined in Parliamentary Question No. 223 dated 2 April 1996.</P>

      <P>These replies include details such as the names of the non-established staff in my private and constituency offices, their job-titles and their remuneration in 1996.  None of these people has been promoted during my period in office.</P>
      <P>My Department does not maintain records in respect of previous employment of staff members.  The following schedule lists the dates on which they commenced their employment in this Department, their starting salary as at that date and their current salary.  None of the non-established staff in my private or constituency offices is related to myself or to any member of the Government.</P>
      <P>The expenses paid to the aforementioned employees in each of the years since I took office are as follows: December 1995: £377; 1996: £4,648.59 and 1997 to date £200.  There were no expenses paid in 1994.</P>
      <P>Two of the staff in question are based at the Department of Justice, St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2.  My personal secretary is located in my constituency office in Swords.  I trust the Deputy will understand that it is not policy to give the home addresses of any member of staff.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, he has taken to assist the once-off position of the 12,000 self-employed persons who entered the social insurance scheme from 6 April 1988 over the age of 56, all of whom have now reached pension age and have been refused pensions.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia,</i> have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age. This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to all insured people.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, self-employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension. They are covered for widow's, widower's and orphan's pensions subject, of course, to satisfying the normal qualfying criteria.</P>
      <P>However, self-employed people in that age group who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 could qualify for the old age contributory pension as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
      <P>Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  In this year's budget I provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that self employed contributors who entered insurance in 1988, but were already over the age of 56 at that time and who had previously paid social insurance as an employee, will now be able to receive a refund of the pensions element of their self-employed social insurance provided, again, that they do not qualify for an old age contributory or non-contributory pension. Heretofore, their earlier contributions precluded them from receiving such a refund.</P>
      <P>Detailed consideration has been given by my Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self-employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  In this regard, costings done in 1989 estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned. These costings are currently being reviewed in the context of the actuarial review of social welfare pensions being carried out by a team of consultants for my Department.  Preliminary figures indicate that the cost is now estimated at £500 million, based on 20,000 claiming, but as I have already said this figure will be updated in the context of the actuarial review. The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self-employed contributors generally to finance the 1989 costings was estimated at 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.  Allowing self-employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years' contributions in order to qualify for an old age contributory pension would also be very costly to the Exchequer unless the payments made by the individual self-employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis. The cost of an individual contributor of buying rights on this basis would be prohibitive.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to relax the requirement that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>

      <P>I understand the person concerned, who was a recipient of the back to work allowance, came to a verbal agreement with his employer, who is also a recipient of the allowance, in relation to payment of the costs of business calls. Any such agreement would be a matter between the parties concerned.  The local jobs facilitator of my Department has interviewed the employer concerned and is satisfied that no further action can be taken by her to resolve this issue.  There are no funds available to my Department from <Col N="1391" /> which recompense could be made to the person concerned in circumstances of this kind.</P>

I will write to the Deputy about his matter when my Department investigations have been completed.</P>

      <P>The household budgeting scheme allows for deductions to be taken from certain social welfare payments and paid over on the customer's behalf to a number of utilities, including local authorities.  At present the scheme is available to people who receive their payments through the post office network by means of post-draft payment.</P>
      <P>Of the 29 county councils and ten corporations in the country all are participating in the scheme apart from Cavan, Kildare, Laois, Monaghan, Offaly and Sligo County Councils and Drogheda and Sligo Corporations.  Nineteen of the 49 urban districts councils are participating in the scheme.</P>
      <P>In most cases the local authorities not yet participating cover areas where the service to social welfare customers is provided by social welfare branch offices.  The necessary level of computerisation has not yet been achieved in the branch offices to allow for household budgeting to be offered to customers.  An Post charge each local authority for the deduction service and this allows for the service to be offered free to the customer. There are just over 6,500 deductions made for local authorities under the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which a person (details supplied) in County Mayo could have been medically assessed for a disability allowance without actually being physically seen by a doctor, when his own general practitioner certifies this man is not capable of work; the reason it took four months from the date this person's application was received by his Department before he was seen by a medical examiner; when an oral hearing will be scheduled for this man in view of the fact that his application has already taken six months to process so far; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos.109, 110, 111, 112 and 113 together.  An application for disability allowance was received in my Department from the person concerned on 13 November 1996.  A medical assessor of the Department then examined the case and, taking into account the medical details outlined by the person's doctor on the application form, considered that he did not satisfy the medical criteria for receipt of disability allowance.  A deciding officer decided on 29 January 1997 that the person did not satisfy the medical conditions for receipt of disability allowance.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed this decision and the appeal was received at the social welfare appeals office on 12 February 1997.  The appeals officer, having considered the grounds of appeal, decided that a medical examination was warranted. Accordingly on 12 March 1997 he was examined by a medical assessor who considered that he did not satisfy the necessary medical criteria.</P>
      <P>An oral hearing of the person's case has been arranged to take place in Westport in the week commencing 26 May 1997.  He will be informed directly of the time and venue as soon as arrangements are in place.</P>
      <P>To qualify for disability allowance a person must be suffering from an injury, disease, illness or physical or mental disability which has continued or is likely to continue for at least one year.  As a result of this condition a person must be substantially handicapped in undertaking work which would otherwise be suitable having regard to age, experience and qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evaluation of the medical condition is conducted by my Department's medical assessors who are qualified and experienced medical practitioners. They examine each case on its merits and advise a deciding officer whether in their opinion, a particular applicant meets the criteria <Col N="1393" /> and where doubt exists they recommend that a formal medical examination be undertaken.</P>
    <P>In a small number of cases, where the available medical evidence suggests that the incapacity is of a mild, moderate or short-term nature they may advise, without conducting a further examination, that the medical criteria are not met.</P>
    <P>The majority of disability allowance cases are decided within six weeks.  However, where medical examinations and/or appeals are involved the timescale can be significantly longer.  In this case the period between date of claim, 13 November 96, and decision issuing, 29 January 97, was 11 weeks.  This delay was primarily due to the fact that following the transfer of the disability allowance scheme to my Department backlogs arose because of a higher than anticipated volume of new claims and additional work arising in the transfer process.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is compiled at the end of each year.  The position at the end of 1996, 1992 and 1989 is contained in the following table.</P>
      <P>The table shows that there has been a steady increase in the numbers of people in receipt of contributory pensions, either old age or retirement, and a steady decrease in the numbers of people in receipt of means-tested old age non-contributory pensions, reflecting the growing importance of social insurance.</P>
      <P>There has also been an increase in the number of recipients of invalidity pension and a corresponding decrease in the numbers in receipt of disability benefit.  This reflects the movement of people from disability benefit to invalidity pensons in cases of very long-term illness so that they are no longer obliged to produce medical certificates on a regular basis to maintain their payments.</P>
      <P>The significant increase in the number of recipients of contributory widow's and widower's pensions is largely because of the extension of coverage to widowers from October 1994.</P>
      <P>The steady increase in the numbers of people parenting alone during the period in question is reflected in the increased numbers of people in receipt of the one parent family payment.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is contained in the following table which shows that 245,020 people were in receipt of an unemployment payment.  Approximately 30,000 of these are part-time workers which means that 215,000 can be regarded as unemployed in the strict sense of the term.</P>
      <P>Section (1a) of this table shows that the number of persons on the live register on 28 March 1997 who were in receipt of either an unemployment benefit or an unemployment assistance payment was 245,020.  A further 17,394 people on the live register were signing for credited contributions only and, therefore, receive no payment and are not generally regarded as actively seeking work.</P>
      <P>Section (1b) shows the number of persons who were receiving a payment or credited contribution who are not included on the live register.</P>

      <Quest>the recommendation by the Commission on Social Welfare Payments in 1985 for the minimum adequate income required by a single person; the equivalent in 1997 terms; the actual level in 1997; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In 1985 the Commission on Social Welfare made a number of alternative estimates of the minimum income required for one adult which they termed the &ldquo;Main Rate&rdquo;.  All of the estimates were in the range of £50 to £60 weekly in 1995 terms.  This range is equivalent to between £69.20 and £83 in 1997 terms.</P>
      <P>The payment rates announced in the 1997 budget are set out in the attached table which also shows these rate as a percentage of the Commission's &ldquo;Main Rate&rdquo;.  I am pleased to confirm that old age contributory, retirement, widow's and invalidity pensions, deserted wife's benefit and carer's allowance will be at or above the recommended rate when the improvements announced in the 1997 budget take effect in June 1997 and that most other payments will reach 98 per cent of the recommended rate in June 1997, while the lowest rates, supplementary welfare allowance and short-term unemployment assistance, will reach 95 per cent of the recommended rate.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to implementing the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to achieve this during the lifetime of the agreement.</P>

      <P>The percentage of those on the live register at Dublin and Galway local offices of my Department is 30.8 per cent and 5.4 per cent respectively.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the recently enacted Social Welfare Act, 1997 provides for increases in the weekly rates of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance which are well in excess of the projected rate of inflation for 1997.  In addition, a range of pro-employment measures has been announced in this year's budget which includes the following: provision for certain social welfare recipients to continue to get increases for dependent spouses where the spouses income is between £60 and £90 a week.</P>
      <P>Retention of child dependant allowance for 13 weeks for social welfare recipients who take up employment immediately following a community employment scheme or who take up employment under the jobs initiative scheme.</P>
      <P>Improvements in family income supplement which, from June 1997, will be calculated on the basis of gross earnings less PRSI contributions and levies.  The income thresholds will be increased by £10 per week at each point, which will mean that most families getting FIS will be at least £6 a week better off while an additional 1,000 low paid workers with children will now qualify for a FIS payment.</P>
      <P>An easing of the conditions for requalifying for unemployment benefit which is designed to be of particular benefit to casual and part-time workers.  Approximately 10,000 people will benefit under this revised arrangement.</P>
      <P>A reduction of 1 per cent in the Class A rate of employees PRSI, from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>An increase of 5,000 in the number of places on the back to work allowance scheme bringing the limit from 17,000 to 22,000 with 1,000 places reserved for a pilot scheme for people with disabilities. In addition, substantial additional resources are being provided for technical assistance grants for back to work allowances recipients and a loan guarantee fund will be set up to allow credit unions provide low-interest loans to back to work allowance recipients.</P>
      <P>A special fund of £300,000 for projects to assist unemployed people return to work is being established.</P>
      <P>I will continue to work towards ensuring that the social welfare system is capable of providing the supports necessary to ease the transition from unemployment to employment.</P>

      <Quest>the consideration, if any, he has given to increasing the living alone allowance to social welfare recipients in 1997 in view of the fact that he failed to grant an increase in the budget announcement in January 1997; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The living alone allowance of £6 per week is payable as an addition to weekly social welfare pensions to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who reside alone.  While the living alone allowance was substantially increased, 22 per cent in last year's budget, pensioners have also benefited substantially from a 12 point package of measures announced in last January's budget which will directly improve the position of pensioners and carers.  I refer the Deputy to my <Col N="1399" /> reply of 25 February 1997 in which I provided him with details of those measures as announced in my budget speech of 23 January 1997 as follows: £3 per week increase in personal rates and £1.50 per week in adult dependant allowances from next June; introduction of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions for pensioners whose yearly average of contributions over their working lifetime is between 10 and 20; refunds of PRSI contributions for certain self-employed contributors; easing of the means test including the exemption of rental income in certain circumstances; retention of treatment, dental and optical, benefits for certain pensioners; extending the time-limit for late claims from pensioners; improvements to the free schemes of free electricity allowance, free telephone rental allowances and the free travel companion pass; and significant improvements to the carer's allowance including an extra 50 per cent for certain carers and easing of the rule requiring full-time care and attention in certain circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised that the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment, can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities. This problem has also been highlighted in various reports, including the final report of the Expert Working Group Report on Integrating Tax and Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The policy direction of this Government has, therefore, been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit and this has been continued in the 1997 budget package.  This approach involves increasing child benefit as part of a planned strategy of moving towards a more integrated child income support system.</P>
      <P>Child benefit remains one of the most effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes as it is not taxable, is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc.  Therefore, it cannot act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, priority has been given in the last three budgets to assisting low income families and in particular, larger families.  This has been achieved by increasing the higher rate of child <Col N="1400" /> benefit, payable in respect of third and subsequent children from £25 in 1994 to £39 this year.  In addition, the lower rate of child benefit, payable in respect of the first and second child, has been increased from £20 in 1994 to £30 this year.  This represents an increase of 50 per cent in the rate payable in respect of the first two children and 56 per cent in the higher rate payable in respect of third and subsequent children since this Government came to office.</P>
    <P>In addition, in the context of reducing disincentives to work, priority has been given to utilising family income supplement (FIS) as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children.  Accordingly, FIS is being reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages, as at present.  This will significantly increase the supplements payable under the scheme, thereby increasing the rewards from work.  As a first step, this year's budget provides that, with effect from June, FIS will be calculated on the basis of gross earnings less any PRSI contributions and levies payable. Pension contributions will also be deductible.  The income thresholds governing entitlement to FIS have also increased by £20 at each point since 1995.  These measures will mean that virtually all FIS recipients will be at least £12 better off since this Government took office.</P>
    <P>Another improvement I introduced last year to overcome disincentives to work was to provide for the continued payment of child dependant allowances for a period of 13 weeks to people who have been in receipt of an unemployment payment for 12 months or more, when they take up employment which is expected to last for at least four weeks.  This measure overcomes one of the obstacles faced by some families during the transition from unemployment to work, as it can take some weeks for a person taking up employment to establish entitlement to FIS.</P>
    <P>These real improvements which have been introduced since 1995 clearly demonstrate this Government's commitment towards providing genuine supports for families, whether in or out of work.</P>

      <Quest>if he has concluded his review of the Defence Forces in relation to section 11 of Statutory Instrument 156 of 1954; and the changes, if any, he intends to make in this regard.</Quest>

      <P>The regulations referred to by the Deputy make provision for the terms and conditions under which qualified PRSI contributors and their dependent spouses are entitled to receive dental, optical and aural benefits under the treatment benefits scheme administered by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> Current arrangements provide that, in the case of serving members of the Defence Forces, entitlement to those benefits is limited to the provision or repair of dentures and optical appliances.  This reflects the fact that the Department of Defence operates a health scheme for those members covering primary dental and optical treatment but excluding the provision of dentures, spectacles, contact lenses or hearing aids.  This limitation on benefit applies only for the duration of the member's period of service and entitlement to the full range of dental and optical benefits is restored on discharge from the Defence Forces.  In addition, the limitation does not apply at any time to qualifying dependent spouses of serving members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Following my review of the existing arrangements, I have decided that the continued exclusion of serving members of the Defence Forces from assistance towards the cost of contact lenses and hearing aids under the treatment benefit scheme is no longer justified.  I propose, therefore, to introduce the necessary regulations to rectify this position in the near future.</P>

    <P>Ms Mary Cummins was appointed by me on 19 January 1996 as the Department's press officer on an annual salary of £28,000.  Her present annual salary is £29,135.  Ms Cummins is located in Dublin.</P>
    <P>None of the above officers has been promoted since commencing employment in this Department. They are not related to me or any of my ministerial colleagues.</P>
    <P>The home addresses of all staff are treated as confidential by my Department and I am, accordingly, not prepared to put the home addresses of non-established staff on record.</P>
    <P>It would require an inordinate amount of time and effort to provide the Deputy with detailed information on expenses incurred by each non-established officer since commencing employment in my Department and at a resultant level of public expense which I could not consider justified in the circumstances.  However, I can confirm that expenses are paid in accordance with the normal Civil Service regulations.</P>

A preliminary sample survey of participants who left the programme having completed 12 months' participation was carried out by the ESRI in 1996 and indicated that 29 per cent had found full time employment; 20 per cent had found part time employment; 7 per cent were self employed and 10 per cent had entered full time education programmes or progressed to specific skills training programmes.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has made or intends to make to the Department of Finance to more fully utilise the potential of Knock International Airport for the development of industry and job creation in the west and north west regions where so many more job opportunities than are currently being provided are badly needed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made no proposals to the Department of Finance in relation to Knock International Airport, and have no immediate plans to do so.</P>
      <P>However, the industrial development agencies under my remit, such as Forbairt, IDA Ireland and the county enterprise boards, are regionally based so as to give an added impetus to the development of indigenous firms and attraction of overseas companies to regionally dispersed locations around the country.  I have described in detail in this House in recent times the importance I and the Government attach to getting an equitable spread of new investments around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forbairt views the development of Knock International Airport as a key element of the infrastructural development of the west and north-west of Ireland.  The development of transport infrastructure helps both Irish and overseas owned companies located in these regions to overcome the real and perceived disadvantages of their peripheral location <i>vis-á-vis</i> the European <Col N="1405" /> market.  This applies to the accessibility of the area for key management and marketing personnel as well as for the transport of raw materials and finished products.</P>
    <P>For its part, IDA Ireland has had discussions with local interests regarding developments at Knock International Airport.  Provision of suitable facilities at Knock would make the location more attractive for airport-related businesses. IDA Ireland's view is that a successful air freight service operating out of Knock would assist in promoting overseas investment in Mayo and the north-west generally.</P>

He was paid £1,234.02 on 11 November 1996 representing an 80 per cent advance of his 1996 suckler cow premium.  The person concerned has not yet received his balancing payment of £308.50.</P>
      <P>During the course of checking the lands declared in this case, it transpired that there is a discrepancy between what the herdowner has claimed, i.e. 41.6 hectares, and what was found when the plots were digitised, i.e. 39.39 hectares. As a result of this apparent overclaim which exceeds the acceptable percentage tolerance, my Department will be in contact with the person named shortly with a view to resolving the problem and having payment made at the earliest opportunity.</P>
