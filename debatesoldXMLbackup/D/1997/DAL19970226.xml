      <P>It is proposed to take item No 1, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996 &mdash; amendments from the Seanad; No. 21 the Credit Union Bill, 1996 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 4, the Equal Status Bill, 1997 &mdash; order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Private Members' Business shall be No. 49 &mdash; Punishment of Aggravated Robbery Bill, 1997 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed) and it is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on the Second Stage thereof shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <P>Even though the Taoiseach told me the complex legislation dealing with syringe attacks would not be ready for several months, yesterday the Government announced its proposals in that regard.  Was it a coincidence that Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill on the matter was being debated?  If I were to ask Deputy O'Donoghue to publish a court officers Bill, a prisons board Bill and a bail Bill next week &mdash; which he would be capable of doing &mdash; would the Government also publish its proposals on them next week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should take legislation on crime seriously.  The referendum on bail was held on 29 November.  He stated approximately five times in the House since Christmas that the legislation on bail would be available shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the promise in the programme for Government to establish an interdepartmental committee with an independent chairman to review the objectives and procedures for the distribution and allocation of national lottery funds, the Taoiseach stated last June that he was awaiting a report from the Minister for Finance before setting it up.  Has he appointed an independent chairman to that committee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased Deputy Ahern raised the bail issue.  When his party was in Government it referred the matter to the Law Reform Commission and asked it not to make recommendations so that the Government would not have to do anything about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In contrast, when we came into office we acted on the matter.  We passed the referendum and the legislation will be ready.  It is <Col N="887" /> wonderful that the Opposition get a surge of new ideas on matters they did nothing about when they were in Government.  They use the Order of Business to find out what the Government is going to do and when they are to do it.  Then they try to produce something that is to anticipate what the Government is doing a day or two before the Government produces it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Tragically, it appears that another violent death occurred yesterday in Kerry.  Does the Taoiseach deem it appropriate that a new deputy State pathologist be based in the southern region in view of delays in the State pathologist getting to the scenes of these deaths?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the photograph in one of today's tabloids shows a deplorable insensitivity to the family of the murdered young man?  Does he have a comment <Col N="888" /> on the standard of what newspapers are publishing in order to sell copies?  It is deplorable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the characteristics of any civilisation is respect for the dead.  The matter to which the Deputy refers indicates a lack of civilisation on the part of those concerned.  Civilised standards are not simply for application by politicians. Those who preach civilised standards to politicians should also practise them.</P>

      <P>When answering questions yesterday, the Minister for the Environment said there would be an increase of 3 per cent in car tax next year and the following year, and that after that there would be no increases other than by Government decision.  In an announcement of 19 December, it was said that local authorities would have discretion to vary the national rate by not more than 6 per cent in 1999 and subsequent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have signed no advertising contracts because the achievements of this Government are so well known that they require no advertisement.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Thankfully, we are in the final days of the 27th Dáil and the Taoiseach speaks of achievements.  One of the commitments in his programme for Government was to a vigorous third force in banking.  Would he agree that it is now unlikely that that will be considered before this Dáil ends?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>In this case the application of VAT occurs under the EU Sixth VAT Directive which has been in effect since 1977.  It is not a new provision and the enforcement of the law is a matter for the independent judgment of the Revenue Commissioners.  Decisions are taken by them in their independent function.  The Government, in conjunction with the social partners, is concerned about the adequacy and availability of child care facilities and the contribution they make in allowing persons to take up paid employment. A working group is being established under the programme, Partnership 2000, to investigate the matter.  Any matter that the Deputy wishes to raise can be raised in the context of the Finance Bill but this matter of the adequacy and availability of child care facilities is being pursued actively by the Government in conjunction with the social partners.  The question of whether guidelines should be issued on the application of VAT under the EU Sixth Directive, which is the law and from which Ireland cannot exempt itself as a member of the European Union, is under consideration by the Revenue Commissioners in their independent function.  They interpret and apply the law which is either made in this House or, as in this instance, at EU level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is much needed.  Certain aspects of it were sought for many years and I agree with the provision which will allow a longer period for loans.  This is most important because a five year period was not long enough.  I also welcome the provision which will allow young people under the age of 16 to deal with credit unions.  It is most important to give young people an opportunity to save for particular items.  The need to train them in the discipline of saving money is most important.</P>
      <P>No organisation or movement since Sir Horace Plunkett founded the co-operative movement has contributed so much to the economy and the financial well being of so many families, particularly those which do not have disposal incomes.  We should be eternally grateful to credit unions, large and small, in towns and rural areas.  However, I have a difficulty with the proposal to cap loans at £20,000.  I agree that the level of deposits should be increased from £6,000 to £20,000 but I have a problem with the cap on loans.  Under the old regime the cap on shares was £6,000 and most credit unions used a rule of thumb to gear the amount of loans against the amount of shares at a ratio of three or four to one.  This meant many credit unions could have provided loans in excess of £20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need for the cap because one of the great characteristics of the credit union movement is that unless a member first saves with the credit union, he or she is not entitled to a loan. The regulatory regime of credit unions is strictly applied and all the members at supervisory level are trained.  That will still be the case and there is no reason the cap should not be raised to a much higher level.  A clause should be inserted in the legislation to allow a percentage of the total assets of a credit union to be used.  Some people might glibly state that, if that was allowed, a member could get a huge loan like that from a large building society.  However, that is not the <Col N="896" /> case because the credit union movement is so regulated that the amount of a loan is always related to the amount of shares held, the ability to repay, family circumstances and many other aspects.  There is no danger that somebody could buck the system and get a much bigger loan. There should be flexibility in this area.</P>
    <P>This matter and other small points should be considered in terms of the record of building societies over many years.  There have never been scandals in building societies despite the fact that they deal with millions of pounds every year.  The operation of that system seems a miracle, but it is because its regulatory system works so well.  The cap on loans should be raised.  The Bill is good and I have no problem supporting it but goodwill should ensure the cap on loans is raised.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time.  I am glad at last to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this legislation.  In common with most public representatives in my area I was invited last autumn to emergency meetings of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  The representatives outlined their great anxiety about the delay in the introduction of the legislation and their concerns for their 1.6 million members.  They said they urgently needed a legislative framework under which they could serve the current and future needs of the members of credit unions.  We were asked to expedite the legislation and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, should be congratulated on introducing the Bill for consideration before the House moves on to other business.</P>
      <P>A primary objective of the credit unions was the introduction of this legislation.  Once introduced it can be debated and further changes can be made sought.  I have files dating back a few years on constituents, members of credit unions in semi-State companies, who held off moving house in the hope that this legislation would allow them borrow money through their credit union, with which they have a record of saving and a strong relationship.  The Minister has done good work in this legislation, the introduction of which was delayed because of a change of Government.  It is important it is passed while there are a number of months left to debate it in this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members attended briefing sessions with officials of credit unions with a positive sense of their contribution to their constituencies.  I certainly had that positive sense in regard to the credit unions in my constituency.  I have been most intimately involved with the Ballymun credit union which has developed and expanded during my time as a public representative.  Most of the other credit unions in my constituency, of which there are eight, were long established.  However, the Ballymun credit union developed at a time of crisis in Ballymun when one of the main banks made a high profile withdrawal from the area at a time of fairly difficult social pressure.  A crisis <Col N="897" /> often provides an opportunity to review the position and people often discover resources they did not know they had.  A good development that resulted from the withdrawal of that bank was a decision by the people to stand on their own feet and develop their own credit union.  It is extremely successful now and has a fine premises in the local shopping centre and a significant membership.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the profile of the activities of the credit unions in my area.  For large tracts of working class Dublin credit unions provide credit and a relationship with a financial institution that is particularly attractive to their members and sensitive to their needs.  Latterly credit unions have become involved in advising people on coping with debt and their existence ensures their members do not need to avail of the more expensive services offered by loan sharks.  Credit unions assist people socially and financially.</P>
    <P>I was amazed that the eight credit unions in my area have almost 33,000 members whose savings and borrowings are substantial.  The premises in which they conduct their business have been upgraded, opening hours have been extended and they have recruited full-time staff.  I was amazed that 30 people, including part-time and full-time staff, are working in credit unions in my area. There are more than 1,300 to 1,400 employed in the movement nationally.  They provide a great voluntary service and that element will remain. The major source of the strength of the movement is the voluntary element and that accounts for much of its central labour, but the growth in associated full-time and part-time employment is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Credit union members were anxious that this legislation should be introduced because they were frustrated at the limit applying to the level of loans available and they wanted some certainty as to their future.  Members were anxious to borrow more and to introduce new technologies to enable credit unions to provide a facility that has become an accepted feature of banking and a major convenience, a cash dispensing machine, which is desirable and economic in terms of the utilisation of staff.</P>
    <P>I accept eaten bread is soon forgotten.  The Minister of State has got less of the credit for introducing the legislation and more of the criticism for what might or might not be in it.  I am encouraged by the fact that he indicated his openness to meet with all interested groups to consider substantial amendments and to address some of the remaining issues.  The only factor that needs to be protected in this legislation is the voluntary and personal nature of the movement which should be allowed to expand naturally without losing its essential voluntary and personal quality, a one to one relationship which is special to credit unions and fundamental to the manner in which they know their members and operate their credit facilities.  Subject to protecting that special ethos, I urge the Minister in this historic legislation to go as far as possible in freeing the credit unions <Col N="898" /> to develop their businesses to the extent they wish for the benefit of their members and society in general.</P>

      <P>Some great developments, such as rural electrification, group water schemes and movements like the agricultural co-operatives established by Horace Plunkett and the credit unions, have brought social and economic prosperity to this country.  There are 550 credit unions on this island with a membership of 1.5 million, approximately 30 per cent of the population.  It is a substantial movement that has brought great prosperity and social and economic development.</P>
      <P>Credit unions, and I include those in my constituency, have fulfilled their vision and commitment. A report of the Irish League of Credit Unions states that its vision is that credit unions will satisfy the social and economic needs of their members with dignity and integrity by offering, in a co-operative manner and on a not for profit-making basis, full financial service for everyone in the community who wishes to join.  As the credit unions have fulfilled their vision and commitment, will the Minister take account of the Irish League of Credit Unions' reservations about this Bill?  It is too restrictive, particularly in that the maximum loan available is £20,000.  A credit union could grant a loan of £20,000 in 1996.  From my experience of credit unions I consider they are objective in their decisions to grant loans. They have not lost shareholders' or members' money since their establishment.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider raising the maximum loan available to at least £30,000 and to take account of the reservations of credit unions about the size of deposits.  Rather than treating all credit unions the same, the Minister should take account of the size of individual credit unions.  Rather than imposing ceilings on savings, he should consider the percentage of savings in individual credit unions.  I appreciate what he is trying to achieve in the legislation, but as the amount of money at the disposal of credit unions varies considerably, he should ensure that each credit union is able to operate to the best of its ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another of my reservations about this Bill relates to the right of credit unions to invest in property.  It must be remembered that the credit union movement has done a very good job and made a major contribution to economic development, some of which related to its investment in property.  In the town of Ballybay the movement is currently involved in providing new credit union premises and a health board facility to be leased to the regional health board.  That is desirable. But for the credit union movement having engaged in a number of such worthwhile projects similar facilities would not be available in other <Col N="899" /> areas much to the disadvantage of the communities they serve.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to review that restriction on the movement's investment in property.  Since the credit union movement generally is expanding very rapidly, it should be permitted to buy appropriate premises for future use when they become available.  From my understanding of the Bill it will be unable to do so unless it has immediate use for them.  That certainly does not make good economic sense.</P>
    <P>Section 43 imposes a restriction on what credit unions can do with their surplus funds.  Will the Minister review that restriction, examine what they have been doing and not introduce more restrictive practices?  The town of Clones has been devastated by partition and is surrounded on three sides by the Border.  Many of its roads were blocked for 25 years.  When they were reopened the townspeople decided they would like to regenerate their town.  Moneys available through the European Union had to be matched. The credit unions provided a sum of £100,000 for that purpose.  Surely nobody would suggest that was an undesirable thing to do?  I appeal to the Minister not to make their rules any more restrictive. Good legislation should contain the minimum of rules and regulations in the case of the credit union movement which has such a good track record.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister also to give the Irish League of Credit Unions a major role.  I am surprised it has not been included in the Bill since it too has a very good track record in regulating the movement.  I understand members of that league pay anything up to 3,000 visits annually to credit union premises.  The Registrar of Friendly Societies will be unable to perform the functions vested in him by the Bill without some assistance.  There is a precedent in section 94 of the Central Bank Bill, 1989 which would permit such a role for the Irish League of Credit Unions.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the contribution of the credit union movement to social and economic development.  Another advantage which must be recognised is the movement's association with the Department of Social Welfare through the MABS, representing a substantial contribution to those dependent on social welfare assistance who encounter all sorts of difficulties in meeting their financial commitments.  It is to the credit of the movement that it is involved with the Department of Social Welfare in alleviating that burden for many people.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to re-examine the time-consuming, expensive right of appeal to the High Court and ascertain whether most appeals could not be conducted through the District Court. While there may be instances when it will be necessary to resort to the High Court, I anticipate that many others could well be dealt with by the District Court.  I want the Minister to examine those issues of concern to credit unions, perhaps tabling amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Most issues have been dealt with already.</P>
      <P>A series of meetings was held nationwide on the provisions of this Bill, one in Limerick at which I understand a motion was passed to the effect that the Bill, as published, was unacceptable. It is necessary that we table amendments to it.  I understand the Minister will table amendments in accordance with the views expressed by the credit movement generally.  That Limerick meeting was concerned particularly with the restrictions being imposed on the additional services of credit unions under section 48.</P>
      <P>The credit unions have played a major part in the lives of thousands of families.  There are more than 400 credit union branches with in excess of 1.5 million members, the large percentage of whom are small depositors with savings of less than £5,000.  The credit unions have provided a lifeline to many people who were unable to avail of the services of the other, larger financial institutions. More than half of its borrowers have availed of the services provided by more than 10,000 voluntary workers who have helped families overcome difficulties they encounter <i>vis-á-vis</i> health, education and farming.</P>
      <P>In Donegal there are in excess of 14 branches, with 38,000 members, which have helped approximately 11,000 people to borrow in the region of £20 million.  They are manned by 240 voluntary workers, 25 full-time and 17 part-time based in the county.</P>
      <P>The advantage of the credit union movement is that its services are available to all and permeates every facet of life, political, social and religious. The movement has lifted the spirits of the poor and unemployed and, in larger cities, has kept people out of the hands of moneylenders.  It has given many people hope by providing a no fuss, friendly service.</P>
      <P>My local branch in Letterkenny is innovative and manned by friendly voluntary workers.  It is to the credit of the movement that it had the foresight to open on Saturdays recognising that business continues throughout the weekend.  It is to its eternal credit that not one penny has been mislaid throughout its many years of operation.  Why should we drastically change the grass roots culture of the movement?  Why must somebody else take its decisions?  Why terminate its right to self-regulation? I hope I will be proved wrong but I predict it will be practically impossible for the Minister to guarantee that its membership will not drop over the next five years: that will be the determinant of the success of this Bill and its ability to reflect the proper culture of the credit union movement.  It will be that aspect and his handling of it for which the Minister will be remembered.  For everybody's sake I hope he has got it right.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been given due credit for saving the pint.  I hope that in his last few months in office he will not be responsible for the demise of the credit union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> The objectives of the Bill are two-fold, to develop credit unions and to increasingly regulate them.  Whenever I hear of increased regulation I become concerned, even in regard to equality legislation as too much can have the opposite effect to that intended.  Employers, for example, may run scared from too much unnecessary legislation and regulation.  At present each credit union regulates its own affairs.  In this country we tend to go overboard with regulation; in the United States there is little regulation and we can see their success.  Who would want to work voluntarily if they are subject to various regulations from high-powered sources, imposed by faceless people in a different area of the country who are far removed from their way of life and have little or no knowledge of local interests?  It may well be a blow to the small entrepreneurial culture we are anxious to promote.  Some 80 per cent of our small businesses employ fewer than 50 people, so this sector will be the first to feel the pinch.</P>
    <P>Why must the Bill restrict the amount of savings a member can have in a credit union?  There is no reason for such a restriction and speaker after speaker has asked the Minister to reconsider this section.  Why should savings on deposits be restricted to £20,000?  What could one do with such money today, considering how much house improvements cost?  In my area credit unions have provided a lifeline to another sector, cross-Border workers.  During the recent Donegal by-election the Government promised to solve their problems but that promise was broken.  The cap or loan restriction is ludicrous and should be scrapped or replaced by a much larger figure, nearer £50,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also take away the power of credit unions to invest.  Under the Bill credit unions would be unable to invest funds over 0.25 per cent of surplus funds.  Such money was usually invested in the local community, cultural projects and society in general.  This is what I mean by saying the Minister is killing local community enterprise culture.  He should consider amendments to this section if he has not already done so.</P>
    <P>There should be a limit on loans but it should be on a percentage basis and take into account the population of the surrounding area, not necessarily just the town.  Members of the credit union should have the right to decide what to do with the surplus.  Some credit unions in Donegal have a small membership of about 200 while others have 25,000 members.  It is not logical to apply the same limit in all cases.  Lending by credit unions should be based on their membership and asset value.  Larger population areas will be the major losers under this legislation.</P>
    <P>Directors of larger financial institutions receive astronomical salaries, some as high as £500,000 per year.  That is based on clauses in their contracts which give them the incentive to achieve.  I have no problem with such people &mdash; they can turn companies around and their skills can save the jobs of thousands of people.  Success does not <Col N="902" /> come cheap, Bord na Móna being an example. However, why should double standards be applied?  Why are we restricting credit unions in this Bill?</P>
    <P>Overall it is somewhat offensive, despite the Minister's best efforts.  A regulatory authority is to be set up to take over the entire movement.  It will dictate who signs the cheques, who shall be paid, where a credit union may borrow, how much it may lend to an individual and for what duration.  As Deputy O'Hanlon said, if a board member fails to comply with the provisions, even if he does so in the interests of the community, he is guilty of an offence and his only right of appeal is to the High Court.  That provision must be changed.  The Bill will frighten off volunteers, the autonomy which was the strength of credit unions will be undermined and the ethos of the movement will die.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies on the opposite benches have said they take off their caps to salute the credit union movement.  If they are serious they should also take off the caps proposed in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Credit Union Bill, if suitably amended, can be a monumental milestone in the further development of the credit union movement, which is the success story of community service in our times.  All sides of the House have paid tribute to its development over the past 40 years.  No one has criticised it because it is not possible to do so.  It is worthy of the highest praise.  The service to the community which has resulted from the flowering of the credit union movement is obvious all over the country.</P>
      <P>In an economy where profit taking is the motivating factor credit unions are the exception.  They are driven by service rather than profit which makes them unique in the delivery of their services. It is necessary to look at the background of the movement to plot its course ahead.  The extension of the range of services it provides is based on the express needs of its members, not on making a profit or competing with financial institutions.  In another sense it is also a full expression of the principle of subsidiarity.  Individual credit unions supply services to cope with the needs of an area, urban or rural.</P>
      <P>As a result credit unions have earned the respect of the communities in which they operate. They have an enviable record of customer awareness and of the ultimate in consumer friendliness. The value of credit unions is measured by the fact that people need them, use them, own them and have a strong sense of belonging to them.  In good times and bad they offered a range of financial services tailored to their members' needs.  That is a co-operative movement at its best &mdash; people working together to build a better life for themselves, their families and their community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come to the Bill against that background, in which the movement has the full trust of all its 1.5 million members &mdash; there is no instance to date of any member having lost a penny as a <Col N="903" /> result of the activities of a credit union &mdash; and the movement itself has sought the updating of the legislation.  This Bill should be considered on that basis, not in terms of Government versus Opposition or party against party.  This House should ensure that the framework being put together for the future development of the movement will provide whatever minimum regulation is necessary &mdash; all such institutions require some regulation &mdash; and allows that marvellous success story to continue to develop.  That is obvious all over the country.</P>
    <P>I should declare an interest, as one must.  I am a founder member of Skibbereen Credit Union, one of the first credit unions in west Cork.  There are now seven such bodies in the area &mdash; Skibbereen, Bantry, Bandon, Clonakilty, Berehaven, Kinsale and Dunmanway &mdash; all are successful. They have assets of upwards of £40 million and their combined membership is about 29,000.  The overall vote in the next general election will not be much higher than that, which is an indication of how widespread the movement is, permeating every town, village, street and townland, fully owned and supported by virtually the entire population.  The same applies throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The cornerstone of the movement is its volunteer aspect, whose unquantifiable benefits may be a cause of jealousy among other financial institutions. There are approximately 12,000 members around the country, including a couple of hundred in my constituency, who are directors, supervisors and volunteers.  None of them are paid for their services; it is the epitome of a community-based institution.  Given this, we must be cognisant of the views of the membership.</P>
    <P>The movement has worked well to date and it could be argued that if it works, do not fix it. While it seeks a new statutory framework, any changes must be made with caution.  The onus of proof is on those who propose major change to show how it can help to achieve their objectives. Nevertheless, while we do not want to interfere with the formula of success of the movement, it has become so big that changes are necessary, including the creation of a regulatory framework.</P>
    <P>I favour a light regulatory framework because I am aware of the benefits of self-discipline from the many bodies in which I am involved.  A successful self-regulatory regime has operated in the movement, and while it should not continue to operate alone with the registrar, we should not cast aside the benefits of self-regulation nor interfere unduly with the formula for success.</P>
    <P>We should be also aware of difficulties that have arisen in other countries.  For example, the saving and loans institutions in the USA have been a cause of trauma and trouble in recent years.  While there is no question of the movement proceeding down that road, we would be wise to consider international experience and contain any adventurism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> There is no suggestion that the movement has been anything other than above board, properly managed at local level with mechanisms for internal discipline and self-regulation and cooperating fully with the registrar and the Department. It is a perfect success story.  The Bill must be judged and amendments suggested against that background.  If properly amended this can be a great Bill which will help the development of the movement.</P>
    <P>The Bill must reflect the philosophy and ethos of the movement, which is all Ireland in scope, with the league covering a wide range of 550 credit unions in terms of diversity and size, both north and south.  For example, in my own area, one union has assets of £12 million and another has assets of £2 million, while one union elsewhere has assets of £55 million with another holding assets of £500,000.  The framework to be put in place must take account of this diversity, which is representative of the strength and character of the movement.  It should not be threatened.</P>
    <P>The basic investment in a credit union is by way of shares.  At present there is a limit of £6,000.  The Bill proposes a limit of £20,000.  This is too low; the limit should be approximately £30,000.  Those who invest beyond the shares make deposits, where essentially no monetary limits apply.  While there should be some limit, it must be set to ensure that unions will not be restricted in attracting the necessary funds to enable them continue with the fine service they provide.  It should be relatively high and should, because of the diversity within the movement, relate also to the total shareholding within the union.  A sum of £50,000 or 2 per cent of the total shares, whichever is the greater, is reasonable.</P>
    <P>While approximately 90 per cent of shareholders are within the share limit, the credit unions need the investment of depositors to enable them provide their range of services.  It is also important to ensure that shareholders at the upper end of the savings bracket should continue to be restricted to one vote and that the limit set on deposits should reflect a percentage of the credit unions shares, not simply a monetary limit.</P>
    <P>There is no monetary limit on loans, which has never been a problem.  The onus must be on those proposing monetary limits to explain why they are necessary.  While a limit of 10 per cent of assets applies, this has never been reached.  The proposed limit of £20,000 in the Bill is far too low. It should be approximately £30,000 and should also be fixed as a percentage of the total assets, although a limit of 10 per cent is probably too high given the growth in the movement.  A percentage of this kind would reflect the involvement by members in something substantial in the context of their areas.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of credit unions loans are for small amounts over a short duration.  At present only 132 credit unions have loans in excess of £20,000.  However, given the surge in growth of the economy, the demand for loans in excess of £20,000 will increase.  The absolute limit could <Col N="905" /> seriously impede the development of the potential of credit unions, especially the larger unions. It could serve to discourage investment if the facility for members to borrow to even the level of their own savings is not available.  Given the diversity in size and the lending capacity of the unions, it is logical to set the limit as a percentage of total assets.</P>
    <P>To a large extent, self-regulation has worked well to date with the savings protection scheme having funds of £28 million or £29 million which represents over 1 per cent of total savings.  Self-regulation has never been a problem.  Fidelity bonding is available for all employees and volunteers. I am not saying we should focus exclusively on self-regulation but we should make the best use of it, working in consort with the Registrar. That type of control is what is needed rather than anything that would stifle the growth of the credit union.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the question of new services.  Why not have new services if they are of benefit to members?  The existing additional services have a proven track record and should continue.  Why would the movement not offer new services, for example VHI group schemes, on an agency basis at no risk to the credit union? An open, encouraging approach is needed in relation to new services, one that is not affected by unnecessary bureaucratic delays.</P>
    <P>The restriction on the ownership of property seems odd.  Why is there a need for this restriction? Section 41 (4) states:</P>
    <P>If the whole of a building held by a credit union ceases to be occupied for the purposes of the business of the credit union, the credit union shall dispose of its interest in that building as soon as it is practicable to do so.</P>
    <P>Surely it is a matter for the credit unions who have managed their affairs responsibly so far to make decisions concerning their property.  If nothing else, this would seem to be a constitutional right.  Why should there be such a restriction? If restrictions are being imposed, the onus is on those seeking them to give the reason for them.  I see no reason for such restrictions.  I do not agree with the suggestion that buildings could be leased in certain circumstances.  That is not my reading of the provision.</P>
    <P>We have a wonderful credit union movement that has captured the support of a huge proportion of the population.  It has proved itself in towns and villages in urban and rural areas.  It has been the outstanding success story of the second half of this century so far as community driven enterprise is concerned.  We salute that success and want to support the movement.  That is why the final shape of this Bill is so important as we head into the next millennium.  We want to see that success story continued in the coming years and to ensure that the framework being put in place will be such as to allow that movement to flourish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> The basic framework of the Bill is good.  It has the potential to be a great Bill and a monumental milestone in the further development of the credit union movement.  The Minister has had consultations with the Irish League of Credit Unions which has made certain proposals.  Deputies on all sides have made proposals as to how the Bill could be improved.  The Minister has been open in his consultations both inside and outside the House.  It is a big Bill and many Deputies wish to contribute.  Unlike other Ministers he has taken the trouble to sit in and listen to virtually the entire proceedings.  I compliment him on that and I have every expectation he will take on board many of the suggestions made on all sides and that on Committee Stage various amendments will be made, the consequence of which will be that this Bill, as amended, will be an enormous success in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this long awaited important Bill and congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on its introduction following a long period of gestation.  During the years many inquiries were made on the Order of Business and elsewhere as to its whereabouts and when it would be introduced.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been welcomed by practically all Deputies who have contributed and by the credit unions who have waited for it for such a long time.  It impacts greatly on the future development of the credit union movement and while it welcomes the Bill, the movement has some reservations about its operation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to update the legislative framework within which credit unions operate in Ireland and enhance the range of services which they can offer their members.  The Bill is concerned to maintain the special ethos of the credit union movement.  The Minister consulted extensively with the Irish League of Credit Unions and, to his credit, he has promised to maintain contact with the League as the Bill progresses through the Dáil.  In its final form I hope the Bill will meet all the concerns that have been highlighted such as the recognition of the role of the Irish League of Credit Unions; the proposed regulatory regime which is regarded as excessively intrusive and incapable of implementation; the proposed limits on shares, deposits and loans; the proposed limitation on the right of the credit union to own property and the proposed system of approval of new and existing services which is viewed as both unrealistic and unwieldy.</P>
      <P>Since its foundation over 40 years ago the credit union movement here has an enviable history. Since then it has grown from one to over 430 units and has over 1.5 million members.  Savings have grown to £2 million and loans amount to approximately £1.5 million.  There are 600,000 borrowers and 10,200 people work on a voluntary basis in the credit union movement.  It is a cross-Border, all-Ireland movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the credit union movement for good on rural and urban life, since its foundation, <Col N="907" /> has been unmatched.  It set out to foster the idea of self-help.  As it grew and developed so did confidence and belief in the community in its ability to work together to improve its lot.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement has lifted many local communities, individuals and families out of a state of no hope and poverty and in some cases out of the hands of moneylenders and given them hope, dignity and faith in themselves and their future.  When they first came into contact with the credit union their future seemed bleak.</P>
    <P>Credit unions are very different from other financial institutions in that they do not make a profit and are owned and run by members for their own good.  The credit union movement has regulated itself over the years and has established a savings protection scheme which is run by the Irish League of Credit Unions on behalf of affiliated unions.  It is mandatory for all personnel, voluntary or paid, to be fidelity bonded.  It provides loan protection insurance and has established rules covering all aspects of credit union business which are approved by the registrar.  However, the Bill gives no recognition to this and instead proposes a system of regulation by the Registrar of Friendly Societies which appears to be too intrusive and to undermine the ethos of the movement as a self-motivated, self-regulated and self-determining private mutual organisation. This appears to be justifiably unacceptable to the Irish League of Credit Unions which has a long and honourable history.  The Minister and the league have been having discussions and I am sure they will be able to agree a system of regulation which will give more recognition to the historical role played by the league in this aspect of its business.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about the proposal to restrict the amount which can be borrowed to £20,000.  This sum is relatively small nowadays and the proposal seems to be unduly restrictive. It is very difficult to understand the reasoning behind this restriction, and perhaps the banks, building societies and Department of Finance had a strong input.  I understand the desire of these organisations to look after their interests and to protect themselves but, given the ethos of the credit union movement and the broad range of people with which it deals, the figure of £20,000 is much too low.</P>
    <P>People who wish to purchase a car or farm equipment or to build an extension to their house will often need to borrow more than £20,000.  If a cap has to be put on the amount which can be borrowed then the criteria should take account of individuals who may wish to borrow money to improve their home or extend the family business, without moving into the wider commercial or corporate business field.  If this factor was taken into account the limit of £20,000 would be increased significantly.  Restricting the amount which can be borrowed to £20,000 will severely handicap the development of the credit union <Col N="908" /> movement.  I am sure the Minister will take this point into account in his discussions with the Irish League of Credit Unions.</P>
    <P>The restriction on the ownership of property by credit unions is totally unjustifiable.  Most small towns have derelict sites and property in need of development and the credit union movement could provide a great service to the community in the wider hinterland by developing such property for commercial purposes.  There should be no restriction on credit unions carrying out such work.  I am not saying they should become involved in development in the wider commercial field where they would have to invest millions of pounds.  This restriction is unjustifiable and I ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>

      <P>The restriction on credit unions owning property is unjustified.  I am sure the Minister of State and the Irish League of Credit Unions will find a solution to that undesirable element in the Bill during their discussions.  The restriction on new services is also unwarranted.  I am sure that, in consultations with the league of credit unions, the Minister of State will find a satisfactory outcome to that aspect also.</P>
      <P>There are credit unions in all the towns in my constituency.  I pay tribute to the membership of those credit unions, especially the people who run them.  They do trojan work and, in keeping with the ethos and tradition of the credit union movement, they give their time on a voluntary basis. They are to be commended.  They stay in the background and the great service they provide for the whole community often goes unheralded and unrewarded.  I compliment the people in my community who provide that leadership under the aegis of the credit union movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which has been long sought. From small beginnings almost 40 years ago, the credit union movement has blossomed into one of the most commonly used financial facilities in practically every town and village and in many rural areas.  It is a striking example, in the best possible sense, of self help.  It has a large voluntary workforce of about 12,000 people, who ensure the availability of funding and services for their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the same vein as other community self help groups, the most recently talked about of which are the group water schemes.  They are a striking example of what can be done on a community basis in regions where the local authorities are unable to provide facilities.  The co-operative movement is a similar organisation.  I was involved with a co-op for half my working life before I entered politics.  I saw the facilities which co-operatives made available to their members in times when money was not as easily available as it is now.  Somebody once remarked <Col N="909" /> to me that the credit union was the poor man's bank.</P>
    <P>I have witnessed the growth of the credit union movement in my constituency, which was at the forefront of the development of the credit union concept.  One of the prime movers was a Donegal priest, Fr. Gallagher, who taught in Clones.  He was very deeply involved in the local credit union and the wider credit union movement.  He went on to assist in the formation of the Irish League of Credit Unions and was its first president.  The area, therefore, has a claim to fame as far the credit union movement is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Bill supports and protects the essential ethos of the credit union movement. It has a proud tradition which is well worth preserving.  The Bill allows credit unions to develop additional services, which is as it should be.  Given the evident enthusiasm and work ethos in credit unions, I expect they will develop a wider range of services.</P>
    <P>Credit unions make a great contribution by employing 1,500 people.  I expect their growth rate will increase with these new extended measures under the legislation.  With total savings of £2 billion, the credit unions have put in a very fine performance.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the £20,000 loan ceiling.  The credit unions would like the loan level to be related to the percentage of savings. The Minister of State will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to give further consideration to a number of such proposals.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have fine premises in every town and many villages.  They also have links with groups in villages and rural areas.  The credit union movement covers almost every region in the country.</P>
    <P>While the credit unions are not deeply involved in new housing loans because of the loan cap of £20,000, they play a very important role in house building and reconstruction.  Local authority loans have a ceiling of £33,000 which is inadequate to erect a four bedroomed house if the builder has to purchase a site and pay for the connection of water and electricity services.  Those costs could run to £12,000 or £13,000 before any building takes place.  The credit unions are used for second loans in these cases to complete and furnish houses.</P>
    <P>There might be a slight restriction in future on credit unions developing outside their office structure.  That would be a pity because they have used their profits to very good advantage, not alone to erect their own buildings but also in their generosity to projects and developments in their regions.  I never like to use names because that means telling business to which I have no entitlement. However, there was a major development in my constituency, one of the most significant developments in the region, for which funding was available under the Border areas programme but it required matching funds.  The credit union provided a six figure sum which, with local contributions, meant the funds could be matched. <Col N="910" /> Otherwise, the development could not have proceeded.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in my constituency, with the assistance of the credit union the health board rented a building for use as a day centre.  Health boards never have enough money for capital projects, so it makes economic sense for them to utilise credit union funding to ensure such facilities are provided. Restrictions should not be imposed on credit unions when they provide funding for those types of facilities, which is outside their remit.</P>
    <P>People use credit unions when they need money for weddings, funerals, confirmations, etc. Many parents would find it difficult to keep their children in second and third level education without the assistance of the credit unions.  I know of a person who purchased land many years ago with the help of the local credit union &mdash; land was not expensive then &mdash; and who is now a large farmer.  Many farmers use the facilities of credit unions on an ongoing basis to buy replacement stock, farm machinery and buildings.  Many people in my constituency who are no longer in full-time employment borrow money from the credit union to, say, develop a farm or go into some other small area of production.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill to allow people under the age of 16 to become members of credit unions.  Parents try to persuade their children, not always with success, to save their pennies.  It is important that they are encouraged to save money from an early age, and now that they can join credit unions parents should guide them in that direction.</P>
    <P>There is an argument for increasing the ceiling of £20,000 on the amount members can borrow from credit unions, although I welcome the relaxation in regard to the maximum loan period of five years.</P>
    <P>The measures in the Bill will greatly facilitate people who want to improve their standard of living, although I am sure the Bill will be subject to amendment on Committee Stage.  I wish the credit unions continued success.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on introducing the Bill which was called for on many occasions in the House over the past two years.  I compliment him on the tolerance he displayed over the past two days in listening to the contribution of Members, which may have been slightly repetitive in some cases.  The fact that so many Members wanted to contribute to the debate is an indication of the respect they have for credit unions.  Public representatives are well aware of the role played by credit unions in local communities.  We have all been lobbied by the credit unions in our areas and the concerns they expressed have been elaborated by <Col N="911" /> Members in the debate.  I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of those concerns.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that this is major legislation there are probably only two small areas remaining in terms of satisfying the Minister of State, the Irish League of Credit Unions and its members.  The Minister has fostered a spirit of harmony in regard to the legislation and he appears to be in tune with what is required of credit unions as they face into the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State met the Irish League of Credit Unions in Limerick last month and I know from speaking to members that they appreciated his contribution and the fact that he listened to their concerns.  The Minister has displayed those good listening skills over the past two days during this debate.</P>
      <P>The Bill recognises the role of credit unions and their importance in the community.  Other financial institutions indicated they would have an input into this legislation, but I was glad to hear the Minister of State say that their concern for credit unions was coming a bit late in the day. Were it not for credit unions, people living in rural communities would not have survived because financial institutions would have been unable to cope with their demands.</P>
      <P>I have enormous respect for the 12,000 people who volunteer to work in credit unions.  I compliment them on the valuable role they play in enhancing the profile of credit union boards. They are the unsung heroes in our community. They respect the confidentiality aspect of credit unions and tend to adopt a tolerant attitude towards people who owe considerable amounts of money.  They assist them in getting out of their difficulties.  The role played by these people is not sufficiently highlighted.</P>
      <P>The people who volunteer to work for credit unions have enormous responsibility having regard to the dynamics of a credit union.  Some credit unions have assets of between £500,000 and £55 million, with a total savings base of over £2 billion.  The reason credit unions gained the respect of local communities was the principle of self-help which was evident from the time of their foundation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision to allow people under the age of 16 become members of credit unions because it is important to ensure the saving ethic is developed at an early age.  One of the most favourable aspects of credit unions is that people can continue to save while paying off a loan.  They know they must visit the credit union on a weekly basis to pay off their borrowings, and that is a good habit.  On the basis of their unique role credit unions are not liable to corporation tax, and I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of shares has been elaborated on by many speakers.  The difference between the limit credit unions are seeking and that proposed is very small.  It should be possible to find a formula which would be compatible with the requirements of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  On <Col N="912" /> loans, the Minister has made some concession in terms of the five year stipulation.  Again, the difference between the limit sought by the Irish League of Credit Unions and the proposal in the Bill is very small.  I hope those matters will be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, there was misinterpretation of the role of credit unions in terms of their right to own property.  If credit unions became involved in buying derelict sites and building property they could be seen as becoming involved in property speculation, and I understand that certain protection mechanisms are necessary in that regard.  The Minister has clarified that there is no restriction on credit unions that wish to lease part of their premises to other institutions.</P>
    <P>The credit union in my area has contacted me about this legislation which it welcomes.  The concern in recent times related to when the legislation would be introduced, whether it would be during the lifetime of this Government.  I am glad it has been introduced and I look forward to teasing out the various issues on Committee Stage.  I have no doubt the legislation will be implemented during the lifetime of this Government.  Recognition is due to the Minister on bringing in a measure which will ensure a bright dawn for credit unions in that it will enhance their profile and help them to expand.  Because many commercial banks operate ATM machines on the basis of throughput of people, some areas do not have access to that service.  I look forward to the provision of such a desirable service by credit unions to people within their community.  I compliment the Minister on the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that credit unions operate in almost every town and village of reasonable size, this legislation affects nearly everybody in the community.  I congratulate the Minister &mdash; I am not joining in the mantra, I say this sincerely &mdash; on bringing forward this long promised legislation. Although some small changes were made in this area in 1978, it is 31 years since legislation dealing with credit unions was introduced.  The whole co-operative movement, including credit unions, has changed in the past 30 years, but the legislative framework under which credit unions operate has not.  Tribute must be paid to the credit union movement on its ethos and the basis on which it is founded.  We live in a society in which lending institutions are not very popular &mdash; they are often associated with greed, high profits and so on &mdash; and a major savings-loan institution based on co-operation and operating on a non-profit basis is to be complimented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome that credit unions will remain free from corporation tax.  Some years ago the co-operative movement objected to becoming liable for corporation tax.  I supported that tax because businesses, including co-operatives, trading in goods and services and making a profit should pay tax.  Credit unions are, however, different in that they operate on a non-profit basis and provide the essential wherewithal for small savers. <Col N="913" /> This applies particularly to small borrowers who may not have access to credit from other lending institutions, many of which are unpopular because they do not provide for those people.</P>
    <P>I also welcome that interest on loans from credit unions will not be liable to DIRT.  There must have been a temptation to make them liable because there are substantial sums of money by way of savings in credit unions.  The Minister said that people are obliged to reveal in their income tax returns profits accrued by interest on credit union savings.  With tongue in cheek, he said that he was not sure how many people obeyed that rule, but given the average savings in credit unions &mdash; £1,300 per individual &mdash; many people would not be liable for DIRT.</P>
    <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions lobbied Members in regard to this legislation, and backbenchers must make up their minds on the matter. There is much merit in the league's proposals regarding the limit on savings.  The 1966 Act imposed a limit of £6,000 while this Bill proposes a limit of £20,000.  I welcome that people with savings of £20,000 will still be entitled to only one vote.  In that way a person may not buy votes by buying extra shares.  Under the 1966 Act there was no monetary limit on deposits while this Bill proposes a limit of £20,000.  The league proposes that the limit on savings should be 2 per cent of total shares or £50,000, whichever is the greater. There is much reason in that argument.  Perhaps the Minister may not wish to set the limit as high as £50,000, but many people have savings in excess of £40,000 &mdash; there are 68 credit unions where individuals have savings in excess of £40,000 while there are 178 credit unions where individuals have savings in excess of £20,000.  A sum of £50,000 is not an enormous amount in savings, and credit unions need such investments to increase their strength.  That proposal should be considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of competition between financial institutions.  It is important, therefore, that credit unions are able to take reasonable sums of money on deposit from those who want to invest it in them.  Building societies, banks and insurance companies take deposits on a long-term basis, the return on which is much greater.  Most people invest in credit unions because they want to invest in their communities.  As credit unions operate in a free market we must enable them to develop with the times.  Money is rapidly losing its value as a result of consumerism rather than inflation.  As the Minister of State comes from a rural community, I am sure he will take account of these considerations.</P>
    <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions is also concerned about the imposition of a limit on loans. Under the 1966 Act the terms of a loan could not exceed five years.  I welcome the provision whereby 20 per cent of a loan may be for a period not exceeding five years and 10 per cent for a period not exceeding ten years.  Under the 1966 Act there was no limit on the loan a person could get, but under current legislation loans are limited <Col N="914" /> to a sum of £20,000.  The Irish League of Credit Unions want that limit increased to £30,000, or 5 per cent of the total assets of the union, whichever is the greater.  A sum of £20,000 is no longer a major loan.  The league's request is not unreasonable when one considers that 20 per cent of a loan can be for a period not exceeding five years and 10 per cent for a period not exceeding ten years.  As stated in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> many second hand tractors cost more than £20,000.  Most people borrow from credit unions to buy additional equipment for their businesses or farms or to improve the quality of their homes. While the majority of people may require less than £20,000, a loan of £30,000 might be a more realistic figure for others.  Perhaps the Minister of State will reconsider the provision and go some way towards meeting the league's request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome this long overdue Bill.  I hope the Minister of State noted the worthwhile suggestions made by Members on all sides on how the Bill could be improved before being passed into law.</P>
      <P>As I was a member of the board of the Enniscorthy Credit Union for a number of years I am aware of the role credit unions play in the economic and social fabric of our society.  When I was elected to the House I had to resign from the board because politicians are not allowed to act as board members.  One would have to deal with all types of representations if one were a member of a credit union board and a Member of this House.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement was set up to assist the working class and the less well off and to allow people to borrow at reasonable interest rates.  Credit unions have assisted many people who were in the clutches of moneylenders and hire purchase companies who charged exorbitant interest rates.  The Department of Social Welfare and others have availed of the assistance of credit unions to help people who borrowed from moneylenders.  Great credit is due to those in the credit union movement who have always been willing to help people in need.</P>
      <P>The buildings from which credit unions operate have improved substantially.  Most of them operate from excellent modern buildings where people can discuss their business in private.  Enniscorthy Credit Union operates from one of the most modern buildings in the country and is the envy of many other financial institutions.  Its membership has increased substantially since that building opened in 1995.  Most credit unions provide first class facilities for their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the voluntary aspect of the credit union movement.  Many people give of their time and energy on a voluntary basis to provide a service for the community.  As Deputy Finucane stated, they are sensitive to the needs of people who find it difficult to make repayments and they operate on a strictly confidential basis.  I never heard a person who works in a credit union talk about people who have run into difficulty in paying <Col N="915" /> back loans.  Great credit is due to credit unions for the confidential manner in which they operate.</P>
    <P>Many ordinary credit union members are concerned that too much regulation may stifle the flexibility and common sense approach that has existed in the credit union movement.  It is important that this should not happen.  Many new services have been initiated by credit unions for the benefit of their members, such as loan protection and life savings insurance schemes &mdash; which cost nothing for members &mdash; as well as death benefit insurance.  These were introduced by members at local level and were then taken up at national meetings.  That is the essence of democracy and some credit union members feel that the new legislation may not allow them to do that in future as the registrar will have to approve schemes.  They are concerned that if something is passed this year, the registrar may take a year or 18 months to make a decision on it.  The Minister of State should give a definitive date for decisions to be made on new credit union systems so there will not be an undue delay because of bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>Unlike the banks, credit unions do not make a profit and surplus money goes back to their members.  The banks make exorbitant profits which are increasing annually but the credit union is far more flexible.  Those who use a credit union are often people the bank would not want to know &mdash; workers, the unemployed and old age pensioners.  Loans are made available to them for house repairs, Christmas, first communion, confirmation and weddings.  When Wexford won the all-Ireland last year, most credit unions found there was a dramatic increase in loan applications. There were top-ups after the Leinster final, all-Ireland semi-final and the all-Ireland final.  That is when the credit union is seen in the best light.  Imagine going into a bank and attempting to borrow £1,000 to follow Wexford. One would be laughed out of the place.  For special occasions, the credit union reaches out to help the community and to improve the quality of life for families.  The legislation must therefore be flexible enough to allow the credit union to continue catering for its members, regardless of what type of member is seeking a loan.  There should be no restrictive practices in this area.</P>
    <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions has proven to be a very responsible body and its role must be enshrined in the Bill.  That organisation has its finger on the pulse as it has a full-time field staff inspecting credit unions, ensuring they are well-run and viable.  I remember those inspectors coming to the Enniscorthy credit union when I was on its board of directors.  This self-regulatory approach has proven very successful for the last 40 years and should be recognised in the Bill. Over the 40 years of the credit unions' operations, no member has ever lost all or part of his or her savings.  The same cannot be said of any of the big financial institutions making millions of <Col N="916" /> pounds annually, where savers have lost some substantial investments.  No credit union members have lost their investments.  The role of the Irish League of Credit Unions should therefore be recognised in this Bill and it should continue in its self-regulatory role.</P>
    <P>Credit unions must also be allowed to introduce new systems to cater for the future needs of members.  Technology progresses daily and we must look at ATM services and an electronic fund transfer system for State payments such as social welfare payments, old age pension or unemployment assistance for the credit unions.  The Minister of State should consider how this can be facilitated, given the number of members that credit unions have.  Those members should be able to avail of any new systems.  A type of chequebook facility should be considered, though it need not be the same as the chequebooks banks use.  A debit card system should be considered also.</P>
    <P>It is 30 years since we had any legislation that dealt with credit unions and credit is due to the Minister of State for introducing this Bill.  Given the growth of modern technology, the credit unions should not have to wait five years, let alone 30, while we look at the changing nature of cash transactions.  The Bill should ensure that credit unions are allowed the flexibility to adapt to new systems and I hope the Minister of State will accept amendments on this matter.</P>
    <P>We have approximately 430 credit unions with 1.6 million members.  Credit union savings amount to almost £2 billion and loans amount to approximately £1.5 billion.  There are approximately 600,000 borrowers and 10,000 volunteers working in the credit unions.  The movement is mainly voluntary in operation and that is an important aspect that should be allowed to continue. The Minister of State is ensuring that in the Bill.  There are 172 full-time and over 500 part-time employees working in this area.</P>
    <P>As a credit union develops, particularly in a large urban centre, more and more people are employed there, thus promoting employment in that area.  The Bill should not stifle the initiatives taken by credit unions over the years.  In my area they have become involved in partnership arrangements with local communities to develop employment or community services.  They are also involved in the sponsorship of local sporting groups and in helping organisations to develop.  It is most important that this involvement continues. There is much talk about the urban rural rift which exists in farming and other areas but the credit union movement has been a shining example in terms of closing that divide.  I am aware of cases where urban and rural areas have come together to develop schemes of mutual benefit.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement is held in high esteem by the public.  It is most important that is is viewed as a help to people because it reaches out to communities.  It is often the case that other <Col N="917" /> financial institutions shy away from supporting worthwhile causes or job creating projects which people wish to develop and the credit union steps in.  Credit unions do not just look after unemployed people in housing estates.  They have broadened their base and many farmers and small business people, who are unable to get funds from other financial institutions, are increasingly turning to credit unions for help.</P>
    <P>Much credit is due to the boards and committees of credit unions because they examine each case on its merits before deciding whether to give a loan.  However, more often than not, they take a risk and work closely with the people involved. If difficulties arise, they discuss them with those involved and come to an immediate arrangement. This facility is not available in large financial institutions which usually send a solicitor's or debt collector's letter.  People in credit unions, who are aware of the position on the ground, talk to those involved and try to help them.  More importantly, they make funds available to enable the project to develop and create jobs.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a broad one and contains 188 sections.  In common with other Deputies, I ask the Minister to consider increasing the cap on shares, deposits and loans.  A good car costs almost £20,000 and a bedroom or bathroom extension costs more than that amount.  Regarding shares and deposits, many workers in the ESB, the Army and Telecom Éireann, who are members of credit unions, are receiving large redundancy payments.  If they already have shares or deposits, they will not be in a position to invest their redundancy or other payments.  Some people are receiving substantial sums and I ask the Minister to re-examine the limits in the Bill and to consider the representations made by the Irish League of Credit Unions in that regard. These people are aware of the position on the ground and what individuals are capable of borrowing and repaying.  I ask the Minister to consider the points made on all sides about this matter but more importantly the genuine representations made by the credit unions for an increase in the limits.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on introducing this long awaited legislation, not before time.  Work began on the Bill in conjunction with the Government of the day in 1989 but it was left in the wilderness for eight years.  At long last it has reached the House.  I was amazed to hear Opposition Deputies calling for speedier legislation.  It took eight years to introduce this Bill, which is much needed, and somebody must have been at fault along the way.  We know where the blame lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a lengthy, detailed and complicated Bill. <Col N="918" /> In common with most legislation, it does not make easy reading.  It runs to 145 pages and includes 14 Parts, 188 sections and five Schedules. The significance of this weighty Bill is that it is the first consolidated legislation for credit unions since the State was founded.  It repeals all the existing Acts relating to credit unions and when it is enacted, it will have major implications for the future of the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister, the Bill is designed to maintain the special ethos of the movement and will allow credit unions to increase the scope of the service they can offer to members. However, I am not 100 per cent happy with the extent of some of the restrictions.  The regulatory requirements appear unnecessary, intrusive and occasionally at odds with the ethos of the credit union movement.  I welcome the Minister's intention to increase the limit on shares from the current rate of £6,000 to £20,000 but what is the rationale behind the new caps of £20,000 on loans and deposits?</P>
    <P>The Minister must remember that the sum of £20,000 in current monetary terms is not a large amount.  It would do little in terms of carrying out structural repairs to homes or reconstruction development.  It is evident that if a house requires major structural renovations and modernisation, such as new furniture, a loan of £40,000 rather than £20,000, the maximum amount contained in the Bill, would be more appropriate.  When the previous maximum of £6,000 for loans was introduced, there were 240d to the pound.  After decimalisation, there were 100p and the purchasing power of money eroded considerably.</P>
    <P>The cap of £20,000 on loans must be considered and an effort should be made to increase it if possible.  If the Minister is insisting on a cap on shares and loans, he should consider doubling the figure, which would be more realistic.  The cap on loans appears to contradict the view of many Ministers that credit unions should be a source of funds for small businesses and agriculture.  A maximum loan of £20,000 would limit the development of such a role, which would help to make the market for loans for small businesses more competitive.  A cap of £20,000 in this day and age is unrealistic.  As it took over eight years to introduce the legislation, I hope the Minister will accede to my request on Committee Stage to either remove the cap or double the limits for loans, shares and deposits.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the provision of the Bill under which a credit union will be required to sell off property, the whole of which is not occupied for the purposes of the business of the credit union.  As everybody knows, credit unions throughout the country provide office space and accommodation for other agencies and services of value to the community.  While I accept that the credit unions are not and do not want to be involved in property speculation, preventing them from providing accommodation surplus to requirements for community services does not sit easily with the ethos of the credit union movement. <Col N="919" /> I, therefore, ask the Minister of State to again look at this clause.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill under which credit union members will be allowed to nominate in writing the person who will be entitled to inherit their property.  The property of members who have less than £5,000 in a credit union and who fail to make nominations may be distributed by the board of directors without the need to issue letters of administration or to take out probate.  The figure of £5,000 should be increased to at least £10,000.  That would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement is not opposed to prudential regulation.  It has exercised self-regulation to a high degree.  I understand that not one penny has been lost by its members in 35 years and that the credit unions have been highly responsible in making their own insurance and bonding arrangements.  Unlike banks and building societies, their operations are not centralised, they do not operate through a branch network. Most of them are small community based mutual organisations.  They have 1.6 million members, total savings of approximately £2 billion, a loan book valued at approximately £1.5 billion and 750,000 borrowers.  This is a unique record for a voluntary organisation.</P>
    <P>There are nine credit unions in my constituency of Cork South West, each of which is providing a trojan service to the people of the area.  Their staff are prepared to discuss the needs of their clients privately and in a friendly manner.  The developments undertaken and the improvements effected in the area during the past three decades would not have been possible without the confidence the credit unions instilled in their clients in seeking to make improvements to their homes, expand small country businesses or purchase a new car.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned that he expects to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage following consultation with the offices of the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General and that he will consider all the views expressed.  I thank him for the hard work he put into the Bill's formulation and adopting a common sense approach.  It is 30 years since the first legislation relating to the credit unions was introduced.  The legislation should be updated at least once every decade to keep pace with the rate of change in the financial world.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State will introduce any amendments necessary on Committee Stage for the betterment of those reliant on the credit unions for their survival.</P>

      <P>I was not aware that this legislation has been in gestation since 1989.  Deputy Sheehan pointed the finger at those responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a substantial document comprising 188 sections and a number of Schedules. I congratulate the Minister of State on his hard work in its formulation in recent months to <Col N="920" /> ensure that it would be presented by this Government. He expressed a willingness to listen and consult.  He met the Irish League of Credit Unions which, in turn, forwarded a vast quantity of documentation to all Deputies in which it highlights its concerns about this legislation.  I compliment credit unions on organising meetings for public representatives to highlight the reasons the legislation is needed and the specific issues they wish to see addressed within it.  They are concerned that it is enacted as quickly as possible. Representatives of the credit unions also addressed the Labour parliamentary party.</P>
    <P>Most Members are probably a member of a credit union.  I have been a member of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland Credit Union since its establishment about ten years ago. This is a feature of the entire credit union movement which was founded in 1958.  One would have thought a co-operative movement such as this would have been in existence during the lifetime of Horace Plunkett.  Creamery and rural co-operatives were established successfully at the end of the last century and at the beginning of this century.  One would have thought the concept of self-help in the financial area would have been part and parcel of this development.</P>
    <P>The credit union of which I am a member has gone from strength to strength.  The Department of Education acceded to its request that deductions be made from salaries.  Not alone does this make it easier for members to acquire share-holdings and build up savings and deposits, it is also cheaper.  This facility should be available to all PAYE taxpayers who would nominate the amounts to be deducted on a regular basis.  That system of saving is a major boost to credit unions as it ensures members make regular payments and are likely to continue to do so.  Savings in credit unions now amount to many millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement was founded relatively recently, but it has experienced phenomenal growth from its early days in 1966 when there were three credit unions to the current number which have 1.6 million members and £2 billion in savings.  The fact that the movement in the first three years of its establishment acquired 169,000 members highlights the potential that existed for that type of institution and the attractiveness of a co-operative self-help community-based development.</P>
    <P>As many speakers pointed out, credit unions have provided great benefits to communities.  It is essentially a small person's bank, a savings union, that enables people to make small deposits on a regular basis which accumulate until they require the money for a particular purpose.  Deposits are made and loans are granted.  The average deposit is £100 and the average loan is £1,000.  The credit union is still very much a localised community-based operation and it is extremely active in deprived and disadvantaged areas, where a national bank often will not locate because it does not consider there is sufficient business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> Credit union loans have resulted in home ownership and in many houses being restored and refurbished.  There is scope for credit unions to become involved in the social housing programme, particularly in regard to shared ownership. Will the Minister of State consider the scope that exists for credit unions to provide a combined mortgage and rental arrangement for people with limited resources?  In the Dublin Corporation area the limits that apply to the shared ownership scheme are £14,000 in respect of shared ownership borrowings and an income of £14,000 which facilitates people on low incomes to buy a house.  This legislation does not permit credit unions to provide house mortgages, but they could provide assistance in the area of shared ownership and there is scope for credit unions to co-operate with local authorities which operate the scheme.  Will the Minister explore that area in the context of credit union loans and the period that applies to them?</P>
    <P>The competition element is also important.  It is generally accepted that the banking system requires large deposits, but banks operate on the basis of profit.  However, small deposits can be attractive and effective.  We have seen the success of the TSB, the ACC, the ICC and credit unions, all of which have a healthy profit.  As to whether the maximum loan granted by credit unions, which has increased from £6,000 to £20,000, should be capped at £20,000 or £30,000, I believe the Minister has got the limit right in the context of corporation tax, DIRT and so on.  We do not want credit union loans to be a means by which people can avoid paying their due tax.  However, there are two types of credit union, small ones like Sheriff Street and Halston Street and larger ones like mine which is virtually an industrial union.  Those credit unions have a very large level of deposits and they can provide a different type of service.  They could provide facilities, like the Telecom Éireann credit union, which enabled a leisure centre be built for its members.  I ask the Minister of State to consider those points.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation.  By and large the Minister has got it right.  I note the concerns expressed by the Irish League of Credit Unions, but I would not put as much store in them as some Members have.  It is appropriate that this area should be strongly regulated after the Taylor Investments debacle.  These provisions will not be unduly intrusive.  I look forward to the credit unions expanding and retaining their ethos and role into the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that there is general support on all sides of the House for the work of credit unions.  I add my voice in support of their work for our society over the past decades.  The fact that they have more than 1.6 million members is indicative of their standing in the community.  The ethos and co-operative nature of their business has been a great success, as it has been in the area of agriculture with the success of the co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> While we on this side of the House welcome this legislation, we have some reservations about the limits applying to shares, loans and deposits. I hope the Minister of State in his wisdom will consider those restrictions during the passage of this Bill through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I commend the credit unions for their involvement in supporting schools, sporting organisations and particularly the community games, of which they are a major financial supporter.  That is in line with the ethos of the credit union movement. They work with the people and that is readily appreciated by all their members.</P>
    <P>There are 427 credit unions affiliated to the Irish League of Credit Unions in the Republic. As previous speakers said, the Irish League of Credit Unions forcefully and effectively lobbied all the political parties about their concerns and outlined their plight at the delay in enacting this legislation.  However, the responsibility for the delay does not lie with any side of the House.  In January 1996 the Taoiseach said the Bill was at an advanced stage and would be introduced shortly and when the Dáil resumed in October he was forced to confess this was difficult and technical legislation and the Government had to be careful to get it right.  Eventually it was published and it is now before us.  It has taken a long time to progress the Bill, but I hope it will have a speedy passage before the election.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I met King Hussein of Jordan in Government Buildings on Wednesday, 19 February and I was accompanied by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I assured King Hussein of the full support of Ireland and of the European Union for the Middle East peace process.  I sought the king's assessment of the current position and congratulated him on the positive role he has played in working for lasting reconciliation and peace in the Middle East, particularly leading up to the recent agreement on Hebron.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>King Hussein expressed optimism that the work for peace would continue to make progress and spoke of his continuing commitment to it.  He also conveyed his appreciation of the important contribution made under the Irish Presidency of the European Union and stressed the value of the <Col N="923" /> supporting role the European Union continues to play.</P>
    <P>We also discussed the issue of the export of Irish beef and dairy products to Jordan.  I assured the Jordanians that Irish food was produced to the highest quality and subject to stringent controls. The Jordanians undertook to give positive reconsideration to their ban on the importation of Irish beef and dairy products and King Hussein suggested the establishment of a specialised group to examine the problems in this area.  We will be pursuing this proposal with the relevant authorities in Jordan.</P>
    <P>We also had some brief discussion on the general situation in the Middle East and on the Euro-med Partnership Agreement.</P>

      <P>How extensive were the Taoiseach's discussions with King Hussein on the position in the Middle East?  Will he state the Government's view on the decision of the Israeli Prime Minister to give the green light to the extension of the settlements, particularly in East Jerusalem, in the face of the objections of the Palestinian people and the United Nations? Does the Taoiseach agree that these decisions may have related more to the domestic position of the Israeli Prime Minister than the continuing peace process in the Middle East?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the King of Jordan the Irish Government deeply regrets the extension of construction on the part of the Israeli authorities in the Har Homa area of East Jerusalem.  I indicated to him that the European Union had stated, at the highest level at the Dublin Summit, that settlements in the occupied territories by the Israeli authorities contravene international law and are an obstacle to peace.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach elaborate on his discussions with King Hussein on agricultural matters?  Did the Taoiseach say the king expressed satisfaction with our agricultural industry? Did he discuss the possibility of our expanding our export market to the Middle East? From their talks on agriculture did the Taoiseach ascertain whether, as in the case of other countries, Jordan is prepared to import Irish beef?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Jordanian market for Irish beef is comparatively small, approximately 1,000 tonnes annually, but I did raise the matter with His Majesty.  As a result he suggested that a specialised group be established to examine the issue of Irish dairy and beef exports to Jordan.  I have written to the Prime Minister of Jordan, Abdel Karim Kabariti, on foot of my discussions with the king last week suggesting a timetable for the establishment of this group.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not raise the matter in those terms.  In fact I think King Hussein's success in reaching an agreement on the very difficult issue of Hebron is testament to the fact that the Israeli Government is capable of reaching agreements, including one with the Palestinian authorities, something the Likud Government had never done previously.  Therefore, I did not raise it in the terms expressed by Deputy Sargent. However, I did express the concern of Ireland and the European Union that there should be continued willingness to reach a compromise on difficult issues standing in the way of progress.</P>

      <Quest>the indicators of human well being and social progress which are used by the CSO, other than GNP and GDP, in view of the fact that these established measurements count motor accidents as a benefit to society and care of the elderly as a negative cost.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4496/97]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Gross domestic product and gross national product are internationally recognised measurements of the value of goods and services produced in the country and of the income accruing to residents.  They are compiled in accordance with international standards and conventions but are not intended to be measurements of welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to other agencies the Central Statistics Office produces a wide range of statistics measuring the economic and social conditions of the country and its people.  The Government has also agreed that the Central Statistics Office should undertake a new quarterly national household survey beginning in the middle of this year. This new survey will replace the annual Labour Force Survey and will cover social topics on a rotating modular basis as well as labour market information.  In his question the Deputy refers to motor accidents and unpaid work, implying that motor accidents serve to increase the level of GDP and GNP while care of the elderly reduces them.  Unfortunately the reality of life is that motor accidents do occur.  Fortunately, in reacting to and dealing with them there are in place folseach' <Col N="925" /> low-up services such as help, security, fire services, legal car repair and others involving many workers.  The ill-effects of accidents are, therefore, counted as part of output and thus contribute to GDP and GNP.  As regards care of the elderly, the Deputy is obviously concerned with voluntary care because the services of paid carers are counted in output, GDP and GNP but voluntary care services, like other unpaid care work, neither add to nor subtract from GDP and GNP.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>This question arose from a previous supplementary question of mine and I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Good GDP figures send the financial markets into a frenzy of delight but does the Minister agree that the effects of good economic growth are much more complicated for men and women on the street?  Has the CSO specifically considered compiling or it is prepared to compile a range of figures comparable to GDP and GNP along the lines of figures compiled in other countries as a &ldquo;Genuine Progress Indicator&rdquo;, which measure car accidents as defensive expenditure, values work in the home and the voluntary sector and measures the effects of crime?  That would give a far truer measure of progress.  Given that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul continually states that the gap between rich and poor is getting wider, does that Minister think it necessary to be more accurate in measuring progress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Fundamentally I agree with the Deputy's observations.  GDP and GNP are essentially economic barometers or measurements.  As to having a wider range of social and environmental indicators, the Government is conscious of the need to enhance the measurement indicators and introduce new measurement procedures, for example, the quarterly household survey.  This will be done on a modular basis and on different occasions we will examine different aspects of the social picture.</P>
      <P>The policy agreement A Government of Renewal stated that the Government was committed to work towards a new set of indicators of sustainable economic development which will take account of environmental and social factors and these indicators would be used alongside the existing measurements of economic activity such as GDP, GNP, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1996 the ESRI published a study, commissioned by the Department of the Environment, on the issues and options arising in connection with this commitment.  It dealt with environmental and social issues.  As regards environmental indicators, a work programme towards the definition of sustainable development indicators is being developed by the Department of the Environment; it is being finalised and will be completed shortly.  As regards social indicators, the ESRI study discussed their selection and quantification and recommended the adoption of the OECD list of social indicators as a basis for a scheme for Ireland.  These seek to go <Col N="926" /> beyond the traditional national accounting measures by focusing on the distribution of resources and extending measurement to include non-economic aspects.  The ESRI noted that, while much of the information for several of these indicators is already available for Ireland, it is in many cases available only at long-term intervals &mdash; for example, the census of population &mdash; or on a basis which makes it less comparable with other countries.</P>
    <P>The quarterly household survey will deal with social problems such as crime, other social areas such as income, leisure, household consumption, transport, social mobility, social contact, housing and the general work environment.  By and large, we are introducing a more comprehensive range of measurements to deal with the points the Deputy makes.</P>
    <P>As regards unwaged work, particularly work which up to now has not been quantified in economic or social terms &mdash; the work of housewives or others who work in the home &mdash; this was addressed in Partnership 2000 for inclusion under employment and competitiveness.  Paragraph 5.11 commits us to the development of statistical methods to evaluate the full extent of the contribution of unpaid work, mainly done by women and their contribution to the national economy, including their contributions to the remunerated and domestic sectors, will be undertaken during the course of the Partnership.</P>
    <P>On foot of this commitment the CSO will undertake a pilot time-use survey using draft questionnaires and methods prepared by Eurostat. Such surveys are designed to measure how people allocate their time to different social and economic activities.  The 1997 pilot survey will use only a relatively small sample and will therefore not produce comprehensive results.  It is designed mainly to establish the feasibility and cost of conducting such a survey on a larger, national, representative basis.  We are moving in that direction but it takes time to draft the modules and quantify the amount of money involved.  The Government's intention is to have as accurate as possible a barometer of the relative values of work, whether waged or unwaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is emphasising the need to go beyond GDP and GNP but I would like to hear more about the module developed by the Department of the Environment.  He said the study is likely to be finished soon but I would appreciate more definite information.  Does he agree that, until such time as we have GDP, GNP and a &ldquo;Genuine Progress Indicator&rdquo; side by side, the urgency to tackle environmental crises will not be apparent; and, conversely, there will always be a temptation to seek economic developments damaging to human health, such as landmines and Sellafield?  In GDP and GNP terms those are healthy developments but they have a huge negative effect.  Will he ensure the indicator he spoke about or a better one will be given equal emphasis to GDP and GNP when it is ready?</P>

      <P>As regards the timescale I am reliably informed we are talking about weeks rather than months and I assure the Deputy I will continue to pursue this matter with the CSO.  I agree with him about setting relative factors side by side.  From the point of view of providing a comprehensive profile of economic and social relativity it is desirable that we introduce the mechanisms as soon as possible and set them side by side so that we are in a position to form judgments as to the relative values.  The Government is committed to this, it is mentioned in Partnership 2000, it is the subject of an ERSI report and we will continue to push forward the mechanisms to ensure we can make as valid a comparison as possible at the earliest possible date.  That is all I can tell the Deputy at this stage.</P>

      <P>My question was partly covered by Deputy Sargent.  I am interested in the extent of the pilot survey the Minister spoke about and I am glad the result will be available within weeks but how comprehensive is it?  If it is a small survey will the findings be of any great benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of using as accurate as possible a cross-section to give the most comprehensive possible picture, it is generally recognised that the CSO has ensured over the years that its surveys are pitched to determine accuracy.  This was the experience as regards the Labour Force Survey &mdash; it covers 45,000 households in April and when cross-checked against other mechanisms it gives an accurate and comprehensive picture.  I am told it is a random sample and is in the early stages of preparation.  The idea was to pitch it as accurately as possible.  I do not have the number of households surveyed but will determine it and convey the information to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>There is constant liaison between the CSO and similar organisations in <Col N="928" /> other countries.  This is crucial from the viewpoint of getting as accurate and comparative a picture as possible regarding all aspects of economic, social and environmental performance.</P>
      <P>In compiling figures on inflation, GDP, GNP, etc., we must conform with the norms that apply in other countries.  They are all compiled on the basis of a well established range of norms, practices, indicators and standards.</P>

It was compiled on a quarterly basis in respect of the middle Tuesday of the months of February, May, August and November each year up to the end of 1996.  From January 1997 onwards, it is being compiled on a monthly basis.

However, special factors apply in this instance, including the pitching of prices below normal during the Christmas sales.

He will be aware that people <Col N="929" /> have been queuing overnight in my constituency to buy property which is now escalating in value at the rate of almost 20 per cent per annum.

      <P>It is not a fiction.  The HCIP excludes the price of owner occupier housing, health services and educational services. However, there is an 89 per cent conformity when the HCIP is compared with the consumer price index in this country.  The variation is only 11 per cent.  The reduction in the rate by 0.5 per cent is welcome.  When incorporated into the 12 month figure it will help to keep it down.  All indicators, guidelines and requirements necessary to qualify for inclusion in European Monetary Union are being met.  We are confident there is no threat from the inflation rate.</P>

      <P>The Second Report of the Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries established under the SMI entitled <i>Delivering Better Government</i>, was launched in May 1996.  This report sets out a comprehensive programme of change for the public service which is being undertaken as part of the ongoing work of Departments and offices.  Costs arising are being met in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key part of implementing the SMI/Delivering Better Government is drawing up and publishing strategy statements setting out clear objectives for each Department and office. This process is now nearing completion in Departments and offices with statements of strategy <Col N="930" /> either published or nearing publication. These set out organisational goals and objectives and the strategies and resources to achieve them.</P>

      <P>There is also the question of efficiencies and savings.  The question was in respect of the cost to date of implementing the SMI to which I have replied.  I will be delighted to reply to any specific questions.  The strategic management initiative reaches across every Department and agency of the State.  In this file I do not have all the details about any particular aspect of it.  Costs and savings, value for money, efficiency in terms of management systems go back to the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, and the requirements emanating from them.  We also have the strategic management initiative <i>Delivering Better Government</i> which was launched in May 1996.  If I am asked a question on a specific Department I will try to answer it but I cannot launch into the entire public service, Department by Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say a few words about savings if that is what the Deputy wants.  Deputies will recall that <i>Delivering Better Government</i> published on 2 May 1996 recommended changes to existing financial management controls and procedures, among many other things, including a more appropriate public financial framework for setting public expenditure allocations and for delegating authority to Departments to manage resources allocated to them.  Each Department was delegated the authority to manage its own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> The changes are designed to provide the basis for the improved financial performance required to underpin a results driven approach to the Civil Service generally.  In particular the results driven approach of the SMI requires clarity in the outputs to be derived from public expenditure, it is designed to achieve better efficiency and service delivery and to place greater emphasis on achieving the best value for money.  The cost of providing improved quality public services under the SMI must be met from efficiency gains and the new systems and structures being put in place in respect of public expenditure control and management, as envisaged in the document <i>Delivering Better Government</i> are specifically designed to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The main areas of change proposed for financial management centres on the introduction of multi-annual budgetary process &mdash; Deputies will recall that on Monday last my colleague the Minister, Deputy Dukes, made an announcement in respect of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications &mdash; are the delegation of financial authority both within Departments and through Department from the Department of Finance, improvements to the administrative budgets system and the introduction of financial management systems which reflect accrual accounting procedures.  To implement the proposals in the report in these areas a financial management working group has been set up and assigned the task of developing and overseeing implementation of proposals.  This working group has now developed an overall programme of action which will see these changes being implemented in the coming months.</P>
    <P>These changes when taken in tandem with the publication of the departmental statements of strategy &mdash; not all have been submitted at this time &mdash; will result in better control of expenditure and the achieving of value for money through regular reviews of expenditure programmes.  This process will take time to implement but we will begin to see the first benefits of this new approach this year with the introduction of multi-annual budgeting.  The savings will come on stream this year.</P>
    <P>The thrust of these developments is consistent with and develops the focus on value for money articulated in section 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.  This imposes a responsibility on Departments to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of their expenditure and to put in place systems, procedures and practices to enable them to do so.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General may carry out examinations of expenditures of Departments to establish that this requirement is being met.  So far 16 value for money examinations of expenditure programmes have been undertaken.  I will not give details of them all but they can be circulated to the Deputy if she wishes.</P>
    <P>The SMI approach is also based on the integration <Col N="932" /> of a number of elements in the overall programme of change for the Civil Service.  The initiatives outlined in relation to financial management systems must also be integrated in the overall framework for managing performance in the civil and public service.  Changes in this area are being overseen by the working group on human resource management and the programme of action of the working groups is designed and integrated to underpin the approach to improve performance across the entire range of services provided by the civil and public services, including financial performance.</P>

      <P>It is very interesting.  Since the Minister asked for a specific question I will ask a specific question.  She stated with her usual categorical self assurance on 26 November that all Departments' statements would be ready and published prior to Christmas 1996.  It is long past Christmas and even the Christmas sales are over. Why were all Departments' statements not completed and published?  Under the strategic management initiative has anyone been dismissed for not completing statements and what action, if any, has the Minister taken in respect of the offending Departments who refused to obey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that not all Departments or agencies of State met the end of December deadline which had been pitched for them in relation to their strategy statement.  Delays in publishing arose from different local circumstances. Each Department was able to produce what it thought was a credible excuse.  Some offices were involved in EU Presidency work and Partnership 2000.  The people involved in compiling the strategy statement were working on either the EU Presidency or Partnership 2000.  That work is now complete and next week we will launch the strategy statement of the Department of the Taoiseach.  Because of the Presidency commitment, the Department of the Taoiseach was one of those delayed.  When challenged, each Department which did not meet its deadline gave me its reason.  I do not accept it nor do I like it but there is little I can do about it.  They will all be published in a matter of a few weeks, including those which did not meet the deadline.  Some had good excuses, others less so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is disappointing news for those of us who continue to support the efforts of the Minister of State in this long-term issue.  In January 1994 the Government decided the Taoiseach's Department should be the leader in this matter.  Departments were asked to set out in their strategic management initiatives what they were doing and how they thought they could do <Col N="933" /> it in a more efficient way.  Three years later they do not know what they are doing and have not decided how they can to it in a better way.  It augurs poorly for the strategic management initiative. Those responsible are trying to frustrate what this House is doing.  If we are to get anywhere with this initiative we have to do it on an all-party basis.  When the Minister of State gave me the information on 26 November she would have known the people, who obviously gave her incorrect information, were involved in the EU Presidency which was five months on at that time. People within the system have no interest in the strategic management initiative and what we have got to date are costs which are of no benefit to the House.  I hope those in Departments who read the Official Report will see that this House is taking the initiative seriously, on an all-party basis.  Three years after it was launched by the Department of the Taoiseach, that Department has not produced its statement.  It is a poor show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the general chiding of the Deputy.  I am disappointed that not all Departments met the deadline.  I would not go as far as the Deputy when he said that three years on the lead Department, the Department of the Taoiseach, does not know what it is doing.  The fact that it has not published does not make that statement. The Department and the Secretary of that Department are taking a lead role in the whole strategic management initiative on <i>Delivering Better Government.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement has been ready since mid-January but it was a month late.  It will be launched next week when the Taoiseach is available and it is an important signal.  It is ready but it has not been launched publicly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not two years late.  Obviously Deputy Brennan, unlike Deputy Ahern, does not understand this is the second statement of strategy each Department has to produce.  The first strategy statement was submitted long ago and this is the second statement.  The first statement was not published but this one will be published. The second statement was to be ready by the end of December but I did not receive it until January. Approximately half the reports have been placed in the Oireachtas Library and the remainder will be placed there very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree it is not acceptable for a Department to miss a deadline.  We hold the EU Presidency once every six years and the submission of the statement in January instead of December does not show a lack of commitment to the Strategic Management Initiative.  It is intended to launch the report next week and Deputies will be pleased <Col N="934" /> when they read it.  I hope to have an opportunity to brief Deputy Ahern on this and other matters before the launch next week.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their continued support for the Strategic Management Initiative which was launched in January-February 1994 by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  There has been consistent all-party support for the thrust of the initiative and the proposed reform of the public service.  It has also received excellent support to date from the public sector unions. The initiative sets out short, medium and long-term agendas and it is extremely important for us to send out a signal that there is all-party support for this reform programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that some Departments seem very reluctant to co-operate with her?

Is she responsible for ensuring deadlines are met and that the initiative works and, if not, who is?</P>

I accept my responsibility but I did not receive the statement until the middle of January.  One must adopt a reasonable approach to these matters.  The report will be launched next week.  The delay does not give a good signal but this is not a measure of the enthusiasm of public or civil servants in the Department of the Taoiseach for the initiative. There is a broad range of Departments and State agencies and the commitment to &ldquo;Delivering Better Government&rdquo; ranges from enormous enthusiasm in many Departments to compliance in one or two Departments.</P>

A co-ordinating group, which includes representatives of the private and public sectors, has been set up, while working groups are dealing with the various areas.  The programme for 1997 has been set and action is being taken.  There are different levels of enthusiasm in Departments and agencies but they will all achieve the same aim at the end of the day.</P>

      <Quest>the number of posts which will arise from the demographic dividend for the school year 1997-98; if these posts will be used to reduce class size and improve the quality of primary education.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the demographic dividend which will arise in the 1996-97 school year.  Data relating to the 1997-98 school year will not be available until early 1998.  The preliminary estimate of the demographic dividend arising in the current school year due to declining pupil enrolments is approximately 600.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there has been a massive reduction in pupil enrolments in primary schools in recent years.  They declined by 12,600 in the 1995-96 school year and by 11,000 in 1996-97 school year, and it is estimated that they will further decline by 10,700 in the coming school year, giving a total decline of 34,300 pupils between September 1994 and September 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of this year's demographic dividend, some posts will be required to meet the needs of schools whose increased enrolments on <Col N="936" /> 30 September 1996 warrant the allocation of additional posts from September 1997.  It is estimated that further posts will be required to meet demands from schools for additional staffing as a result of increased enrolments and to ensure compliance with maximum class size guidelines.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that by next September the Government will have reduced the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools to 22:1 from a level of 25.2:1 when I took office.  Implementing a pupil teacher ratio of 22:1 will also enable me to retain a substantial number of posts to further enhance the quality of primary education through, for example, improving the staffing schedule and providing extra resources to address a range of special needs.  This will leave a further number of surplus posts and I will explore the possibility of retaining these in the primary education system.</P>
    <P>Since taking office I have retained almost 1,270 teaching posts in the primary sector which would otherwise have been surplus due to falling enrolments. I have used these posts to reduce maximum class sizes substantially and to provide a substantial number of additional posts in the special education and disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said approximately 600 posts will arise in 1996-97 academic year as a result of the demographic dividend.  It has been the practice since 1987 under the Programme for National Recovery, the PCW and PESP, and in consultation with the social partners, for all posts which arise as a result of declining pupil enrolments to be redistributed within the system.  The Minister has continued this policy but she did not specifically say that all the 600 posts which become available in 1996-97 will be retained within the system.  Will she confirm that all these posts will be retained within the primary school system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explore the possibility of retaining the surplus posts in the primary education system.  It is worth repeating the starting reduction in pupil enrolments.  They declined by 12,600 in 1995-96 and by 11,000 in 1996-97 and it is estimated they will decline further by approximately 11,000 in 1997-98.  The benefits of this is that, regardless of whether teachers are involved in the home-school liaison scheme, remedial teaching, etc.  I can now guarantee a pupil-teacher ratio of 22:1.  We look forward to having classes not bigger than 35 pupils, with a maximum of 31 pupils in multi grade classes where one or more class grades are taught together.  No school in a designated disadvantaged area will have a class size greater than 29 pupils.  The Deputy is aware of the very satisfactory pupil-teacher ratio in the areas covered by the Breaking the Cycle intervention where for the first four school years no class is bigger than 15 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have used the dramatic fall in population in a very positive and targeted way and we are very much on stream to reach the 22:1 pupil-teacher <Col N="937" /> ratio which was guaranteed.  As the Deputy said, when the 600 posts are divided among that 22:1 ratio there will be a number of posts available.  I am not finished with the matter but that is how it stands today.</P>

That has been reflected in discussions with the primary partner involved, the INTO.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister, to help her case, that no remedial teacher was appointed last year as a result of the demographic dividend.  Does she agree there is an enormous need for additional remedial teachers throughout the system and a crying need for the creation of additional psychological posts?  Some 80 per cent of primary school children do not have access to an educational psychologist.</P>

      <Quest>if she will commission a study into the weight of school bags and their impact on the health and well-being of the nation's children; and the steps, if any, she will take to alleviate the hardships currently imposed on school children as a result of the excessive weight of school bags.</Quest>

      <P>In 1995 I established an advisory committee on textbooks and materials for primary schools.  This committee, which includes representatives of the partners in education, was requested, as part of its remit, to investigate the matter of the optimum weight and size of school books when preparing new guidelines for publishers.</P>
      <P>These guidelines will be issued to the partners. Therefore, in the circumstances I will await the final guidelines and I do not consider it necessary to commission a study specifically to examine the impact of the weight of school bags on the health of pupils.  I am satisfied that I will get advice on this from the group which is already sitting.</P>
      <P>I should point out that teachers and parents working in partnership very often make suitable practical arrangements at individual school level to address this issue.  Such arrangements can include, for example, advance planning of timetables so that pupils know which books are required on any day.  Where such arrangements are in place, they are extremely effective in addressing the difficulties associated with heavy school bags.  At second level, in particular, the availability of school storage and the midday lunch break are of assistance in alleviating this problem for some students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled this question as a result of meetings which I had with various parent groups throughout the country.  One group which I met in Ballincollig provided me with a school bag full of books and asked me to put it on my shoulder. The weight of the bag was extraordinary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still relatively strong.  The parents put it to me that a 13 and a half year old girl had to carry that bag, which weighed one and a half stone, on her mile and a half walk to school. Carrying such heavy bags must have health implications for children.  The Minister indicated that a group has been set up to prepare guidelines on the weight of school books.  However, a study by an expert group is needed to assess the health implications of the weight of school bags.  We need that basic data to provide schools with the resources for storage and lockers, which most schools cannot afford to provide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have set up an advisory committee on textbooks and materials.  Its terms of reference include a request to provide guidelines and specifications for textbooks and other teaching materials for use in national schools, to provide guidelines for the information of parents and schools on the selection of textbooks and other teaching materials, to investigate the matter of the optimum weight and size of school bags, to keep new publications under review and to advise the Department of Education on their suitability for use in primary schools.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's worry is being addressed by this committee, which includes representatives of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, the National Parents' Council, the Heritage Council, the Women's Council of Ireland and the Department of Education, including An Gúm.</P>
      <P>This worry has been addressed by the National Parents' Council which, in a report prepared in 1989, suggested that the optimum solution to the problem would have to be addressed at individual school level.  I pass nine schools on my way to this part of the city in the morning and I am mesmerised by the shape and weight of what appear to be very heavy school bags which students carry on their shoulders.</P>
      <P>My children have been through this experience but Deputy Martin's are only beginning.  There is something to be said for asking children to empty out their school bags and to show what they carry in them.  I say that as a very practical response as a parent to a worry about the weight of my children's school bags.  That is a role which parents can play.</P>
      <P>Parents can also look at timetabling.  That begs questions about the voice of parents with school managements.  This is a problem which all the edicts from the Department of Education will not resolve.  One has to ask why some children carry heavier bags than those of their counterparts in other schools who are taking the same subjects. As I said, this problem is best resolved at individual school level but there are roles for parents and school managements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> The advisory committee was asked to address this issue before the Deputy brought it to my attention because it is a problem which everybody faces.  However, the answer does not lie totally with the Department of Education.  The Department has a role to play and when the guidelines are made available to me I will share the information with the Deputy.  Deputy Browne is not with us today but he raises this subject in the House at the start of each school year and, as a consequence of his concern, this is now included in the terms of reference.  I do not want to pre-empt the findings of the advisory committee currently sitting, but I will be delighted to share any recommendations they make with the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take on board the parenting tips offered.  In regard to the bag the parents asked me to carry around the meeting room in Ballincollig, we opened it and discovered that every book was necessary.  Because of the junior certificate syllabus, for example, publishers are printing books to cover the three year course.  In other words, a child starting in first year has the whole programme for three years in one book for each subject.  That problem was specifically identified. These books are beneficial from a cost point of view but the weight issue is a significant factor.  When does the Minister expect the working committee to report to her?  All the initiatives taken so far have been ineffective and the parents believe nothing has been or will be done about this problem if a serious initiative is not taken. The Minister referred to a report compiled in 1989.  This is now 1997 and no action has been taken.</P>

      <P>The 1989 report was from the National Parents Council.  The committee I established is currently sitting.  The Deputy said every book in the bag was needed that day but that raises the question of class timetables.</P>

      <P>If every subject a child is taking for the junior certificate course is scheduled for the same day, that child is at a disadvantage compared to a child in a neighbouring school where class scheduling takes account of the weight of books and materials required for a particular day.  I cannot answer this question.  It is best asked and answered locally.  The Deputy referred to publications and I know some books cover the entire three year syllabus.  Publishers are involved with the Department of Education and are represented on this committee.  Recommendations can be made on dividing the course into various parts.  There may be cost implications but these questions should be asked and practical answers given.  Deputy Martin should not imply that nothing is being done about this problem. Action is being taken but it cannot all be taken in Marlborough Street.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>I have already taken a number of steps to increase the supply of appropriately qualified computer graduates from third level colleges.  I have allocated 1,800 places to the computer science area under the joint public/private sector £60 million capital initiative.  This represents 29 per cent of the total of 6,200 additional places under the initiative.  The other places under the initiative are for agreed areas of priority manpower needs, for example in science, engineering, mathematics and business studies.</P>
      <P>I have also increased the number of places on one year postgraduate programmes in computer applications open to those with suitable primary degrees.  The output in 1997 from this one year programme, including those under the advanced technical skills programme, will be over 800.  It is planned to increase this output to 1,250 in 1998. Numbers can be increased further in subsequent years to the extent necessary.</P>
      <P>In the current academic year I have also approved a range of new courses in the Dublin Institute of Technology/RTC sector in computing and associated disciplines, software engineering and multimedia applications development.  The Government has also recently approved the establishment of a steering committee, chaired by the chairman of the Higher Education Authority, to begin a bidding and negotiation process with educational and training institutions.  The aim of the committee is to identify the most cost effective way of providing 1,000 additional software graduates and 750 technicians per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee will urgently examine all the <Col N="942" /> viable possibilities for meeting this requirement. The committee's report will then be considered by Government in determining the best strategy. While I would not wish to pre-empt the work of the committee, it appears likely that the major contribution to addressing the skills needs in this area will come from the publicly funded third level institutions with an established record in providing appropriately qualified personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government serious about its industrial investment policy?  There appears to be no integration in that regard between the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Education.  Is the Minister not aware of the boom in the computer industry? Why are we only reacting now to what has been known for many years?  Will the Minister agree a great deal of discussion must take place between the Departments on this issue?  Have any discussions taken place in that regard?  Will the Minister agree it is necessary to increase the number of places available for computer studies as a matter of urgency?  Last year over 2,500 students applied for computer studies but only half of those obtained places.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should listen to the information I am giving.  This group is chaired by Professor Frances Ruane of Trinity College and includes representatives of the industrial development agencies, FÁS, the Departments of Enterprise and Employment, Finance and Education as well as the Higher Education Authority. That group has an ongoing brief to advise the Government, but if we are to increase the pace at which we create job opportunities, we must meet our requirements in the medium and long-term, and I have every confidence we will do that.  I have already put in place initiatives that will result in a positive outcome at the end of this academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In contrast with the miserable record of previous Governments, this Government has been very successful in attracting exceptional job opportunities, particularly for graduates.  On the basis of advice from the skills group, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise and Employment, whose success in attracting jobs is worth admiring, and the development agencies which sell Ireland on the quality of our graduates, responded with an initiative, based on a decision of 11 December 1996.  A report will be made available on the continued availability of sufficient numbers of high <Col N="943" /> quality graduates and skilled persons in the workforce. A committee was established to put in place a system that will allow us to identify the institutions of education which will respond to immediate needs.</P>
    <P>The shortage of computer skills is also evident in other countries.  The pace of change and development in industry has increased the need throughout the world for people with skills in technology.  The US recently identified the need for 195,000 extra engineers each year, but their colleges produce only 35,000 engineers per year. We want to be in a position to respond to requirements. A decision was made to put in place a negotiation process involving education and training institutions with a view to identifying the most cost effective way of providing 1,000 software places and 750 technician places per annum in addition to the extra places that have been provided.</P>

Extra places have been made available through the ATS and the new courses approved for the Dublin Institute of Technology-RTC sector.  A number of places were made available under the various initiatives.  The success can be measured by the high quality of jobs achieved by graduates, and they are accountable for that success.  Extra people will be required in the computer, language and technician areas and, in conjunction with the Departments of Finance and Enterprise and Employment, I established a committee to ensure that when the skills are needed the necessary graduates will be qualified.  I will come back to the House and report on the success of that initiative.  This is a successful policy and there is no shortage of job opportunities for graduates.</P>

      <P>The skills shortage represents the single greatest strategic failure of the Government in terms of industrial education planning.  It is extraordinary that the Minister has not met the heads of universities or the directors of regional technical colleges to develop a national coherent plan to deal with these shortages.  Does she accept the figure of 1,750 places is an underestimate of what is required in the marketplace?  The 1,250 additional places announced last year in the computer area has not proved sufficient and neither will the figure of 1,750 for the next academic year.</P>
      <P>In regard to Question No. 9, does the Minister see a role for private sector third level colleges in assisting public sector colleges to meet the skills shortage?  It is time for leadership from the Minister, she should not ask a committee to do her work.  The Government should adopt a hands-on approach to this matter.  Because of its capacity to attract industry in the future this is the single most important issue facing the country.  The Minister said there are job opportunities, but there are no graduates to avail of them.  The Minister must take responsibility for this scandal.</P>

      <P>In regard to private colleges, no possibility is closed off in terms of investing in additional places.  A total of 4,000 students attend private commercial colleges.  That sector is unregulated except for courses approved by the National Council for Educational Awards.  The need to regulate the sector in terms of guaranteeing the quality of courses and the standing of institutions and protecting the financial investment for student and parents is highlighted in the White Paper, <i>Charting our Education Future</i>.  The regulation of any sector of education is referred to TEASTAS, the national certification authority. Pending the establishment of TEASTAS on a statutory basis and the introduction of control procedures, we should not automatically look to the private sector.  We will look to the sector that has been the success story of the 1980s and the 1990s, the educational system.  The success of graduates in the State system has guaranteed them employment prospects at home.  We hope to have even more graduates available to fill the greater number of jobs coming on stream.  The success that has resulted in current investment <Col N="947" /> has been based on the State system of education, the regulated system.</P>

      <P>When the Minister recently appointed an expert body to make recommendations on the upgrading of the regional technical colleges, why did she not appoint a representative of industry to the board?  Will she acknowledge regional colleges tend to tailor-fit their graduates for job opportunities in the market place?  Does she agree it is crucial that regional colleges, and the bodies that shape their future policy, incorporate a voice from industry in their decision making process?  When setting up that body the Minister missed an important opportunity to close the gap between industry and education.  Is it too late to add a representative of industry to the board of that expert group?</P>

      <P>The reply to a later question deals in more detail with this matter.  The skills group to consider the overall needs of the computer software area was established by FÁS.  That group includes representatives of FÁS, the Departments and the HEA.  I am confident that the quality of the advice available in the existing committee will help us identify the needs of this area.</P>
      <P>There is an opportunity to reflect the partnership of the community involved in education with the specific composition of the boards of the regional technical colleges and the universities when the composition of their governing bodies is changed by the universities legislation.  The involvement of local industry will be available to the colleges and, as we assign places and make recommendations nationally, we must have access to information as the Deputy feels we should.</P>

      <P>Industrial action is being taken by members of the Public Service Executive Union in my Department.  This action involves members of that union refusing to carry out work related to vacant posts and to co-operate with any new work or scheme which they deem to require additional resources.</P>
      <P>Industrial action of this nature has the effect of slowing the flow of work to a greater or lesser extent.  In the Athlone offices the principal effect has been delay in the completion of administrative processes relating to the leaving certificate applied programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> Student achievement and performance in the leaving certificate applied is recorded in three modes; performance in final examinations, satisfactory completion of modules and performance of task work.  Assessment of task work takes place at the end of each session and is undertaken by visiting examiners appointed by my Department. The examiners assess the tasks produced by the students and also interview the students regarding the processes involved.  The assessment scheduled for the week commencing 3 February 1997, following the September/January session, has been postponed due to the industrial action.</P>
    <P>A letter notifying schools and examiners of the postponement was issued to school principals and examiners on 29 January 1997.  I very much regret the disruption which the necessary postponement of the assessment has caused to schools, students and examiners.  Every consideration will be given to candidates to ensure that they will not be adversely affected by this postponement.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need to resolve these industrial relations problems.  Every effort is being made by my Department to that end.  I hope that a satisfactory outcome will be arrived at very quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>What has happened to the leaving certificate applied has been disgraceful.  The letters of postponement went out on Thursday and the assessments were due on Monday.  That is a disgraceful way to treat 3,600 students, their parents and their teachers.</P>
      <P>Staff morale is at an all-time low in the Department of Education.  I have received correspondence that states that despite the crisis last year with the examinations, nobody at the top seems prepared to sort out the real problem, which is inadequate staffing.  Does the Minister accept there is an inadequate number of staff in the examinations branch?  The Minister referred to a work survey of that branch in reply to a parliamentary question I tabled before Christmas.  Has that been completed?  We are lurching from crisis to crisis with the examinations branch in Athlone because of the lack of staff.  Something will go wrong with the 1997 examinations unless the Minister moves quickly to deal with the chronic staffing inadequacies in her Department.</P>

      <P>It is very important not to exacerbate this situation, which is causing great concern in the Department.  I regret the dispute and assure the Deputy that every effort is under way to resolve the dispute.  Contacts with the union are continuing and I intend to avoid further disruption.  I do not want to exaggerate the effect of the action to date.  Plans for new forms for eliciting information have been deferred but the old forms were available and have been posted to schools.  There was some delay in the issuing of examination numbers but students do not become aware of their examination numbers until the oral examinations start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> The one practical effect of the dispute to date has been on the assessment of taskwork for the leaving certificate applied but that examination is in three sections.  If, following this session, the assessment of those tasks has to be delayed, that examination's results in August are not at the brink this week or next week.  There is an effect on the system but the situation would not be helped by my elaborating on that.</P>
    <P>There seemed to be a suggestion that this dispute was not a cause of concern to me or my officials.  I assure students, parents, teachers, examiners and the staff who carry the burden of maintaining confidence in the examination system that every effort is being made to effect a satisfactory outcome to this dispute.  Contact with the unions is certainly ongoing.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the main thrust of the Bill which has taken a long time to produce. While we on this side of the House had an input <Col N="955" /> into its drafting prior to leaving office, some aspects are causing concern and we intend to table amendments on Committee Stage to deal with them.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has lobbied successfully on behalf of its 427 units throughout the Republic to have changes made.</P>
      <P>The credit unions promote the concept of self-reliance and to empower their members to provide for their needs through their own efforts. This ethos, which is based on co-operation, was uppermost in the minds of the founders of the movement in the 1950s.  We tend to overlook the motives which prompted these pioneers to establish credit unions.  The next phase of development should proceed in a structured way.  It is to facilitate this that this legislation has been introduced.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the effect credit unions have had on the social fabric.  Some tend to think of them as rural based organisations but there is no major town without an active and vibrant credit union.  New credit unions are springing up throughout the suburbs of Dublin city.  Many people do not realise the extent of which credit union members give of their time voluntarily. This is underestimated.</P>
      <P>Legislation which hinders or frustrates the development of credit unions will prove damaging. The restrictive caps that the Minister of State proposes to impose on shares, deposits and loans will have a serious effect.  The right of credit unions to own property will also be restricted. They will no longer be allowed to buy and sublet property to community organisations.  The Minister of State should seriously consider amending these provisions on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In certain areas the Bill will be intrusive and tend to centralise control.  This is unwarranted. The credit unions are self-regulated, have acted responsibly and demonstrated the value of the co-operative approach in resolving problems.  They have managed their own affairs successfully.  Any attempts to make changes by way of legislation should be discouraged.</P>
      <P>There are few individuals and families whose lives have not been affected and improved by the use of credit union facilities.  With more than 1.65 million members, the credit unions have grown not by way of a major marketing campaign or sophisticated advertising but through the service they offer and deliver to their members.  Credit unions are owned and run by their members and set out to serve their needs.  That is the basis of their success.  The credit union movement is one of the most successful co-operative movements this country has witnessed.  Credit unions do not make profits.  They are owned and run by their members for the good of their members.  A cornerstone of the movement is that anyone can join a credit union and that distinguishes them from other financial institutions motivated by profit. One notices the difference in walking into a credit union and walking into one of the commercial banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> I know of the work of the credit union movement on behalf of the community.  It serves its members in a number of ways including its involvement in sponsorship.  Recently a school principal told me she was amazed at the amount of support the local credit union gave her school. Students go on to be active members in their credit unions.</P>
    <P>The involvement of credit unions in supporting and sponsoring various sporting events reflects well on the movement.  The community games is one of the major events supported by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  The finals of the games are held annually in Mosney in September and are enjoyed not only by the participants in the sports events but by the parents and the organisers. The league's involvement in that successful sports weekend is a credit to the movement.</P>
    <P>I have seen the valuable input of credit unions to rural and urban society.  They have had a great impact on large urban areas and towns in my constituency, like Carlow, Tullow and Bagenalstown. Members of parishes and rural communities are brought together by involvement in their credit unions and that should be supported.  People's lives have been changed by their involvement in and the assistance given by credit unions.  Some people who would otherwise be driven to approach greedy moneylenders have received assistance from credit unions.  They were given dignity and credit union money breathed new life into communities whose outlook has been changed by the facilities offered them.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about a number of aspects of the Bill.  The limit applying to loans, shares and deposits is too restrictive and I ask the Minister to reconsider it and table amendments on Committee Stage.  The Irish League of Credit Unions lobbied for the introduction of this Bill and gave the Minister of State and the Department detailed submissions of amendments to the restrictions applying to shares, deposits and loans. It requested that the maximum level of shares should be increased from £20,000 to £30,000 and the maximum level of deposits from £20,000 to £50,000.  That proposed maximum limit for deposits may be too high, but the current maximum deposit of £20,000 should be increased. The maximum limit applying to loans should also be increased.  Credit unions have been successful in granting loans to fund house extensions.  With relatively ordinary houses in Dublin selling for £90,000 to £100,000 and house extensions and improvements costing in the region of £30,000 to £40,000, the maximum loan of £20,000 is too low. Will the Minister give serious consideration to reviewing those limits on Committee Stage?</P>
    <P>The Bill restricts the amount of savings a member can have with the credit union.  I fail to understand that restriction as members are entitled to only one vote, irrespective of the amount of money they have on deposit.  Under current legislation a member may save as much money as he or she wants to save with a credit union.  The cost of materials, particularly in the housing area, is <Col N="957" /> expensive and for that reason the maximum loan of £20,000 should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>There is a serious anomaly in credit unions investing in property to benefit the community. Having regard to the work they do in the community, the provision in that regard should be changed to assist them.</P>
    <P>The Bill brings into play the role of the Irish League of Credit Unions which, to date, has been largely supervisory, but it will change under this Bill.  There are 427 credit unions affiliated to the Irish League of Credit Unions and it has expressed to the Minister of State its disappointment about certain aspects of the Bill.  It has asked that amendments be introduced in line with its views expressed at a recent meeting.  Those views should be given serious consideration.  It is anxious that the limits on shares, loans and deposits are increased.</P>
    <P>We recognise the important role played by credit unions in society for the past number of decades. We should encourage and support the credit union movement in any legislation enacted by this Oireachtas.  The Minister of State should seriously consider tabling amendments in line with what is sought by the Irish League of Credit Unions, which is acting on behalf of its members. I appreciate his intention to table some amendments. Limits should be a percentage figure taking account of the size of a credit union.  The right of credit unions to decide what their members want to do with surpluses should be provided for.</P>
    <P>The procedures set out in section 48 covering the provision of new services are daft.  If we were to follow them, it would take more than two years to introduce even the smallest new service to credit union members.  Is the Minister of State seriously suggesting those detailed procedures are necessary before a credit union makes even the smallest new service available to its members? There is a difference between the development of a major new service and meeting the simple needs of credit union members.</P>
    <P>Some credit union officials are upset by the provisions on regulations.  Not alone does the Bill provide for the proper regulation of credit unions, it seeks to take over and run the movement, which is wrong.  Until now credit unions have been successfully self-regulated.  How will the Registrar of Friendly Societies police the credit union movement, given that at present he has considerable difficulty reporting his work?  The last report he produced covered a number of years ending with 1993.  Without providing a major increase in resources and finances to that office, the registrar will find the increased workload under this Bill unsupportable.  It takes the registrar two years to process the annual returns of credit unions and only rarely does he inspect a credit union.  The control and supervision of credit unions has been successfully done by the movement through the Irish League of Credit Unions.</P>
    <P>The movement is self-regulated.  Every credit union operates under rules approved by the registrar; <Col N="958" /> every loan or amount saved is insured; every person who works in a credit union is bonded and the movement has its own savings protection scheme.  It is to be commended on all these matters. The Irish League of Credit Unions inspects almost every branch annually and audits its activities professionally.  Despite that it is disappointing to note that the Bill does not recognise the rule of the league in the overall scheme of things.</P>
    <P>I express my appreciation of what credit unions have done for society over many years.  There is much merit in most of the provisions of the Bill but others are disconcerting for credit unions which because of their track record, particularly in supporting rural society, should be encouraged rather than discouraged from taking on additional services.</P>

      <P>As a member of a credit union, as a founding member of a study group established almost 30 years ago, the forerunner to the Donabate and District Credit Union established in 1968, I am glad to contribute to this long promised, overdue Bill.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the Government and, in particular, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, responded to the many representations received from all sides of the House and from the Irish League of Credit Unions to introduce this Bill as a matter of priority.  In its frequent meetings with politicians the Irish League of Credit Unions clearly enunciated the movement's urgent need for a legislative framework within which to service its members' present and future needs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to update and consolidate the body of the existing legislation, some of which dates back to 1893, in a single Bill to protect the ethical principle espoused by credit unions, of community self-help on a non-profit basis.</P>
      <P>This Bill covers all aspects of the activities of credit unions from registration and membership issues to operational and management procedures, to their overall scope and the supervisory role envisaged for the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The credit union movement has evolved from the many varying forms of credit co-operation that have obtained worldwide over the past 150 years or so.  It could be argued that its origins are to be found in the German people's bank founded in 1850 to enable tradesmen to obtain much needed credit for the purchase of supplies. The first Canadian credit union was formed in 1900.  The movement soon spread to the United States where a national organisation was established <Col N="959" /> so that today, worldwide, the credit union movement prospers in some 84 countries.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement was first introduced here in 1958.  It is appropriate to acknowledge the excellent work of the late Nora Herlihy who, as a teacher, daily witnessed the effects of unemployment and poverty on her students, particularly within the poor, working class areas of Dublin.  At that time money lending, loan sharks, pawnbrokers and hire purchase were the only means by which ordinary people could raise the necessary funds to buy essential commodities. Unfortunately, many of them found themselves in the clutches of those loan sharks whose so-called loans, in most cases, carried exorbitant rates of interest, sometimes ranging between 100 per cent and 400 per cent.  To her eternal credit Nora Herlihy took up the challenge, resulting in the first credit union being established in Dublin.  Since then approximately 422 branches have evolved throughout the 26 countries, their membership now stands at approximately 1.6 million and savings amount to a staggering £1.8 billion, clearly demonstrating the outstanding success of the movement.</P>
    <P>It should be noted also that the Irish League of Credit Unions is a 32-county organisation, another example of how people, North and South, can work in harmony for the benefit of the greater community.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement, with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, have been and continue to be to the forefront in the battle to rid Dublin of the scourge of moneylenders, some of whom are still active.  As legislators it is incumbent on us, through the various statutory and voluntary organisations, to get the message across to those unfortunate people still caught up in this barbaric system that help is available within the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>Where were the other financial institutions in that period, particularly throughout the 1950s, when the banks would not even consider giving loans to ordinary people?  Thankfully that has changed in recent years.  I am firmly of the view that that changed attitude of the banks is due largely to the work done and competition posed by credit unions.  Has the Minister of State received any representations from the mainstream financial institutions on the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    <P>Within the financial services area huge changes are taking place daily which will have a significant effect on the credit union movement.  In the beginning credit unions were dependent more on the co-operative, trusting relationship between their members and volunteers which I hope will continue to be a core policy within its movement. We must publicly acknowledge the role played by the many volunteers, in many cases the public face of credit unions, who work for them.  There are in excess of 10,000 active volunteers engaged in this work without whose commitment and <Col N="960" /> dedication the movement and its attendant philosophy would not be as strong as they are today.</P>
    <P>Our young people are among the best and brightest in the European Union.  It is imperative that many more of them should be encouraged to save and become involved by giving their skills and expertise voluntarily to the movement.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State confirmed he was open to suggestions from Members by way of improvement of the Bill.  I have a number of reservations about its provisions, particularly about section 27 (4) which stipulates that the maximum shareholding of a member of a credit union is £20,000; the same applies to a member's deposit account.  Any member who has deposited £40,000 in a credit union is committed to its philosophy.  I see no reason any credit union could not lend such an individual between, say, £25,000 and £30,000. Other amendments have been put forward by the Irish League of Credit Unions and I ask the Minister to take them on board.  I commend the Bill to the House and hope it will give the credit union movement even greater strength so it can move into the next century and beyond.</P>

      <P>It is rare that a Bill comes before the House which strikes a chord with all Members as this one does.  All of us are aware of the tremendous impact the credit union movement has had throughout Ireland.  It is surprising that it has taken almost 30 years for legislation on credit unions to be introduced but that speaks well of the movement, which has served its members magnificently over the years.  Its growth is remarkable but we must never forget that this was achieved because it served the needs, demands and requirements of its members and the community.</P>
      <P>The credit union was aptly described as the working person's bank.  It provided loans to many people who would not dare darken the doors of the main banking institutions, who would not have welcomed them in any case.  Many lessons can be learned by our major financial institutions from the ethos which has driven the credit union movement.  Families met emergency bills, bought their own car, built a much needed extension to their house or were able to go on a well-deserved holiday because of the existence of the credit unions.  Over the past 30 years they have been the only financial institutions to tailor their services to the needs of lower income customers.  They did everything possible to ensure their service was not prohibitive and did not scare people but rather encouraged them to become members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They should be complimented for their ethos and their belief that when one borrows one must also save.  That has not been encouraged by any other financial institution.  Every young person should start his or her savings with the credit union movement, as it would instil in him or her that saving will enable one to borrow and one can save while also paying back a loan.  It is a tremendous ethos and credit unions should be complimented for it.  If young people became <Col N="961" /> used to dealing with the credit union movement, far fewer people would have crises of bad debts or inability to meet their financial commitments. The credit union also inspired confidence in people who would feel intimidated by other financial institutions.  They felt that the credit union was on their side so they were not afraid or ashamed of admitting how small their income was or how little capacity they had to save.  They felt the credit union was their house.</P>
    <P>We must examine how credit unions served the needs of their members.  It is a pity that our major financial institutions learned this lesson much later. In my constituency, the town of Cahir is regularly packed on Monday nights with people making their weekly credit union lodgements.  What other financial institution has business hours totally geared to the customer rather than itself?  That is the strength of the credit unions &mdash; they made it their business to be available when people were able to visit them.  Up to two years ago, many of us had to spend our lunch hour or take time off work to transact business in the major banks.  Until they changed their practices, people found it almost impossible to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The ethos of the credit union was to serve the needs of its members, recognising the demands within their daily lives and leaving the door open when it suited people to come in.  The most important reason they were able to do this was the volunteer element within the movement. They could run a business at times which would be called unfriendly within the normal working regime.  Volunteers ran the credit unions during what many would call unsocial hours.  It is great to think we had a financial institution with a non-profit making ethos.  Credit unions never departed from this principle, although the temptation must have been there when they saw their business go from strength to strength.  At all times their thought was to serve the community.</P>
    <P>Credit unions are an integral part of Irish life, rural and urban, and they continue to grow and prosper.  It is extraordinary that £2 billion is currently invested in 434 credit unions.  I am glad that the Bill first and foremost protects the essential ethos of the movement.  It would be detrimental or at the least a backward step to damage that ethos, which has been so vital over the years and formed the basis for the success of the movement.</P>
    <P>I am also glad that the Bill provides for additional services such as insurance and foreign exchange.  Why should customers not be able to avail of those facilities in their credit unions, when customers of other financial institutions can avail of such facilities where they do their business? Why must credit union customers go elsewhere for foreign exchange?  The credit union is their bank and I am delighted the Bill caters for extended services.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary because of the success of the movement over the past few years.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on introducing the legislation, whose purpose is <Col N="962" /> to provide a statutory framework for the development and growth of the movement and to enable credit unions to provide an enhanced range of services to their customers.  I am delighted that the Minister had wide-ranging consultations with the movement before bringing the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>However, for that reason and because of the movement's success, we should consciously do everything to meet its concerns. These concerns have been raised by people who worked within the movement and steered it through a successful period. For that reason we should respect their concerns. It is not enough to compliment them for what they did in the past.  If they have serious concerns about some areas of the Bill, they deserve a good hearing from us.  My local credit union in Cahir was most concerned about the proposed limit on shares, deposits and loans.  The Minister was generous in the consultation process and I am sure he will be open to reasonable amendments relating to the concerns of the credit union movement. These are the people with success behind them. They know the needs of the credit unions and have the necessary experience.  We should heed their concerns.</P>
    <P>They are also concerned with other aspects of the Bill.  While limits on shares, deposits and loans are under consideration, we should ensure credit unions do not become banks.  They must remain as they are while operating within the realities of the current economic situation.  We must take the escalation of cost factor into account.  It is pointless to cap their loan capacity at limits which do not reflect reality.</P>
    <P>If the congratulations and compliments expressed in this House were enough, the credit unions should continue to prosper into the next century.  However, their success depends on the manner in which we legislate a framework within which they must operate.  Their success depends on this Bill meeting their needs.  I know the Minister of State will be conscious of the concerns raised by many Members regarding only a few sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the credit union progressing from strength to strength following the implementation of this legislation.  I also took forward to their concerns being heard and to the introduction of amendments which will take cognisance of the need to serve the customer at all times and maintain the ethos of this great movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The purposes of the Bill, set out in the explanatory memorandum, are receiving widespread support.  These include an attempt to consolidate existing credit union legislation, to provide an updated framework for the development and regulation of the movement and to safeguard community self help principles to which the movement is dedicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the development of a range of services which credit unions may offer to their members.  In addition, the role of the <Col N="963" /> registrar of friendly societies is to be substantially expanded.  There is a welcome across party lines and within the credit union movement for the approach undertaken by the Minister of State.  It is a large undertaking and it is perhaps surprising that it is being done with such a level of public and political support.</P>
    <P>The Bill arose in response to requests by credit unions to update their role and the legislation under which they act.  They have actively and effectively lobbied politicians.  We have been reminded of their role and many members of the unions have extolled the virtues of the movement. Not being a member of a credit union, I am not in a position to do this, but I have learnt more about their role.</P>
    <P>As an element in the credit facilities market, the credit union movement is unusual in that it enjoys a strong level of public support.  Many of us are forced, often too often, to do business with banks.  While we may pretend on the occasions when we engage them in business that we appreciate their services, most people would not extol the virtues of the banking system in private. I do not know whether this is because the banks usually announce huge profits on a bi-annual basis, or because many of those working for them consider themselves poorly paid.  Perhaps it is nothing more than begrudgary.  However, I suspect it is more than that and that many feel excluded from the general banking, and even building society system.  Given this, it would be a great pity if, arising from this legislation or other factors, the credit union movement was to be put in a similar situation to the banks, especially as they have traditionally played a constructive role, which we are seeking to continue, improve and expand.  It would be a pity if the legislation undermines the reputation they have acquired and their extraordinary high standing in the community.</P>
    <P>Given the size of the Bill it is very difficult for legislators to come to an informed opinion on it. I am indebted to the movement for assessing it in the context of its experience.  Presumably parliamentary draftsmen and others have acted similarly. The scale of the Bill draws attention to the huge workload which falls on Deputies.  Given the scale of constituency business it is hardly practical to expect them to consider a Bill of this size, even though it is very important legislation.</P>
    <P>It appears that the league of credit unions is in favour of the legislation, with some caveats. There is a fear that some provisions would attack the voluntary ethos of the movement.  This ethos is extremely important.  In many respects it is the bedrock of its success.</P>
    <P>The raising of the ethos argument in any area worries me because it sometimes leads to extremes of emotions and expression which do not reflect reality.  However, the credit union movement has been driven by the effort of individuals who have been prepared to give of their time and talents voluntarily.  It would be a pity if they formed the view that the regulatory provisions <Col N="964" /> appear to be heavy handed.  A recent editorial in the magazine of the league of credit unions pointed out that it could be construed as an attack on the self help ethos of the movement. This would be a pity and perhaps it could be addressed by amendment.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately in recent time, the Oireachtas and the Government appears to attack the self help ethos in rural Ireland, for example with regard to group water schemes and certain aspects of the Education Bill.  I know it is not intended that this would happen in this legislation, yet some of those with an excellent record of involvement in this area appear to believe this could be the case.  They point to their excellent record over 35 years in self regulation in co-operation with the registrar.  A number of speakers, including some on the Government side, said that if something is not broken there is no need to fix it.  They get much the same message I get from people prepared to play a part in developing their communities.</P>
    <P>The delay in bringing forward the legislation was seen as a failure of the establishment and the Government was seen to be controlled by the credit unions' competitors.  The size of this complicated comprehensive legislation has allayed those fears somewhat although some of the provisions appear to have reactivated suspicions.  I thought the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, would have been above suspicion.  I do not know which of the partners in Government is open to influence from certain quarters particularly in the capping of loans.</P>
    <P>The limit on property holdings has come under attack and is raising hackles.  On a first reading, the Bill seems to outlaw certain joint ventures or local development initiatives in which the credit union might be involved in providing equity, buildings or whatever.  There is a fear that activities of this nature which have already been undertaken may become illegal if the Bill, as drafted, is passed.  As the credit union is part of the local community and depends on it for funds it is important that such a self-help philosophy would not be outlawed but encouraged.</P>
    <P>The <i>raison d'être</i> or the background to the limit on property holdings is not entirely clear.  I presume there is fear that a credit union might be manipulated in such a way as to get involved in property speculation.  If that is a genuine fear it could be addressed firmly in a better way than in this Bill.</P>
    <P>On the £20,000 cap on loans, the Minister believes the social and mutual character of credit unions is helped by the limit.  His view is that the average worker or member of a credit union is unlikely to need a loan of £20,000.  There are many people in need of a loan of £20,000 who may not be in a position to take it up or repay it. It has been pointed out that a person who received a redundancy payment might be in a position to make a substantial amount of money available to a credit union or that a person in a position to start a new business may need more <Col N="965" /> than £20,000.  In one of his replies to the credit unions the Minister said he wants to exclude the credit union movement from the house purchase area, the area in which the building societies deal mainly.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the need for house extension or refurbishment, for which the £20,000 limit is not sufficient.  Some people say there should be no limit but the Minister has made a good case for it; it needs to be debated on Committee Stage.  The Minister fears that a small credit union could be dominated by very large shareholders in the absence of a cap and they could use the credit union as a mechanism to avoid taxation.  Either of those points could be dealt with in a slightly different way.  He could have threatened them with the big bad wolf of the Department of Finance and no doubt he would have succeeded.  This area needs to be dealt with in a different way from that proposed in the Bill.  The Minister seems to say any large-scale competition with the building societies would damage the ethos of the credit unions.  Perhaps there is a case for saying that, but I am not convinced.  I would not be upset if the credit unions were in a position to compete at a certain level with some of them.  I do not see it as damaging their ethos but as expanding and developing their role within the societies they serve.  The Minister cleared up the confusion in relation to the £20,000 loan.  The intention is that it is an indebtedness cap and cannot be in addition to the amounts held in shares or savings.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty about the regulatory mechanism. I agree with the Minister that the mechanism needs to be rigorous and tight.  I am not convinced it is properly provided for in the Bill. Some of the suggested amendments may go some way towards redressing the balance, particularly in acknowledging the excellent record of the movement during the past 35 years.  More than anything else this is what the people who have served in credit unions would want the legislation to do.  It is a fair point and one that can be accommodated.</P>
    <P>A criticism of the Bill is that it is too similar to the Building Societies Act.  Those who drafted the legislation were probably not all that familiar with the ethos and the workings of the credit union movement.  Credit unions are individual companies &mdash; some small, some large &mdash; but are not part of a national or international network. In that sense they are different and are locally based.  There are some 434 units in the country. When dealing with that number of separate institutions an effective regulatory mechanism is needed and no one, including the credit union, says otherwise.  What the credit union is saying is that for years it had an effective mechanism, in co-operation with the registrar, and that what is proposed is draconian and may be damaging in the long-term.  We ought to take that on board.</P>
    <P>This Bill attempts to cater equally for the needs of small and large credit unions.  The Minister said some of the small credit unions may not have <Col N="966" /> reached the standard of professionalism that is desirable.  Perhaps that is so and, if so, it is a good reason for stringent mechanisms of regulation and control.  However, it fails to adequately acknowledge the work being done by these people in communities, the effect of which is seen on the ground where the money has been earned and saved.  Credit unions have excellent effect in terms of developing the community by catering for minor and larger scale matters.  The role of the registrar can be effective without being intrusive.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have managed to be more customer friendly and customer accessible than the large professional institutions.  This is extraordinary because those running the credit unions do so voluntarily.  The large banks and institutions have massive resources at their disposal and a huge level of control.  That more than anything else points to the fact that banks see themselves as in control of customers while credit unions present themselves as being available for customers and their benefit.  The difference between the two is in favour of credit unions.</P>
    <P>An element which has not been mentioned much is the role of credit unions in combating poverty and in certain areas in combating the curse of money lending and moneylenders who operate illegally and are difficult to detect for a plethora of social and other reasons.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the role of credit unions in parts of County Clare in enabling people, who had previously been in the grip of moneylenders, conduct their business with the credit union above board and in a manner which took their personal circumstances into account.  The Bill should have provided for increased co-operation between credit unions and Departments in this area which is of major importance but which State agencies have difficulties in dealing with directly.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would consider constructive points put forward by credit unions and Members of the Oireachtas.  I commend him on this but he must do more than listen, he must accept amendments proposed by the credit union movement and Members.  I ask him, in a spirit of co-operation, to include some of the changes proposed by us in amendments tabled by him. This complicated Bill reflects the needs of the credit union movement and allows it to continue to develop and play a constructive role in society.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McGinley.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to pay tribute to the credit union movement for its work over the years.  It is time to update the legislation governing credit unions to bring them into the next millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The credit union movement has served the country very well.  While it is regarded as an urban based organisation it has been extended to rural areas in recent years.  Credit unions are to urban areas what the ACC is to rural areas.  The friendly approach adopted by credit unions has attracted many investors.  Credit unions were set <Col N="967" /> up to provide finance to people in need.  While many moneylenders were reasonable, some of them had a stranglehold on families, used threats to get their money and charged inflated interest rates.  Credit unions helped many households to organise their finances by encouraging them to save money and borrow sensibly.  People mainly borrowed from credit unions for weddings, christenings and emergencies.  As Deputy Theresa Ahearn rightly said, credit unions made themselves available to the public by opening their offices from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.</P>
    <P>The extension of the credit union movement to rural areas has enabled many farmers to invest their money with it.  Credit unions give their investors important advice and play an important role in their local areas.  In this context, the cap of £20,000 on the amount which can be borrowed will restrict the development of credit unions in urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>In the past the main investors in credit unions came from the lower income group but people in the middle and higher income groups now invest their money with them.  I do not want credit unions to compete with building societies in the provision of mortgages but people will not be able to fully refurbish their house etc. with a loan of £20,000.  Given that it is more than 30 years since we reviewed the legislation governing credit unions &mdash; it may be another 30 years before we review this Bill &mdash; a figure of £40,000 would be more realistic.  It is important to remember that credit unions advise investors on the amount they should borrow and do not give out loans willy-nilly.</P>
    <P>The banking institutions have treated their customers reasonably well.  I do not wish to point the finger at any institution but the personnel in some institutions are not as friendly as the personnel in the ACC.  Maybe the ACC has been able to develop this friendly approach because it is a voluntary organisation and does not have the same pressure as large banking institutions to make profits for its shareholders.  The large profits of banking institutions have obviously been made at the expense of customers.  While credit unions must be profitable, they do not have the same obligation to make extensive profit.  It is therefore easier for them to conduct and control their business.</P>
    <P>Farmers who wish to replace their tractors or buy cattle wish to invest in their farms, but £20,000 will not go far in this respect.  I do not understand why there has to be a cap of £20,000 on the amount which can be borrowed when people can invest up to £40,000 with the credit union.  People who have savings of £40,000 should be able to borrow £40,000.  However, this should not be the yardstick used to grant loans in all cases.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to restrict the term of office of directors to three years.  The people involved in credit unions do excellent work.  In this context I pay tribute to John O'Hara from Ballyconnell, <Col N="968" /> Michael Reilly from Redhills and the many other people in my constituency who are deeply committed to their work and have devoted much time and effort to it.  I have been told that the term of three years has been proposed to enable a director to be transferred to a new branch in another town.  That man will only have got to know his customers when he will have to move on.  It is good there is an option to remove an unsuitable person after three years.  However, a person doing a good job would need at least seven years to get the credit union properly established and to get to know the customers.</P>
    <P>Bank managers are only getting to know their customers when they are moved, which is a failure in the banking system.  Perhaps there is a notion that bank managers might get too friendly with their customers.  However, a good bank manager who is well established in his community will attract business.  Similarly, if the director of a credit union is given a period of time to establish himself, build up confidence and get to know the people he will give a better service and attract business.  The Minister of State should extend the period of the directorship.</P>
    <P>The cap on loans should be increased to £40,000, given that credit unions might not be legislated for again for quite a number of years. There is broad agreement that the cap of £20,000 restricts the ability of credit unions to do a proper job.  Increasing the cap will not impinge on the banks or building societies.  If those institutions feel threatened by that, their ground must be very weak and they should examine how their businesses are set up and operate.  Large institutions should not feel under threat if a voluntary organisation is in a position to make loans of £40,000 as they lend businesses hundreds of thousands of pounds.</P>
    <P>I compliment credit unions, in which I have every confidence.  They have done a marvellous job.  They have looked after many families and removed them from the clutches of loan sharks. They are now moving into the new millennium as lending and saving agencies which can sustain their achievements.  I wish to share my time with Deputy McGinley.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm deis a fháil labhairt ar an Bhille seo, Bille na gComharchreidmheasa. Cosúil le gach cainteoir a labhair go dtí seo, fáiltím roimhe: is fada muid ag fanacht le Bille mar seo le blianta fada agus tá creidiúint ag dul don Rialtas agus don Aire Stáit Rabbitte a thug an Bille seo isteach i ndiaidh an oiread sin blianta.  Tá an-obair á déanamh ag na comharchreidmheasa ar fud na tíre: gluaiseacht í a chuaigh i bhfeidhm go mór ar phobal na hÉireann; is beag paróiste in Éirinn nach bhfuil craobh den chomharchreidmheasa ann anois.  Is é an taithí atá agam féin ar chomharchreidmheasa ná an ceann i mo pharóiste féin, Comharchreidmheasa Ghaoth Dóbhair, atá bunaithe le 25 bliain.  Is dóigh gur ceann neamhghnáthach é mar go ndéanann siad a gcuid oibre go léir agus go bhfoilsítear a gcuid <Col N="969" /> tuairiscí trí mheán na Gaeilge.  Feicim an tAire Stáit sa Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta ag croitheadh a cheann agus tá súil agam go bhfuil sé ag éisteacht leis sin.  Sílim go bhfuil ceann eile i gConamara anois ach is cinnte gurb é Comharchreidmheasa Ghaoth Dóbhair an t-aon chomharchreidmheasa in Éirinn a rinne a chuid oibre go léir trí Ghaeilge ó bunaíodh é 25 bliain ó shin.</P>
      <P>Bhí mé féin i mo Runaí ar an gComharchreidmheasa ar feadh dhá bhliain nuair a bunaíodh é agus an fear atá ina Chathaoirleach i láthair na huaire ná Pádraig Ó Dochartaigh, a rinne an-obair air agus a thug isteach sa pharóiste é.  Tá sé anois ina bhall ar Údarás na Gaeltachta agus go leor déanta aige ar son phobal na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Timpeall 20 bliain ó shin thóg an Comharchreidmheasa seo oifigí a chosain a lán airgid ag an am ach tá sé tar éis éirí chomh mór sin agus tá an oiread sin ball ann &mdash; sílim go bhfuil cúpla míle ball ann anois &mdash; go bhfuil siad ag tógáil óifigí níos mó agus níos nua-aimseartha i láthair na huaire.  Taispeánann sé sin an dul chun cinn atá déanta acu.</P>
      <P>Aontaím lena dúradh faoi na comharchreidmheasa le cúpla lá anseo.  Cuireann siad seirbhís an-mhaith ar fáil do dhaoine a mbíonn iasachtaí beaga ag teastáil uathu nó a mbíonn ag cur airgead beag i dtaisce.  Daoine nach bhféadfadh dul go dtí go dtí na bancanna nó chuig na tairgintí iasachta eile, bhí siad ábalta dul isteach go dtí an chomharchreidmheas agus airgead a fháil don teaghlach fá choinne gnáthimeachtaí an tsaoil: an Nollaig, an Chéad Chomaoineach, gluaisteán úr. Bhí na comharchreidmheasa ag déanamh freastail ar an bpáirt sin den phobal nach raibh na bancanna ag déanamh freastail air.</P>
      <P>Tá cúpla moladh agam.  Luaigh Teachtaí eile an uasteora atá le hiasachtaí: tá sé £20,000 sa Bhille agus is dóigh le gach duine gur chóir go mbeadh sé níos airde ná sin.  Tá a fhois agam go bhfuil an tAire ag machnamh ar an moladh sin agus go dtiocfaidh sé ar réiteach a bheidh sásúil don Credit Union League.</P>
      <P>Bhí cruinniú speisialta cúpla seachtain ó shin ag Comharchreidmheasa Éireann i Luimneach agus bhí Teachtaí ó gach páirt den tír ansin.  Rinneadh plé an-fhada ar an Bhille seo ag an gcomhdháil sin agus bhí an tAire Stáit ann ar feadh an deireadh seachtaine.  Chuala sé na moltaí agus na gearáin agus tá mé cinnte nuair a bheidh leasuithe á gcur síos ag Céim an Choiste den Bhille seo go mbeidh an tAire ag cur síos leasuithe ón méid a dúradh leis i Luimneach.</P>
      <P>Tá sé sa Bhille nár chóir go mbeadh gábhaltais ag comharchreidmheasa.  Is dóigh go bhfuil fáth an-mhaith leis sin agus i gcás comharchreidmheasa Ghaoth Dóbhair atá ag fágáil oifig amháin agus ag dul isteach in oifig eile, cad a dhéanfaidh siad leis an oifig a fhágfaidh siad? Níor chóir go mbeadh riail daingean ann.  Nílim ag iarraidh go mbeadh na comharchreidmheasa ina dtiarnaí talúin ach ba chóir go mbeadh an riail sin solúbtha.</P>

      <P>I have listened to much of the debate and I do not intend to go over the arguments put forward by previous speakers.  This is one of the best produced Bills as far as briefing is concerned.  The credit unions lobbied every Deputy in the House and the question of the £20,000 cap was raised time and again.  They also met the Minister of State who made it clear he is prepared to listen to their concerns and implement changes.</P>
      <P>Credit unions have done tremendous work over the past 40 years.  I was fascinated to hear that their assets currently amount to £2 billion and it is a major responsibility to deal with such amounts.  Lest anyone think I have no interest in the work and welfare of credit unions, I join other speakers who paid tribute to the people who work in credit unions on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on introucing the Bill and wish the credit unions well in future.  I acknowledge amendments will be tabled on Committee Stage, particularly in regard to the capping which appears to be a major problem for credit unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  It is difficult to say anything novel at this stage with all that has been said previously. For the first time in 30 years, all the legislation affecting credit unions has been brought together, and the Minister of State is to be congratulated in that regard.  In general credit unions are happy with the Bill but some areas require further attention and modification.</P>
      <P>Credit unions play a major role in the social and economic activity of the country.  They are especially suitable for the small investor but some modification of the restrictions on loans, deposits, etc., is necessary.</P>
      <P>Credit unions are not banks or building societies. They are operated on a voluntary basis by people who do not seek remuneration.  People who do voluntary work do not like many constraints imposed on them in regard to their activities. We all accept a certain amount of regulation is necessary, but it must be flexible and suit the agenda.  We do not object to the Registrar of Friendly Societies operating in this area as long as it is not too intrusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credit unions wish to develop and provide a better service to their customers.  They want to <Col N="971" /> get involved in the insurance business as well as providing foreign exchange, ATM and other facilities.  They have done a good job to date in serving local communities.  They have assisted the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Department of Social Welfare in dealing with the problem of loan sharks operating in deprived areas. They have ploughed money back into local endeavours by small entrepreneurs and have assisted in areas in which the banks and building societies would not be readily involved.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Minister of State responsible for development in the west is in the Chamber because the credit unions have a special role to play in developing small rural areas.  They have a great deal of money on deposit and it could be used for further development in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Credit unions currently employ many people on a full-time basis in their offices throughout the country.  They provide an excellent service and open on Saturdays, which is appreciated.  Credit unions are exempt from corporation tax and the DIRT does not apply to most depositors whose savings are in the region of £1,000.  There is no threat to the credit unions in relation to money laundering or from loan sharks abusing their services.</P>
    <P>The track record of credit unions is good.  Their service to the community is recognised by everyone. Their intention to expand should be facilitated by more flexible legislation than that before the House.  The main complaints about the Bill concern the limits on deposits, which has been referred to by almost every speaker.</P>
    <P>The criteria currently applied to credit unions are too restrictive.  The cap of £20,000 is very restrictive, and anyone involved in farming will know that £20,000 does not go very far.  Some Deputies referred to extensions to houses and other expenses that arise, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The regulatory regime now proposed for credit unions is regarded as excessive and an intrusion into the affairs of a voluntary body.  It will cause enormous problems, particularly in regard to the implementation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of credit unions owning property was also raised.  I am aware the Minister of State proffered some responses in that regard but the whole area is a bit vague.  If a credit union owns a large property in which it runs its business, it should be allowed to lease part of that property to earn additional revenue.</P>
    <P>The proposed system of approval for new and existing services will be difficult to implement and is unrealistic in some cases.  I ask the Minister of State to re-examine that area of the Bill with a view to amending it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Having highlighted some areas of concern I acknowledge the good work done in drafting the Bill.  I am aware the Minister of State may take on board some of the concerns I have outlined. Having waited 30 years to consolidate all the <Col N="972" /> existing legislation affecting credit unions, it is unfortunate that there is difficulty with areas of the Bill.  Some of its recommendations will be difficult to implement, particularly if they restrict the further development of credit unions which want to provide a service more suitable to the new millennium and respond to the challenges of a modern society.  It would be unfortunate also if totally different criteria applied to credit unions in the South compared to those pertaining in Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom and on the Continent.  We must legislate for the likely economic social milieu that will pertain in the not too distant future.  Flexibility and criteria that are easily modified should, therefore, be the order of the day.  The Minister did a good job in bringing forward this legislation, but as has been outlined, a number of areas need further consideration, particularly the proposed capping and intrusion into running a voluntary society.  I hope those matters will be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a few brief comments on this important legislation. There are few Bills which excite the interest of Members across the board, as this one did, and that is recognition of the important role the credit union movement has played throughout the country, in urban and rural areas.  It is important to note the legislation under which credit unions have been forced to operate, the 1966 legislation and, prior to that &mdash; the credit union movement predated that legislation &mdash; the Industrial and Provident Society Acts, 1893 and 1913. While a great amount of time elapsed between the 1966 Act and the previous legislation, so much has happened since 1966, particularly in the past ten or 15 years in the area of financial services, that the legislation is long overdue.</P>
      <P>This is complex legislation.  In recent years, because of the inadequate statutory legislative framework, credit unions have been forced to operate outside the provisions of the 1966 legislation. It is important that the activities of an organisation that is so deep-rooted in local communities are regularised and brought within the provisions of statute.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker, Deputy Moffatt, said it is difficult at this late stage of the debate to make new points, but I wish to refer to Nora Herlihy from my constituency, a teacher by profession, who is recognised as one of the founding figures of the credit union movement.  The ethos of the credit union movement today is not much different from that which motivated Nora Herlihy from Ballydesmond, County Cork, to establish one of the first credit unions, and the movement is still managed and operated by persons of similar background and motivation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Lower Mount Street there is a major development, the building of new headquarters for the Irish League of Credit Unions.  Credit union offices exist in practically every large urban area and many smaller rural areas.  In recent years in my constituency, the Macroom Credit Union <Col N="973" /> renovated its property and a new headquarters is nearing completion.  Kanturk Credit Union opened a fine new office where late last year I and other public representatives met members of all credit unions in the constituency.  Because of the increasing interest in the service they offer, other credit unions in the constituency are in the process of acquiring new premises, and the same applies throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have been referred to, in a complimentary fashion, as the poor man's bank or the bank for the ordinary man in the street, but that is an out-dated description.  Credit unions provide financial services the value of which is recognised by people from all social and economic backgrounds, and that is a tribute to the people working in the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>It is important that the activities of the credit union movement are regularised and that, as we move into the new millennium, the necessary legislative framework is put in place to enable it to continue to develop and expand.  The main purpose of the Bill is to put in place the framework under which credit unions will provide financial services.  There has been criticism of excessive regulation, but it is important to consider the proposed regulations.  Only recently a major financial institution, Taylor Asset Managers Limited, collapsed.  On the international scene, there is uproar in Albania because of the collapse of a financial savings institution not under the auspices of the credit union movement. Those examples highlight the importance of adequate supervision and protection of investors' interests in organisations such as credit unions which are community based and motivated not by profit but by service to the community.  While I have certain grievances with the detail of the regulations, because of what happened in the not too distant past, we should not balk at the idea of additional regulation.</P>
    <P>Many Members dwelt on the fact that the credit union movement operates extensively throughout the country &mdash; there are more than 500 credit unions on the island, of which 427 are in the Republic, there are one and a half million members, with approximately £2 billion on deposit.  Those statistics highlight the broad community support for credit unions and are recognition of the service they provide.</P>
    <P>I have a reservation about the legislation, and I understand the Minister's difficulty in this regard. There is a danger that in our endeavours to meet the needs of leading credit unions, we will throw the baby out with the bath water.  We may fail to recognise that some credit unions are not as advanced as others in terms of the services they provide.  We are all familiar with the top 100 or, as the Irish League of Credit Unions stated in its briefing document, 81 credit unions which, to a large extent, motivated this legislation, but I am concerned about the smaller credit unions, the branches that open perhaps one evening per week and provide important services to their communities.  I fear that facilitating the demands <Col N="974" /> of the top 80 or 100 credit unions may be to the detriment of the smaller credit unions.</P>
    <P>The Minister must endeavour to accommodate those top 100 credit unions while not adversely affecting smaller ones.  Deputy Ring used credit unions as a stick with which to beat the banks.  All of us take pleasure in beating the banks with as big a stick as possible from time to time, but if we overly compensate the top 100 credit unions, that dreaded term &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo;&mdash; which has become the byword for closures and job loses in other areas of activity &mdash; may come into play for some of our smaller credit unions.  A small credit union in a rural area cannot provide services, such as insurance and ATM machines, provided by those in large urban areas.  The community base of many small credit unions could be eroded because members will vote with their feet and join a larger credit union in their area.  The Minister has a difficult decision to make in this regard. Do large credit unions envisage an increase or a decrease in the number of credit unions as a result of this legislation?</P>
    <P>While I support the Bill in general, I have reservations about its regulatory procedures and the capping on loans, shares and deposits.  It is important that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water.  While we should protect the ethos of the credit union movement and allow it take advantage of new technologies, services and so on, this should not have a detrimental effect on small credit unions.  I would be interested to hear the views of the Minister and the Irish League of Credit Unions on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions has circulated extensive documentation to Members of the House in which it emphasises that credit unions range in size from institutions with £500,000 on deposit to institutions with £55 million on deposit. Therein lies the dilemma for the Minister.  It is difficult to frame legislation that will cover a credit union with £500,000 on deposit and one with £55 million on deposit which will not disadvantage either.</P>
    <P>I share the views of Members who spoke at length about the advantages offered by credit unions over the conventional banking system.  For many people a visit to the bank manager is an intimidating experience, but the credit union movement has to a large extent, removed that element of fear and restored people's dignity when dealing with financial institutions.  The movement should not seek to imitate the services offered by banks and building societies.  A credit committee report of a credit union with which I am familiar outlines the range of loan facilities offered by credit unions.  They include housing, house improvements, furniture and fittings, motor purchase and repairs, car insurance and tax, education, consolidation of debts, house and health insurance, weddings, funerals, communions, agriculture, medical expenses, travel and leisure and Christmas and business loans. <Col N="975" /> That covers practically the entire range of human activity.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment should note that more than 20 per cent of loans given out in that credit union are to small businesses. As chairman of the Joint Committee on Small Business and Services, I know that one of the major problems facing business today is access to finance at terms suitable to one's business development.  Many businesses now recognise that credit unions offer loans at competitive interest rates.  In a tripartite effort involving the banks, the State and the EU, the Government has made a strenuous effort to make finance available at subsidised rates to small business.  It is interesting that many businesses are voting with their feet and get their business loans from credit unions.  This is particularly relevant in the context of capping the amount of loans under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions, the umbrella organisation that has overseen the development of the credit union movement since its infancy, should get special mention in the debate.  I am pleased the Minister of State acknowledged its contribution by stating &ldquo;the league is the representative body which has guided and overseen the development of the credit union movement since its foundation... with diligence and integrity&rdquo;.  The development of the credit union movement is a tribute to its foresight and it should have been involved in the consultative process for this legislation.</P>
    <P>My main concern with the legislation relates to its regulatory provisions.  Over the past 40 years, since the foundation of the credit union movement, not one shareholder, depositor or member of a credit union has lost money.  I am sure the same cannot be said of other financial institutions. That is a tribute to the self regulatory mechanisms that have been the hallmark of the operation of individual credit unions on a daily basis.  Many people, not least Deputy Killeen, have quoted the maxim, &ldquo;if it ain't broke don't fix it&rdquo;.  This is sound advice in regard to credit unions.  A fairly comprehensive system of checks and balances and audits takes place in each credit union and the savings protection scheme is policed by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  Therefore, while acknowledging what has been achieved on a voluntary basis with the benefit of self-regulation, we must introduce a system that will put the Registrar of Friendly Societies at the apex of the controlling regime.  It is important to recognise what has been achieved.  There are other reasons why the self-regulatory regime should be incorporated into any new system.</P>
    <P>The limits on savings and loans are giving rise to concern.  The 1966 legislation had a £6,000 limit on shares and there is a limit of £20,000 proposed in the current Bill.  A limit of £30,000 is being sought and it should be possible for the Minister of State to reach an agreement through compromise with the Irish League of Credit Unions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> I fail to see why we are proposing very strict limits on deposits.  Those limits were not in the 1966 legislation.  Why is it necessary to introduce them?  It would be understandable if the aim was to avoid money laundering or tax evasion but I am informed that the present legislation is adequate to deal with those fears.</P>
    <P>Another matter that will hinder the capacity of credit unions to attract finance from their natural hinterland is the limit being placed on loans. Rather than putting a monetary cap on these loans, we should apply a percentage of total assets in each credit union.  That criterion should be the driving force.  I also have reservations about the restrictions on owning property as I do not favour credit unions being involved in land speculation.  However, some credit unions have embarked on very innovative community-driven projects.  A credit union in my constituency is considering such a venture and it would pay strong dividends to the local community.  The venture would be on a non-profit basis for that credit union.  This legislation should not close the door on credit union participation in such projects, especially when the credit union is community-based and there would be a significant benefit to that community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue and there is great credit due to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for his exhaustive efforts to accommodate the frequently conflicting views expressed to him by various interest groups.  I also welcome the Minister of State's openmindedness on accepting amendments.</P>
    <P>It is essential we preserve the ethos of the credit union.  Nobody wants to see the banks, building societies and credit unions lumped together. It is therefore essential that, as we try to accommodate the fast-track credit unions, the smaller ones should not suffer or disappear.  It should be possible to find a balance between those interests and the Minister of State will find that compromise.</P>

      <P>We are on the crest of a wave at the moment and good things may be around the corner.  The credit unions have not had to wait for this Bill as long as Kildare have had to wait for the Sam Maguire, but perhaps both will now happen in the same year.</P>
      <P>Credit unions became very disillusioned with successive Governments as this legislation was promised for several years.  The credit unions expressed their concerns about this to politicians and I am delighted the Bill has now been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although they too were delighted to see the Bill, credit union members are concerned at some of its provisions.  The Minister of State went to a <Col N="977" /> credit union meeting recently in Limerick to allay some of their fears.  He used the trick of warming them up with some stories before talking about the Bill.  They were still unhappy with some of the restrictions the Bill will impose on them.  The Minister of State in his speech said he was open to contributions.  In general, when Minister of all parties bring Bills to the House they tend to view that as the end of the matter and are reluctant to accept Opposition amendments.  I therefore hope the Minister of State is as good as his word and that common sense prevails.</P>
    <P>This is a very complicated Bill.  It is the first consolidated legislation for credit unions and when passed it will have serious implications for their future.  I intend not to politicise the debate but to be honest about the Bill.  It introduces some very welcome changes.  It allows people under 16 years of age to join credit unions.  That is very important, because materialism has taken over Ireland and the world.  The old system of children saving in a piggy bank seems to be gone.  Now, when the occasion demands, parents must provide the necessary funds.  Encouraging young people to save is great training.  If we start them properly it can prevent problems later.  I welcome that provision as it shows common sense and realism.</P>
    <P>The provision for more flexibility on withdrawing shares and deposits is also to be welcomed. The credit unions looked for this and are quite happy with the flexibility in that regard.  The decision to allow loans to be repaid over a longer period is to the advantage of the credit union and the customer.  It is a sensible approach.  The Bill allows the credit union to provide additional services, which is also welcome.  Credit unions have shown great initiative over the years and this provision will be used to maximum effect.</P>
    <P>Due to the diversity of the credit union movement, a legislative framework that would both accommodate such diversity and provide flexibility and development potential was required. The 1996 Bill does not achieve this.  Many people complimented the credit unions for their tremendous work over the years.  However, most people hoped this would be enabling legislation and allow credit unions to continue their work in a much more competitive financial arena.  There was an opportunity to facilitate the development of the movement in the next century but we missed it.  If anything, this Bill will set the movement back rather than bring it forward.  The legislation is geared at small and medium sized credit unions with limited growth potential and this is regrettable. A number of credit unions have shown enormous initiative and have proved to be most successful.  The Bill will restrict their capacity to continue in the manner in which they worked previously.</P>
    <P>The achievements of the movement and its volunteers have received little or no recognition for four decades.  It provides an essential economic, social and community service and that cannot be over-emphasised.  It has assisted many families in <Col N="978" /> circumstances where no other financial institution was prepared to meet their needs.  We hoped the Bill would allow the credit union movement not just to survive in the market place but to compete. There have been many changes in the financial world and many different services are now available. More flexibility for credit unions is required to allow them compete.  I hope the Minister will take this point on board.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers paid tribute to the voluntary service provided by so many people to the credit union movement.  The solid principles of mutuality, self-help and equality have been discarded in favour of an overall inclusive approach which interferes with the economic policy decision mechanism in addition to the already excessive supervisory and regulatory powers.  The directors of the board will become quasi watchdogs and will be subject to heavy fines or possible imprisonment depending on the seriousness of a problem.  Many directors are not aware of this aspect.  They became involved in credit unions to contribute something to the community and they do good work.  However, they are now in a vulnerable position and it is possible this measure will be an obstacle to attracting good people to become involved in credit unions in the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill will impose restrictions on credit unions.  It provides for an increase in the limit on shares from £6,000 to £20,000 and the introduction of a new cap of £20,000 on deposits and loans.  However, in 1997, these figures are not sufficient. The Minister and other Deputies said they do not want credit unions to become involved in mortgage lending but I do not understand why they should not be involved in that area.  One can be sure that most of the people who drew up the legislation have bank accounts but few of them have dealings with credit unions.  However, the only financial institution many people will deal with are credit unions.  They are more comfortable with credit unions because they have established a relationship with them over the years and feel their applications will be given the serious consideration they deserve.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed said people fear meeting bank managers whom they perceive as powerful people behind desks making decisions.  Even major business people feel uncomfortable about dealing with banks.  However, the same cannot be said of credit unions.  This is not a criticism of banks, which exist to make money.  If I had shares in a bank, I would be happy with the way they do their job.  However, credit unions are a different kettle of fish and they must be considered in that light.</P>
    <P>There have been major changes in recent years in work practices.  Temporary and contract workers find it difficult to secure funds from financial institutions because of their insecure employment.  However, credit unions have always looked favourably on them and treated them as they treat other clients.  The £20,000 cap is much too low and it should be increased, perhaps to £50,000.  I do not understand why credit unions <Col N="979" /> should not be allowed to provide mortgages. They provide a tremendous service and it is important they are not restricted.</P>
    <P>In the past year a number of Ministers said they hoped the legislation would allow small businesses to secure funds from credit unions but the ceiling of £20,000 will limit the scope in that area. It depends on the type of business but £20,000 is a small figure.  If we are serious about helping small businesses, a step could be taken which would reap major rewards.  Small businesses, particularly in the early stages, have great difficulty securing capital and this is one way much needed funds could be provided.  I hope the Minister will consider this aspect and perhaps increase the levels.</P>
    <P>The Bill is over regulatory.  Credit unions have in the main operated self regulation for the past 40 years and we must accept it has worked exceptionally well.  Many of the regulatory sections have been taken from the legislation relating to building societies and applied to credit unions. This is not right because they are two very different organisations.  Credit unions are generally small, locally based organisations as distinct from large building societies and they should be treated differently.  In specific areas the Bill does not go far enough and I hope the necessary changes will be made.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the credit unions for the work they have done.  At a time when the urban-rural divide is the subject of much debate, the credit unions when it comes to being community-minded have never been found wanting and have always come up trumps.  Their decision to support the Community Games, possibly our greatest sporting success story, was an excellent one.  The games epitomise what they are all about.</P>
    <P>There are a number of credit unions in County Kildare.  Newbridge Credit Union which moved to new office premises last year, a building of which any major bank would be proud, has been a tremendous success and has grown enormously in recent years.  It is being run extremely well by the paid officials with the assistance of members who give of their time voluntarily.  In general, the credit unions are community-minded and support many ventures that other organisations would be reluctant to support.</P>
    <P>In an interview in the <i>Credit Union Review</i> the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, asked what average member of a credit union needs to borrow more than £20,000 or has more than £20,000 to deposit in the normal course of life.  Because of changes in work practices thousands of workers throughout the country have been offered redundancy packages.  Members of the Defence Forces can avail of an early retirement scheme.  Sizeable amounts of money are involved.  It is at times like these that people need the best of advice.  The credit unions should be allowed to provide such a service.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward the Bill and hope he will take into account the views which have been expressed.  There is <Col N="980" /> general consensus that the caps he proposes to impose are too restrictive.  I thank the credit unions for the service they have provided to many households throughout the country and hope they will be enabled to continue their good work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá suim mhór agam féin agus ag mo pháirtí, an Comhaontas Glas, sa Bhille seo. Tá áthas orm an deis a fháil ón Rialtas lathairt air.</P>
      <P>I was grateful for the opportunity to meet directors, managers and members of the credit unions in my constituency of Dublin North which encompasses Fingal.  At that meeting they called for the publication of the Bill which was long overdue and which they were awaiting with considerable patience.  I understand, however, from comments made by representatives of credit unions in my own constituency and further afield, that there is considerable concern at the way it has been framed.  It is important that the views of Members are listened to carefully as there are a great many items that need to be addressed and rectified on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In playing their role in society the credit unions have literally put their money where their mouths are.  They are prepared to co-operate to help build the community and, in doing that, help its weaker members.  Credit unions by virtue of their existence in the workplace or in the community improve the quality of life of their members because of the quality of services they offer and the fact that they belong to their members, not to a boss or a local politician.  Their services are short-term in the provision of savings-shares, deposits and loans and long-term in the accumulation of capital by a community based organisation for its use and benefit subject to the requirements of fiscal prudence.</P>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers who said it was important to encourage savings, a habit that has waned in recent years, particularly among young people.  It is important to send a message, not only to young people but to people living alone in rural areas, who are vulnerable and may be inclined to keep the few pounds they have in cash in the house, that savings in a credit union are secure and accessible and that membership of one better preserves the value of savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hears anecdotes from the staff of banks and building societies of unclaimed credit balances in private or commercial financial institutions which a deceased's next of kin may be legally entitled to inherit but which the institution in question does not make any effort to draw to the attention of the potential legatee in the absence of probate and administration procedures being in place.  One hears impressive figures quoted about the potential aggregate value of these unclaimed credit balances, but one assumes that type of thing does not happen in the credit union movement, principally because the measure outlined <Col N="981" /> in section 23 exists in practice to protect the value of the member's savings and the interests of the member's survivors.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome section 82 with its restatement of the prohibition of proxy voting. The preceding section provides for an AGM quorum of only ten.  That is a remarkable figure when one considers community credit unions with tens of thousands of members, but I suppose one would not wish to make it compulsory for members to contribute to the process by which their credit unions are governed.  However, in many cases we would prefer they did.</P>
    <P>Section 32(3) underlines the intimation throughout the Bill that civil servants, who have turned their attention to these matters in recent times, know better how to run credit unions than those who have been running them for decades in some instances.  If the section is enacted, any person who has a loan outstanding with their credit union will be proscribed for the period of that loan from using their account on a savings and withdrawal basis.  If an emergency arises and the credit union credit committee does not meet until the following Monday evening, a member will not be able to withdraw from shares the funds required to deal with it.  Where is he or she to turn other than to the local moneylender?  I met financial advisers who work closely with the Citizens' Information Centre which had its AGM in Balbriggan last night.  Those helping the people who need the advice of financial advisers told me that moneylenders are still very much a central part of our communities.  Even with the legislation in place and the Government's belief that this matter has been addressed, many moneylenders are still charging people interest on loans at the rate of 100 per cent or more.</P>
    <P>The Credit Union Bill should help to keep people away from the clutches of moneylenders. Arising from that, what provision is in the Bill to allow a member to hold more than one account, for example a home loan account on which the interest paid is subject to tax relief, a shares account against which other occasional loans can be drawn and a savings account?  Is the Minister saying to members who have a number of accounts with their credit unions that such arrangements must cease?  That point was made in the submission of the Credit Union Institute of Managers and I hope the Minister of State had time to reflect on its implications.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 35(2)(a) which is a prudent and intelligent provision and section 35(2)(b) is in like vein.  What credit union worth its salt can accept section 35(2)(c) which would restrict the maximum credit union loan to £20,000, approximately one year's salary?  That point was made by several Members and I am sure it will be hotly debated on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Surely the registrar would have sufficient information to know that most credit unions with the wherewithal to employ management and staff will have loans on their books exceeding that figure. What should those credit unions do in future? <Col N="982" /> Should they sell their loan books to the Union Bank of Switzerland or other such financial institution? Should they refer their members to the elusive third banking force?  Surely credit unions should decide with due regard to prudence in lending, what they can commit themselves to and the member's circumstances &mdash; that is the underlying thrust of the Bill &mdash; how much it can lend. The assumption in the legislation is that the Minister, the registrar and the civil servants know best. However, for the past 35 years or so credit union boards and their managers have known pretty well where to set the limit in regard to the size of a loan.  The record of credit unions speaks for itself in that people have not lost money and they have managed to survive by making balanced decisions.</P>
    <P>There is a major omission in section 36.  It is acknowledged that credit unions directly employ approximately 2,000 people in the Republic.  It is estimated that they have a direct employment potential to recruit another 2,000 to 2,500 staff, yet the Bill does not make any reference to paid staff in credit unions at management or any other level unless one considers the potential of credit union managers to be miscreants, but that is not the point I am making here.  While the indirect employment generated by credit union activities has not been estimated to my knowledge, one imagines that if the approach adopted by credit unions such as the illustrious ones in Kilkenny, Tralee, Clones, Blessington, Kilrush and Tallow are representative of the movement, the figure must be significant.</P>
    <P>I referred to the arrogant tone of the framers of the Bill.  It is exemplified in section 48(1) which states that a credit union may provide, as principal or agent, additional services of a description that appears to the registrar to be of mutual benefit to its members.  Again we see the role of the registrar usurping that of the AGM and of the credit union boards.  With due respect to the registrar, who is likely to be a senior career civil servant, there are other perspectives.  Matters sometimes look different when viewed from outside the confines of the lower Castle Yard.  The failure to acknowledge this and to show preparedness to give credit unions their head is a fundamental and indicative failure of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Is section 49(7) an attempt to legislate retrospectively and, if so, what would be the effect of its enactment on credit unions which offer services such as the payment of bills, a Christmas club and foreign exchange?  The real tension in this Bill arises from the relationship between sections 26(1) and 43.  Section 26(1) states:</P>
    <P>A credit union shall not carry on any business or activity which is not appropriate or incidental to the objects for which, in accordance with <i>section</i> 6, it is formed.</P>
    <P>The intent of section 43 appears to be to allow the Minister, presumably through his or her agent, the Registrar of Friendly Societies, power <Col N="983" /> to prescribe how a credit union may invest its surplus funds.</P>
    <P>This represents a considerable qualification of the autonomy of annual general meetings of credit unions, the implication being that in section 26 the annual general meeting proposes whereas section 43 confirms that the Civil Service disposes. Just as in the case of universities, it appears the Government would like to usurp press space to ventilate its commitment to pluralism.  Credit unions must cease to rely on their genius, their guiding light and revert to the pre-adolescent condition of being told what to do and how to behave by an excessively interfering parental State.  The crux of the dichotomy between what the State wants from its relationship with credit unions and what the credit unions want from their relationship with the State is contained in section 41(1) &mdash; carrying the side heading &ldquo;Acquisition, holding and disposal of land&rdquo;&mdash; which states:</P>
    <P>A credit union may acquire and hold in its own name any land for the purpose of conducting its business on the land (including erecting a building on the land for that purpose) but for no other purpose.</P>
    <P>This type of decision was heretofore taken at annual general meetings.  That such decisions will henceforth be taken by the Registrar of Friendly Societies is to be regretted.  While it appears the State is prepared to follow the best credit unions in broadly interpreting the phrase contained in the explanatory memorandum on section 26 &mdash;&ldquo;a credit union may do anything consistent with the objects for which it was formed&rdquo;&mdash; there is the qualification with regard to the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</P>
    <P>How will it serve the Minister's commitment to the principles of mutuality if some larger credit unions seek to escape the repressive environment heralded by this Bill by entertaining the possibility of demutualisation?  Hopefully I am wrongly misinterpreting future plans.</P>
    <P>If one's instincts in these matters are influenced not by the party politics of the right, with its ideological attachment to maximising the value to shareholders, nor by the party politics of the left, with its ideological attachment to winning control of the economy for the State, if one is committed to the concept of community economics, a political attitude that considers people in their daily lives to matter more than economic orthodoxies, then one must take a different view.  One's instinct prompts one to predict that, in such circumstances, the power wielders, meaning the Minister and Civil Service, will interpret that phrase as narrowly as possible and individual communities and the credit union movement overall will be the poorer.  Such an instinct would be buttressed by the attitude adopted by the Registrar of Friendly Societies and communicated to the boards of directors of credit unions in circumstances in which there will have been <Col N="984" /> discussion about what is and is not the proper role for a credit union within its community.</P>
    <P>Section 41(4) is particularly invidious.  It states:</P>
    <P>If the whole of a building held by a credit union ceases to be occupied for the purposes of the business of the credit union, the credit union shall dispose of its interest in that building as soon as it is practicable to do so.</P>
    <P>That is tantamount to interference in the autonomy of credit unions.  To whom should a credit union dispose of its property?  I hope we would not seek to ensure the disposal of such property to a politically well connected entrepreneur.  That would be a most sinister development.</P>
    <P>Article 43.1.1 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that man, in virtue of his rational being, has the natural right, antecedent to positive law, to the private ownership of external goods.</P>
    <P>Article 43.1.2 states:</P>
    <P>The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath, and inherit property.</P>
    <P>This leads one to question whether the constitutional rights of a duly established credit union are less valuable and worthy of protection by the State than the constitutional rights of other categories of property owners.  It has to be acknowledged that even in an advanced democracy, such as this Republic is held to be, the interests of the State apparatus cannot always be <i>ad idem</i> with the interests of each and every one of the local communities comprising that State.  Before and since the State first thought to legislate for them &mdash; the House will recall that credit unions were already well established and the Irish League of Credit Unions had been in operation for some years before the first Credit Union Bill was passed &mdash; credit unions' primary responsibility was to their membership and potential members. Sometimes that responsibility to a locality may be expressed by a credit union through the ownership of property above and beyond the banking hall required to transact the savings and loans aspects of its business.</P>
    <P>During the <i>Irish Press</i> dispute I suggested the possibility that the credit union movement, or some larger ones comprised mainly of journalists, had an opportunity to invest in a community newspaper.  I hope that type of possibility will be envisaged by those looking to the development of credit unions as an organ of community development.</P>
    <P>The State ought not to criminalise actions undertaken by democratically structured civil organisations mandated by and acting in the interests of their local communities, yet that appears to be the precise intention behind section 41 of this Bill.  A number of members of credit unions and some members of boards of directors have expressed the fear that the enormous power <Col N="985" /> being vested in the Registrar of Friendly Societies to interfere in the activities of credit unions, even to the extent of holding such directors responsible for their actions or repercussions after they resign, may well prove ominous.  In such circumstances the voluntary input, on which credit unions depend, will be made all the more difficult.</P>
    <P>We hear some political parties describe how difficult it is to obtain candidates for elections.  As this Bill stands my fear is that credit unions will begin to express a similar view, contending it will be difficult to find volunteers if they are to be subjected to the type of prescribed control envisaged in this Bill.</P>

      <P>This debate gives Members an opportunity to devote due attention to the overall development of the credit union movement.  One must congratulate them and their members on having brought our attention to the position in which credit unions find themselves.</P>
      <P>While recognising the need for regulation, it is clearly acknowledged that credit unions represent a success story over many years.  With a general election impending the present Minister may not be the author of the final regulations but whoever it is must ensure the credit unions receive support to create and enhance an environment conducive to their development and expansion.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated his willingness to listen to some concerns expressed but is not prepared to say what amendments he will table on Committee Stage.  This means we speak in somewhat of a vacuum.  There is not much one can say except to clearly signal to the Minister that, because we know only half the story, we will be unable to give the Bill the attention it warrants. We want credit unions to be encouraged and enhanced and we want the regulations to assist them.</P>

    <P>The biggest concern of the community is crime. Under that large heading there are many but drug-related crime is probably the biggest worry of all.  Associated with drug related crime are the horrible syringe attacks on people who are vulnerable <Col N="986" /> in the community or the workplace.  A number of cases have made me shudder and I have communicated with the Minister for Justice about one sad, emotional case which caused a difficult and traumatic time for a family.  It involved a garda attacked with a syringe by a prisoner whom he was escorting to court.  Only when these facts are brought to our attention do we realise the impact on the victim's spouse, dependent family and wider family as well as the psychological effect on the individual.  No one will deny it has a huge traumatic effect.  Public servants or people working in a community may have something desired by a person wielding a syringe and will be attacked for it.</P>
    <P>A number of issues have been brought to our attention.  I received a letter from the National Taxi Drivers' Union of Ireland, which reads:</P>
    <P>The members of the National Taxi Drivers' Union of Ireland have requested me to write to you regarding the proposed debate on the syringe Bill.</P>
    <P>As you are probably aware the number of taxi drivers who have been attacked with syringes over the last year has increased dramatically, and to date it is still a great problem for taxi drivers and the general public.</P>
    <P>I would therefore ask your party to consider making attacks of this nature and similar attacks on taxi drivers, but drivers, shop keepers, etc. to be a charge of attempted murder or a minimum of five years to life in prison.</P>
    <P>Enclosed with the letter were newspaper cuttings with which, regrettably, we are all too familiar. They concern horrible attacks on people such as taxi drivers who work anti-social hours. Ireland has a friendly taxi service &mdash; the cars are open without glass screens between the driver and the passenger.  Taxi drivers say they will not be able to provide a service at certain times when they would be vulnerable to attack or will have to take measures which most of us would prefer they would not take, such as introducing screens.  The union sent my party this message and undoubtedly has relayed it to other parties in the House.  Its members want something done now and are not prepared to wait any longer. The letter refers to bus drivers, shop keepers and others who are vulnerable to attack from people who are prepared to disregard their unconstitutional rights.</P>
    <P>It is important that this House be seen to respond in a measured fashion.  No one would object to the content of Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill and the points he made when introducing it are admirable.  The Bill provides for a five year minimum sentence for a first offence, and that is acceptable.  For additional and subsequent offences, there should be higher sentences &mdash; seven years for a second offence, etc.</P>
    <P>Last week I asked the Taoiseach to give Government time to this Bill, otherwise we would have to move it in Private Member's time but he refused.  We simply ask the Government to <Col N="987" /> respond to one of the greatest scourges in the community, attacks on people providing worthwhile services.  Not long ago I met a person who had been attacked with a syringe; he worked for a charitable organisation and would have been known to carry a certain amount of cash.  He, his family and the other charitable volunteers all went through great trauma.  There were medical costs and the psychological impact on the family were appalling.</P>
    <P>We as legislators should be seen to draft the appropriate legislation to deal with issues which warrant focus and attention.  In the past the Minister accepted a number of worthwhile Bills but, unfortunately, we have been put through a charade. The Bills have been sent to the standing committees and while they were being considered the Government published its own legislation. The issue of syringe attacks can be addressed by way of emergency or immediate legislation.</P>

      <P>I have been a Member of this House for only a short time but it annoys me to see the Opposition produce a Bill on every occasion the Government signals its intention to introduce legislation.  Where was Fianna Fáil for the last seven years?  Effectively, there had been no Minister for Justice prior to the Minister taking office. She has tackled every problem presented to her in a comprehensive manner and introduced eight Bills in 1996.  By contrast, when Fianna Fáil was last in Government only four Bills were introduced by the then Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The Minister was heavily criticised for not doing enough to address law and order.  It was, therefore, heartening for the Dublin Chamber of Commerce to acknowledge that something was at last happening in this area.  It complimented the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> To threaten people with syringes is a serious offence, which will be addressed under the provisions of the Bill published today.  Anybody who read the national newspapers knew of its imminent publication.  Fianna Fáil has introduced its own legislation in an attempt to show up what it claims to be the inaction of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister has acted and I congratulate her on the way she addressed the many problems she inherited from previous Governments.  The public accepts that something has been done to deal with the drug barons and others who have attacked the State.</P>
    <P>It will be a long time before Fianna Fáil returns to power because the public now sees what good Government is about.  It is concerned with introducing legislation to tackle the problems that must be dealt with.  Hitherto, nobody was dealing with criminals because of the absence of the necessary legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be seen as the most reforming Minister for Justice because she took on an overburdened system, reformed the courts and the criminal justice system and oversaw a bail referendum.  The legislation published today continues her record.</P>
      <P>Deputy Callely referred to a charade. However, the charade is Fianna Fáil because the Bill it has presented to the House is flawed.  It does not cover many of the issues that need to be tackled if the problem of syringe attacks, which are increasing on a daily basis in Dublin, is to be addressed.</P>
      <P>By contrast, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Bill, 1997, should be enacted because it covers issues which Fianna Fáil wants the Government to address but which are not covered by its Bill.  It is mainly restricted to attacks involving robbery and does not cover other attacks on gardaí and prison officers.  It deals only with the use of syringes and does not deal, for example, with the threat presented by a container of blood.  It does not deal with wounding with a syringe, contaminated or otherwise, or with putting blood, contaminated or otherwise, on a person.  The putting of contaminated blood on a person can be compared with attempted murder.  Finally, the Bill does not provide against persons abandoning syringes in places like Garda cars and coffee shops, thus creating a danger for others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could not accept the Bill in this state.  Nevertheless, it is important that we address this issue.  The number of syringe attacks in my constituency has increased from less than one per day in 1995 to more than three per day last year.  This is linked to the drugs problem, an international problem which the Government is tackling by putting increasingly effective measures in place.  However, drug addicts have seen that using a syringe has a powerful impact on their victims.  In addition, sentencing was not in place and was unfortunately not taken as seriously under the justice system as it needed to <Col N="989" /> be.  The Government's Bill takes it seriously and this will make a difference.</P>
    <P>It is important that a victim impact statement should be made mandatory for all cases before the courts.  Assault by a blood filled syringe is as traumatic as being robbed at gunpoint.  The unbelievable trauma generated by some of these attacks has caused people to sell businesses and has left many victims in need of counselling.  I welcome the provision for severe penalties in the Government's Bill.  It sends the right message to criminals but I urge the courts when sentencing to assess the impact of the syringe attack on the victim.</P>
    <P>There is a need for this legislation.  As a female Deputy I especially welcome the provisions on stalking.  The Minister has addressed this problem speedily.  She has provided a way in which women can now report such offences.  They will not be told by the gardaí that there is nothing they can do on the basis that it would appear an offence has not been committed.  Many women have been intimidated and terrorised by men who have behaved in this extraordinary and outrageous way.  The Bill will go a long way towards reassuring women and I congratulate the Minister on its publication.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with stalking and syringe attacks. It replaces offences which lie at the core of the criminal law with provisions more responsive to modern needs.  The Fianna Fáil Bill is not comprehensive and does not cover many of the issues involved.  It should not be supported by the House.  By contrast, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Bill, 1997, which has been worked on over many months, shows the care with which it has been approached.  It is not a hasty measure introduced for political reasons.  It is a well thought out measure that has gone through a long process of referral to the Attorney General and all the other mechanisms to emerge in a state worthy of being passed.  I congratulate the Minister on her initiative and the quality of the non-fatal offences against the person Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Frances Fitzgerald in welcoming the initiative which the Minister for Justice has taken in the Bill published today.  The Bill before the House is another of those Bills from Deputy O'Donoghue published just ahead of the Minister's announcement.  It is part of a pattern of rapid Bill production in which the Deputy specialises.  It is yet another of those political responses based on the principle of getting there first, whether it is a good news item to be announced in the constituency or the discovery of a problem that needs to be rectified.  In other words, it is the politics of one upmanship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Crime is too serious for this type of response. The response here is badly thought out legislation which would give rise to predictable problems subsequent to being enacted.  The Minister has pointed out many of the limitations of the Bill and I do not intend to repeat them.  The main reason I decided to speak on the Bill is that last <Col N="990" /> night Deputy O'Donoghue sought to portray my party &mdash; and referred to me &mdash; as being soft on crime.  That is nonsense.  He seeks to insinuate that somehow the Labour Party is not vigorous in terms of its opposition to crime.  I reject that as outrageous and ridiculous nonsense.</P>
    <P>Many of the victims of crime are constituents of mine.  It would be outrageous, to the point of being stupid, if I and other Deputies who represent the constituency were anything other than tough and absolutely vigorous in confronting crime.  We have to deal with that problem day in day out.  We have more experience of confronting the problems of crime &mdash; the awful affliction that drugs have visited on the city of Dublin &mdash; than Deputy O'Donoghue has in the pastoral lowlands of County Kerry where the crime level is much lower than in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

      <P>It is nonsensical, outrageous and totally removed from the realities on the ground which we have to deal with.  It is totally removed from the awful difficulties the victims of crime have to face and that we have to encounter every day in our constituency.  I reject what Deputy O'Donoghue has said in relation to this problem and what he is trying to insinuate in regard to crime.  The Minister has a tremendous achievement in regard to the amount of legislation she has put through the House.  That achievement comes from collective decisions in the Cabinet which have been supported by my party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been achieved by the Minister in the face of opportunistic and outrageous attacks from the other side of the House which have little to do with crime and much to do with the politics of availing of the cheap opportunity. The reality is that an enormous amount of comprehensive legislation has been pushed through the House by the Minister.  This is in sharp contrast to what was achieved by the last Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice who was also in partnership with the Labour Party.  Four Bills were pushed through in that period which was an identical length of time to the period this Minister has held office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Minister, 13 Bills have been pushed through, five or six are before the Houses and some more in preparation, not to mention the reformation in the courts and the provision of <Col N="991" /> extra prison spaces.  This comes about because my party in partnership with Fine Gael and Democratic Left has made that possible at the Cabinet. It is nauseating to listen to Deputy O'Donoghue who produced another of his instant Bills which have much the same value as instant soup.  The Deputy specialises in instant Bills.  What type of paralysis gripped Deputy O'Donoghue as an important on-the-way-up backbencher when his party was in Government and what was wrong with his Bill writing capacities in those days?  Why did he not produce them?  In that time only four Bills were enacted, less than 20 per cent of what the Minister has achieved in her term of office.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one or two important points as to where we might go from here.  It is important to lay down some moral imperatives in relation to crime and draw clear distinctions between what is right and wrong.  Yesterday I read with a great deal of satisfaction the column by John Waters in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which he referred to those concepts.  It was refreshing to find they are coming back into the public domain and are being spoken about in terms of what is acceptable and unacceptable.  It is important that we concentrate on that and lay a moral basis for the outlawing and prevention of crime.</P>
    <P>In addition to the law and order measures which have been introduced we need to go much further particularly in the area of estate management by local authorities.  It is important that a big effort is made in this area.  It is even more important when resources are provided for areas of special deprivation that they are managed well.  If not we will end up throwing good money after bad, which would be a pity, and undermine the principles involved in tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider funding some type of research institute in the area of criminology. We have an unlimited supply of amateur criminologists, individuals who holds forth with a tremendous degree of vigour and conviction and do not know what they are talking about.  It is about time we laid the foundations to tackle the problem of crime in a systematic and scientific manner.  We should collect the data, analyse it and draw conclusions that can be learned from the experience.  That is how it is done in other countries.  It is time we made that investment and the cost would be relatively cheap.  A series of worthwhile articles has been written by Dr. Ian O'Donnell in which he suggests the cost of keeping as few as ten prisoners for a year in prison would fund such an institute.  That investment would be worthwhile.  That type of systematic approach has paid huge dividends in other areas such as the electronics industry, the food and agriculture industries, the environment and in medicine.  I appeal to the Minister to give consideration to my suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Upton I would not get upset about the ridiculous positions <Col N="992" /> adopted by Fianna Fáil in Opposition.  I am looking at the Leader of the largest party in the State, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who has arrived for this debate and I have to say Fianna Fáil is an absolute disgrace.  During its time in office it had no policy and did nothing about the drugs epidemic afflicting the city.  I smile when I recall vividly the time he left the House with his press officer and accompanying photographers to meet people in Molesworth Street who were campaigning for and demanding drug treatment services and how he was happy to support them on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet when the Eastern Health Board attempted to set up treatment services in my constituency the most vocal opponent was Deputy Ahern's colleague, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Justice in the Upper House.</P>
      <P>The Government has done more during its two years in office to deal with the drug epidemic in Dublin city than Fianna Fáil ever did.  When the problem arose in the mid-1980s Deputy Ahern and others attended public meetings.  It is a pity Fianna Fáil learned nothing from the people working on the ground at that time.  The then Minister, John O'Connell, forced the Eastern Health Board to open the doors of the Baggot Street clinic to all drug addicts and we are still paying the price.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil complains that we are robbing its ideas.  Like Deputy Upton, I would like to know where these ideas were when it was in Government. It did not set up the drugs task force, community drug teams or the Criminal Assets Bureau or introduce legislation dealing with the seizure of criminal assets or the bail laws.  It is difficult to listen to Deputy O'Donoghue attacking the Government and Minister when his party did nothing in office.  His childish attempts to label the left wing parties as being soft on crime does not upset me as I would expect nothing else from him.  When we go before the electorate in June&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I will be happy to stand over the record of this Government.</P>
      <P>One can only imagine the terror felt by innocent people who are robbed by people brandishing syringes.  Today's newspapers report on three such cases of robbery.  In the first case a German tourist was robbed of £55 at Whitechurch Cathedral in my constituency.  The second robbery took place on Bunting Road, Walkinstown, which is also in my constituency.  In this case an individual with a syringe boarded a bus and robbed one of the passengers of £20.  In a third case two women robbed a person outside the National Irish Bank, whose ATM I often use, on the South Circular Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left Deputies who represent the Dublin <Col N="993" /> South Central constituency know the views of the electorate.  We inform Ministers about what is happening and urge them to introduce legislation to address the problems.  I do not attack the Minister but encourage her to move in a certain direction. She has moved in the right direction on this occasion and I congratulate her on introducing legislation today which will repeal the antiquated 1861 Offences Against the Person Act.  Her legislation will be of more long-term value than one of Fianna Fáil's single issue Bills which are more designed to catch the headlines than to provide solutions.</P>
    <P>Blood filled syringes have become potent weapons in the arsenals of crooks.  I am delighted the Government intends to make the use of a syringe an offence under its legislation.  In my constituency vulnerable people, including small shopkeepers, garage attendants, bank users and pensioners live with the fear of being attacked by syringe wielding thugs.  The use of blood filled syringes is often regarded as a drugs related problem but it is interesting to read the results of research carried out by the Garda Síochána and given to a conference in Dublin two weeks ago. At that conference the Assistant Garda Commissioner, Mr. Tom King, said that 12 per cent of crimes involving the use of syringes were committed by drug addicts.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue complained that his Private Members' Bills are consistently voted down by the Government.  He can remedy this by giving more attention to the drafting and detail. The Deputy seems to assume that syringes are used only during robberies and completely ignores their use in other offences which may not be connected with robbery but which nonetheless are deeply upsetting for the victims.</P>
    <P>The Bill could be regarded as applying to those who avail of needle exchange schemes which are encouraged by the State.  While I welcome such schemes there must be some tightening up in this area.  Given that needles can be bought across the counter in chemist shops it is probably fair to assume that many needles are acquired other than through a needle exchange scheme.  There is general agreement on all sides of the House that the offensive use of syringes needs to be severely punished and this issue is addressed by the Government in its legislation.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken many steps to reverse the consequences of the inactivity of previous Fianna Fáil Governments.  We are picking up the tab and doing a good job.  I congratulate the Minister for Justice and other Ministers, including Democratic Left Ministers, who are using their influence to direct the Government along a progressive and productive path.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That means 295 attacks, or approximately 25 per cent, were dealt with by Fitzgibbon Street Garda Station in my constituency. I thank the good, efficient gardaí in that station who keep an eye on my office and surroundings, against all the odds.  However, those are huge figures.  More than ten attacks have been reported to that station alone since 1 January.</P>
      <P>According to today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, there were four hold-ups in Dublin yesterday between 6 p.m. and midnight.  Most of them involved raids on shops or businesses and muggings. Syringes are filled with the attacker's blood, that of someone else or even tomato juice and their use as weapons has increased over the past six months, in particular.</P>
      <P>Syringes are seen as effective weapons for a number of reasons, according to the Garda.  They are easily obtainable.  They are also small and portable and, therefore, easily concealed and disposed of.  It is almost impossible to get fingerprints from a syringe as any number of people might have handled it for legitimate reasons and, unlike with guns, there is no ballistic evidence. Therefore, the Garda have very little evidence to work on.</P>
      <P>Criminals have, unfortunately, recognised that a syringe is a far more powerful weapon because people are terrified of contracting AIDS, HIV or hepatitis.  It is widely acknowledged that guns do not cause the same terror as blood filled syringes. A report in last week's <i>Irish Independent</i> carried a quote from the victim of a very savage attack who stated:</P>
      <P>The first thing that struck me was that I wished it was a gun or a knife.  If it was a gun they would have disposed of me fairly quickly. If I had to make a choice, I would take my chances with that.  I saw the syringe as having long and lingering consequences.</P>
      <P>A syringe attack is a horrendous ordeal with far reaching consequences for the victim and his or her family.  The victim can face months or years of uncertainty and trauma waiting for test results. For example, the postmaster in Summerhill was jabbed some time ago by an attacker who was HIV positive.  The postmaster still does not know whether he has the virus.  The business has since closed down.</P>
      <P>Syringes are now used more often in muggings. The perpetrator can hold the person at needle point and force him or her to hand over wallets, purses and jewellery rather than having to snatch a visible handbag or other item of personal property. Their handiness for the attacker is why there has been such a dramatic switch to the use of syringes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue has been constantly highlighted by Fianna Fáil through our spokesperson, Deputy O'Donoghue, and by Deputy Eoin Ryan and others.  When it appeared the Government was dragging its feet on yet another urgent criminal matter of enormous public concern, we were moved to introduce a Private Members' Bill to <Col N="995" /> provide that such attacks would be a serious criminal offence attracting significant punishment. The Fianna Fáil Bill creates new offences of aggravated robbery, robbery while in possession of a syringe or needle intended to be used to intimidate, cause injury to or incapacitate any person, and attempted aggravated robbery. Unfortunately, Deputy Eric Byrne could not understand that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has, once again, been spurred into action by the persistence and dedication of the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on justice. Today the Government published the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Bill, 1997, which I welcome on behalf of this side of the House.  It creates a new offence of injuring a person by piercing his skin with a syringe or threatening to do so with the intention of causing the person concerned to believe he will become infected with disease as a result of the injury.  The Bill also provides for a sentence of life imprisonment where the syringe contains contaminated blood or fluid. The Bill also provides for an offence of possession of a syringe or needle and gives the Garda powers of search and seizure.</P>
    <P>All of these provisions are to be welcomed because we had reached a frightening position. The Minister rightly corrected me when she said more than one quarter of those cases occurred in the catchment area of just one Garda station in my area.  I have had the unfortunate opportunity of meeting many of those who have been attacked.  I feel extremely sorry for anybody who is attacked, regardless of how it is done, and hope our laws can cope with the attacks.</P>
    <P>When almost 300 attacks have been reported to one Garda station, it is not an exaggeration to say this is an epidemic which has developed in recent months.  Deputy Eric Byrne believes this has been going on for years in his area.  There were other activities taking place at that time about which he and his organisation probably know more than I do.  I remember marches and parades which put the fear of God into me and which were led by people closely associated with the Deputy inside and outside the House.  It was not syringes they were carrying, but we will not annoy him about that because he has tried to wash himself clean of all those issues.  His party has moved on from that and I hope he realises that all criminal acts are dangerous and we want them all curbed.  The Minister has our support and that of the public for the moves she has made on this issue.</P>
    <P>We need to further examine the issuing of needles.  I have campaigned for a long time in favour of providing needles to drug users and supported some of the clinics which deal with them. Many people use syringes on a daily basis for perfectly legitimate and life saving reasons. However, there are too many stories of children finding needles in playgrounds and on the streets and their danger is far too great to leave unaddressed. I was in Tallaght, Clondalkin, Crumlin <Col N="996" /> and Kimmage last week where one continually hears about needles being found on a daily basis. That matter must be looked at.</P>
    <P>My local gardaí told me that a few days ago two ten year old boys found a needle with traces of blood in a laneway off the North Circular Road.  Luckily they brought it to Fitzgibbon Street Garda station and all they sought for their good citizenship was a tour of the station, with which the gardaí rewarded them.  Fortunately, those two boys had the foresight and sense to hand up what they had found but other children might not be so fortunate.  I hope this legislation, urged on by my colleagues, particularly our spokesperson and Deputy Eoin Ryan, will prove to be very useful in time to come.</P>

      <P>I will speak very briefly to allow some colleagues to contribute.  This is a very important topic.  Like my party leader, I also pay tribute to Deputies O'Donoghue and Eoin Ryan, both of whom produced this Bill.  The parliamentary party and the Front Bench wanted this Bill and, with their customary diligence, Deputies O'Donoghue and Eoin Ryan got to work on it, for which I commend them.  Deputy O'Donoghue has the necessary attributes for such a tough role. He is prolific in his ideas, prodigious in output and, most of all, he is pugnacious in dealing with it in this House.  He would need to be all of that. This issue is one of huge importance.  Today I received telephone calls from three mothers in this city who asked me to tell the Minister she is not in the real world and does not know what is happening.  Since Christmas, each of their three sons, who attend secondary schools in different parts of Dublin, were attacked in broad daylight, two in O'Connell Street and one in a street off O'Connell Street.</P>

      <P>It is dreadful to think that we are living in an era of crime.  What is occurring in Dublin today will be all over the country in the future.  This problem has arisen in recent years. Those boys to whom I just referred were aged 13, 15 and 16 years.  When they were approached, their attackers produced syringes and each young man gave up his watch, money or whatever he had, which is what their parents had told them to do in such situations.  This is a modern crime and an horrific one.  I am sure when people are threatened by someone yielding a syringe they immediately think of contagion, infection and death in that order.  Nobody knows the ramifications of such an attack which can be more lethal than attacks with guns, hammers, blocks or other weapons. Fear of the unknown strikes the victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is terrible that young boys cannot travel to school safely without being subjected to these attacks, 1,200 of which took place in one year. That is approximately 100 per month.  This is a new type of crime in addition to the horrendous murders we hear about almost on a daily basis. <Col N="997" /> Nobody is holding the Minister responsible for those murders but she presides over a system where these matters have become casual and almost acceptable when one hears about them.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for this Bill and it does not deserve the derogatory remarks heaped upon it.  I know of only one party that had a printing press, but the Minister's printing presses must have been working overtime last weekend to produce the Government's Bill.</P>

      <P>Opposition parties must have people to help them prepare legislation, and those people do that out of a sense of voluntary duty.  Fianna Fáil is fortunate in that it has attracted many to this cause.  I cannot understand the disdain expressed by the Minister last night for those professional people who have chosen to help us in the preparation of Bills and other documents.  They are performing a valuable civic duty and they should be commended rather than derided.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make this brief contribution to the debate and highlight the dangers posed to young people by this crime.  The use of syringes in attacks, particularly on young people, is of enormous concern to parents.  I say that in the knowledge of the telephone calls I received today which confirm everything Deputy O'Donoghue and others have said in that regard.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to participate in the debate and congratulate Deputies O'Donoghue and Ryan on bringing forward this important legislation which concentrates on one issue, a fact welcomed by the public.  The incidence of this type of crime has increased in the past few years. It is now at a stage where I and many of my constituents in Dublin South-West believe it is totally out of control.</P>
      <P>A report in tonight's <i>Evening Herald</i> states that five attacks involving syringes occurred in different areas of the city overnight.  One took place at a service station, another at a corner shop, a tourist was involved in another, a passenger on a bus was attacked by another person on the bus and the fifth attack occurred at an ATM.  People using ATMs are particularly vulnerable to these attacks both during the day and at night.  It is dangerous for people to withdraw money from ATMs.  To be threatened or stabbed with a syringe is a terrifying experience for anybody.  It takes some time for the fear to abate which only occurs when the person finds out they have not been infected.</P>
      <P>Another important issue is the problem of discarded syringes.  Parents are terrified their children will pick up one of these syringes and become infected.  Members who have attended public meetings in their constituencies to discuss crime and vandalism will be aware that the problem of discarded syringes is frequently raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be sad for the people already infected <Col N="998" /> with HIV to know that their infection is being used as a terrifying weapon by criminals.  It is despicable for people to threaten to infect others in this way.  The penalties proposed in the Bill are welcome and they should send out a message from this House that we will not accept this type of behaviour in the future and that we are serious about locking away those who threaten others with infected syringes.  Such behaviour is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept the Bill because it focuses on this specific crime which is of great concern to the general public.  She can amend it if she wishes but it would be a good day's work on the part of this House to produce specific legislation to tackle this menace which is of great concern to parents, community leaders, teachers, etc.  If the House were to pass this legislation, with whatever amendments are required on Committee Stage, it would be welcomed by the people who have spoken to me about this issue.</P>

      <P>I welcome this initiative by Deputy O'Donoghue and congratulate him on introducing the Bill.  He has introduced many Bills since becoming our party's spokesperson on Justice, a job he has undertaken with vigour and imagination.  I found it distasteful to listen to many Members opposite, particularly the Minister and some backbenchers, attacking Deputy O'Donoghue on a personal basis on his role as Justice spokesperson.  I never heard anybody attacking Alan Shatter for introducing Private Members' Bills.  He was regarded as a good parliamentarian by Fine Gael but when that party got into Government he was put into exile.  We all know what happened to poor Deputy Shatter.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for the Minister because Deputy O'Donoghue keeps her on her toes and under pressure, but that is his job and he will continue to do it.  Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, lectured us on the role of the Opposition. The role of the Opposition is to raise issues of public concern with the Government, to question it and to put it under pressure.  That is what we are doing in this Bill.  It is our job and we will continue to do it.</P>
      <P>I do not have any problem with the Minister's Bill.  I welcome it but I have no doubt that it is being introduced because of Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill and the fact that I raised the issue on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There is a serious problem of syringe attacks around this city.</P>
      <P>People have given many examples and I heard of one in recent days of a teacher who was attacked in the classroom by a person with a syringe who robbed her handbag and said that if she told anybody he would come back.  She sat in shock and a few minutes later the person ran back into the room to see if she was using the telephone.  That teacher, who is under great stress and mental pressure because of this attack, has not taught since.  In my constituency people have been attacked in video shops.  In a tragic case last summer a youth who had taken a holiday job in a petrol station was attacked and jabbed with a needle.  He is a very bright young person, but since the attack he has fallen back in his studies and suffers great mental trauma.  There is nothing more terrifying than an attack with a syringe &mdash; it strikes terror into people's hearts &mdash; and gardaí, prison officers and the general public are under threat of such attacks.</P>
      <P>Because of our stand, the Government has taken the initiative on this issue.  Deputy Upton criticised Fianna Fáil for having no ideas.  Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left blame Fianna Fáil for everything, but they must break out of that.</P>

      <P>The first responsibility of a Government is to protect its citizens in their homes, on the streets and in their places of work. It is the right of citizens to live their lives without fear of violence or threat of violence.  By any yardstick, the Government has failed in all those responsibilities.  As a Deputy who shares a constituency with the Minister, it is difficult to make a speech without personalising matters, but the Government, particularly the Minister in her role as office holder, has miserably failed the people, particularly the constituency of north County Dublin.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue on the wonderful work he did in preparing the Punishment of Aggravated Robbery Bill.  As a result of his drive and work, many improvements have been made in recent legislation; they were not made by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Lest anybody thinks the problem of needles is experienced only in inner cities or major cities, it is evident in my constituency of Dublin North, where crime is the greatest issue of concern.  In housing estates where over the years shrubberies and plantations had been developed in open spaces, they have had to be cut down to curb drinking and the use of needles in these areas. Since then, the people have some peace of mind.</P>
      <P>During the Christmas period people were attacked and horrendous crimes were committed in Portmarnock.  In recent weeks in Malahide houses were broken into.  The position has become so bad that thugs ignore burglar alarms, take car keys from houses and drive away.  On one occasion they went to the bedroom of a couple to demand the keys of the car and on another occasion they found the keys in the hall and drove away.  That happened in the area where the Minister lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Swords cars are stolen from outside homes. On one occasion a car was stolen at about 10.30 p.m., driven down town and crashed into another car which went on fire.  Thank God nobody was killed.  What is the Government doing about crime in our area?  There has been a spate of robberies in houses where couples work during the day, with robbers entering houses through the roofs.  On one side of my home a vacant house was burned to the ground and on the other side, the house was broken into, to the great distress of <Col N="1001" /> my neighbours.  The Minister then tells us crime is under control.  In reply to a question I put down, she said crime figures are reducing in the area. Little she knows, but much she will find out when she knocks on the doors.</P>
    <P>In the parish of Donabate last weekend the home of a quiet, inoffensive man, who never did a wrong turn in his life, was broken into and he was attacked and robbed of a small sum of money.  The community in Balbriggan has to take on the problem of drugs.  The people in the area are terrified by threats to use blood-filled needles and of being infected by them.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this Bill on behalf of our party, Deputy O'Donoghue has, as on other occasions, spurred the Minister to action.  It is unfortunate that we have to depend on the Opposition to produce legislation for the Government to take action.  The Taoiseach stated a week ago that the Bill would be ready in the summer, but Deputy O'Donoghue's action has brought it forward.</P>

      <P>There is only one way to deal with a crime problem and that is the right way.  It must be thoroughly examined in all its manifestations, and proposals brought forward must be comprehensive and well thought out.  The Minister has published the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Bill, 1997 which will repeal the greater part of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861 and restate in modern statutory form the law relating to the main non-fatal offences against the person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill restates the law relating to various forms of assault, threats to kill or cause serious harm, coercion, poisoning, false imprisonment and abduction of children and will provide for increased penalties.  In line with the commitment given by the Minister, the Bill deals with syringe offences.  It provides for a range of new offences to combat criminal conduct involving syringes, including offences of possession of a syringe or container of blood with intent to threaten or injure, placing or abandoning a syringe in a place in a manner which injures or is likely to injure a person, injuring a person with a syringe or threatening to do so and throwing or putting blood on another person or threatening to do so.  The penalties <Col N="1002" /> provided will range from five years to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also provide a new offence of harassment aimed at stalking which will incur a maximum penalty of five years and will also empower the court, in addition to imposing a penalty, to order the stalker not to communicate in any way with the victim for such period as may be specified by the court or not to approach within a specified distance of the victim's residence or place of employment.</P>
    <P>The syringe provisions are very comprehensive and address all the various ways in which syringes and blood can exploit people's fear of becoming infected with disease.  The Minister's provisions will deal with threatening behaviour involving syringes or blood; injury caused by wounding with a syringe or spraying with blood; provide for the offence of piercing a person with a syringe contaminated with blood or spraying of contaminated blood on a person; criminalise possession of a syringe or blood in a container intended to cause or threaten injury; criminalise abandoning syringes in a dangerous way; provide for penalties ranging from a maximum of five years to life imprisonment depending on the seriousness of the offence; and, in relation to possession offences, give the Garda the appropriate powers of enforcement and the courts power to take a common sense approach to the application of the possession provisions.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill, the Minister's Bill leaves no stone unturned.  As the Minister indicated last night, the Deputy's Bill is totally inadequate and I will spell out clearly its main difficulties.  It does not deal with the range of possible criminal activity involving syringes or other containers of blood.  It is restricted in the main to attacks involving robbery.  It does not cover other attacks, for example, those on gardaí, prison officers, social workers, doctors, etc.  It deals only with use of syringes, but fails to deal with threats presented by a container of blood.  It does not deal with actual wounding with a syringe or with putting blood on a person.  It does not provide for wounding with a contaminated syringe or putting contaminated blood on a person. As the victim could catch a fatal disease, this action can be compared with attempted murder. It does not provide against persons abandoning syringes and so creating a danger for others, for example, leaving them in squad cars, in a coffee shop or in other places where they may present a danger to unsuspecting members of the gardaí, prison staff or the public.  Deputy O'Donoghue's main possession offence is also linked to robbery. It does not deal with attacks to intimidate or injure or, in relation to drugs, intimidation or threats of injury where doctors are put under threat.</P>

      <P>This Bill is indicative of the work Deputy O'Donoghue has been doing as Opposition spokesperson on Justice.  He has distinguished himself in that role.  This is not the first Bill he has introduced but, unfortunately, from the tone of the previous speaker it appears it will not be accepted by the Government.</P>
      <P>I want to highlight a number of problems related to drugs in my constituency.  Dún Laoghaire currently suffers from three social problems, housing, crime and drugs.  That may come as a surprise to those who see Dún Laoghaire as a sophisticated, high flying urban area.  Nothing is further from the truth.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would bring to the notice of the Minister for Health the problems that will arise when a GP in Dún Laoghaire retires from his practice after many years of dedicated service to the community.  He prescribes physeptone and methadone to drug addicts and local pharmacies dispenses medication to approximately 80 drug addicts each week.  The GP in question deals with between 240 and 400 addicts per week and will retire at the end of the month.  It is crucial that the Minister for Health appoints another GP immediately.</P>
      <P>The huge drug problem that affects the centre of Dublin also affects the Dún Laoghaire area. While a clinic must be set up to deal with the serious drug problem in Dún Laoghaire, it should not be located in a shopping centre or built up area.  I support the Bill because it will address the problem in my constituency.  A recent letter submitted to me stated:</P>
      <P>I hope you will ensure that the problem is dealt with efficiently and that a crisis in the area is prevented.  Panic is mounting amongst the drug addicted community.  I have heard rumours that three drug dealers from the Dublin area are intending to target Dún Laoghaire at the end of March.</P>
      <P>If I could do nothing else for my constituency I would love to rid the community of the obscenity of drug peddlers.  I have some sympathy with drug addicts who are often brought into the circle because of unemployment, marriage breakdown, drink, weakness, hopelessness or helplessness.  I can understand the need to help addicts who are anxious to break their habit.  For that reason I want the Minister of State to bring to the attention of the Minister for Health the urgent need to appoint a new GP to deal with drug addicts in the Dún Laoghaire constituency, particularly in the centre of Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members who contributed to this debate and particularly the kind words spoken by some.  As Fianna Fáil spokesman on Justice I have called more than once for a separate offence dealing with syringes and their use in robberies.  That was recently followed up <Col N="1004" /> by Deputy Eoin Ryan on RTÉ radio when he spoke about these offences.  Before Deputy Ryan had his lunch the same day, the Minister for Justice stated that she would publish legislation dealing with this matter.  We proceeded with legislation that was a long time in planning and brought a cogent, persuasive Bill before the House that would stand up in court.</P>
      <P>The ink was hardly dry on that legislation before the Minister of Justice stated that she would bring in her own legislation.  I have said more than once that the Minister's tenure in the Department of Justice has been the era of the photocopier.  That is how it will go down in history if historians ever bother to deal with the trials of the rainbow coalition Government; it was the era when the photocopier reigned supreme in the Department of Justice.  I have listed examples of that before and there is no need to repeat them.</P>
      <P>However, there is a need for Government backbenchers who talk tough and vote soft on crime to understand what is happening in Dublin and what is likely to occur in every town and village unless adequate steps are taken now to prevent it.  Here are some examples from an <i>Irish Independent</i> supplement of 18 February: &ldquo;Taximan pricked after handing over money&rdquo;, &ldquo;Raid on a petrol station in Tallaght&rdquo;, &ldquo;Seven syringe attacks on Ranelagh newsagent&rdquo;, &ldquo;Jabbed in a video store&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hidden in café seat&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hepatitis C after the needle&rdquo;.  According to the Minister for Justice these are real situations involving 1,200 people last year who suffered at the hands of those wielding syringes.</P>
      <P>It is easy for Government members to deride this legislation on the basis that it deals mainly with robbery.  They should come into the real world.  The legislation deals with robbery because &mdash; in the vast majority of cases &mdash; that is when syringes are used.  It would be ludicrous for our Bill not to refer to robberies.  The Minister for Justice and the Minister of State have advanced many reasons for not accepting this Bill.  I could give 10,000 more reasons for accepting it but what would be the point in wasting one's sweetness on the desert air?</P>
      <P>Last night I asked if this Legislature had the courage to bring in minimum, mandatory legislation in relation to attacks by people wielding syringes.  I stated that legislation needed to be brought in to deal with that problem and that minimum or mandatory sentences should be imposed.  I do not suggest that this legislation is minimalist but I accept it does not deal with every eventuality; no legislation could.  However, it was the minimum required in the light of experience. It provided that if a person had a first offence for using a syringe or needle with intent to injure, incapacitate or intimidate, the minimum sentence the court should impose would be five years.  If the person had a second conviction the minimum sentence should be seven years and after a third conviction the person should receive life imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> In a carefully choreographed press statement this morning, the Minister for Justice seemed to indicate that the Government had provided for life sentences for those who use syringes and for minimum sentencing in their legislation, making it mandatory for a court to impose stiff sentences on people wielding syringes with the intent to maim, injure or incapacitate.  That is not true.</P>
    <P>The Government legislation allows a court to impose a sentence of five years up to life or other periods of years but there is no minimum or mandatory sentencing contained in its legislation. That legislation is fatally flawed as a consequence because somebody pulled out the plug on the photocopier when the Fianna Fáil legislation was being copied.  Nobody should be under the illusion that this House does not have the power to impose minimum sentences; it was done by Deputy Ray Burke in the context of capital murder and was done with other of legislation, such as the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876.  It was <Col N="1006" /> also done by Deputy Burke in relation to attempted capital murder in section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990.  There is no valid argument in the proposition that the separation of powers postulated by the 1937 Constitution is compromised by minimum or mandatory sentencing imposed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The only question for the people is why, when faced with such a horrific situation in society, did the Government decide that the punishment would not fit the crime?  The answer is the same one tonight that we have had for the last two and a quarter years; the Government did not do the right thing by the people because it could not agree to do it.  The three separate philosophies in the rainbow coalition could not reach a consensus to do the right thing and, therefore, they did the wrong thing.  The Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare pulled the plug when the Minister's secretary was photocopying the Fianna Fáil Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for coming into the House to respond to this matter.  As Members are aware, Deputy Ó Cuív and I travelled to London on Thursday, 13 February to meet Róisín McAliskey in Holloway Prison.  Proper arrangements were made for the visit.  We were treated with courtesy and in a civil manner. We had an open meeting of 40 minutes duration with her.  This was followed by a satisfactory meeting with the governor of the prison whom I found open, interesting and helpful.  I make these points to separate rhetoric from reality.</P>
      <P>Róisín McAliskey is entering the seventh month of pregnancy.  She is slight and frail and has been undermined, psychologically, by the alien conditions in which she is being held.  She is deemed to be a category A, high risk prisoner. The Government should press for the alleviation of these conditions which we found to be utterly disgraceful for a woman in her condition.  They include a lack of physical exercise, a lack of association with others, surveillance at 30 minute intervals throughout the night and strip searching at regular intervals.</P>
      <P>She is receiving medical treatment from her doctor within the prison.  She has, however, been asked to sign a disclaimer to the effect that should anything happen to her or her baby she will not hold the prison responsible.  She has not done so and both Deputy Ó Cuív and I encouraged her not to sign it under duress.</P>
      <P>On our return we met the German and British Ambassadors.  There is what I can only describe, politely, as a diplomatic fudge as each Ambassador informed us that their country does not oppose the granting of bail.  I know the Tánaiste called in the British Ambassador and I am sure he had an interesting discussion with her.  Perhaps that fudge can be cleared up.  In this era of information technology two weeks after we visited her in prison the two embassies are giving the same message.  The British Crown authorities and the German authorities are saying they do not oppose bail.  The German Ambassador said that his Government did not have the power to do so nor was their opinion sought on this matter.</P>
      <P>Years after the event Irish cases appear to get justice.  The case of Bloody Sunday has been raised.  The Tánaiste, the Government and our party are doing their best to bring the events of that day into the open, to secure a proper apology and to have all the facts ascertained.  With the Guilford Four and the Birmingham Six justice was not seen to be done until years after the event and the same is happening in regard to the events of Bloody Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter is one of immediate humanitarian interest and concern and because of the nature of the pregnancy we cannot delay on this.  I am pleased to record what we saw and those we met. We found her in brave spirits, but she was weak <Col N="1009" /> and very frail.  We want this House to convey its concern about this case and how it is progressing.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an Teachta O'Rourke agus buíochas a ghabháil leis an Tánaiste as ucht teacht isteach agus éisteacht leis an gcás seo tráthnóna.  Two issues concerning this case must be sorted out expeditiously.  An explanation is owed as to why Róisín McAliskey is the first ever female pregnant prisoner to have been categorised as high risk, category A.  The categorisation of prisoners is a matter for the British authorities. The conditions under which she is being held, which were well explained by my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, are wrong in the circumstances. Lights are on in the prison 24 hours a day and there is constant strip searching even for closed visits. Open visits were afforded to her family for the first time last week.  Closed visits do not afford visitors any contact with the prisoner.</P>
      <P>The second issue relates to bail and the German authorities.  A letter dated 19 February 1997 from Gareth Peirce of Birnberg &amp; Co., Solicitors states that during a court hearing a representative of the Crown prosecution said that the Germany Embassy representative at the court had repeated that the Germany Government was opposed to the granting of bail to Ms McAliskey.  There has been a step forward since then, but it has not resolved this issue.  I understand a further letter issued from the German authorities to Birnberg &amp; Co., Solicitors, but it has not clarified this matter in the way it needs to be clarified to expedite the possibility of bail being granted.  It is important that the German authorities should be called on to state explicitly and to put in writing to the British authorities and the defence solicitor in this case that they are not opposing bail and that they consider it a matter for the British authorities. If that were done, it would enable the British authorities to grant bail in this case where a large surety has been offered if bail is granted.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom arís buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht éisteacht don chás seo.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh ar a chumas achainí laídir a dhéanamh agus an cás truamhéileach seo, nár cheart éirí riamh, a réiteach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to inform the house of the actions I have taken with regard to the case of Ms Róisín McAliskey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand fully and share the humanitarian concerns expressed by all those concerned about the circumstances surrounding her detention and the forthcoming birth of her child.  In considering her case we should not lose sight of the fact that she is on remand pending an extradition hearing and has not yet had the opportunity to defend herself against any charges.  There has been widespread concern about her condition in Ireland and Britain, particularly given her pregnancy. The House will be aware that her case has more recently attracted significant international attention, <Col N="1010" /> including on the part of Amnesty International and the European Parliament.  I welcome the Parliament's decision this week to send a delegation of its civil liberties committee to visit Ms McAliskey on the proposal of Irish MEPs.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Deputy and her colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, visited Ms McAliskey as have a number of Irish MEPs and that other Members of the House intend to do so.  My Department and the Irish Embassy in London stand ready to assist in this regard.</P>
    <P>Last week I personally conveyed my serious concerns about Róisín McAliskey's circumstances to the British Ambassador when she called on me at my office at my request on 19 February.  I raised with her the conditions under which Ms McAliskey is being held, particularly in light of her now advanced stage of pregnancy.  I questioned the need for Ms McAliskey to be regarded as a category A prisoner which has impeded open family visits and consultation with legal counsel. Her security categorisation also involves an excessive level of strip searching.  While recognising that the question of bail was a matter for the courts, I strongly urged that the relevant authorities encourage a positive and early decision on bail on humanitarian grounds.</P>
    <P>I also addressed the need to provide substantial reassurance now to Ms McAliskey both about the circumstances in which she will give birth, if she should remain in custody, and the question of facilities to enable her to take care of her new born baby.  In particular, I expressed the hope that her partner would be permitted to be present during the birth and that she would not handcuffed or similarly restrained at any time during the birth.  The ambassador undertook to convey my concerns to her authorities.  My Department and the Irish Embassy in London have, on my instructions, been very active in Ms McAliskey's case and closely monitor all developments relating to it.</P>
    <P>Following Ms McAliskey's first appearance at Bowe Street Magistrates Court on 27 November 1996, the embassy arranged for her to be visited at Holloway Women's Prison by her father, sister and partner.  Over the weekend of 30 November-1 December she was moved to Belmarsh Prison, an all-male high security facility, and was reclassified upwards to high risk.  Following this move, my Department received a substantial number of representations expressing serious concern about Ms McAliskey's health and the conditions in which she was imprisoned.  This concern included the fear that she would lose her baby unless appropriate medical attention was provided.  As a result, the Embassy made representations to the British authorities regarding her condition and they urged that appropriate medical attention be afforded to her.  These representations were met with assurances from the British authorities that appropriate medical treatment would be provided.</P>
    <P>After her appearance at Bowe Street Magistrates Court on 4 December 1996, Ms McAliskey <Col N="1011" /> was visited by an embassy official at Belmarsh Prison.  On the basis of this visit further representations were made to the British authorities.  Subsequently, she was brought to Greenwich and District Hospital for a scan on 5 December and brought back to Holloway Prison.  The next day the embassy was involved in arranging further visits by her partner and her parents.</P>
    <P>Following contact with Ms McAliskey's solicitor, Ms Gareth Peirce, in late December, the embassy again raised a number of issues regarding the conditions of her detention and sought clarification regarding the possibility of a transfer to a prison in Northern Ireland.  The reply from the British authorities on the question of a transfer to the North was that there was no legal provision under which such a transfer could be ordered.</P>
    <P>Ms McAliskey was visited again by an embassy official on 24 December.  While she was reported to be in good spirits, her condition continued to give cause for concern. Further consular visits have been made by officials of the embassy to Ms McAliskey on 3 and 21 February 1997.  Concerns expressed to them by Ms McAliskey during these visits have been subsequently raised by the Embassy with the appropriate British officials at the highest level.  At the most recent meeting with the British side on 20 February, the Embassy reiterated the concerns regarding Ms McAliskey's circumstances and asked the prison service to address them as a matter of urgency on humanitarian grounds.  Embassy officials again questioned the need for Ms McAliskey to be subject to such a high security classification, the appropriateness of closed visits to a woman in her condition and pressed the British authorities for movement on these issues.  On the basis of a report from the Embassy, I am hopeful that there may be some improvement in relation to the question of closed visits in Ms McAliskey's case.</P>
    <P>The general question of closed visits for republican and remand prisoners has been the subject of numerous representations by the Irish Embassy to the British Home Office and prison service officials.  The issue will be raised again at a meeting with the British authorities tomorrow.  I have expressed our humanitarian concerns about their impact on family contact and legal consultations, in particular within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>Officials of the Embassy have been present at a number of Ms McAliskey's court hearings, including her most recent appearance at Bow Street Magistrates' Court on 13 February 1997. The Embassy continues to keep in close contact with Ms Gareth Pierce who has advised that she has lodged a petition with the House of Lords regarding the decision, taken at Divisional Court level on 22 January 1997, to refuse an application for Ms McAliskey's release on the grounds that the German extradition request was in contravention of the European Convention on Extradition. <Col N="1012" /> The Embassy has been advised that this appeal will commence in advance of the full extradition hearing on 12 March 1997.</P>
    <P>There has also been contact at senior official level with the German Embassy in London with a view to clarifying its position regarding the question of bail for Ms McAliskey.  It has been stated at bail hearings on behalf of the British Prosecution Service that the German Federal Prosecutor's Office oppose bail for her.  The Magistrates' Court has asked for clarification on this issue.  I understand there were contacts last week between the German Federal Prosecutor's Office and the British Crown Prosecution Service for this purpose.</P>
    <P>My Department and our London Embassy will continue to follow the case closely in the period ahead and, where appropriate, any concerns raised will be again taken up with the relevant British authorities.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I will continue to take a direct personal interest in Ms McAliskey's case. I also intend to raise the issue at my next meeting within the context of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference with the Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew.</P>
    <P>The case of Róisín McAliskey and her unborn child has an obvious and compelling humanitarian dimension.  However, as I stated after my meeting with the British Ambassador, if mishandled it also has the potential to damage the shared objectives of the two Governments in the cause of peace and reconciliation in these islands. The House will be fully aware that there are those who are only too ready to exploit such cases for their own purposes.  Therefore, we will continue to closely monitor Róisín McAliskey's condition and urge the British authorities to treat her in a compassionate and humane way in the light of the forthcoming birth of her child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue to articulate the anger and concern of thousands of parents nationwide at the announcement of the imposition of a 21 per cent VAT increase on the costs of child care services arising from a decision of the Revenue Commissioners to apply VAT at 21 per cent to crèches and child-minding services generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growth of child care facilities here has been dramatic over the past 20 years with an estimated 50,000 children being catered for by a variety of such services.  I call on the Minister for Finance to intervene and take urgent steps to ensure that this 21 per cent VAT rate is not applied to the pre-schools involved.  I also call on <Col N="1013" /> the Minister to ensure that the costs of this imposition will not have to be borne by parents.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important to make child care facilities available to all our children.  We are the least developed country in the western world in respect of child care facilities generally.  It is extremely important that this savage increase in VAT does not result in children being unable to avail of child care services because of their increased cost.  It is estimated that this decision will mean increases of between £10 and £16 in crèches nationwide.  Various owners of crèches and Montessori schools have reported that VAT bills amounting to thousands of pounds have already been received and in some instances VAT bills of up to £6,000 have been paid.</P>
    <P>I note that educational services such as Montessori pre-schools are exempt from VAT at 21 per cent as they are defined as educational services. However, all existing child care facilities should be classified as &ldquo;educational&rdquo;.  The demarcation line between crèches and pre-schools in the child care area is nonsensical; most establishments have an educational base where children learn through play and other activities.</P>
    <P>We are faced with the prospect of the Revenue Commissioners arriving at such definitions and taking decisions on whether an institution or establishment has a wholly child caring dimension or an educational one and, on that interpretation, proposing to apply VAT to the non-educational dimension, a non-runner, not capable of implementation at the outset.</P>
    <P>According to the NCNA, at the current charge of £50 to £80 per week in Dublin, a child care service with ten children charging at the lower end of the scale would find itself within the VAT net and that has caused an outcry.  Perhaps it illustrates a lack of a coherent plan in relation to pre-schooling here.  I have long argued for the establishment of a national forum on early education, on which all providers of education would be represented and at which a proper, coherent, national plan could be developed.  It is well known that investment in early education pays rich dividends in society.  Throughout the developed world and in the United States proper, planned pre-school education has resulted in tremendous gains for society as a whole, in addition to individual children who will have benefited from well resourced, pre-school education. Children learn at an extremely rapid rate in their early years.</P>
    <P>This VAT proposal is anti-family and anti-women. Many women returning to work require child care facilities, like many parents returning to education.  No tax relief is available to parents at work or returning to education in respect of child-minding services.  The House will be well aware of the difficulties encountered by independent mature students who must bear such child-minding costs themselves when they return to education.  This proposed VAT increase will further exacerbate their difficulties.  This should <Col N="1014" /> be perceived as a total education service and, accordingly, exempt from VAT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Martin for sharing his time.</P>
      <P>It is time to put a stop to the ambivalence on the provision of child care.  I welcome the outcry resulting from the recent Revenue announcement that VAT may have to be charged on child care services.</P>
      <P>Today we witnessed strong reaction on the part of representatives of child care organisations nationwide, from the National Women's Council and many others who know that the overall demand for child care services is continuously growing and that thousands of parents and children depend on them.  I have no doubt that if this matter is not sorted out we will be inundated with letters from angry, frustrated parents.  Most other European Union countries have sorted out this problem; so should we.</P>
      <P>It has taken years to tackle this issue.  I welcome the commitment contained in Partnership 2000 but we cannot allow that commitment to be derailed by a decision of the Revenue Commissioner. Our objective must be to provide the best quality child care facilities for all our children; by that very definition all such care has an educational component.  Indeed, services that do not contain such facilities, far from being charged VAT, should be closed down.</P>
      <P>This is not an issue which can be allowed to divide parents.  The notion that we must not act on the provision of high quality child care services lest we offend parents taking care of children full-time at home is divisive and blatantly anti-children and anti-family.  All families should be able to take advantage of good quality child care services. It should be remembered that today's full-time parent may be tomorrow's part-time worker who may need such services in times of family illness and so on.</P>
      <P>Let the nonsense about child care cease.  Let us ensure that we develop the best, most accessible and affordable child care services in the interests of all children and their parents.  The argument that to support child care is to diminish the role of women caring for their children full-time is a cop-out.  What it actually reflects is guilt.  The tangible support for and recognition of those of us who have and continue to carry out that role has never been a political priority.</P>
      <P>It is about time we found the will to tackle both issues rather than playing one off against the other and shedding crocodile tears for women and children.  This is an issue that should be of concern to Members on all sides of the House since it affects many of our citizens and is about our children's future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Martin and Deputy Fitzgerald for raising this matter because it will allow me to correct some misleading impressions that appear to be circulating about this subject. <Col N="1015" /> The suggestion made in media reports today that this is an initiative to extend VAT does not accord with the facts.  In the past many child care providers were below the VAT registration threshold of £20,000 per annum and did not need to levy VAT but could not, correspondingly, deduct their input VAT.  VAT has been charged in the case of the larger operators since the late 1970s. The problem has been given greater focus in recent years due to the increasing commercial provision of child minding services, on a very substantial scale.  These entities are increasingly above the threshold for VAT registration and thus should charge VAT but they will also have the right of deduction on inputs.</P>
      <P>Our treatment of child care services for VAT purposes is governed by the EU sixth VAT Directive which dates from 1977 and with which Irish VAT law must and does comply.  Under that directive the main relevant exemption is for child minding services provided by public bodies or recognised non-profit making charities but this exemption does not extend to the provision of child care services generally.  Such facilities are liable for VAT at the Irish standard rate &mdash; currently 21 per cent &mdash; when they are provided in the course or furtherance of business and if their annual turnover exceeds or is likely to exceed the standard VAT registration services threshold of £20,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>Education is also exempt under the directive and crèches and playschools which follow a clear educational programme may also be exempt if they come within the terms of the exemption for children's education.  It is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to determine whether a particular facility follows such a programme.  The difficulties of deciding what forms of activity are educational in nature have given rise to some concern and we are anxious to help resolve this issue.  In accordance with a commitment given in Partnership 2000 a few months ago, the Revenue Commissioners have promised to issue guidelines clarifying the criteria used to determine to what extent child care facilities fall within the terms of the exemption from VAT for children's education. These guidelines are expected to be available in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are also researching the treatment of this service in the other member states of the EU.  If, taking account of the outcome of these inquiries, one can be satisfied child care as it is developing will come within one or other of the exempt categories set out in the directive, this possibility will certainly be pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am optimistic about this.  My experience of pre-school child facilities goes back a few years but all of them meet educational criteria to some extent.  It is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to lay down the guidelines so that each pre-school or crèche facility can see whether it complies.  It will only take a small step to resolve the dilemma and legitimate concerns of parents. <Col N="1016" /> Nothing new has happened &mdash; the VAT requirement is laid down in a 1977 EU directive &mdash; but with larger turnover and more people getting into the business it has become an issue recently.  I am sure the matter will be resolved to everyone's satisfaction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me raise this important matter on behalf of the people of Dingle in my constituency of Kerry South.  The difficulty relates to a new, state of the art sewage treatment plant in the town some three years ago installed by the Department of the Environment through its agent, Kerry County Council.  Contractors were hired to carry out the work and they in turn operated to the instructions and plans of consultants.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, although the sewage treatment plant cost in excess of £3 million and was located in a coastal town whose harbour has been developed at considerable expense to the Exchequer in recent years, the development of the fish processing industry in the area was not taken into account.  As a result, the plant was unable to cope adequately with the effluent from the three fish processing plants in the town.  One would be forgiven for thinking a plant costing so much money and located in a coastal town with a tradition of fish processing would have been built to take into account that first, these processing industries existed and second, because the harbour had been developed, they would definitely expand.  As the fishing fleet grew so did the landings into Dingle harbour &mdash; in 1996 they were estimated at approximately £7 million, as opposed to £1 million in 1989.  More than 200 people are employed in the processing industry and many more are directly involved in the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>Someone has serious questions to answer and I ask the Minister to discuss the matter with the consultants and Kerry County Council.  It transpires that at no stage did either the consultants or the county council consult the fish processors, although the Department appears to be of the view that they did.  Surely in a coastal town where fish processing is one of the major industries the consultants should have discussed the matter with those involved in the processing industry.  Apparently this did not happen.  Neither was there proper input from BIM &mdash; it was only consulted by way of a telephone call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great pity and a great drawback to the town that the sewage treatment plant does not take the effluent from the three fish processing plants.  It has now been proposed to the owners of the plants that they should provide pre-treatment facilities.  That would cost in the region of £300,000 per plant; the owners could not afford that and no grants are available.  One processor finds himself in the unenviable position that, because he has been unable to date to comply with the effluent discharge licence, he is being <Col N="1017" /> denied payment of a grant of approximately £750,000.  I ask the Minister of State to bring the various parties to this sorry saga together with a view to resolving it for the community.</P>

      <P>It is recognised that difficulties have been experienced since the Dingle sewerage scheme was opened in 1995. However, it is not accepted that these difficulties can be attributed to the design of the treatment plant.</P>
      <P>Dingle sewage treatment plant was designed to deal with a loading of 8,000 population equivalent. This loading represents both domestic and industrial usage.  It is usual for industrial waste to be accepted in a local authority scheme, provided that BOD strengths are reasonable.  A reasonable level is considered to be domestic strength or slightly higher.  If an industry generates waste which involves a high loading, it is the practice that the waste should be pre-treated to a reasonable level.  Discharges of high strength wastes to a municipal scheme can cause major overloading which creates difficulties in the running of the plant and these difficulties can be exacerbated when the wastes are seasonal in nature.</P>
      <P>In Dingle, the loading and concentration arising from the fish processing sector are subject to seasonal fluctuations.  Discharges during the herring season, from October to February, are different in nature from those in the summer season when white fish which are gutted at sea are processed. It is also a fact that concentrations can vary from day to day.  As against this, the design of a sewage treatment plant must be based on average discharges over a period, and cannot be designed on the basis of taking large loads over short periods.</P>
      <P>The needs of the fish processing industry were taken into account when the plant at Dingle was being designed.  As a result, almost 25 per cent of the plant's treatment capacity was set aside to meet the requirements of industry, mainly the fish processing industry.  This provision is considered reasonable.  The alternative to pre-treatment by industry of their effluent is to design a plant capable of catering fully for the untreated discharge from industry.  In the case of Dingle, this would have required treatment for a population equivalent in the order of 75,000, which would have had huge implications for the capital and running costs of the scheme.  In such circumstances, industry would have been required to make a major contribution to the capital costs of the scheme on the basis of the polluter pays principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, in a situation where an industry generates a high strength waste it is the practice for that waste to be treated prior to discharge to the municipal treatment plant.  This is achieved by the imposition of conditions through licensing under the Water Pollution Acts.  The granting of these licences is a matter for the local authorities, in this case Kerry County Council.  I understand that in order to find a satisfactory resolution <Col N="1018" /> to the problems which have arisen, Kerry County Council entered into discussions with representatives of the fish processing industry and has issued a revised licence.  Pre-treatment facilities are required as a condition of this licence and are to be installed before the next herring season. Kerry County Council is confident that the requirements imposed by the licence will allow the treatment plant to operate effectively as soon as the appropriate measures are put into place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Shercock in east County Cavan is located in the heart of the poultry rearing area. Carton's is an excellent company and has been in business in Shercock for over 30 years.  It is the only major employer in the region.  It has had an excellent workforce.  The work ethic in Cavan-Monaghan is second to none and is accepted as such by many, especially employers.</P>
      <P>The major growth area in poultry processing is in value added and the portioning sector.  The company recently requested 28 redundancies, not because there was no work but to relocate in County Meath.  The employees of the company and the people of Shercock are concerned about the implications of this move.  Over 350 people work for Carton's in Shercock.</P>
      <P>What has the Minister of State's Department done to protect the jobs?  What has Forbairt done?  Was the company approached?  Was any effort made to get the company to develop in Shercock?  Was any grant aid offered or was it offered to the company to develop elsewhere? Land is available in Shercock, there is a proven workforce and a ready supply of new labour.</P>
      <P>People in my area believe that the Border counties do not matter to the Government.  For the first time in the history of the State, there is no Minister from any of the Border counties. When opening a high-tech industry in Dublin recently, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment stated that one of the reasons for the industry's location was the efficiency of the Government. Can it therefore be taken that the reason jobs are not being created in the Border region is the inefficiency of the Government?</P>
      <P>Of the 14,087 jobs created by foreign companies in 1996 only 22 were located in County Cavan. However, the county lost 84 jobs.  Twenty-five new overseas jobs were established in County Monaghan while 23 jobs were lost.  In response to a parliamentary question, the Taoiseach told the Dáil on 18 February that of the eight regions in the country, the Border region had by far the highest unemployment rate at 15.2 per cent.</P>
      <P>There is support for the region from outside the country.  For example, the USA is prepared to give support through the Washington Conference, the Pittsburgh Conference and the IFI. EU support is available through INTERREG and the programme for peace and reconciliation. There would be results if the Government did its job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that these jobs are retained in Shercock and to encourage the firm to develop there.  It has been very successful over the past 30 years.  Cavan County Council and the county enterprise board support a new development.  I appeal to him to consult with Forbairt to provide special grant aid and to give the company an opportunity to retain its jobs and develop in Shercock.</P>

      <P>I propose to deal with the avian health situation in Ireland and with the general economic health of the poultry meat industry.  Deputies were briefed on Wednesday of last week on the Newcastle disease outbreak in Northern Ireland and on the animal health measures which were being taken by the industry and the Department to try to prevent the disease from spreading to this side of the Border.

      <P>I have not yet received representations of consequence from the poultry and egg industry or from individual processors within that industry in relation to any adverse effects on their enterprises.  I would not expect any such representations because any lessening of the measures in place could only be considered as increasing the disease risk here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the broader issue of the economic health of the industry, Deputies will be aware of the report of the Poultry Industry Forum.  The forum was established by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in January 1995 to assist in the implementation of a new development strategy for the poultry processing and egg sectors.  The membership of the forum was representative of all sections of the industry, including poultry producers, poultry processors, feeding stuffs manufacturers, egg producers and egg packers.  An <Col N="1020" /> Bord Bia, Forbairt, Teagasc and the Department were also represented.</P>
    <P>The report dealt in a forthright and critical way with the structure of the industry, its strengths and weaknesses, the market environment and development strategy and recommendations.  The weaknesses identified in the poultry meat sector included cost disadvantage, scale of operation and insufficient investment in further processing.</P>
    <P>Regarding the market environment, it was acknowledged that one of the most fundamental changes taking place within the poultry sector is in the area of market liberalisation and the growth of free trade.  It was accepted that the consequence of that liberalisation would be increased import penetration.  Identification of the issues involved led to a development strategy which grouped recommendations under six main headings. These include cost reduction and competitiveness, health status, quality assurance and regulatory authority, marketing, innovation and research development and training.  The issues of cost reduction and competitiveness have to be specifically addressed by the poultry processing industry overall.</P>
    <P>Within the agreed development framework expenditure of £34 million is planned on Forbairt sponsored initiatives in a range of areas across the poultry industry value chain.  Forbairt efforts will focus on the two aims of optimising industry cost effectiveness and greatly enhancing industry innovation.  In the past year Forbairt has actively sought development plans from companies that will meet the agreed development objectives for the overall poultry industry.</P>
    <P>Poultry meat processors in Ireland are commercial companies in competition with one another and with imports.  They are required by market forces to take actions for commercial reasons to protect their markets.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate I am not in a position, in the circumstances, to intervene in the commercial affairs of individual companies nor can I discuss the market development proposals of those companies.</P>
    <P>I advise the company concerned to contact Forbairt to discuss its problems.  Should Deputy O'Hanlon do likewise and bring the problem to its attention Forbairt will listen to him.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.33 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 February 1997.</P>

      <P>Voluntary youth organisations, youth clubs and community youth projects provide valuable opportunities for the social and personal development of our young people.  Youth services operate in the area of non-formal education and I will be continuing my efforts to make these opportunities available to young people in line with the provisions of Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1984, the Costello report identified the need for the establishment of a properly co-ordinated system of formation and development for youth.  In order to facilitate the emergence of a more comprehensive and accessible youth service, a revised policy on youth work was outlined in my Department's White Paper on education, <i>Charting our Education Future</i>.  Furthermore, in line with a commitment given in the <i>Government of Renewal</i> policy document, I have arranged for the preparation of a youth work Bill in order to provide a statutory basis for the development of youth work in this country.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that publication of the legislation is imminent and that this was preceded by wide-ranging consultation with youth work interests.  I envisage that the new structures currently being planned for the youth sector will also facilitate the involvement of local communities, empowering them to play a role in the development of responses to the needs of young people. In addition, the framework provided in the Youth Work Act and particularly the provisions for monitoring and assessment and the provisions for integration, co-ordination and targeting, will help to demonstrate the value for money of youth work.</P>
      <P>I am confident that developments in the youth work area will increase the provision of opportunities for the personal and social development of our young people.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>Last year, two-teacher schools which were due to lose a teacher because of falling enrolments and thus become one-teacher schools were allowed to retain their posts for the 1996-7 school year.  The school to which the Deputy refers was one of the 16 schools which benefited from this concession.</P>
      <P>Final decisions regarding the staffing allocations for primary schools for the 1997-8 school year have not yet been taken.</P>
      <P>In September 1997, this Government will have reduced the pupil teacher ratio in primary schools to 22 to 1 from a level of 25.2 to 1 when I took office as Minister for Education.  The putting in place of a pupil teacher ratio of 22 to 1 will enable me to retain a substantial number of posts to further enhance the quality of primary education through, for example, improving the staffing schedule and providing extra resources to address a range of special needs.  In allocating these posts, the needs of small schools, including each of the schools in question, will be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 23 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>The recent report from the National Economic and Social Forum of &ldquo;<i>Early School Leavers and Youth Unemployment</i>&rdquo; focuses on measures designed to tackle early school leaving and the situation of those who have left early without qualifications.  The report includes recommendations relating to the expansion of the Youthreach and VTOS programmes.</P>
      <P>Following submission to Government of the NESF report, the Government decided to establish an interdepartmental working group to examine the feasibility, implications and costs of implementing the forum's recommendations; to develop a clear framework with explicit targets to deal with the needs of existing school leavers and to reduce the level of early school leaving and to clearly identify the responsibility and accountability of schools, education authorities and other Departments and agencies for the achievement of the targets.</P>
      <P>The group has been established and is representative of the Departments of Social Welfare, Enterprise and Employment, Taoiseach, Justice, Health, Finance, Marine, office of the Tánaiste and FÁS.  It is being chaired by the Department of Education.  The group has commenced its task and is due to make an interim report to Government by 31 March 1997 and a final report by 31 May 1997.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 provides that priority will be given to expanding the places on the Youthreach and VTOS programmes.  With regard to Youthreach, 2,000 places are provided at present in the vocational education committee sector and an expansion of 450 extra places is under way. Approximately 1,500 places are provided by FÁS. There are currently 5,000 approved places on the VTOS programme.  The question of additional places on the Youthreach and VTOS programmes is one of the issues being considered by the interdepartmental working group in the context of its examination of the NESF report.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.  Over 28,000 students benefited under the initiative in 1995-96 at a cost to the Exchequer of £54.5 million in 1996.  The costs associated with the initiative have been offset by the savings from the abolition of regressive covenant tax relief.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to extend the scope of the free fees initiative to include NCEA degrees in designated private third level colleges.  Any extension of the initiative would have to be considered in the light of overall resource constraints.  In this regard, I would point out that tax relief is available at the standard rate on fees paid to private colleges in accordance with the provisions contained in section 6 of the Finance Act, 1995 and section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>All students pursuing courses in institutions which are part of the CAO-CAS system of entry are not in receipt of free fees.  Only students who meet the eligibility criteria and are attending institutions which have been approved for the purposes of the free fees initiative qualify for free fees.</P>

      <P>The Enniscorthy application was one of 14 applications for the recognition of new gaelscoileanna which was examined by my Department in 1996. Nine of these applications were approved. However, a number of applicant schools, including Enniscorthy, could not be given recognition because they were unable to meet the enrolment conditions set down by my Department.  If a school is unable to provide sufficient enrolment on opening, its viability in the future must be in doubt.  Future viability of new schools is particularly relevant at a time of major decline in primary school enrolments.</P>
      <P>However, I have asked my officials to review the Enniscorthy proposal in the context of an undertaking given by me in the House some time ago.</P>
      <P>I should mention also, that the Commission on School Accommodation Needs is at present reviewing the criteria for the recognition of new primary schools and I will be giving careful consideration as to how future applications for recognition should be considered in the light of the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to be precise about the cost implications of the establishment of education boards at this time.  The establishment of the boards will not result in a completely new area of expenditure.  Rather it will involve the reallocation of funding and administrative responsibilities within the education system.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the education boards will take place on a phased basis, with a gradual transfer of functions to the boards within a costed and approved plan prepared by each board and approved by the Minister.  This will facilitate careful appraisal of the incremental costs of the boards in the context of the Education Estimates for the year in question, and within the overall context of the budgetary parameters approved by Government, an education budget which has increased from £1.645 billion to an estimated £2.3 billion since 1992.</P>
      <P>I have not received any consultancy report on this issue.  However, to ensure the smooth transfer of functions to the education boards, and to prepare for the new role of the Department, management consultants have been contracted by my Department to review the present organisational structure of the Department.  As part of their brief, they will also make recommendations regarding the future structure of the Department and the education boards.  This will ensure that no unnecessary expenditure is incurred in the transfer of functions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to appoint additional remedial teachers to primary or second level schools.  Remedial teacher posts are allocated on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's inspectorate. The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to primary schools and 98 remedial teachers to post-primary schools.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place at primary level and 350 at post-primary level.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wide range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage.  I have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
      <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of all schools, including schools in County Clare, will be given every consideration.</P>

      <P>St. Aidan's national school is an amalgamation of the Presentation Convent and CBS national schools in Enniscorthy.</P>
      <P>I have not failed to honour a commitment to carry out refurbishment works at St. Aidan's primary school, Enniscorthy, County Wexford.</P>
      <P>When the two schools amalgamated in 1994 my Department agreed that a programme of refurbishment works would take place.  Since then, £166,000 grant aid has been sanctioned towards an initial schedule of improvements works at the school.  The remaining major improvement works are combined into one project which I included in the 1996 capital programme.  All of the necessary planning work for this project is complete.  I appreciate the urgency of the case but due to budgetary constraints it was not possible to include all deserving projects in the first group of projects which were allowed to proceed to tender recently. The project is among those which will be considered for phased release to tender later in the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pupils and students with disabilities have access to a wide range of special support services which are tailored to meet the variety of special needs which can present.</P>
      <P>In many instances, pupils at primary and second level with special needs are capable of being catered for in the ordinary school setting with the help, where necessary, of remedial teachers, resource teachers or visiting teachers.  In more serious cases, the needs of the pupils may be such that placement in a special school or special class attached to an ordinary school, is the most appropriate response.  A wide range of such facilities is available.  Each such facility enjoys a significantly reduced pupil teacher ratio and has access to special additional capitation funding. My Department makes every effort to ensure that no person with a disability is denied access to an adequate education service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have targeted significantly increased resources on services for children with special needs.  I have allocated an additional 241 remedial <Col N="1036" /> teachers and 39 resource teachers to the primary sector.  There is now a total of 1,188 remedial teachers and 46 resource teachers in place in primary schools.  I have also sanctioned the appointment of additional teachers to the visiting teachers service.  At second level, there are 350 ex-quota remedial teachers and 131 resource teachers in place.</P>
    <P>I have reduced the pupil-teacher ratio in all special schools and special classes and I have substantially increased the rate of special capitation funding payable in respect of children attending such facilities.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Education, &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo;, sets out the Government's policy for the provision of suitable education services for pupils with a disability.  A fundamental objective of the White Paper is to ensure to the maximum possible extent that all persons with disabilities will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own area and within the ordinary school system.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the third level sector is that, following on the report on Access and Participation of Students with Disabilities in Higher Education, the Higher Education Authority provided £290,000 in 1996 in targeted funding for special initiatives being undertaken by the universities to cater for disabled students.  These initiatives include access programmes, student liaison projects, counselling services and braille and sign language services.</P>
    <P>I have also established a special fund of over £100,000 per annum to assist students with physical disabilities.  Students can apply for assistance either by way of special equipment such as voice activated computers, braille computer printers, laptop computers, radio aids or services such as interpreters, personal care assistants, transport and extra tuition.</P>
    <P>The needs of disabled students are taken into account in the design of all new buildings and improvements to existing buildings.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures which I have already taken, coupled with the strategy for development outlined in the White Paper, will ensure that all persons with a disability will have access to a range of services which will enable them to reach their full potential in the education system.</P>

      <P>There are no statistics on the number of second-level schools which do not have library, canteen or physical education facilities.  Physical education facilities in second level schools include indoor PE halls, outdoor hard play areas such as basketball and tennis courts and playing fields. <Col N="1037" /> Virtually all schools have at least one element of these facilities.  Libraries and PE halls are provided in all new schools as a standard part of the schedule of accommodation.  Canteen facilities are provided as an integral part of the provision for the general purpose area.  Where schools do not have these facilities, they are provided as resources permit.  However, the provision of essential classroom accommodation must continue to be the first priority.</P>
      <P>Prefabricated buildings are generally provided to cater for a short-term increase in enrolment which would not warrant permanent accommodation or in a situation where a school is due to be replaced through rationalisation and the provision of permanent accommodation would be wasteful of scarce resources.  The Department does not have precise information on the proportion of pupils accommodated in prefabricated buildings.  The proportion is in any event one that changes constantly.</P>

      <P>There are three post-primary schools catering for pupils in the Naas catchment area.  These are the convent secondary school, the CBS and the vocational school.</P>
      <P>The indications are that the three schools have, between them, sufficient pupil places to accommodate all pupils, including those from Caragh, seeking second level places for next September. The difficulty would appear to be that some pupils are unable to gain a place in the school of first choice.</P>
      <P>The current policy in relation to centres in which there are a number of schools, as in Naas, is to ensure that these schools can, between them, cater for all pupils from the catchment area seeking second level places.  This may result in pupils not getting a place in the school of first choice. My Department must ensure, however, that existing accommodation is fully utilised before providing additional accommodation.</P>
      <P>A building project has been approved for the convent school and this project is at tender stage. This is to enable the school to cater adequately for its current enrolment and, when completed, will not significantly alter the level of intake places available each year in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CBS has applied for a permanent extension to the school.  This application is currently under examination in the planning section of my Department.

Account will also be taken of the new housing developments in the area.</P>

      <P>Special schools and special classes cater for children aged four to 18 years with a mental disability. Pupils who attend such facilities normally complete their education at the end of the school year following their eighteenth birthday.  In exceptional circumstances, my Department is prepared to consider a one year extension for such children where it is felt that significant educational progress will be made as a result of a pupil attending school for an additional year.  I have no plans to specify a minimum number of years schooling for these pupils.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that my Department grant aids the provision of tuition in recognised vocational training centres which operate under the Department of Health and which are designed to cater for the needs of young adults with a mental disability.  These vocational training centres provide training programmes which include a continuation of the general and special education received by pupils in special schools and special classes.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides funding for a full-time instructor for a vocational training centre in Cork which caters for young adults with a severe or profound mental handicap.  I am satisfied that the arrangements currently in place offer a satisfactory response to the education needs of young persons with mental disability following completion of their period in special schools or classes.</P>

In accordance with standard practice, recognition of the unit was given on a trial basis for a period of six years. There are 150 pupils enrolled in the unit this year.</P>
      <P>The all-Irish unit is resourced, in respect of accommodation, funding, and staffing, through the vocational education committee, in the same way as the mainstream vocational schools.  Funding in respect of day-to-day operating expenses incurred by the unit is provided from the annual block-grant paid by my Department to the committee for its county scheme.  Within the limits of the overall grant, the level of funding allocated to individual schools and units is at the discretion of the committee. The overall staffing allocation to the Ballincollig unit includes one additional post on an ex-quota basis, to take account of the needs of unit.</P>

      <P>The pay and conditions for instruction staff in the Youthreach sector were established when the programme was established on a pilot basis in 1989.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 6.37 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> provided for a review of the staffing arrangements for the Youthreach programme. In accordance with this provision, and following agreement with the Teachers' Union of Ireland, a consultant was engaged to review the staffing structure of the programme.  The consultant's report was submitted in April 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations on pay and conditions for Youthreach commenced between my Department and the union representing instruction staff in the programme.  Facilitation and arbitration under the terms of the Government/ICTU PCW statement of 15 May 1996 was offered to the union in November 1996.  The union referred the matter to the central review committee of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> for the determination on the question of the applicability to Youthreach of the terms of the &ldquo;Chairman's Minute concerning New Companies or Newly Organised Employees in Employments where no unionisation already exists.&rdquo;  This matter has now been resolved and the Teachers' Union of Ireland has agreed the revised terms of reference for the facilitation and arbitration process which was offered to the union on 14 February 1997.  In effect, my Department has confirmed to the Teachers' Union of Ireland that it is prepared to enter further negotiations with the aid of a facilitator, if necessary, in an attempt to reach agreement on as many issues as possible.  My Department is also prepared to refer any outstanding <Col N="1041" /> issues for adjudication to the Public Service Arbitration Board operating on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>My Department is fully committed to reaching an amicable solution to the issues involved in this matter and thereby recognise the contribution which the youthreach instruction staff make to enabling the educationally disadvantaged participants in the programme to enhance their prospects in the labour market.</P>

      <P>I recently launched an important new initiative aimed at &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  This initiative seeks to discriminate positively in favour of schools in selected urban and rural areas which have high concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the education system because of their socio-econnomic backgrounds.  Under the initiative, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 33 selected urban schools and 123 selected rural schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>FÁS is the statutory authority which has the responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, to provide for training to meet the needs of companies &mdash; enterprises in the Irish construction industry.</P>
      <P>As part of its remit it provides courses or secures the provision of courses for the training of persons employed or intending to be employed in skilled or semi-skilled occupations in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>My Department is represented on the board of FÁS and on its statutory industrial training committee which deals with all aspects of training issues relevant to, <i>inter alia</i>, the construction industry.</P>
      <P>As part of the new standards based apprenticeship system the recruitment of apprentices is a matter in the first instance for employers.</P>
      <P>The White Paper &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo; outlines the Government's commitment to the importance of links between education and the economy.</P>
      <P>In so far as links between business and second level schools are concerned, I welcome the contribution which the business and education links programme run by IBEC in association with AIB is making to the development of a co-ordinated and structured approach between business and second level schools.  My Department will cooperate fully with IBEC in promoting the programme, which in its first year of operation established 60 links between IBEC members firms and second level schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a comprehensive national qualifications framework is one of the important considerations which will underpin the future organisational development of vocational education and training, and adult and continuing education. Teastas, the Irish national certification authority, which has recently furnished its first report, will provide a structure for the formal involvement of business and the social partners and will ensure that the needs of business industry <Col N="1043" /> for skilled personnel are met, in particular through improved links between these sectors and the providers of education and training.</P>
    <P>In relation to third level, the White Paper again underpins the importance of the putting in place, by institutions, of arrangements for co-operation with business, building on existing best practice. The relevant legislation for the technological sector recognises the role of the colleges in promoting economic and social development and allows for business representation of the governing bodies. The Universities Bill underlines a key object of the universities as that of supporting economic and social development and provides for business representation on the governing bodies.</P>

      <P>The White Paper &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo; states that &ldquo;Third level institutions will be encouraged to provide special arrangements for students with disabilities.  These will build on existing good practice and relevant research.  The Higher Education authority will pursue a supportive and monitoring role and will actively encourage the development of such special arrangements in all institutions&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The report of the committee on access and participation of students with disabilities in higher education, which was established by the Higher Education Authority, recommended that there should be full integration of persons with disability in the higher education system and that appropriate funding provisions be put in place to support this policy.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority invited proposals from the universities in relation to the recommendations of the report on access and participation of students with disabilities and £290,000 was provided last year in targeted funding for special initiatives to cater for the disabled. These initiatives include access programmes, student liaison projects, counselling services and braille and sign language services.</P>

      <P>The fundamental policy objective of promoting equality of access to, participation in and benefit from higher education was outlined in the White Paper on Education, &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo;.  The White Paper recognises the need for a holistic approach to promote equality rather than policies focused only on the third level sector and on the transition from second to third level.  In this regard, I have introduced a wide range of initiatives throughout our education system, such as the introduction of the Early Start Pre-School Programme, the introduction of the Breaking the Cycle initiative at first-level, targeting of resources at first and second level in disadvantaged areas, the provision of educational support services for first and second level students including psychological and guidance services, career guidance and remedial teachers, the continuing development of the home-school links programme at second-level, a major restructuring of the senior cycle curricula to adapt them to the needs of the wider spread of ability levels and backgrounds proceeding to senior cycle, and the introduction of alternative pathways for students to progress to post-second level education and training.  As regards measures specifically targeted at third level, the White Paper identified a number of initiatives, namely:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each third level institution will be encouraged to develop links with designated second level schools, building upon existing good practice. <Col N="1045" /> Institutions will also be encouraged to develop appropriate arrangements to help students make the transition to full-time third level education.  The Higher Education Authority, in consultation with third level institutions, will be asked to advise on the most appropriate and effective means of achieving an annual increase in participation of 500 students from lower socio-economic groups in third level over the next five years.</P>
    <P>Proposals specifically relating to disadvantaged students have been received from the university sector by the Higher Education Authority and £260,000 has been provided for initiatives in a number of colleges which should result in an increased intake of disadvantaged students in 1997-98.  These initiatives build on existing programmes and involve links with second level schools.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the free fees initiative and the third level student support schemes facilitate students with limited means who wish to progress to third level.  I believe the abolition of undergraduate fees, in particular, will have very important material and psychological effects in encouraging greater equality in access to third level education.</P>

These fees fall within the day to day operational arrangements in the institutions and it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister for Education, to seek to interfere in this area.

    <P>In 1994, I announced the allocation of a sum of £150,000 for a pilot escort scheme.  All applications for support under this scheme were carefully considered by my Department.

      <P>The White Paper on Education, &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo;, sets out the Government's policy for the provision of suitable education services for pupils with a disability, in either special educational facilities or in an integrated environment.</P>
      <P>The fundamental objective of the commitment in the White Paper is to ensure to the maximum possible extent that all children with disabilities will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own area and within the ordinary school system.  The degree to which integration can be achieved will depend on the specific and evolving capacities of the individual children concerned.</P>
      <P>The special educational needs of pupils with a physical or mental disability are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system with the assistance, where necessary of a remedial, resource or visiting teacher for the handicapped.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy on the number of students with physical disabilities attending mainstream primary and second level schools is not readily avbilable within my Department.</P>
      <P>In the primary education sector, 38 per cent of all schools have building access for disabled pupils.  Statistics are not available at second level.</P>
      <P>All new schools grant-aided by the Department of Education are provided with access facilities and special toilets to cater for disabled students. In the architectural design of emergency evacuation routes, account is also taken on the requirements of students with disabilities.  New schools with two stories or more are provided with lifts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> Existing schools which make application for grant-aid towards the provision of access facilities for students with disabilities are given consideration in the light of the available capital funds.</P>
    <P>A scheme of grants was introduced in 1995 towards the purchase by second level schools of equipment for use of pupils with certain disabilities which make ordinary communication through speech and-or writing impossible for them.</P>

      <P>Statistics produced by the Health Research Board on the areas of residence of persons receiving treatment for drug misuse in 1995 and the views expressed by statutory, voluntary and community organisations working with drug misusers suggest that drug misuse is closely associated with social and economic disadvantage, characterised by high levels of unemployment, poor living conditions, low educational attainment, family breakdown and a lack of recreational facilities and other supports.  The areas where the task forces are being established in Dublin correspond directly with those areas designated, on the basis of objective criteria, as being economically and social disadvantaged under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-99.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the following VAT rates apply to the supply of goods and services in relation to dairy equipment: supply of equipment, 21 per cent; supply and installation of equipment regarded as fixtures (e.g. milking parlour equipment), 12.5 per cent; supply and installation of equipment not regarded as fixtures, 21 per cent; repair and installation, in all instances, of dairy equipment, 12.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>The rate of tax applying to certain services normally charged at the 12.5 per cent rate of VAT depends on the two-thirds rule.  Section 10 (8) (a) of the VAT Act, 1972, as amended refers.  This provides that a transaction is liable for VAT as a sale of goods at the 21 per cent rate and not as a service at the 12.5 per cent rate if the value of the goods (that is their cost, excluding VAT, to the service contractor) exceeds two-thirds of the total charge to the customer.</P>
      <P>The above outlines the VAT rates that apply in relation to dairy equipment.  There should not be inconsistency in the VAT application based on where service work is carried out.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has information relating to such inconsistency, perhaps he would send it to the VAT Administration Branch, Office of the Revenue Commissioners at Dublin Castle, for investigation.</P>

      <P>Capital acquisitions tax (CAT) is due whenever a person receives a gift or an inheritance, subject to certain exemptions and reliefs.  The amount of tax, if any, <Col N="1052" /> which would be payable upon inheritance depends on a number of factors including the relationship between the disponer and the beneficiary, whether the beneficiary had received gifts or inheritances since 2 June 1982 and whether any specific relief would apply.</P>
      <P>The threshold amount before CAT is liable for a niece or nephew is £24,740 for the calendar year 1997.  There is an additional relief for gifts and inheritances of farm-business assets taken by a nephew or niece who has been working full-time on the farm or business for the period of five years prior to the date of transfer.  In this situation the favourite nephew or niece can avail of the Class I threshold of £185,550 for the calendar year 1997.</P>
      <P>The rate of CAT on inheritances is nil up to the threshold amount, 20 per cent on the next £10,000, 30 per cent on the next £30,000, and 40 per cent on the balance.  CAT on gifts is at three-quarters of the rate of CAT on inheritances.</P>
      <P>Where the beneficiary has received previous gifts and inheritances since 2 June 1982, the value of these benefits is added to the value of the current benefit when determining the CAT liability. This is known as aggregation.  In such cases, the CAT-free threshold applicable to each gift or inheritance is calculated, and the highest one is used.  Any CAT that is referable to the previous gifts or inheritances is taken into account, to arrive at the CAT that is due on the current benefit.</P>
      <P>Finally, by virtue of Business Relief and Agricultural Relief, the value of qualifying assets may be reduced for CAT purposes by 90 per cent.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>The scheme to compensate persons who have contracted hepatitis C from the use of human immunoglobulin anti-D, whole blood or blood products was formally established in December 1995 and is administered by a tribunal.  It commenced hearings in January 1996 and regular hearings commenced in March 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 3 of the Appropriation Act, 1995 a special account was established to be used to <Col N="1053" /> pay awards, on an <i>ex-gratia</i> basis, made by the tribunal under the scheme and to pay the costs of administering the scheme.  On 13 December 1995 the Dáil approved the payment of £60 million to the special account.</P>
    <P>The compensation tribunal has received 1,664 applications of which 1,512 are primary claimants, 86 are dependants and 6 are carers.  267 cases have been heard to date and a further 123 have been listed for hearing up to 31 July 1997.  A further 376 cases are ready for listing.</P>
    <P>In the 267 cases heard to date, the tribunal has made 169 lump sum awards and 96 provisional awards.  Two claims were disallowed.  The total amount of the awards made to date is approximately £30 million excluding legal costs and expenses.  The awards have ranged from £15,200 to £332,756, the average award being £113,000.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to providing whatever resources are required to enable the tribunal to carry out its functions and for the payment of all awards made by the tribunal.</P>

In November 1996, I amended Clause 5(i) of the compensation scheme to allow that the period for consideration of an award by a claimant be extended until one month after the report of the tribunal of inquiry is published, or one month after the date or receiving notice of the award, whichever shall occur later.</P>
      <P>Of the 99 awards made since 24 October 1996, 26 are still under consideration by the claimants. The compensation tribunal is not in a position to state how many of these claimants are awaiting the outcome of the tribunal of inquiry before making a decision in relation to accepting or rejecting their award.</P>
      <P>The number of cases heard by the compensation tribunal each month since it commenced in January 1996 is as follows:</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The National Blood Screening Programme commenced in February 1994 to screen for hepatitis C all women who had received the anti-D product, their children and partners.  The targeted lookback programme, commenced in October 1994 to identify persons who may have been infected with hepatitis C as a result of transfusion, by tracing the past donations of donors identified with hepatitis C infection.  The optional screening programme commenced in September 1995 to ensure that all recipients of blood transfusions and blood products who might possibly have become infected with hepatitis C through the receipt of transfusions or blood products were given the option of being tested free of charge.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy will be aware the home help plays a most important role in the care of the dependent elderly.  As Minister for Health I am extremely conscious of the excellent work carried out by the home helps themselves and the mainly voluntary groups which organise the service on behalf of the health board.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Eastern Health Board have carried out an internal review of the home help service in the board's area and that a report has been produced.  The board has identified a number of issues in this report and have made recommendations <i>vis-à-vis</i> the development of the service over the next few years.  I understand that the Eastern Health Board are setting up a broad based group which will include representatives of the voluntary groups and home help organisers to consider the findings and recommendation contained in the review.</P>
      <P>In response to previous questions in this House I stated that the Department in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards has under active consideration a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within the health boards for the provision of this service.</P>
      <P>A discussion document submitted by the chief executive officers group formed the basis for this examination of the home help services.  Following on from these discussions, my Department decided to have an examination of the operation of the home help services carried out by an independent body which will advise on how the services can be developed in a cost effective way in tandem with the other community based services. Following receipt of tenders for this review, the contract has been awarded and the work will commence shortly.  It is expected that the review will be completed before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I understand that evidence available to An tArd-Chláraitheoir indicates that these domiciliary requirements have not been met and accordingly the birth in question may not be entered in the register.  The applicant has been informed why his application cannot be approved.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The provision of orthodontic services to persons in the Dublin area and the maintenance of waiting lists is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Eastern Health Board that patients are placed on the orthodontic waiting list by a clinical dental surgeon in their local area in the first instance.  They are placed on this waiting list with a view to getting an assessment appointment at a later date with an orthodontist. In the intervening period, movement of teeth may increase or decrease the need for orthodontic treatment.  For this reason, it would not be possible to place patients on a definitive waiting list at their initial screening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996 the board appointed a consultant orthodontist and established a regional orthodontic department at St. James's Hospital.  Orthodontic practitioners and support staff were recruited and under the supervision of the consultant <Col N="1062" /> orthodontist have eliminated the waiting list for category 1.</P>
    <P>As a result of the increased service provision and a review of the waiting lists by the consultant to determine eligibility for orthodontic treatment the waiting time for category 2 patients and the waiting list numbers have been considerably reduced.  A review of persons in category 3 is due to commence shortly to determine eligibility for orthodontic treatment.</P>
    <P>I understand from the board that the patient in question was placed on the board's orthodontic waiting list for further assessment in June 1992. He had an appointment for assessment on 21 October 1996 at the board's regional orthodontic department in St. James's Hospital.  At this assessment it was established that his orthodontic problem does not fulfil the criteria regarding priority for orthodontic treatment through the public dental services.</P>
    <P>On this basis the board regrets that it was necessary to discharge this patient from the waiting list.</P>

      <P>The provision of services to persons with a mental handicap in the County Galway area is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, additional funding of £12 million has been provided in 1997 for services to persons with a mental handicap.  £2 million is being used to meet identified needs in existing services.  The remaining £10 million is being used to put in place new services, including additional residential places and day care services.</P>
      <P>Details of the precise services to be put in place in each health board region and the individuals who will benefit from these services will be agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees in line with the priority needs which have been identified for each region.

      <P>Determination of amounts to be paid into the proposed equalisation fund was made following consideration of each local authority's income from rate support grant and domestic water and sewerage charges, together with details of each licensing authority's motor tax income.  Data from recent years were examined using a guiding principle that local authorities should retain the maximum amounts possible of motor tax income collected by them.  Various percentage retention rates were considered.  The retention rate of 80 per cent of motor tax income from cars and motor cycles was the optimum proportion to follow this principle.  At the same time, I had to be conscious of the need to ensure sufficient resources in the equalisation fund to make good the rate support grant and domestic water and sewerage charges income foregone by all local authorities and also to share our equitably the buoyancy inherent in the new system.</P>

      <P>Article 7 of these regulations requires rented accommodation to contain an appliance or appliances capable of providing adequate space heating and defines the term appliance as including an open fireplace. Since 1994, it has been the policy that all new local authority housing should be provided with full central heating.  In relation to accommodation provided before then, heating by means of a fireplace, central heating or other appliance was provided. All local authority dwellings should therefore comply with the regulations in this regard and I do not consider a special allocation to be required.</P>

      <P>The treatment plant in Dingle is designed to cater for a population equivalent of 8,000, which includes a significant provision for pretreated effluent from the fish processing industry.  Pre-treatment is a condition of the current discharge licence for the fish processing industry concerned who have been given until September 1997 to comply with this condition.  It would not be appropriate, nor was it ever part of the design, for the treatment plant to cater for untreated effluent from the industry at the current levels of discharge.</P>

      <P>The new funding arrangements for local government which I announced on 19 December last involve replacing the rate support grant with the proceeds of motor taxation.  Therefore, the question of deductions of the type mentioned will not arise in the future.  The position of town commissioners under the new funding arrangements is being considered in the context of the forthcoming legislation on the subject.</P>

With the commencement of those regulations, the powers vested in the Garda Commissioner to make by-laws and temporary rules under sections 89 and 90 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 will cease.  The regulations under section 35 will include a provision for restrictions on the parking of large vehicles.  The new traffic signs regulations will provide for the adoption of a traffic sign appropriate to the proposed restriction.  In the context of the imminent introduction of the new regulations, the making of temporary rules by the Garda Síochána would not be appropriate.</P>

Chomh maith leis sin, ní féidir seirbhís iompair scoile a bhunú ach amháin nuair a bhíonn go leor mac léinn cáilithe ina gcónaí i gcomharsanacht ar leith.

Is féidir cead taistil ar sheirbhís iompair atá bunaithe cheana féin, a thabhairt ar bhonn fabhair agus ar tháille do mhic léinn nach bhfuil cáilithe.  Ní mór spás dóibh a bheith ar fáil ar an bhfeithicil, sa bhreis ar spás do na mic léinn cáilithe go léir, agus ní foláir nach mbeadh aon chostas breise ar an Stát.

      <P>Scoil Phapain Naofa was established with provisional recognition from my Department in September 1993.  In line with standard practice, the period of provisional recognition was provided so that the school could clearly demonstrate its development potential over a number of years.</P>
      <P>A thorough review of Scoil Phapain Naofa's enrolment pattern and development potential has been completed by my Department and the position is that, in its fourth year of operation, the school's total enrolment is only in the region of 20 pupils.  In the circumstances, my Department concluded that Scoil Phapain has not developed into a viable school and that it is unlikely to do so in the future.  I have decided, in the circumstances, to withdraw recognition and grants from the school with effect from the end of the current school year.  The school will continue to receive grant-aid from my Department up to that point.</P>
      <P>The review referred to above also concluded that three gaelscoileanna in the Ballymun-Santry area not required and, accordingly, I do not intend to reverse my decision in relation to Scoil Phapain.</P>
      <P>My Department is prepared to assist in making alternative educational arrangements for the pupils in the school.  The teacher has been advised also of the panel options open to her, with a view to obtaining a post in another school.</P>

      <P>Since I took office, I have increased substantially each year the number of trainee teachers admitted to the colleges of education for primary <Col N="1090" /> teachers.  The intake for September 1996 was 500, and in early 1997 a further 150 places were provided in a special 18 months post-graduate teaching training course.</P>
      <P>On a general basis, the intake of trainee primary teachers to the colleges of education is closely allied to movements in the pupil-teacher ratio, the number of teachers retiring or otherwise leaving the teaching profession, and the number of teachers taking career breaks.  Projections for a number of these variables are not yet available.</P>
      <P>When these projections have been finalised, decisions will be made on the number of trainee teachers to be admitted to the colleges of education in September 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in responding to the Deputy arose from the fact that my Department was pursuing detailed inquiries with the individual centres in relation to the matters raised.  The three young offender facilities to which the Deputy refers are reformatory schools.  Such facilities generally cater for children in the 14-15 age group at the time of committal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under current legislation, children sentenced to detention in reformatory schools are committed for periods of between two and four years. Any such children who subsequently reoffend are generally over the age limit for placement in the young offender facilities operated under the Department of Education and would be dealt with under the adult prison system.  Inquiries with the Department of Justice indicate that data is not readily available on the number of persons referred to the adult prison system who have previously <Col N="1091" /> been detained in young offender centres. Children under 14 years of age, who have been convicted and sentenced to a period of detention, are normally placed in one of the two industrial schools operated under the Department of Education. Some such children do reoffend following their release from the industrial schools and receive further custodial sentences.  Of the 46 children currently on detention in the reformatory schools to which the Deputy refers, 11 have previously been placed on detention in industrial schools.</P>
    <P>I should point out that many cases of reoffending by children do not result in the imposition of custodial sentences by the courts and would not, therefore, come to the attention of my Department or the young offender centres.</P>
    <P>A study conducted in 1989-1990 into the incidence of reoffending by former inmates of Trinity House School who had left the school in the previous two years, indicated a reoffending rate of 75 per cent.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the incident referred to by the Deputy took place between 10 p.m. on 15 February 1997 and 10 a.m. the following morning.  I understand that the premises was burgled and that several windows were damaged in the process.  The Garda authorities have informed me that their investigation into this incident is ongoing.  However, to date no person has been made amenable for the crime, nor has the stolen property been recovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The detailed deployment of Garda resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities. They have informed me that there are four official vehicles allocated to Greystones Garda station consisting of one marked patrol car, one unmarked patrol car, one community policing vehicle and one motor cycle.  In addition to this, mobile patrols in the sub-district are augmented, as required, by the divisional crime task force unit based at Shankhill, the divisional drugs unit based on Dún Laoghaire and by the district drugs unit based at Bray.  The Garda authorities have informed me that they are satisfied that the current allocation of vehicles to Greystones Garda station is adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area.  However, the situation <Col N="1096" /> will be kept under continuous review and adjustments will be made as necessary.</P>

      <P>The CORI part-time job opportunities programme is a three year pilot programme which was scheduled to end in June 1997. Given that there will be wind down issues and that some individual projects did not start on time it will be end September before the project is completely finished.  Funding is being made available in 1997 which will allow for the pilot programme to be completed.</P>
      <P>An evaluation of the pilot programme has just been completed, and I am now considering the consultant's findings and whether there are any elements of the pilot programme which could be absorbed into mainstream programmes.</P>

      <P>There have been extensive contacts between the person referred to and my Department in relation to animal health difficulties.  My Department has offered to undertake a programme, to be carried out by its veterinary laboratory service under which it will test livestock on the farm at regular intervals; in addition, it <Col N="1100" /> will undertake, free of charge to the farmer in question, pathological testing at the Regional Veterinary Laboratory in Cork of material from the farm which may be submitted by the farmer or his veterinary surgeon.  Consideration of any more extensive investigation would be contingent on the completion by the farmer in question of certain farm improvements which have been indicated as necessary by a study jointly carried out by the VLS and Teagasc in 1996 and which have been advised to him.  It is considered that the results of any such investigation would be prejudiced and its scientific worth devalued if such works are not first carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of the ewe premium scheme in any year is determined by the average prices paid in the EU market for that year.  During 1996, both the EU and Irish market prices for lamb were at record levels from March onwards, due to buoyant consumer demand.  Irish lamb producers who sold their lambs in 1996, benefited from prices about 21 per cent better than those available in the previous year.  The premium is related to market returns and so in a year of good prices the amount paid is lower than that available when the market is poor.  The significantly improved market returns in 1996 had a consequential benefit on the income of sheep producers.</P>

      <P>As outlined in my reply to the Deputy on 13 February 1997 the number of brucellosis herd restrictions has increased significantly in the past year.  At the end of 1996, some <Col N="1101" /> 313 herds were restricted including some herds which had had two or more clear tests but which had not been derestricted under national legislation. This compares with 189 herds restricted at the end of 1995.  In 1996 174 herds were depopulated due to brucellosis.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on reactor grants, income supplement payments and depopulation grants under the brucellosis eradication scheme was some £1.57 million higher in 1996 than in 1995, an increase of 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>Discussions on the actions to be taken to redress the deteriorating situation are currently taking place with representatives of the farming bodies and the veterinary groups and I hope to be in a position to finalise proposals in the near future.</P>

      <P>Under the revised disease eradication arrangements which were introduced from 1 April 1996 following agreement with the representative farming bodies, herdowners are generally responsible for arranging and paying their veterinary practitioners in respect of first herd tests each year.  However, in the case of brucellosis the Department will pay for all contiguous tests in 1997 even if such tests are the first tests in the herds.  With some exceptions the Department meets all subsequent herd testing costs including costs of any contiguous tests.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the fact that farmers would henceforth meet the cost of a significant part of the testing programme, the disease levies were reduced by about two-thirds from 1 April 1996.</P>

      <P>Aer Rianta's basic charges to airlines at Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports have remained unchanged since April 1987.  The company introduced discounts in these charges with effect from 1 January 1994, with the objective of stimulating traffic growth on existing and new routes.  Similar discount schemes have been put in place on an annual basis since 1994.  An important element of the new 1997 scheme is its rolling five year nature which will assist airlines in their route development planning.</P>

    <P>I am satisfied that the current charges regime <Col N="1102" /> will contribute towards keeping access costs into and out of Ireland for tourists and others to the minimum and will help to underpin tourism employment and economic growth generally.</P>

      <P>The salmon management task force report recommended a package of measures designed to secure and augment salmon stocks and regulations have been recently introduced which complete the first phase of implementation of new <Col N="1104" /> management strategies for salmon.  They include legalising the use of monofilament netting in the drift net fishery and increasing the permitted maximum depth of net mesh from 30 to 45 meshes deep.</P>
      <P>The 30 year ban on the use of monofilament has been widely acknowledged as counter-productive in many respects and on balance the task force concluded that the conservation objectives would be better served by putting the emphasis on fishing effort rather than the type of gear used.</P>
      <P>The relaxation of the law on monofilament should be seen in the context of the restrictions being introduced on the drift net fishery, including: postponement of the opening date to 1 June in all districts; limiting of the fishery to four days a week instead of five; restriction of drift netting to day only fishing; and ban on fishing outside six mile limit from baselines.</P>
      <P>The new regime taken in its totality will make for more effective conservation and enforcement and will significantly increase the escapement potential of salmon stocks.  The package of conservation measures represents a <i>de facto</i> reduction of almost 50 per cent in the drift net season and over 50 per cent reduction in the sea area.  The measures, as a package, are critical to halting and reversing salmon stock declines.</P>

      <P>The practice has been for members of the Government to accept relatively inexpensive gifts to mark occasions such as visits, official openings, etc. and not to accept expensive gifts.  It has not been the practice to describe items presented. However, I can assure the House that I did not receive items in the period in question which would be in excess of the threshold set in the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.</P>

      <P>A new national strategy on fishing vessel safety is currently being finalised in the Department of the Marine.  I hope to shortly be in a position to announce details of the measures to be taken to implement this new policy which will draw on the recommendations and objectives of the review group.  The proposed new strategy will aim to achieve fundamental improvements in the safety culture and standards of the sea fishing sector with the objective of avoiding, as far as possible, fishing vessel accidents and especially the loss of life at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a number of the review group's recommendations are already being implemented, particularly in relation to training, safety awareness and on-shore radio-communications. I was pleased to see that my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, recently <Col N="1106" /> announced that share fishermen will, in future, qualify for full PRSI.  The absence of mandatory social insurance cover for fishermen was identified by the review group as the cause of many trained deckhands leaving the fishing fleet.</P>

      <Col N="1108" /> Grant-aid approval &mdash; national and EU of £824,000, supporting a total investment of £1.8 million has been given for aquaculture and fishing fleet projects in County Clare under the Operational Programme for Fisheries up to the end of 1996.  Funding over the forward years of the operational programme will continue to be available for eligible fisheries projects right around the coast, including County Clare.</P>
    <P>Grant-aid of approximately £75,000 was provided by my Department towards the construction of a berthing wall-pier at Doonbeg, County Clare in 1996.  I have no plans at present for additional investment in port infrastructure in County Clare in 1997.</P>
