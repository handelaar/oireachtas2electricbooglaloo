      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics.  I propose to deal with these two topics separately and I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  In regard to the first topic, I have received notice from Deputy Martin. I now call on the Deputy to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister for Education the reason she has ignored the submission made by Cork Regional Technical College to be upgraded to the status of an institute of technology in view of the internationally high standards of excellence achieved by the college across a wide range of disciplines since its establishment; if she will award such a status to Cork Regional Technical College immediately; and if she will review the status of all third level institutions in the sector on a planned and rational basis.</P>

      <P>In regard to the second topic I have received notice from Deputy Seamus Brennan.  I now call on the Deputy to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the enormous disruption caused to thousands of commuters by today's action by CIÉ workers; the plans of the Minister for Transport, Energy and <Col N="886" /> Communications to meet the unions, given CIÉ management's proposals for change in the company are now in disarray; and the urgent necessity for the Minister to address the Government's failure to bring forward clear policy initiatives and a stated development plan for CIÉ and the transport sector.  I say this at the risk of the Minister calling me names.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take the Report from the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on the European Parliament Elections Bill, 1996; No. 16 &mdash; European Parliament Elections Bill, 1996 &mdash; Order for Report and Report Stage; and No. 17 &mdash; Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance, which shall be taken on the conclusion of Questions to members of the Government.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the sitting shall not be suspended at 1.30 p.m. today; the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. today and the motion for the General Financial Resolution shall be moved not later than 12 midnight whereon business shall then be interrupted and the Dáil shall adjourn forthwith; the Report Stage of No. 16 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be adjourned at 2 p.m.; following the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance and the statements by the main spokespersons of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party, the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes; and there will be no Private Members' Business this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are five matters to put before the House.  Is the proposal that the sitting shall not be suspended at 1.30 p.m. today satisfactory?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed?  Agreed.  Are the arrangements for dealing with No. 16 satisfactory?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for the suspension of the sitting following the Budget Statement satisfactory?  Agreed.  Is the proposal that there will be no Private Members' Business this week agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach arrange for statements to be made to the House by the relevant Ministers regarding the industrial disputes in the transport and nursing areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider that request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach outline the legislation the Government intends to bring forward <Col N="887" /> as a matter of priority between now and the time he declares a general election?  On this first day of the new session is the Taoiseach in a position to give an absolute guarantee that whatever priorities he sets will be passed into legislation this session?  As a matter of interest, perhaps the Taoiseach will tell the House the number of days in this particular session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government legislative programme has been or is in the process of being circulated to Deputies.  It sets out the legislation we intend to advance in this session, the next session, the session thereafter and so forth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <P>Is he a permanent dictator?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the investigation into the Dunnes Stores payments affair has made such little progress, will the Government consider bringing forward a motion to establish a tribunal of inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if the Deputy dealt with that matter another way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Government deal with it another way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is eight weeks since this matter came to public attention and it is not unreasonable to ask this question on the first day of the new session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That inquiry is ongoing at this stage.  It is not the case that any Member has sufficient information to make a statement of the type made by the Deputy.  When the report from Mr. Justice Buchanan is available it will be furnished to the appropriate committee of the House which will then institute inquiries into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say how long that might take?  Does he have any idea when it will happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I cannot do so because only Mr. Justice Buchanan can determine the length of time he requires for the task he has been given.  The committee will in turn determine the length of time it requires to perform its functions.  Neither will be acting at the direction of the Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A proposal will be made to the House tomorrow in relation to the setting up of the Lowry/Dunnes Stores committee.  For example, it is proposed that the quorum will be three of five members.  Has the Government examined this proposal?  Will it be proposed tomorrow?  There is some doubt whether it is a <Col N="888" /> good idea to have only three people attending a meeting or if it would be preferable if all members were present during all the committee's deliberations.  If some members are missing from time to time, it could be open to subsequent legal challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's points.  I understand the proposal has been put forward by official sources in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The most appropriate course of action for the Government to take is a discussion between the Whips, and I understand the Government Whip will initiate a discussion on the matter.  The Deputy will have an opportunity to raise his concerns at that level.  When the matter returns to the House there can be public discussion if it is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A High Court ruling yesterday will have severe implications for sports clubs throughout the country.  Does the Government intend to introduce legislation to improve the position for sports clubs which has been worsened by the High Court decision yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be dealt with another way.  There should not be circumvention of the business at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early to state whether legislation is necessary to remedy problems which may have arisen for clubs as a result of the <Col N="889" /> judgment, which must be studied.  However, it may be that non-statutory solutions are the best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Taoiseach plan to bring forward legislation to overcome the administrative errors which have occurred regarding the three months notice period under the Family Law Act?  Approximately 50 marriages are in limbo. Will the legislation be introduced as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of that promised legislation, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Equality and Law Reform are aware that, for nine months, I had reservations about the difficulties which would arise in this area.  I ask the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to ensure all the difficulties which could arise under the legislation are addressed.  I draw the Minister's attention to the point that if the legislation is not enacted before 5 April, many couples who married since 1 August may find they are not entitled to the normal married persons' tax allowances and benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised by Deputy Shatter are of such a detailed nature that they would probably best be pursued by means of a parliamentary question.  As I said, it is the Government's intention to remedy the problems which have been identified.</P>

      <P>Can the Taoiseach state whether the Government intends to introduce legislation regarding special areas of conservation before the habitats directive is signed in February by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht? It is important that both Houses have an opportunity to discuss the implications of the directive before it is signed.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Education announced the upgrading of Waterford Regional Technical College to institute of technology status, a decision of which everybody in Waterford is proud, but legislation is required to implement this decision.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Central Returning Officer&rsquo; means a person who is appointed by the Minister under section 17 to be the Central Returning Officer for the purposes of this Act;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the amendments were thoroughly discussed in select committee.  I want to again press on the Minister amendment No. 1 and related amendments.  If the Minister is not willing, as he indicated on Committee Stage, to exclude the Clerk of the Dáil from the legislation, perhaps he would consider amending the Bill in the manner I suggested by substituting &ldquo;Central Returning <Col N="893" /> Officer&rdquo; for &ldquo;Clerk of the Dáil&rdquo;.  If the Minister accepts this amendment, all he need do under section 17 is declare that the Central Returning Officer for the time being shall be the Clerk of the Dáil, and the effect of the proposed legislation will be the same.  I press this amendment on the Minister because of reservations I outlined on Committee Stage regarding the Clerk of the Dáil having to undertake this work.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and the Department, seem set on having the Clerk of the Dáil as the Returning Officer and my amendment would allow the Minister to nominate the Clerk of the Dáil as the Central Returning Officer.  It would also allow the Minister to appoint somebody else as the Central Returning Officer in the future if what I fear comes to pass.  The Minister has discussed this with me.  He should consider changing the Bill in the way I suggest.  If some future Minister needed to change this he could do so by regulation without recourse to law.  I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>These 27 amendments seek to retain the present position of Chief Returning Officer which the Bill proposes to drop by assigning the functions to the Clerk of the Dáil.  These functions consist of making a return of persons elected to the Parliament and the storage and disposing of election documents.  These amendments were discussed on Committee Stage, during which Deputy Dempsey indicated there were three main reasons for the amendments.</P>
      <P>The first was the storage of documents.  Storage of documents by the Clerk of the Dáil is not new. He stores documents from Dáil general elections and by-elections for six months and he therefore has to have space available.  As the timing of general elections and by-elections is not fixed and they can occur at short notice, the space is there. Storage of European Parliament election documents for six months will not be a very difficult task especially as the six months period will be known well in advance, unlike Dáil general elections and by-elections.</P>
      <P>The second reason was the hidden administrative burden.  The Deputy is overstating the case here.  We are talking about the receipt of four notifications of election results and the issue of a letter to the European Parliament once every five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third reason was access to non-confidential documents.  I will not delay the House as it is covered by amendment No. 4.  My amendment No. 9 proposes to meet the concerns expressed on Committee Stage.  I am still opposed to these amendments because there is no sense in having two different officers notifying the Parliament of who has been elected to represent this country in the European Parliament.  The Clerk of the Dáil already communicates with the Parliament in relation to the filling of causal vacancies, a role he is ideally located to discharge in view of the potential residual role of the Dáil in this area.  It would therefore be preferable for him to take on <Col N="894" /> the task of making a return to the Parliament of the persons elected at the election proper.  I oppose the Deputy's amendments.</P>

      <P>I accept that in amendment No. 9 the Minister of State has gone some way to meeting my concerns, but maybe he has not got the drift of what I am proposing.  I do not propose to have two different officers doing this.  I accept that the Department is determined that the Clerk of the Dáil should do this work but I suggest, instead of writing it into legislation that it must be the Clerk of the Dáil, that the person deemed to be the Central Returning Officer be appointed under section 17.  I accept what the Minister of State wants and what the Department is apparently hell-bent on getting.  I ask that the hands of future Ministers not be tied should they want to change that.  The Minister of State might consider this again.  I accept he is talking about the Clerk of the Dáil and that under section 17 it will be said that the Minister will make the regulation declaring the Clerk of the Dáil the Central Returning Officer.  I recognise that the Clerk of the Dáil will be the returning officer but future Ministers should have a chance of changing that by regulation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) All documents sent by a local returning officer or a returning officer in pursuance of this Act to the Clerk of the Dáil, other than documents referred to in subsection (2), shall be open to public inspection at such time and under such conditions as may be specified by the Clerk.  The Clerk shall supply copies of or extracts from the said documents to any person demanding the same, on payment of such fees not exceeding the reasonable cost of copying and subject to such conditions as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 20 provides that after an election, confidential papers such as ballot papers can be inspected only on foot of a High Court order. However, the section is silent on access to non-confidential documents such as nomination papers. The point was made on Committee Stage that some regulation on access to non-confidential documents is desirable in order to avoid disrupting the normal work of the Clerk of the Dáil and his staff.  I undertook to review this matter and, if appropriate, to table an amendment on Report Stage.  This amendment proposes to regulate access to non-confidential documents after an election by providing, in section 20, for public inspection under conditions laid down by the Clerk of the Dáil.  The amendment also provides that copies of election documents may be supplied to interested persons on payment of the reasonable cost of copying.  The amendment is similar to a provision in the Dáil electoral code which has worked very satisfactorily as far as I am aware.  Under the Bill, the Clerk of the Dáil must destroy all election documents six months after polling day.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 27, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) A person to whom paragraph (4) applies may include in the nomination paper the name of any political group formed in accordance with the rules of procedure of the Parliament of which he or she is a member, provided that, at the time the nomination paper is delivered to the returning officer, a certificate (in this Schedule referred to as a &lsquo;certificate of European political affiliation&rsquo;) is <Col N="896" /> also produced to the returning officer, being a certificate signed by a member of the Secretariat of the relevant political group that the person in question is a member of the political group formed in accordance with the rules of procedure and of the Parliament and named in the certificate.  Where such a certificate is produced, the returning officer, provided he or she is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in relation to the candidate, shall cause a statement of the name of such political group, in addition, where appropriate, to the expression &lsquo;Non-Party&rsquo;, to be specified in relation to the candidate on all the ballot paper and on notices.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These amendments are identical to amendments tabled on Committee Stage which I undertook to review.  I have considered the matter and am satisfied the amendments are desirable to ensure equality of treatment on the ballot paper for all MEPs and parties represented in the outgoing Parliament.  These amendments will enable a non-party candidate who is a sitting MEP to include on ballot papers a reference to the European political group of which he or she is a member. This facility is already enjoyed by party candidates. I emphasise we are talking about political groups formed by MEPs and functioning solely within the parliament, not about European political parties.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies in committee felt the amendments should be extended to enable non-party candidates who are not sitting MEPs to specify the parliamentary group they intend to join, if elected.  I do not agree.  It is one thing for a sitting MEP to inform the electorate of an existing political affiliation which is beyond dispute, that is membership of a political group within the outgoing Parliament.  It is a different matter for non-party candidates to inform the electorate of the political group they plan to join if elected.  We can legislate only for facts, not for intentions.  I am satisfied the amendments I propose will not give rise to difficulties in the case of non-party candidates who are not sitting MEPs.</P>
    <P>The general treatment on ballot papers of non-party candidates at all elections is due for discussion by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  This will give Deputies an opportunity to consider all aspects of this issue.  I assure the House that any recommendations Deputies make will be considered carefully for inclusion in all the electoral codes.  Amendments Nos. 27, 46, 47 and 51 are consequential technical amendments to the substantive amendment.  I ask the House to accept them.</P>

      <P>The Minister considered these amendments after issues had been raised on Committee Stage and has come back with the same provisions.  In light of the McKenna judgment I put down a marker that this will cause difficulties in the future.  I accept the Minister has taken advice from the Attorney General and has <Col N="897" /> made a reasonable point about a person's intention to form part of a group.  However, I still think somebody who is accepted by a European Parliament group as an independent, prior to an election, cannot have that stated on his ballot paper. I predict here and now that we will have a test case on this matter during one of the European elections but I will not oppose the Minister's amendments.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(b) a ballot paper may include a photograph of each candidate and the form of the ballot paper may be adjusted accordingly,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I announced on Committee Stage this amendment will enable candidates' photographs to be included on ballot papers at European elections on a trial basis.  This issue has been the subject of discussions and representations by public representatives for a number of years and was supported earlier this year by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  Subject to resolving any technical problems the intention is that the candidates' photographs will be included on ballot papers at the 1999 European elections. The Question of including photographs on other election ballot papers will be considered in the light of experience at these elections.  I ask the House to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome and support the amendment which states that a ballot paper may include a photograph of each candidate.  Is there a need for a saver in the section?  One does not want to use the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because if the difficulties are not overcome the legislation will have to be amended.  If a candidate decides he or she does not want a photograph on the ballot paper could there be a legal difficulty?

      <P>The point raised by Deputy Dempsey is an interesting one.  We should not put an absolute requirement on any candidate to include a photograph.  The candidate should be given the choice of including a photograph.  That is the minimum freedom that ought to be given to candidates. At the end of the day the only essential <Col N="898" /> detail that needs to be put on the ballot paper is the name and the party or in the case of Euro elections it is reasonable to include the grouping. If we go down the road of requiring people to include photographs, they will then be asked to include their ages.  Can one imagine the hilarity if we were to include our confirmation photographs, or a photograph at an age of about 25 when in fact we are much older.  This could be a whole lot of nonsense and the best we can do is to allow the option to include a photograph.  For that reason I would not agree with the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; leaves our options open and that is the wording I would support.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5) The local returning officer shall, where practicable, give public notice of all polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than the eighth day before polling day.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to make voting easier for people with disabilities and the follow on from the provisions in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1996.  The first amendment provides that where practicable, the local returning officer must give advance public notice of polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users.  This should increase the take up of the existing facility whereby wheelchair users who cannot gain access to their local polling stations can apply to vote at another accessible polling station.  A similar provision in relation to public notice of inaccessible polling stations is included in the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I undertook to review the <Col N="899" /> other two amendments.  They require local returning officers and returning officers to ensure that the places they appoint for verifying ballot paper accounts and counting votes are accessible to wheelchair users.  The view was expressed in committee that it should be mandatory in all cases to appoint centres which are accessible to wheelchair users.  I will do this in the case of count centres in the four Euro constituencies.  However, we must retain some flexibility in the verification of ballot papers which takes place at 34 centres. In the case of amendment No. 23, the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; are included to ensure the verification of ballot paper counts can proceed in cases where a building accessible to wheelchair users is not available.  This should be the exception. This is similar to the provision in the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1996, which provides for similar flexibility in relation to count centres in the 41 Dáil constituencies.  I ask the House to accept these amendments.</P>

      <P>I have a difficulty with the inclusion of the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; in amendment No. 23. I do not wish to delay the debate and will accept this wording, but I ask the Minister to confirm that returning officers will be instructed to secure centres to which people can gain access.  The provision under which returning officers must give public notice of polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users is an improvement and I welcome it.  I commend the Minister for taking on board the suggestion that count centres must be accessible to wheelchair users.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these amendments and have no hesitation in supporting them.  In my constituency some polling stations are inaccessible, even to able-bodied persons.  It seems from past experience that returning officers do not go out of their way to be consumer friendly in terms of selecting polling stations.  The need for polling stations to be accessible must be brought to the attention of returning officers.  When elections are held during the winter it can be very difficult for senior citizens to gain access to some polling stations.  The provisions as they relate to wheelchair users should be extended to cover ordinary voters so that voting is made more accessible.  I commend the Minister on tabling these amendments which have the support of my party.</P>

Like Deputy Quill, I do not understand why the residents of a housing estate should have to cast their votes in a polling station three miles down the road when there is a polling station <Col N="900" /> across the road from the estate.  This type of bad planning discourages people from voting. Returning officers should be mindful of the need to ensure polling stations are user friendly and are located in areas which are easily accessible.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment which will automatically apply to European elections any regulations made by the Minister with responsibility for Dáil elections providing for facilities such as Braille ballot papers.

      <P>I thank Deputies for their co-operation and constructive approach to this debate.  Even though all their amendments were not accepted, we achieved a fair level of consensus.  The Bill will consolidate and amend existing domestic law relating to the conduct of European Parliament elections and will continue the ongoing programme of electoral law reform.  It is important legislation and should be helpful to elected Members, candidates and members of the public who wish to consult it.  Deputies will agree it is helpful to consolidate the law on a particular matter in one Act so that people do not have to read through several Acts. This worthwhile legislation incorporates a number of important improvements.  I thank the Deputies for their positive contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for political progress rests in the first instance with the two Governments.  We have exercised this responsibility through putting in place agreed procedures and mechanisms for the fair conduct of multi-party talks and the commencement of these talks on 10 June last year.  In addition, we have made constant and unremitting efforts over the past seven months to move these talks into substantive negotiations in the three strands.  The talks represent the best, and probably the only, way of achieving agreement among the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prospects for peace in Northern Ireland depend on all sides exercising their responsibilities. Of course, everybody does not have the same <Col N="903" /> responsibility.  People who kill, or encourage others to kill, bear a greater burden of responsibility for the lack of peace in Northern Ireland than those who passively support violence. Equally, those who passively support the politics of violence have a much higher responsibility for the lack of peace than those who support parties which reject violence.  There is an onus on all democrats to speak and act against violence and sectarianism in all their manifestations.  Violence and sectarianism continue because, regrettably, a minority continue to give them active or passive support.</P>
    <P>The Government is convinced that, provided the will is there on all sides and all are prepared to act responsibly, 1997 can be a year both of peace and of political progress.  For our part, we will continue to do everything in our power, as we have done in the past, to secure these objectives. We will work in close co-operation with all who share, and who are committed to, exclusively peaceful and democratic methods of action.  In particular, we will do everything we can to optimise the prospects for substantive progress in the multi-party talks, including, if possible, in advance of the general election in the United Kingdom.  We continue to work in close contact with Mr. John Hume, with whom I recently had an extensive private meeting.  We support his continuing efforts to obtain an IRA ceasefire.</P>
    <P>On the question of contacts with Sinn Féin, the Government made clear, in response to a request for a meeting from the Sinn Féin leader, immediately after the IRA resumed its campaign by the bombing of Canary Wharf that we wanted the IRA ceasefire to be restored immediately, that the basis for the previous Government meetings with Sinn Féin had been that a total cessation of IRA violence was already in place, that further Ministerial meetings with Sinn Féin must be consistent with this long standing policy and that, notwithstanding the resumed IRA campaign, a meeting at official level could take place on the basis that Sinn Féin would bring forward its ideas on how the ceasefire could be restored at that meeting.  That meeting took place and since then there were a number of official level meetings within that channel of communication.</P>
    <P>During the 11 month period in which these meetings were taking place, the Irish Government secured a fixed date for the opening of all party talks, eminent and independent chairmanship of the talks, agreed rules of procedure to protect the position of minority parties within the talks, Irish Government involvement in face to face discussions in the talks with parties, some of whom had never previously had contact with the Irish Government, the effective removal of the Washington Three precondition, as well as a clear commitment in statements from both Governments that Sinn Féin will be admitted to the talks once it complies with the terms set out publicly.</P>
    <P>Despite all these advances, which were designed, <i>inter alia,</i> to secure an IRA ceasefire, <Col N="904" /> and the meetings which were held at official level with Sinn Féin, we have seen in the interim not an IRA ceasefire but more and more IRA violence which has intensified to the point that at least nine IRA attack attempts, of a major kind, have taken place in the past three weeks.</P>
    <P>IRA violence, more than anything else, has isolated the Nationalist community in the North from all those who wish to help them to achieve parity of esteem.  IRA violence is partitionist. IRA violence has provided a pretext and a context for sectarianism.  IRA violence is an invasion of human rights which, in some Nationalist areas, has substituted arbitrary and unaccountable penalisation by a secret organisation for accountable justice through an open courts system.</P>
    <P>The intensified activity on the part of the IRA, over Christmas and so far this year, makes it difficult to believe that the republican movement is not now deliberately attempting to pursue a parallel ballot box and armalite strategy, which is unacceptable to democrats and which accordingly should not be assisted politically or otherwise by a democratically constituted Government.  The official channel of communication to which I refer can be used whenever the Government receives reliable assurances that an IRA ceasefire is attainable in a genuinely short-term horizon, and that previously identified and realistically attainable things need to be discussed at the meeting, and done, that will achieve that end.  If such assurances are received, meetings can be arranged at very short notice.  The sole purpose of any such meeting would be to end IRA violence, once and for all, and quickly.</P>
    <P>In response to Question No. 5 from Deputy Ahern, I can confirm that all parties to the multi-party talks are indeed required to maintain a strict adherence to the Mitchell Principles.  This is made clear beyond doubt in the 28 February 1996 communiqué, the ground rules paper, and the agreed rules of procedure for the talks.</P>
    <P>I have already reported to the House on my meeting with Prime Minister Major on 9 December last.  I do not believe it is always appropriate or useful to report on every contact with the Prime Minister.  I can however assure the House that this year, as during last year, intensive contact will be maintained at political and official level with Downing Street wherever desirable or necessary.  This is of course additional to contacts already under way with the British authorities, including intensive contacts on a daily basis in the context of the multi-party talks.</P>
    <P>The multi-party talks process, as any political realist could have seen from the outset, is an inherently difficult one.  It was set up to achieve agreement on profoundly divisive questions affecting allegiance between a diverse range of parties, some of whom previously had little or no dialogue with one another.  We need to remind ourselves that the underlying assumption of the peace process has been from the outset that such an agreement, although difficult, is possible.  The concept that such an agreement could be <Col N="905" /> imposed, rather than freely negotiated, is contrary to the basis on which the all-party talks were sought and agreed to.  The Governments do, of course, have a responsibility to give proactive leadership in the talks at appropriate junctures.</P>
    <P>The slow pace of the talks is naturally a matter of regret.  To those in the majority community in Northern Ireland who may be reluctant to move from traditional positions, I would point out that the outcome of the talks has to be approved by the people by means of a referendum.  To the minority community, I would point out that the involvement and endorsement of the Irish Government is contingent on the achievement of an agreement within the three strands which is fair and just to Nationalist aspirations.  Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, so all parties have a specifically designed structure, within which they can make contingent concessions to one another's positions, in the interests of an ultimate overall agreement.  I urge all parties in the talks to do that, so that there can be forward movement and Northern Ireland can enjoy a stable and universally accepted political structure, which is the precondition for all durable economic and social development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that, since the House last met, there has been growing pessimism in regard to the peace process and the overall position in Northern Ireland?  Does he agree this has been caused by the deplorable, irresponsible actions by paramilitary organisations on all sides; the lack of leadership in many of the parties in the talks process some of whom are more concerned with their electoral position and backing than with peace and that in recent weeks the Government appears to have given up endeavouring to break the deadlock?  While the Taoiseach has furnished a long reply, concentrating mainly on events over the past year or so &mdash; with none of which I disagree &mdash; will he inform the House what he is endeavouring to do to reverse the deteriorating position?  My main concern as expressed in Question No. 1 relates to where we are going and what can we do now to try to assist the parties and respective communities to reverse that position.  I am conscious that it is a matter of weeks only before the marching season begins and we await proposals which we hope will be useful in dealing with those marches. I put it to the Taoiseach that, had he been more vigorous in assisting Mr. John Hume in mid December last, in putting his initiative to the British Government &mdash; which merely sought a date for an unequivocal ceasefire &mdash; far more progress could have been made.  Will the Taoiseach say whether he perceived a greater difference at that time than was apparent on the surface, because I am inclined to think there was and I cannot understand why neither Government tried hard to resolve the then position?</P>

That would appear to be a fair balance unless the Taoiseach wants to monopolise Question Time giving Members lectures and history lessons.  Will the Taoiseach inform the House of his efforts to assist John Hume?  I note he said in the course of his reply he had recently had an extensive private meeting with John Hume, the contents of which I do not expect him to divulge.  May I take it from the coded language used in the Taoiseach's reply that the Government has stopped meeting Sinn Féin at official level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with the way the Deputy presented three reasons for people's concern at present, as if they were all more or less on the same level.  He should realise that the reason we have had no peace in Northern Ireland over the past few weeks is that individuals have gone out with guns and bombs to kill or hurt others.  People who do that sort of thing have a responsibility for their own acts.  No amount of complaint about what this Government, that Government or any other Government is or is not doing excuses anybody from the primary and overwhelming responsibility for their own actions.  The people who order young men, and some young women, to go into a children's hospital with guns to assassinate politicians must accept first responsibility for the lack of peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy presented the problem in Northern Ireland by listing three reasons &mdash; lack of leadership in the talks, the Government not doing enough and what Deputy Bertie Ahern rather coyly described as deplorable, irresponsible actions.  I can find stronger words than those to describe the actions of the IRA and of loyalists who attacked a number of people; they are more than deplorable and irresponsible, they are attempts at murder.  However, we must reach a point in discussion about this subject at which we describe acts for what they are and ascribe responsibility as it ought to be ascribed.  As far as the peace process is concerned, I do not believe everybody has the same level of responsibility but I agree we can all do more and must do more not just to stop people shooting others but to deny them any excuse, however distorted in their minds, for the actions they take.  That is why the Government has invested such effort trying to get those talks moving, in trying to find a way around obstacles and moving the talks into threestranded discussions.  That is why I have had intensive frequent high level discussions with Mr. John Hume about the initiatives he is currently taking, and maintain close contact with the British Prime Minister in regard to this matter. However nothing that we do can be seen as taking <Col N="907" /> away from those who order killings or who order mortar attacks, their responsibility for those decisions.</P>
    <P>I have listed in the House all of the things the Government has achieved already which have justified an IRA ceasefire.  We have a fixed date for talks, with Senator Mitchell chairing those talks, we have rules and procedures fair to all, we have removed the Washington 3 condition and this Government is in direct face to face talks with parties in Northern Ireland who previously would not have spoken to us.  All that has been achieved but it has not been good enough for the republican movement.  It is time the republican movement said exactly what it wants.  To my mind any reasonable democrat should be satisfied with what is on offer if looking for agreement with others as distinct from an attempted imposition of one view at the expense of another, which is a recipe for further problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the loyalists' ceasefire has clearly broken down, is the Taoiseach fully satisfied the leadership of the fringe Unionist or loyalist parties are fully committed to the peace process and the Mitchell principles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to that is set out in Article 29 of the rules for the talks. These state that if, during the negotiations a formal representation is made to the independent Chairman that a participant is no longer entitled to participate on the grounds that he or she demonstrably dishonoured the principles of democracy and non-violence, this will be circulated by the Chairman to all participants and will be subject to appropriate action by the Governments, including due regard to the views of the participants.  That is the rule which governs the question raised by the Deputy.  So far a complaint has not been lodged in regard to any party taking part in the talks.  If a complaint is lodged, obviously it will have to be on the basis that the party concerned had demonstrably dishonoured the relevant requirements in regard to non-violence. It is also the case, and worth noting, that the CLMC has not, to my knowledge, taken or announced any decision to abandon their ceasefire or cessation of violence.  It is also the case that the loyalist parties have indicated that they are working hard to maintain the loyalist ceasefire, despite what might appear to be deliberate provocation designed to unhinge that ceasefire by the other paramilitary organisation, the IRA. Obviously, it is a matter of concern that actions have taken place which could be ascribed to organised loyalists.  As of now, the requirements have not been demonstrably dishonoured by the parties concerned but if a complaint is lodged, of course, that can be investigated in accordance with the procedures I have outlined to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach answered my question on the Mitchell principles.  I have no wish to see the loyalists driven from the negotiating table because their presence is essential.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House when he believes we have reached an absurd situation when there have been three loyalist attacks and at least nine republican?  On one side, loyalists are engaged in the argument about who accepts responsibility.  Is it not absurd that one group is at the talks although some of its members are engaged in these actions, while another which offered an unequivocal ceasefire through John Hume has not been allowed into the talks and has been told it must go through other hoops?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach answered my question about mid-December by telling me what happened since 1 January; I have no argument with what happened on that date.  He can use whatever words he likes and I will sign up to them.  Going back to mid December, is it correct that John Hume could get the republican movement to give a commitment to an unequivocal ceasefire provided he got a date and that the difficulty was that the only response he got from the British Government was that there would be several other hoops through which the republican movement would have to go before it got a place at the table?  If that is not correct, will the Taoiseach point out where the differences lie?  Will the Taoiseach outline the present position given that the initiative taken by John Hume before Christmas did not work?  What would be the Taoiseach's view if there was an unequivocal ceasefire now, which unfortunately seems unlikely, or before or after the British general election?  He did not say whether the Government is meeting Sinn Féin at official level as frequently now as it did some months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the last part of the Deputy's question is concerned, I answered that question in some detail in my initial reply.  I indicated the exact position as far as that matter is concerned and I have nothing to add.  As regards the position in December, the Irish Government took the view that a date should be set for Sinn Féin's entry to the talks once a ceasefire had taken place.  Within the period of the ceasefire and the date, the relevant appreciation could be made as to whether the ground rules requirements &mdash; paragraphs 8 and 9 &mdash; were being complied with by not just the ceasefire but by the behaviour following it.  The British Government's view was somewhat different.  It felt there had to be a ceasefire after which it would look at whether the ground rules were being complied with.  It was not willing to set a specific date without a ceasefire and it being allowed a margin for appreciation as regards compliance with the ground rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference was the subject of vigorous discussion between the Governments.  Each Government, however, held its position on the matter, as they are entitled to do.  My view was as I have <Col N="909" /> outlined while the British Government's was different.  I assure the House that the position the Irish Government holds was pursued with the utmost vigour in December with a view to obtaining the relevant ceasefire and Sinn Féin participation.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is clear under the ground rules that if the IRA had called a ceasefire, Sinn Féin would have got into the talks quite soon anyway; there was no question that Sinn Féin would not have got into the talks.  Admittedly, there was the difficulty that it had not been told exactly how many days the discussion about whether it had complied with the ground rules would take. However, there is no doubt in my mind that if it had complied with the ground rules and had called a ceasefire, Sinn Féin would have been in the talks by now.</P>
    <P>I regret the republican movement did not call a ceasefire on that basis.  I appealed for one but there was no response.  While we can analyse these matters as much as we like after the event, there was, and still is, an opportunity for Sinn Féin to take part in the talks if the IRA would call a ceasefire.  That is the first step.  It is obvious from the lessons of 30 years of Irish history &mdash; lessons which have been well learned and are fully understood by the republican movement &mdash; that violence achieves nothing in the context of Northern Ireland.  The republican movement has accepted that analysis.  The inevitable conclusion of such an analysis is that a ceasefire must be called sooner or later, and the sooner the better from everybody's point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <P>I am not sure I agree with the implicit distinction the Deputy is making between Sinn Féin and the IRA.  I think she may be making a mistake.  I would be more inclined to agree with John Hume who said Sinn Féin is the political voice of a movement which has a military voice called the IRA and that it speaks with the same voice when it comes to the politics of our situation.  In terms of the political direction of the movement, we are talking about a single movement which has a political and a military dimension. No party in this House has a combined military and political dimension; we only have a political dimension.</P>

This unitary movement must make up it mind whether it is for peace.  Nobody can do that for it; it is a decision it must make itself.  It must stop projecting its problems, decisions and, more often, indecision on other people's shoulders.  The republican movement, Sinn Féin and the IRA, must make that decision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the ground rules which are referred to in the legislation.  Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules clearly indicate that if the requirements contained therein are met, Sinn Féin can enter the talks.  Sinn Féin knows that and I have repeated it so often in the house that I thought at times the Deputy was getting tired of listening to me say it.  Paragraphs 8 and 9 are quite clear and if they are met, Sinn Féin or any other party is entitled to enter the talks and nobody can stop them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people within the republican movement who might describe themselves as part of the leadership of Sinn Féin who are working for peace.  That is undoubtedly true, although every time we see an IRA attack we must become more sceptical of their effectiveness. Against the background of the things which have been done so that there could be an IRA ceasefire, the fact that we see an intensification of IRA violence must lead to considerable scepticism about either the seriousness or the weight of influence of the people concerned.  That remains to be seen.  It should be left open for us to pursue whatever hope there is.</P>

      <P>From his communications with John Major, does the Taoiseach believe the British Prime Minister will make any further moves with John Hume or anyone else to try to bring about a renewed ceasefire and renewed talks prior to the British general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say but the Deputy's focus on what the British Prime Minister must do to bring about an IRA ceasefire is to some extent placing the emphasis on the wrong place.  It should be on the responsibility of the IRA and the republican movement to stop the killing now. This House should direct its attention to people who claim to be Nationalists like people in this House.  We should try to influence those who claim to have the same creed as us to stop killing in its name.  While I have no doubt there will always be something more than the British Prime Minister or any other British statesman can do, there is no doubt that the primary and overwhelming responsibility for the continuance of IRA violence rests with the IRA itself.  Where previously there were no talks available for Sinn Féin to take part in, there now are.  Where previously there were no ground rules to guarantee the rights of the minority in such talks, there now are.  Where previously some Unionist parties would not talk to Irish Government representatives, they now sit around the same table with us. Sinn Féin can also sit at those talks under the ground rules we have negotiated if the IRA calls a ceasefire.  While I will certainly encourage the British Prime Minister to do anything extra he can in terms of statements to make it easier for the IRA to call a ceasefire, I would not want such a statement to be interpreted as in any way removing from the shoulders of the republican movement the primary and overwhelming responsibility for its own acts and for the current lack of peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach need not worry about anyone misinterpreting that.  This House, regardless of who has been in Government, has spent 25 years renouncing violence and the republican movement.  However, it is worth putting some emphasis on Mr. Major.  The Taoiseach tried in December, supported by this side of the House, to look for an unequivocal ceasefire and to set a date, the result of six months' work by John Hume, supported by the Taoiseach, the Opposition and the Progressive Democrats, and this was rejected by John Major.  When we try to convince the republican movement or the Nationalist people who might support them, what does one say about the British Government which rejects the Irish Government's and Dáil Éireann's proposals?  That is still the position.  I cannot stop the army council but I can urge the Taoiseach to get John Major to clarify where he <Col N="912" /> stands.  If we know that, we can then try to convince at least some republicans of the right thing to do.  We are not at that point because we failed and the Taoiseach failed to convince the British Government only a few weeks ago that, if there were an unequivocal ceasefire, a fixed date would be forthcoming.  It seemed to break up on the basis that we were talking about next Monday, the day the talks were to resume after Christmas, and the British Government was saying behind closed doors that it was not Monday but might be Tuesday.  If the difference was that small, why did we not succeed?  That is why I strongly believe that the Taoiseach should try to encourage John Major to do something useful rather than considering the next general election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Sinn Féin was given a date when it could take part in the talks which was 10 June.  It had months notice of that date.  If the republican movement wanted to take part in the talks, all it had to do was call an IRA ceasefire in good time and participate in the elections as it did and it would then have gone straight into the talks on 10 June.  It should not be put about that the republican movement is not represented in the talks because it never got a date.  It did get one &mdash; 10 June.  When members of the movement turned up, they knew they would not be admitted because the IRA was continuing its campaign of violence and had not reinstated its ceasefire.  The conditions were set out in the ground rules which require a declaration of a ceasefire but also that the conduct of an organisation be consistent with a ceasefire.  It is not sufficient just to declare a ceasefire and to behave otherwise.  We were talking about the loyalists a few moments ago and questions were raised about whether the loyalist parties should be taking part.  The reality is that it is not enough to declare a ceasefire.  One's conduct must also be consistent with it.</P>

      <P>The British Government's view was that it wanted some time to assess whether the reality on the ground matched the declaration. If the republican movement wants Sinn Féin in the talks, it knows it can and will be in the talks within a short time after the declaration of a ceasefire and compliance with the ground rules.  It knows that well.  Any attempt to pretend that, because it has not been given a specific date, although it would be desirable to give them a date, it justifies its continuing killing of people is <Col N="913" /> hair splitting of the most weak-kneed and amoral kind.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell the House, once a ceasefire was declared, what further hoops the British Government would require Sinn Féin and the provisional movement to go through before it would enter into talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, all that is required is that it would comply after the ceasefire with the provisions of the ground rules which means abstaining from violence.  A suggestion was made by the British Prime Minister that there would be bilateral discussions with Sinn Féin and other discussions which would last a short period of time before it entered the talks.  In practice, it would be useful for any party coming into a process midstream to have bilateral briefings before it enters the plenaries.  There is nothing difficult or in the nature of a precondition about arrangements of that nature which are probably common sense in any event and people would seek them.</P>
      <P>The reality is that, since 10 June and long before, Sinn Féin and the IRA have known exactly what they need to do to comply with the ground rules and for Sinn Féin to enter the talks. They need to comply with paragraph eight, a ceasefire, and paragraph nine, conduct consistent with a ceasefire.  That is all.  Once a reasonable brief time has been taken to ensure that paragraph 9 as well as paragraph 8 is being complied with, there will be no delay in Sinn Féin entering the talks if there is an IRA ceasefire.  People should not give credence to the sort of sophistry which is emerging from the republican movement on this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained the situation as far as the difference is concerned.  The difference was this Government took the view that it would be sensible to set a date and in the interim between that date and the ceasefire there would be sufficient time to ensure that paragraph 9 in particular was complied with.  The view of the British Government was that compliance with paragraph 9 would be rendered meaningless by setting a date.  It was mistaken in that view.  The overriding reality is that if the IRA had called a ceasefire before Christmas Sinn Féin would be in the talks by now.  The Deputy knows that as does Sinn Féin and everyone else.  The IRA chose not to announce a ceasefire.</P>

      <P>I hope the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, on behalf of the trade union movement, following consultations, discussions and decisions within the individual unions, will be in a position also to endorse Partnership 2000.  It has a target of holding a national congress on 30 January at which that issue will be decided.  I hope it will realise that in terms of take home pay and gross pay, trade union members are much better off than they were at the outset of the process of partnership. Not only has take home pay improved but there has been a number of other benefits to trade union members, particularly in the past two years, notably the abolition of third level fees, the increase in child benefit and stable low mortgage interest rates, all of which mean that trade union members are appreciably better off under a system of partnership than they might have been in a free for all.</P>

      <P>The industrial issue raised by the Deputy was addressed by me on the occasion of the launch of Partnership 2000 when I indicated that the nursing profession is and has been doing work of a very high standard with commitment and skill in very difficult conditions.  I understand fully the sense of frustration felt by many nurses.  I also understand, however, that all of us, including nurses, have benefited from the fact that during the past ten years there have been rules for settling industrial disputes.  All partnership agreements, including those of which Deputy Ahern claims authorship, contained a &ldquo;no strike&rdquo; clause with a statement that issues in dispute about people's salaries or wages will be settled by conciliation and negotiation and if that does not work, by independent adjudication and that there will not be recourse to strike action.</P>
      <P>Strike action is contrary to Partnership 2000, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the whole concept of social partnership, the basis on which all employees, be they nurses, gardaí or people in the private sector, have been able to enjoy lower interest rates, greater take home pay, no university fees and other advances which have arisen directly from the partnership structure.  It is very important that the rules of that structure, one of which is that issues in dispute are not settled by recourse to strike action, are respected by all.</P>

      <P>The new system of local funding is based on assigning the proceeds of motor taxation to local authorities.  The amount of this taxation collected by the different authorities will vary, in some cases significantly, from the income levels generated by the existing system &mdash; some authorities will collect considerably more and others considerably less.  This requires a transfer of resources to ensure &mdash; as has been stated very clearly in the programme &mdash; that every local authority benefits from the changes.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed equalisation system local authorities will retain 80 per cent of the proceeds of motor tax on non-goods vehicles and contribute all other motor tax revenues to a fund for redistribution.  The resources of the fund will be distributed in the first instance to ensure that the income lost through the abolition of domestic water and sewerage charges and the rate support grant is made good in full to each local authority. The balance remaining will be allocated as equitably as possible among local authorities, having regard to needs and resources.  Work has already commenced in my Department on developing a more finely tuned and comprehensive equalisation mechanism for 1998 and subsequent years. This will be provided for in legislation which will come before the House in the next two months or so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of the form of financing used for local authorities, I agree with the Minister that it should include the principle of equalisation.  The Minister in his reply has not given any further detail than that which was available before Christmas.  Given that local authorities had to make returns before the end of December, will the Minister confirm if calculations have been carried out in the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> Will he also confirm if practically every county will get money from the equalisation fund and, if so, how many counties will be net contributors to that fund?  Is it true that the county councils in Dublin will be the only net contributors to that fund?  Figures from a survey I carried out of eight to ten counties reveal that councils in those counties are of the view that they will get a sum ranging from £1.5 million to £2.5 million from the fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm that the majority of counties and authorities will receive support from the equalisation fund.  I welcome the Deputy's support for the concept of the fund which is largely based on work on health insurance I did previously when the Deputy and I were in Government.  We looked at equalisation funds that operated effectively in the health insurance area.</P>
      <P>A much more constructive way of looking at this is that nobody will be worse off and that every local authority in the country will be better off.  The mechanism that will operate from this year will be that the Minister for Finance will indicate in his Budget Statement the arrangements for rates support grants.  That will tide all local authorities over until such time as we enact the legislation to transfer formally and legally by statute, although it is accruing to them from 1 January, the proceeds of motor tax to local authorities. Eighty per cent of revenue from motor car tax, motor cycle tax and small revenues, such as licence fees and so on, will accrue to local authorities and 20 per cent of that revenue, together with that accruing from commercial vehicle tax, will go into the equalisation fund.  We will have a substantial pool of money in that fund to redistribute. The simple mathematics of this is that the pool will be significantly bigger than the combination of rates support grant and service charges, which are being abolished, so there will be buoyancy. Two important principles to bear in mind are that this will be the first time in the history of the State that local authorities will have ringfenced funding available to them by statute for ever more and, second, it will be one of the most buoyant sources of revenue that we will have.  It is a major achievement for the Government to give to local government that guaranteed source of income buoyancy into the future.</P>
      <P>Interesting statistics I read in a newspaper reveal that in the first ten days of this year there was an 11 per cent increase in registrations over the very buoyancy equivalent period last year. Local authorities will have a good source of income from this day on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important fact to reiterate is that I have told local authorities we will continue to support the very high rate of commitment on the other funds they receive directly from the Department of the Environment in the area of housing for which my colleague, the Minister of State, has responsibility, and road grants.  All Members of the House have recognised and appreciated the <Col N="918" /> historic level of non-national road grants I announced earlier this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in assuming that a formula for the distribution of the equalisation grant has not yet been worked out by the Department? Will the Minister confirm that this year he will ensure no one will be worse off and that in future years it will be the Department's intention that an objective formula will be drafted which will take into account the state of development of the county, local authorities, the population, infrastructural needs and so on?  Will he further confirm that the formula will be reasonably objective in so far as it is possible in such matters in that it will not be distributed at the whim of the Minister in the Department of the Environment where large sums of money could be allocated in one direction to the detriment of others?  Is such a formula in place or being worked on or is it the Minister's intention that it will be in place for 1998?</P>

      <P>Objectivity depends on one's perspective and if one takes anything from anyone objectively, that is a damage.  I confirm largely what the Deputy said.  We started the process this year, but we will not have the detailed analysis of the functions, capacity, population distribution of each local authority that ultimately we will need to have an absolutely crystal clear and fair equalisation. The starting point this year will be to ensure that nobody will lose out and that everybody will be better off.  The second step will be to share out as equitably as possible the benefits of the buoyancy I mentioned.  Then we want to fine tune the criteria the Deputy mentioned.  We have undertaken a survey to get fundamental data on population distribution, infrastructure support required and so on so that we can give a better distribution than the rates support grant, which was a rather crude system, did up to now.</P>
      <P>We can tease this out when I introduce the legislation in about two months' time.  I would see the equalisation fund being administered separately from my Department ultimately and the local authorities being represented on the management of that fund so that its distribution would be clearly objective and not at the whim of a Minister for the Environment or, much more worryingly, a future Minister for Finance, who might see it as a fund to be used lightly.  We must establish it in a way to ensure it is protected from any predatory Minister for Finance, who certainly would not come from this side of the House.  One does not know who might be in power in a decade or so.</P>

      <P>I take it that the question relates to the further investigation now being undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency, following my request in October 1996, into the nature and extent of the groundwater contamination and the need for a hydrogeological survey of the Nenagh area.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Environmental Protection Agency furnished the report on the contamination of the Gortlandroe Well, Nenagh, in September of last year.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Environmental Protection Agency that in relation to the further investigation I required it immediately commenced detailed and comprehensive work which required considerable time and resources and that it is currently evaluating the results and has commenced the preparation of its report.  I understand that the report will be completed and submitted to me during February.  I also understand that Tipperary North Riding County Council and Nenagh Urban District Council co-operated extensively with and assisted the agency in its work and investigations.</P>

      <P>This issue was serious last summer and will remain so until it is clarified.  The Environmental Protection Agency undertook its investigation and prepared an interim report, but it was also due to complete further reports.  From information I received from local sources I understand that the two local authorities concerned were less than co-operative with the Environmental Protection Agency.  My concern and I am sure that of the Minister in this matter is that there is danger of the Environmental Protection Agency, a body which I and the Minister hold in high regard, coming into public disrepute because of non co-operation or slowness to co-operate on the part of the local authorities concerned.  To my knowledge the local authorities were very slow to come forward with the information.</P>

      <P>I strongly share the Deputy's view but I have received no report from the Environmental Protection Agency that there was anything but full co-operation from both local authorities. On publication of the initial report I asked for a full investigation which commenced on 21 October.  This included the commission of special ordnance surveys of the region; research and review of geological and hydrogeological information for the region; preparation of a brief for specialist hydrogeological consultants to report on the ground water of the region generally; a field survey to identify suitable borehole sampling locations within a 20 kilometre grid <Col N="920" /> square centred on Gortlandroe; an international database and literature search on the chemical substance OMCT Siloxane, the substance detected in the water.  The Environmental Protection Agency reviewed all of the metrological data for the region.  There was liaison with Tipperary North Riding County Council and Nenagh Urban District Council on the information in their possession while 20 sampling locations within the 20 kilometre grid were investigated.  The information is now available and the report has been drawn up.  I am not aware of any information required by the Environmental Protection Agency which was not forthcoming.  I look forward to receiving the report which I will make available as it should be a public document.  I understand the Environmental Protection Agency has instigated legal proceedings against Proctor and Gamble and the case will be heard shortly in the District Court.</P>

I understand it is not necessary to complete the case being taken by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Have the recommendations of the preliminary report been implemented?  It recommended that all local authorities should carry out a risk assessment of ground water.  Nenagh Urban District Council was also asked to undertake a chemical tracing study.

I understand these have been carried out.  While the temporary scheme is working well, the Deputy will be glad to know that the Nenagh regional water supply scheme which I decided to fast track at a cost of £11 million will commence next month.  That is a positive and welcome development for the people of the town who suffered last summer.  I have instructed all local authorities to give priority to water supply schemes in close proximity to an industrial process.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if he is in receipt of a recent report by a leading environmental scientist which states the water quality in Lough Corrib is under severe threat from agricultural and sewage pollution; and the action, if any, he will take on foot of the findings of this report.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1502/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Lough Corrib and River Corrib are designated salmonid waters and, accordingly, subject to the monitoring and pollution control requirements of the European Communities <Col N="921" /> (Quality of Salmonid Waters) Regulations, 1988 which give effect to Directive 78/659/EEC.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for water quality in Lough Corrib and implementation of appropriate measures to deal with pollution are primarily for the relevant local authority, Galway County Council, and the Environmental Protection Agency in so far as activities licensable by the agency may be involved.  Extensive statutory powers are available under the Water Pollution Acts, 1977 and 1990, and the Environmental Protection Act, 1992 to support these bodies in their respective roles.</P>
      <P>The recent Environmental Protection Agency report, Water Quality in Ireland 1991-94, indicates that an assessment of water quality in Lough Corrib, based mainly on mid-lake investigations carried out by the Central Fisheries Board, confirmed a continuing trophic status for the lake, compatible with a low probability of pollution or impairment of beneficial uses.  A slight reduction in planktonic algal growth was also recorded, a positive development in relation to water quality.</P>
      <P>I am also aware of the recent report Lough Corrib &mdash; Cause for Concern, and welcome it as a further addition to the body of research available on the lake.  The report, however, is affected by limitations in regard to sampling sites and sampling periods.  These limitations necessarily affect the usefulness of the data and give rise to difficulties with interpretation.  The absence of hydraulic measurements enabling the report to quantify nutrient loads by source, river input or sector compounds these difficulties.  The report does, however, highlight the inadequacies of relying exclusively on mid-lake sampling points and the strong case for conducting a comprehensive assessment of the littoral zone of this important lake system.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives addressing these concerns in relation to the lake water quality assessment and the threat from agricultural sources of pollution, as highlighted in the report, are under way.  Projects commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services include an investigation headed by the Zoology Department of UCG of eutrophication processes in the littoral zones of western lakes, including Lough Corrib. The project involves a detailed study of how lakes respond to nutrients, especially phosphorus inputs into the littoral areas.  One of its main aims is to develop an early warning system which will be capable of detecting subtle, adverse changes in the littoral areas of the lakes.  The projects also include a study by Teagasc-TCD on agricultural soil phosphorus (P) losses to water in Irish catchments. The aim is to develop a model which will predict soil P losses given soil type, soil P level and precipitation amounts so as to facilitate decisions as to whether pollution control resources should be concentrated on control of soil phosphorus levels or control of point source farmyard pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> These studies form part only of the Environmental Protection Agency's ongoing research and monitoring programme for western lakes and water quality generally and the findings will be of benefit to local authorities and the agency in the performance of their water pollution control and management functions.</P>
    <P>A range of actions are being pursued for the improved management and-or reduction of nutrients, including phosphorus, with a view to tackling the problem of lake eutrophication.  These actions include: promotion of the code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution which I launched jointly with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in July 1996; the amendment, in the Waste Management Act, 1996 of the Water Pollution (Amendment) Act, 1990, with which the Deputy will be familiar, allowing local authorities to require farmers to prepare nutrient management plans so as to achieve the correct balance between water quality protection and nutrient requirements for crop production taking account of recommended application rates and nutrients already available in the soil; the launch on 13 December 1996 of revised Teagasc recommended application rates for phosphorus fertilisers for grassland; the extension since 3 September 1996 of the integrated pollution control licensing system under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 to new intensive agricultural activities in the pig and poultry sectors; the imposition by local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency of controls, as appropriate, in respect of phosphorus discharges from industrial activities through the exercise of their statutory licensing control functions; the ongoing implementation by my Department, in conjunction with local authorities, of the major programme of capital investment, entailing estimated expenditure of £1.3 billion by 2005, on upgrading sewage treatment facilities to meet the requirements of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive; the rural environmental protection scheme and the control of farmyard pollution scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry are specifically geared to the adoption of environmentally friendly farm practices and provide grant assistance for necessary investment to support such practices; under Partnership 2000 provision will be made by way of improved capital allowances for a targeted and monitored measure to support investment by farmers in necessary pollution control measures.</P>
    <P>To provide better co-ordination for the above actions and to intensify efforts at protecting the vulnerable water quality of lakes my Department is finalising a lake catchment management strategy. This will aim to encourage an integrated approach to catchment management, based on the co-operation of all economic and other interests involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did.  As a result, the data is not as comprehensive as it might be.  However, there are good points in the report.  It points out that some of the monitoring carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency, which concentrates on mid-lake samplings, is not sufficiently fine tuned to pick up mild contamination of the littoral areas.  The agency is changing its methodology to ensure there is a comprehensive monitoring system.</P>
      <P>I have given a comprehensive list of the range of activities undertaken by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to ensure that increases in mild pollution in waterways will be detected by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The most recently published report on Lough Corrib, that for 1991-94, shows a slight improvement and not a slight deterioration. However, we will not become complacent.  We want to ensure that the REPS, the investment programme in the control of farmyard pollution and the investment programme in sewerage schemes, for which I am responsible, will in a co-ordinated manner stop the eutrification of our lakes.  That will be my priority.</P>

      <P>I am not convinced the Minister has read the O'Sullivan report in detail.  With regard to the location of the dump in Curragh Line, County Galway, is he concerned about the <Col N="924" /> report's remarks on the location of that dump?  If so, what discussions has he had with the municipal authorities in that area?  What discussions has he had with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Teagasc about the efforts that must be made to reduce the amount of agricultural waste seeping into Lough Corrib in greater amounts each year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the location of landfill, the Deputy will be aware, following 18 months of debate on the Waste Management Act, that stringent environmental standards are being put in place with regard to the future management and operation of landfill sites.  The Environmental Protection Agency has been given the responsibility of implementing the legislation and will ensure that landfill sites will be carefully monitored and not have an effect on ground waters.  The Deputy will remember the lengthy debates we had on that issue when discussing the Act.</P>
      <P>In addition, I took the opportunity when drafting the Waste Management Bill to amend previous legislation to enable local authorities to require a nutrient plan to be established for farmers who might potentially impact on water systems such as Lough Corrib.  Galway County Council can require a farmer who might have a potential impact on those waters to produce a nutrient plan which the council can monitor to ensure there will not be inappropriate or overextensive applications of nutrients to land.  I have worked closely with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to dovetail our Departments' schemes in this regard.  We took that initiative last year to ensure the two Departments focus in a co-ordinated way on the western lakes.  The benefits of that are already visible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister requested the Environmental Protection Agency to intensify its monitoring procedures in respect of Lough Corrib? Is the Minister prepared to furnish the House with a report which will demonstrate that an improvement will be effected as a result of the worthwhile study on Lough Corrib carried out by this environmentalist at the request of the Federation of Anglers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report.  Any additional information we receive on vulnerable ecosystems such as those in the western lakes is most important.  We will take careful cognisance of the report and I will require the Environmental Protection Agency to do likewise.  We will possibly make changes in the analysis systems to ensure the shoreline areas are more extensively monitored in addition to relying on mid-lake samplings which, by definition, will be purer than those from the lake's edges.  Much good can come from this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as the catchment strategy is finalised by my Department, it will be published and will no doubt be the subject of debate and questions <Col N="925" /> in the House.  We all have the same objective of ensuring that the high quality of the watercourses of this country is not only maintained but improved in the future.</P>

      <P>The Government's opposition to the NIREX proposal for a rock characterisation facility near Sellafield has been clearly stated to the UK authorities, including the Secretary of State for the Environment, as a result of bilateral contacts at ministerial and official levels, correspondence and, in particular, the presentation made in January 1996 on behalf of the Government by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to the UK public inquiry on the matter.  The Government's concerns, as outlined at this inquiry, centre on the proximity of Sellafield to the Irish Sea, the uncertainties about the geological and hydrogeological nature of the area and doubts about whether the building of a radioactive waste repository near the marine environment is compatible with UK commitments under EU and international law.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has referred copies of the recently available NIREX memorandum to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Geological Survey of Ireland for examination and advice.  The need for a further approach to the UK authorities and the nature of that approach will be determined in the light of these assessments and advice, taking account of the strong case already made by the Government in relation to geological and hydrogeological uncertainties attaching to the NIREX proposal.</P>

It appears that NIREX does not take the public inquiry seriously.  The British environmental agency was not permitted to go before the public inquiry and it has said, off the record, that it opposes this proposal.

      <P>The leaked report is a vindication of the Irish Government's position last year.  The issues we raised about the geology and hydro-geology of the area were the focus of our presentation. The fears we expressed have been raised by the scientists employed by NIREX.  That vindicates not only the stand we took but also the focus we presented to the inquiry.  The Government would be most concerned if NIREX expected rubber stamping of the due process in the United Kingdom.  We are carefully monitoring this.  I raise this issue directly and frequently with the British Secretary of State, John Gummer, to the extent that I think he regards the whole nuclear industry as one of my fixations.  He wrote me a note at one Environment Council meeting asking me particularly to let one meeting pass without raising it as an issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but will he not agree that, if NIREX has signed a £50 million contract for the next stage of the development, this is a rubber-stamping process? As is the case frequently in England this company will go so far down the road with the development and, having spent £200 million, £300 million or £400 million, it will not want to stop the development.  That is our concern and the concern of the people who objected at the oral hearing in England.  If the report in the papers that NIREX has signed a contract for £50 million is true, strong indications must have been given to the company that this is just a rubber-stamping exercise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very concerned if NIREX adopted the attitude that this was a rubber-stamping process.  From my direct contacts over more than two years with Secretary of State Gummer, he is not a person to take for granted on most issues.  If I was an applicant for any licence to him I would expect to get a vigorous assessment.  I hope that is the case in this instance; I certainly will be monitoring it.  The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, which has direct responsiblity for nuclear safety matters, is monitoring this issue and we must wait to see what comes of that.  We have to assume that due process in our neighbouring country will take place.  We cannot at this stage assume that <Col N="927" /> any advance commitments made by a company can presuppose that the application will be rub-ber-stamped. We are monitoring the issue very carefully.  The views of the Irish Government are well known to the British Government.  BNFL recently offered to make a presentation to the committee I chair.  I acknowledged its offer but declined to accept the presentation as we are well aware of all the data in relation to these matters. Our determination to follow through on this issue is clear and whatever avenues internationally are available to us, we will use.</P>

Those comments were reported in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> in November 1991.  Would that be a consideration in dealing with the matter legally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As I said, if there are any legal avenues open to us they will be explored. The Attorney General serves on the committee I chair to ensure that every legal avenue is explored.  We have not ruled out the prospect of taking legal action should a reasonable prospect of of success present itself to us.  It is a matter of grave concern if the memorandum referred to in Deputy Ryan's question, which was prepared by NIREX's director of science and has now become available, suggests there is considerable uncertainty and concern on behalf of the company and its own experts whether the scientific and geological case will be strong enough to meet the safety criteria laid down by the UK authorities.  They are saying that is in doubt and that is a cause of concern for us.  It reinforces the case the Government made directly to the public inquiry, which was an unprecedented step, and we will be pursuing vigorously our efforts to influence the decision of the British Secretary of State.  Hopefully if he rejects the proposal that will be the end of that particular matter.  If not, we will see what other legal channels are available to us to take whatever action necessary to protect the Irish people from this potential threat.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's reply.  Will he agree that the sad reality is that the opposition of the combined parties in this House to the activities of the British nuclear industry has been ignored by the British Government to date?  The Minister indicated that there <Col N="928" /> are not many avenues currently open to him to allow him take the kind of steps that would result in a realistic outcome to stopping the NIREX development and the development at Sellafield generally.  In view of this will the Minister indicate the action the Government believes it can take at European level which seems to be the only real possibility for effective action?  If we could mobilise support among EU member states there might be some hope of stopping the British authorities in what they are supporting and propose to continue to invest in despite the concern of the Irish community as represented through all the political parties elected to this Parliament.</P>

      <P>There are two separate questions. The NIREX underground geological repository for nuclear waste is a stand alone issue.  The other issue is the development of THORP and the ongoing threat posed by the work at Sellafield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Both are to be opposed but the strategy has to be slightly different.  One proposal does not yet have planning permission and we must fight to ensure that it does not get planning permission.  It has gone through the public inquiry phase and is with the Secretary of State.  We have made a strong case as a Government to the public inquiry and we hope account will be taken of it by the Secretary of State in coming to his conclusion. We will continue bilaterally to impress our case upon him; that process is ongoing.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second issue, I read into the record of the House previously a range of initiatives we have taken in opposing the development of Sellafield in particular and British nuclear developments generally because I am also concerned about some of the aging Magnox reactors outside the Sellafield area that pose a potential threat to this country.  Many of them are 25 years old or older and we must work out how they will be decommissioned and what will happen to them afterwards.  I am very concerned that for generations to come they will pose a threat to the Irish people.  I have raised this issue repeatedly at European level, not only within the European Council of Environment Ministers but also at the pan-European conference of all Environment Ministers held in Sofia.  It is interesting to note that at that conference the British Minister joined with the other European Union Ministers in voicing concern about some of the nuclear facilities in the Eastern bloc countries and how they will impact on the rest of Europe, but he did not take kindly to me raising our concerns with the UK authorities in the same forum.  I will continue to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to waste the time of the House talking about our initiatives in relation to the International Maritime Organisation which will greatly strengthen safeguards on the control of transportation of fuels to Sellafield which is of concern to those living on both sides of the Irish <Col N="929" /> Sea.  We took an initiative at the Intergovernmental Conference on strengthening the EURA-TOM Treaty to place greater emphasis on public health and environmental protection as part of the treaty.  We ratified it and other nuclear safety conventions in July last year and have made efforts to ensure all EU member states and the International Atomic Energy Agency does so as soon as possible.  I will not list the other initiatives which I previously mentioned in the House but the Deputy can be assured that every channel and available international fora the Government can use to advance our case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals by Dublin Corporation for the redevelopment of the Ballymun estate are under consideration and a decision will be made and announced as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I have approved the corporation's proposals to accept a tender for works to the roofs of the tower and spine blocks.  This is a necessary shortterm measure as the roofs have reached the end of their serviceable life and need replacement to protect the buildings and their occupants against weather conditions.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State but she did not tell me anything I did not already know.  What is the reason for the delay, given that the Minister met local activists last September? Has the matter gone to Cabinet since?  I presume the Minister and the Minister of State are of one mind on this matter.  Are they not receiving support from their Government partners?  Is Cabinet approval for the matter necessary?  Has it gone to Cabinet yet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy complained the information was not new, but my reply is true. The proposals submitted by the corporation in the middle of October are extensive and involve, in effect, a total redevelopment of the Ballymun estate.  They are also extremely costly, involving approximately £179 million.  In addition, there is a requirement to adopt a more strategic approach to the redevelopment of Ballymun.</P>
      <P>While I understand the Deputy's impatience, many of the problems with which we are dealing arose from an approach in the past which demanded instant solutions.  A famous commentator said that to every difficult problem there is a solution which is simple, neat and wrong.  The Ballymun estate was a simple solution but, with hindsight, it was the wrong solution.  I want to ensure, when work is carried out in Ballymun, that it is comprehensive and deals with the complex problems on the ground.  It is not just a housing problem, although housing is an important element.  We are developing a strategic approach and we must make allowance for proper administration and consultation in addition to funding. It is a complex problem but I assure the Deputy that progress is being made and we are making every effort to ensure that it continues.  The Deputy should appreciate that we are adopting a comprehensive approach which was lacking in the past, creating a tremendously negative knock-on impact in terms of the current problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State did not say whether the matter must go to Cabinet.  I agree it is more than a housing matter but I remind her that much good work is being done locally in terms of building up community activity and involvement.  However, spirit cannot be maintained <Col N="931" /> forever and people are beginning to wonder if they are being strung along or if the matter will work out favourably.  I accept the plans and proposals have changed a number of times in recent years but they involve total or partial demolition.  This basic issue has been under examination for more than two years.  We are not seeking £180 million or any money this year.  Does the Minister realise we are not trying to put a serious strain on his finances this year?  We are seeking approval in principle to allow the corporation to establish its project team and get matters moving. Even if approval was granted today, a house would not be built for two years or more.  Will the Minister grant approval to allow the corporation to proceed?  Must the matter go to or has it reached Cabinet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>Funding must be approved by the Cabinet.  The plan being developed will take a number of years to finalise.  It is a huge project but initial funding must be available for it to commence. It is unsatisfactory for everybody, including public representatives and the local community, to give the go ahead for a project without having resources available to back up the decision.  We must ensure in addition to funding that a well integrated approach is developed which deals with housing and other issues related to it and the general community.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if he is concerned at the number of beaches and coves which do not conform to the standards required for the EU blue flag status; and the plans, if any, he has to improve the situation in a significant manner.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's record on blue flag awards to beaches compares very favourably with the rest of Europe.  Statistics compiled by the Foundation for Environmental Education in <Col N="932" /> Europe &mdash; FEEE &mdash; which operates the scheme, indicate that 50 per cent of Irish beaches were awarded blue flags in 1996 compared to the European average of only 12 per cent.  The next most successful country was Portugal, where 34 per cent of beaches obtained blue flags.</P>
      <P>The criteria for the award of blue flags are determined by FEEE and relate to water quality, facilities for visitors, beach management, including litter control, environmental information and display facilities.  As far as water quality is concerned, FEEE seeks to emphasise and recognise bathing areas achieving standards of excellence, assessed on the basis of guide values for certain parameters contained in the Directive on the Quality of Bathing Water.  These values are up to 20 times more stringent than the mandatory standards set in the directive.</P>
      <P>Applications for blue flags are usually made by local authorities and it is primarily a matter for them to ensure that the criteria for beach management and water quality are satisfied.  Major investment in sewage treatment facilities will support local authorities in making successful applications. In addition, extensive environmental control powers are available to local authorities to deal with activities which may compromise their ability to observe the criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only natural that, because of our isolated location, many of our beaches are unpolluted.  However, 50 per cent of them have not passed the test, although we have the best record in Europe.  Has the Minister any intention of raising the capital allocation to local authorities for sewage treatment plants of the type he mentioned, because this is the cause of the problems which adversely affect our tourism industry? Has the Minister plans to eliminate the pollution that exists at a number of our major holiday resorts and beaches?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifty per cent of our beaches meet the stringent requirements to get a blue flag, but that is not to suggest that the other 50 per cent are polluted.  There are a number of reasons for beaches failing to meet the requirements.  It may be that they do not have sufficient monitoring, that it is not frequent enough, that the facilities for the visitor are inadequate or that there is inadequate display of signage relating to facilities and the local eco systems.  A range of criteria must be met, apart from the pollution criteria.  It is heartening to know that we have the most unpolluted beaches in Europe.  It is also heartening to know that between now and the year 2005 &mdash; the operational date for the waste water directive &mdash; we will be expending £1.3 billion on sewage infrastructure here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also of note, and important for us to recognise, is that no area of the Irish coastal zone has been designated by this Government or the previous Government as less sensitive and requiring only primary treatment.  All the new sewage plant will be to at least secondary or secondary plus standard. <Col N="933" /> This is not the case in the United Kingdom, stretches of whose coastline have been designated as less sensitive.  The investment programme I have indicated means that by the year 2005 we will have the best and cleanest coastal zones in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased with the statistics that the Minister has related.  Is he satisfied that the country as a whole is benefiting sufficiently in the context of tourism from the fact that such a high percentage of our beaches have blue flags?  Regarding the 50 per cent of beaches which were turned down for blue flags, the quality of the bathing water was one of the most important features, particularly on the east coast. Is the Minister satisfied that coastal county councils are doing enough and that the Government and the EU will have the money to provide treatment plants to bring bathing water up to the required standard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that an investment programme of £1.3 billion has been earmarked to bring all our coastal zones up to the standards that will be required in the year 2005 under the European directive.  We are well advanced in investing huge sums of money for sewage treatment and management.   That programme is continuing.  I believe that the very major investment that will be required in Dublin will be forthcoming and that areas like north Dublin can link into the secondary treatment facilities that will be coming on stream so that every citizen, especially those on the east coast, will continue to enjoy very high quality bathing waters and can look forward, as this infrastructure is put in place, to even better quality bathing water in the future.</P>

      <P>The full annual value of the additional amount which I am investing today in our society is, at over £650 million, the biggest in the history of this country.  As a result, for those on PAYE and full PRSI, a married worker with four children earning £210 per week gains over £14 per week; a single worker earning £270 per week gains £8 per week; and a married couple with four children earning £28,000 per annum gains £888 per annum or £74 per month.</P>
      <P>People receiving social welfare payments will get an increase of twice the rate of inflation.  This year we will make real progress towards achieving the targets set by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Small firms and family businesses will get reductions in tax to help them continue the increase in economic growth and in jobs.</P>
      <P>I intend to do this, and more, while at the same time providing for a significant current budget surplus for the first time in our history.  Moreover, the general Government debt ratio will be the lowest since we began calculating this measure back in 1989.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years this Coalition Government, in which I am proud to serve as Finance Minister, has made spectacular progress in developing our economy and combating social inequality while at the same time successfully managing the nation's finances.  In doing so, we have confounded those commentators who said that you cannot achieve social progress and fiscal responsibility at the same time.  In fact, we have and the record is there for all to see.</P>
      <P>Since the end of 1994 employment has grown by over 100,000 or 8.5 per cent to about 1,300,000 &mdash; the highest number of people at work in the history of our State; unemployment has fallen by 31,000 or over 14 per cent; GNP has expanded in real terms by over 14 per cent; the level of investment has risen by about 20 per cent; capitation grants for children in primary school have risen from £20 and £25 to £29 and £34, an increase of between 35 and 40 per cent; tuition at universities and other State-funded third level colleges is now free, with the abolition of fees; the number of households assisted under the social housing scheme has risen from 8,540 in 1994 to 10,020 in 1996; total spending on arts and culture has risen from £23 million to £46 million or by 100 per cent; over 3,000 extra people are employed in delivering improved services in health and education; real consumer spending has grown by almost 10 per cent; exports have risen by over 25 per cent; inflation has averaged about 2 per cent each year; the general Government deficit (GGD) has been reduced from 1.7 per cent to 1 per cent of GDP; and the general Government debt to GDP ratio has fallen from 88 per cent to 73 per cent.  These economic and social statistics tell the facts.  Taken together they represent the most dramatic economic and social development of our society since this State was established just 75 years ago.  Ireland is now a national and international success story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, therefore, at the outset of this budget <Col N="935" /> to pay a special tribute to workers, employers, farmers and businesses for the record breaking performance which they have achieved.  The policies of this Coalition Government have contributed to our collective success.  The lessons of recent years, and indeed of previous Governments, have been confirmed by our collective success. Social partnership works.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the consensus approach to developing and managing our economy is successful. It ensures continued economic growth, real improvements in take home pay, increased numbers at work and better social services for all of our people.  It has produced real results at home and it has caught the admiration of commentators abroad.</P>
    <P>However, we still have major problems of unemployment and poverty in our society.  Long-term unemployment remains unacceptably high. The poverty that it brings limits the hopes and aspirations of too many of our people.  We must improve and deepen our measures to deal with this problem and this budget begins to do that.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Partnership 2000</i>
    </P>
    <P>The social partners and the Government have recently completed negotiations for a new agreement to succeed the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> or PCW.  The new programme, Partnership 2000, aims to build on the success which we have achieved together &mdash; in particular the creation of a dynamic low inflation economy. The primary objective of economic policy under the new programme will be to secure and strengthen the economy's capacity for sustainable employment and economic growth.  This will make it possible to continue to reduce taxes, to raise living standards generally and to generate the resources for improved social inclusion measures while maintaining competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The new partnership is based on acceptance by all its participants of a commitment to a reduction in the tax burden; a commitment to improved social measures to tackle long-term unemployment and social exclusion; moderate wage increases in the context of low inflation, with a strong focus on competitiveness; agreement on the management of the public finances, including a slowdown in the rate of increase in current public spending; and agreement on a firm exchange rate strategy.</P>
    <P>Adherence to these principles will ensure that we can continue to develop our economy upon sound foundations.  Underpinning moderate wage increases and social development through Partnership 2000 is the best way to maintain low inflation over the medium term.  Low inflation and minimising both public sector deficits and the debt burden are essential components of a sound economy.  Their achievement will also ensure that we continue to qualify to participate in the single currency under European economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the ratification of the new <Col N="936" /> programme by all of the social partners.  It will ensure this nation's continued economic and social progress up to the beginning of the next century.  Based upon our experience to date and the real progress that our people, working together, have made during the course of the previous programmes, Partnership 2000 is the best way forward for all of us.</P>
    <P>The budget which I am presenting today is clear evidence of this Government's intention to deliver on its commitments under the new programme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pay and Public Service Change</i>
    </P>
    <P>The pay agreement which forms part of Partnership 2000 provides for increases in the public service in line with those in the private sector, totalling 9.25 per cent over 39 months.  The method of application of the first phase of the pay agreement in the public service will limit costs in 1997 by restricting the increase payable in July next to the first £200 per week.  In addition, payment of the local level negotiations provision of 2 per cent is linked to the achievement of real verifiable progress in the public service programme, Delivering Better Government.</P>
    <P>In 1997 pay increases will add an estimated 5.5 per cent or £265 million to the Exchequer pay and pensions bill.  This is largely due to the public service pay increases under the PCW pay agreement and the need to fund outstanding commitments under the PCW local bargaining arrangements, which the Government intends to honour. These increases and the cost of service improvements, including those I am announcing today, will bring the total pay and pensions bill to approximately £5,150 million.</P>
    <P>This country and all its people &mdash; particularly public service workers &mdash; need a modern, efficient and effective public administration.  The impact of change must be reflected in the development of our public services at both national and local level.  The programme Delivering Better Government sets out a complete range of changes which are designed to improve the performance of the public service, increase value for money and deliver a better service to the citizen as customer.  The commitment in Partnership 2000 to specific action to improve the public service, and the link with the local level negotiations provision, are important steps toward acheiving these objectives.</P>

      <i>Review of 1996</i>
    </P>
    <P>1996 was another very good year for the Irish economy.  The main features were GNP growth was over 6 per cent; employment grew by 50,000; consumer spending increased by 6 per cent; inflation was 1.6 per cent; the GGD was 1 per cent; the current budget had a surplus of £292 million; and the fall of almost £300 million in the national debt in absolute terms, reflecting the relative strength of the Irish pound, was the first time it has been reduced in almost 40 years.</P>

      <i>Budget Targets for 1997</i>
    </P>
    <P>Taking account of departmental balances of £26 million and increased capital receipts of £20 million, the opening EBR for 1997 is £334 million. Having made provision for the measures contained in today's budget, my targets for 1997 are a current budget surplus of £193 million (0.5 per cent of GNP); an Exchequer borrowing requirement of £637 million (1.6 per cent of GNP); and a general Government deficit of 1.5 per cent of GDP.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, this is the first time ever that a Minister for Finance has planned for a significant current budget surplus.  And I am projecting a surplus, not just for one year, 1997, but for 1998 and 1999 as well.</P>
    <P>
      <i>1997 Budget Measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>This budget reaffirms and builds on the main principles of my first two budgets.  As in 1995 and 1996, the measures in this budget will reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity.</P>
    <P>Work continues to be the key to our success as a people and as a society.  It is one of the ways that we fulfil ourselves as individuals and it is the way that we create wealth as a community.  We need to foster and promote enterprise throughout our society in both the public and private sectors. We need to encourage the growth of new companies, consolidate existing firms and ensure that family-run businesses can pass safely from one generation to another.</P>
    <P>In rewarding work and creating wealth through enterprise, we generate the resources to strengthen our country, to provide the services which we all require and so ensure that every individual in our society becomes and remains a valued participant in our community.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REWARDING WORK</P>
    <P>The first of those principles is rewarding work.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to reduce the standard rate of income tax from 27 per cent to 26 per cent with effect from 6 April next.</P>
    <P>The employee PRSI rate for class A and class II contributors is being reduced by 1 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This reduction in social insurance contributions will assist over 70 per cent of PRSI contributors, including those outside the income tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the standard rate income tax band is being widened by £500 for single persons to £9,900 and by £1,000 for married couples to £19,800.  The personal allowance is being increased by £250 to £2,900 per annum for single persons and by £500 to £5,800 per annum for married couples.  An increase of £250 per annum will also apply to widowed, single parent and <Col N="938" /> widowed parent allowances.  The general income tax exemption limits, below which no income tax is payable, are being increased by £100 to £4,000 per annum for single persons and by £200 to £8,000 per annum for those who are married.  It is estimated that these changes will remove around 10,000 persons who would otherwise be in the tax net.</P>
    <P>The withholding tax on professional services and the standard rate for deposit income retention tax will also be reduced from 27 per cent to 26 per cent.</P>
    <P>The thresholds for the payment of the employment and training levy and the health contribution are being raised by £500 to £10,250 per annum, or from £188 to £197 per week.</P>
    <P>Finally, the PRSI ceiling applicable to all employees and the self employed will be increased from £22,300 to £23,200 per annum.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the employee PRSI contribution rate which I have announced today will add significantly to the improvement in takehome pay for most workers.  However, I do not envisage a process of regular reductions in this regard as the Government remains committed to protecting the financial position of the social insurance fund in view of its central role in ensuring that agreed social insurance entitlements are provided into the future.  In that context also, the Department of Social Welfare is commissioning an actuarial review of the projected long-term costs of social welfare pensions.</P>
    <P>The effect of the substantial cuts in personal taxation and employee PRSI which I have announced will be to leave a family with two children and one spouse working who is earning £15,000 per annum and paying full PRSI and PAYE better off by £327 per annum or £6.30 per week.  This is before the effect of the child benefit measures which I will announce later.</P>
    <P>To assist the elderly, the special allowance for those aged 65 and over is being increased by £200 to £400 per annum for single or widowed taxpayers and by £400 to £800 per annum for married couples.  This age allowance, which benefits some 65,000 taxpayers, was last increased in 1986. Some 30,000 other pensioners will also pay less tax as a result of the increase in the income tax exemption limits which I announced earlier.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment in Partnership 2000, the Government will be introducing a provision in the 1997 Finance Bill whereby the first six weeks of disability benefit in any tax year will be disregarded for tax purposes.  However, for the 1997/98 tax year the exemption will be for three weeks while the administrative arrangements are being put in place, with the six week exemption applying from the 1998/99 tax year.</P>
    <P>The special tax relief on unemployment benefit payments to systematic short-time workers introduced in the 1994 Finance Act is being extended for a further year.  The exemption of the first £10 per week of unemployment benefit from tax, introduced in the 1995 Finance Act, will also continue at its current level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> The cost of these income tax and PRSI measures is £232 million in 1997 or £393 million in a full year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PROMOTING ENTERPRISE</P>
    <P>I turn now to my second principle, namely that of promoting enterprise.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Corporation Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>In my last two budgets I have made significant changes to corporation tax, both by lowering the standard rate to 38 per cent and by introducing a new rate of 30 per cent on the first £50,000 of taxable income.  There is a clear longer-term strategic need to reduce the standard rate of corporation tax over time to bring it closer to the 10 per cent rate which applies to manufacturing industry generally.  Accordingly, I propose to reduce the 38 per cent rate of corporation tax to 36 per cent and to reduce the 30 per cent rate to 28 per cent. The taxable income band to which the 28 per cent rate applies will remain at £50,000.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there were nearly 20,000 companies with taxable profits of £50,000 or less, paying tax at the standard rate in 1994.  As a result of this year's budget, and the reductions in my previous two budgets, such companies will now be paying tax at 28 per cent, as compared with 40 per cent in 1994.  This is a real reduction of nearly one third in the tax rate for the small and medium sized Irish companies concerned.  I recognise the important role that they have to play in our growing economy and I am also aware that this is where most of the new jobs have been created within our society.</P>
    <P>The Government is studying the appropriate corporation tax structure for the longer-term, bearing in mind the central importance of the 10 per cent rate for inward investment, including the IFSC.  I am conscious of the need to clarify this issue at an early date and I would hope to be in a position to make an announcement before too long.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employer PRSI</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the case of employer PRSI, the threshold below which the 8.5 per cent rate applies is being increased from £13,000 to £13,500 per annum or from £250 to £260 per week.  The overall ceiling on employer PRSI will rise from £26,800 to £27,900 per annum.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Mariners' PRSI</i>
    </P>
    <P>In order to foster seafaring employment and to develop a pool of maritime expertise in Ireland, the Government will bring forward in the Social Welfare Bill a special concessionary regime involving substantial reductions in the rate of employer PRSI applicable to certain seafarers. An ongoing review of the income tax regime for seafarers is taking place but this review is not yet completed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New and Expanding Businesses</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a further measure to assist small business <Col N="940" /> formation, I will be introducing a provision in the Finance Bill to enable firms to claim certain pretrading expenses in setting up business.  Assistance to firms in such start up situations can be crucial to their survival.  So too is access to capital when firms have reached a certain stage of development.  The Government welcomes, therefore, the proposed establishment by the Irish Stock Exchange of the Developing Companies Market, or DCM.  To help promote its establishment, a number of tax measures will be introduced in the Finance Bill including the extension of BES relief to qualifying firms who obtain a listing on the DCM.  I also propose to increase the investment limit for 10 per cent special portfolio investment accounts by £10,000 which will be targeted specifically at investment in DCM shares for the first three years of its existence.  Full details are set out in the Principal Features.</P>
    <P>These concessions are made in the expectation that the Stock Exchange and its members will set out, and seek to achieve, specific targets for the number and type of firms to be brought to the DCM and will restrict listing fees in the generality of cases to reasonable levels.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rented Residential Accommodation</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have been reviewing the tax rules applying to the providers of rented residential accommodation in order to improve the supply and quality of such accommodation.  As part of this review process, which is not yet fully completed, I have decided to make improvements in the tax rules applying to this sector.  In particular I will be making legislative provision to apply the standard capital allowances in respect of wear and tear on fixtures and fittings to this area.  Full details are contained in the Principal Features.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Gains Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>In line with the reduction in the standared rate of income tax to 26 per cent, it has also been decided to reduce the 27 per cent rate of capital gains tax which applies to certain shareholdings in small and medium-sized companies to 26 per cent with effect from 6 April 1997.  This reduction will also apply to the taxation of life assurance and unit linked investments.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Acquisitions Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the last two years I increased the business relief under capital acquisitions tax from a minimum rate of 25 per cent on certain transfers to a flat 75 per cent for property retained in the business for at least ten years after transfer.  I have decided to increase this 75 per cent rate to 90 per cent in order to reduce the tax impact on the transfer of a family business.  This new rate will also apply to the transfer of agricultural property. The effect of this measure will be to strengthen further small and medium sized companies and ensure their sucessful development from one generation to another.  Early profit taking and other forms of redistribution will continue to be taxed in the normal way.  The new rate therefore <Col N="941" /> will be subject to the existing clawback arrangements to ensure that the ten year requirement applies to the full 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Car Value Threshold</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to increase from £14,000 to£15,000 the car-value threshold used for calculating capital allowances in respect of new cars and allowable expenses for all cars which are used for business purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmer Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>The level of the farmers' flat rate addition, which compensates unregistered farmers for the VAT borne on their inputs, is being increased from 2.8 per cent to 3.3 per cent with effect from 1 March 1997.  This is based on the latest information on the level of VAT paid by unregistered farmers.  There will be a similar increase in the associated VAT rate for livestock which will also increase to 3.3 per cent from the same date.  The cost of this measure in 1997 is £9.3 million and £14.1 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to introduce for a three year period an improved capital allowance for farm pollution control, and to continue for a further period the existing farming stock reliefs and the special stamp duty relief for transfers of assets to young trained farmers.  The details of these reliefs are contained in the Principal Features.  The cost of these measures is estimated at £6.2 million in 1997 and £8.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The cost of all the business measures I have announced today is £27 million in 1997 and £100 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The total impact of the tax changes I have introduced today will be very substantial.  The value obviously will vary for different categories of individuals, depending on their circumstances. Taken together, this is the biggest tax reduction package in the history of the State.  It will benefit the majority of the 1,300,000 people currently at work and it has an annual full year value of over £490 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I turn now to the third principle, namely that of strengthening social solidarity.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Social Welfare and Social Inclusion</i>
      </P>
      <P>One of the major challenges identified in the new programme, Partnership 2000, is the reduction of social inequalities and exclusion, especially by cutting long-term unemployment. To meet this challenge, the Government agreed to commit additional expenditure of up to £525 million over the next three years on an action programme for social inclusion and equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures I am announcing today will not only reflect this committment in regard to social inclusion but will also improve the position of all <Col N="942" /> social welfare beneficiaries and other categories and enhance the work-friendly features of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Weekly Welfare Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am providing for increases of £3 a week in all personal social welfare payments and of £1.50 a week in adult dependant allowances from midJune next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>These increases are about 4 per cent or twice the rate of inflation and reflect substantial progress towards meeting the commitment in Partnership 2000 to implement, before the end of the Partnership, the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. By next June, almost all rates will be at 98 per cent of the Commission on Social Welfare target rate or above it.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Child Benefit</i>
      </P>
      <P>I am continuing the policy pursued in recent years of increasing child benefit rates significantly. In this budget, I am providing for an increase of £1 per month for first and second children, and increase of £5 for third and subsequent children with effect from next September. The new rates will be £30 per month for each of the first two children and £39 for the third and other children.</P>
      <P>A mother with three children will therefore get £99 a month or £23 per week while a mother with four children will get £138 a month or £32 per week tax free for her children compared with £90 per month or just under £21 per week three years ago.  This amounts to a 50 per cent increase which is of direct and real value to mothers and children throughout this country, particularly large families.</P>

      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Family income supplement, which is a support paid to families in low paid employment, has been identified in Partnership 2000 as a priority measure to enhance the reward from work by increasing the net return to families with children.  Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to adjust the way it is calculated from a gross income to a net income basis during the lifetime of the Partnership.  As a first step towards fulfilling this commitment, I am proposing that, from June this year, family income supplement will be calculated on a basis net a PRSI contributions and the health and unemployment levies. In addition, I propose to increase the current income thresholds by £10 per week.  These changes will increase the payments to those currently in receipt of family income supplement by <Col N="943" /> a minimum of £6 per week for most people and will increase the take up of this scheme.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Back to Work Allowance Scheme</i>
      </P>
      <P>As stated in Partnership 2000, the most effective strategy for achieving greater social inclusion is one which focuses on increasing employment. As part of the measures in this budget to fulfil the commitments to combat unemployment under this programme, the Government has decided to increase the numbers on the back to work allowance scheme.  This scheme allows the long-term unemployed to taken up employment or self-employment while retaining a substantial portion of their social welfare payments and associated secondary benefits for up to three years.  Because of the success of this scheme, the Government has decided to provide for an increase in the number of participants from 17,000 to 22,000 in 1997.  Of this increase, 1,000 places will be allocated to people on disability allowance thereby facilitating their integration into mainstream employment.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Adult Dependant Allowance</i>
      </P>
      <P>I now turn to a measure designed to alleviate a particularly severe poverty and unemployment trap.  At present, if the dependent spouse of someone in receipt of a social welfare payment earns more than £60 per week, no adult dependant allowance is payable.  Many such spouses are deterred from seeking employment of a substantial nature or from working additional hours because this would result in a substantial fall in net family income.</P>
      <P>To address the severity of this trap, the Government has decided to introduce a tapering arrangement in regard to the retention of the adult dependant allowance element under certain schemes with effect from next October.  The adult dependant allowance will be retained on a phased basis as the spouse's weekly income increases from £60 to £90.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Miscellaneous Improvements</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the measures I have just announced, I am providing for other improvements in the social welfare system which are targeted at particular groups.  The main changes are as follows: in relation to the carer's allowance, an additional 50 per cent is being paid to persons caring for more than one incapacitated person, while the full-time care requirement is being relaxed to allow attendance at rehabilitation, training and day-care centers on a limited basis; £2 million is being provided for renewing the scheme of grants aimed at improving the security of elderly people; an additional £2 million is being given in grants for community and voluntary service, including increased resources for the National Social Service Board and the Combat Poverty Agency; those in residential care on a part-time basis will be entitled to half-rate disability allowance; in relation to maternity benefit and adoptive benefit, the minimum rate is being increased to £82.30 and both these benefits are being extended to the self-employed; in relation <Col N="944" /> to treatment benefit, the income limit is being abolished and dependent spouses who take up employment are being allowed to retain entitlement until qualified in their own right; in completing the process of equal treatment for social welfare recipients, a widower's non-contributory pension is being introduced and equal treatment in occupational injuries benefit for widowers is being applied; more generous capital assessment provisions in regard to some non-contributory schemes, including old age pension, are being applied; the minimum yearly average social insurance contributions needed to qualify for a <i>pro-rata</i> old age pension is being reduced from 20 to ten provided that the claimant has 260 paid contributions; the qualifying conditions for free electricity and free telephone rental allowance are being streamlined; the rules for payment of arrears on foot of late claims are being eased; and &mdash; I know this is making Deputies sick but please listen to it &mdash; in order to improve the arrangements applying to casual workers, social insurance contributions paid after six months of unemployment onwards will be reckonable for requalification for unemployment benefit.</P>

      </P>
      <P>Last month, the Minister for the Environment announced a radical reform of our local government system.  His proposals, which I strongly supported, include a new system for financing local government.  The new funding system involves the abolition of local authority charges to domestic consumers for water and sewerage facilities. In fairness to those who paid their charges, the local authorities will continue to collect outstanding service charge arrears.  I will make no change in the tax relief for service charges this year.</P>
      <P>The proposals also involve the assignment of motor tax revenue to local authorities, partly offset by the abolition of the rate support grant.  In 1997, there will be transitional arrangements, with part of the motor tax revenue being transferred and a reduction of £98 million in the allocation for the rate support grant in the abridged estimates volume, a provision which was calculated on the basis of the previous funding arrangements.</P>

        <i>Total Cost of Current and Capital Expenditure Measures</i>
      </P>
      <P>The abridged Estimates volume provided for gross current supply spending of £12,874 million this year.  The gross cost in 1997 of the current expenditure increases I have announced is a little under £200 million.  Taking account of these and other changes, in particular the change in the arrangements for funding local authorities, the revised 1997 spending is £12,950 million.  I announced a post-budget target for gross current supply services of £13,014 million when publishing the abridged Estimates volume last month. The principal changes to this figure are an additional £24 million pay costs and the reduction of £98 million in the rate support grant which I referred to earlier.</P>
      <P>The capital measures have a gross cost of about £12.8 million, which is mainly offset by savings. The net impact of the capital adjustments, which are also summarised in the Principal Features, is that 1997 spending is now £2.4 million above the target of £1,574 million which I announced last month.</P>
      <P>I turn now to revenue raising measures.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Tax Changes: Excises</i>
      </P>
      <P>With effect from midnight tonight, I propose to increase petrol and diesel excises by a VAT-inclusive 1.5p per litre for diesel and unleaded petrol, 2p per litre for super-unleaded and 2.5p per litre for leaded petrol.</P>

      <P>I also propose to increase tobacco excises by 7 pence per 20 cigarettes, including VAT, and <i>pro rata</i> for other tobacco products, also from midnight tonight.  This will raise £52 million in 1997 and £57 million in a full year and add an estimated 0.2 per cent to the CPI in 1997, bringing the post-budget CPI forecast to 2.2 per cent.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Environmental Tax Policy</i>
      </P>
      <P>Last year I announced that my Department, in conjunction with other relevant Departments and agencies, would establish a special group to examine the strategic impact of taxation on environmental policy for the 1997 budget.  I have already announced one measure in the farming area for pollution control, while the proposed excise duty increases on petrol and diesel take account of environmental considerations.  The extension of the £1,000 VRT refund scheme for scrapping ten year old cars to 31 December 1997, to which effect was given last month, also has clear environmental advantages.</P>

For that reason I will ask the group to continue its work with a view to a complete examination of possible initiatives which might be taken up in subsequent budgets.</P>

        <i>Residential Property Tax and Stamp Duty</i>

      <P>As with arrears of local authority service charges, the Revenue Commissioners will continue to collect outstanding residential property tax.  At the same time it was announced that, in order to recoup this loss in revenue, the existing 6 per cent stamp duty on transfers of certain residential property valued in excess of £150,000 would be increased to 9 per cent with effect from midnight tonight, subject to certain transitional provisions.</P>

The Financial Resolution provides for a number of intermediate rates to increase the duty from 6 per cent to 9 per cent.  These are 7 per cent for relevant property valued between £150,000 and £160,000 and 8 per cent for property valued between £160,000 and £170,000, with the 9 per cent rate applying thereafter. This stamp duty increase will raise £13.5 million in a full year.</P>

        <i>Dublin Docklands</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I announced the establishment of a task force which would lead to a master plan for the regeneration of the Dublin Docklands.  I am pleased to say that great progress has been made in achieving what I set out to do.  The legislation to establish the new Docklands Authority has passed Second Stage and should be enacted by March.  The preparation of the master plan by the multi-disciplinary team of consultants is on target and will be completed by 31 March.  I intend to facilitate the implementation of the master plan with a range of selective tax reliefs based upon the recommendations which will be set out in the report of the consultants.  This project will transform the heart of Dublin over the next 15 years, <Col N="949" /> providing new jobs, homes and amenities for the next generation of Dubliners.</P>
    <P>
      <i>IFSC</i>

    <P>The International Financial Services Centre will be ten years old this year.  The centre has been a remarkable success by any standards, and I will be including certain measures in this year's Finance Bill to help ensure that it continues to expand and provide more jobs for our young school leavers and graduates well into the next century.  The Custom House Docks Development Authority which has provided the infrastructure for the centre will be subsumed into the new Docklands Authority when it is established.</P>

      <i>Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Valuation Office is a great national resource, providing specialised expertise vital to public administration which has largely gone unrecognised.  This office has endured, for far too long, a completely outdated archaic system dating back 150 years.  Work has been completed on the heads of the Valuation Bill which will totally modernise this valuable agency's operations.  I hope, with Government approval, to publish the Bill later this year.</P>
    <P>I am giving serious consideration to the establishment of an interim board to oversee the transition of the Ordnance Survey to independent status.  A new form of organisation could well strengthen the commercial focus of the survey.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Multi-Annual Budget Projections and Strategy</i>
    </P>
    <P>In last year's budget I announced my intention of moving to a multi-annual budget presentation this year.  This new presentation of the budget allows the Government to examine policy changes on spending and taxation in a more systematic way in the light of their future impact.  As part of this process, I am publishing today for the first&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;time projections for the main economic and budgetary aggregates for 1998 and 1999 as well as for 1997.  These projections are given in <i>Economic Background to the Budget</i> and further details of the budgetary projections are set out in the Principal Features.  They take account of the full year cost of the 1997 budgetary measures announced today.  They also include the cost in 1998 and 1999 of maintaining the existing level of services and take account of the pay, tax and social inclusion commitments envisaged in Partnership 2000, including in particular tax reductions of £1 billion on a full-year cost basis representing real reductions, on average, of over 0.5 per cent of GDP per year and an action programme for social inclusion and equality involving expenditure of £525 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major start has been made in the budget in <Col N="950" /> implementing these Partnership 2000 commitments. In preparing the multi-annual projections for 1998 and 1999, it has of course been necessary to make some working assumptions as to how the balance of these tax and social inclusion measures could be spread over the subsequent two years. The multi-annual projections are based on a forecast that GNP growth will be approximately 5.5 per cent in 1997 and average 4.5 per cent in 1998 and 1999.  It is also projected that employment growth will average approximately 38,000 per year over the three years 1997-99.  Inflation is expected to be moderate at just over 2 per cent per year over the period.  Based on these assumptions, the underlying general Government deficit is projected at 1.2 per cent of GDP in 1998 and 0.9 per cent of GDP in 1999.</P>
    <P>However, recent experience shows that we should budget for the unexpected.  It is prudent, when making plans over several years, to provide a reserve against factors outside the control of the Government that may impact on the budget but which cannot be foreseen at this stage.  Examples are variability in tax buoyancy and exceptional costs across all areas of public expenditure.  While such variations are likely to be both positive and negative, it is appropriate to allow in the projections for a modest negative net impact on the EBR and GGD.  I have, therefore, made a net provision against all budgetary contingencies of £175 million in 1998 and £325 million in 1999. This would increase the projected general Government deficit to 1.5 per cent of GDP in both 1998 and 1999.</P>
    <P>In farming the medium-term target set out in Partnership 2000 of keeping the GGD in 1999 to no more than 1.5 per cent of GDP, the Government was mindful not only of the need to keep the debt-GDP ratio on a progressive downward path, thereby increasing overall budgetary flexibility, but also of two important factors bearing on the future budgetary position:</P>
    <P>(1)  Economic and monetary union, European Monetary Union, which will provide for the single currency, to be known as the euro, will commence on 1 January 1999.  Ireland intends to continue to meet the conditions of entry into European Monetary Union.  We are obliged under the Maastricht Treaty to avoid an &ldquo;excessive deficit&rdquo;.  This was further reinforced with the adoption of the Stability and Growth Pact at the Dublin European Council.  This means that we must make provision in our future budgetary planning to maintain sufficient headroom to deal with the impact of economic shocks without exceeding the 3 per cent ceiling on the deficit.</P>
    <P>(2)  There is uncertainty regarding the level of EU Structural and Cohesion Funding after the current Financial Perspective expires in 1999.  The Government will, in the forthcoming <Col N="951" /> negotiations, argue that Ireland needs continuing substantial support.  We will point to our recent economic progress as evidence of our effective use of EU funds.  However, it is only prudent to recognise that there is no assurance that EU funding will continue indefinitely at present rates.</P>
    <P>Because of factors such as these, the Government has adopted a strategy that will keep our general Government deficit at no more than half of the 3 per cent Maastricht ceiling by 1999.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Expenditure Reviews</i>
    </P>
    <P>Constraining the growth of public expenditure will be central to achieving the Government's medium-term budgetary goals.  To date, we have not been as effective in this area as we would wish.  It is essential that we improve our performance. One step in that connection will be the wide-ranging programme of financial management reforms set out in Delivering Better Government.  The objective of these reforms is to underline the primary responsibility of spending Departments for managing their expenditure programmes within settled allocations and to take accountability for the results achieved.  A key element of the new system will be agreements between the Department of Finance and spending Departments on a rolling programme of expenditure reviews under which the objectives and the rationale for the continuation of all major departmental spending programmes will be subjected to systematic evaluation over a period of three years or so.  This process will begin this year.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention to reflect on how the relationship between my Department and the spending Departments should develop in the context of a devolved, medium-term approach to expenditure management, the main aim being to improve the effectiveness of overall control over Government spending.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pre-Budget Submissions</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year I announced a change in the forum for presentation of pre-budget submissions from various organisations and representative bodies. The new forum for the presentation and hearing of these submissions was the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs under the chairmanship of Deputy Jim Mitchell.  This new arrangement worked well in its first year and 107 submissions were received.  Twenty-one groups appeared before the committee and a comprehensive report was submitted by the committee which helped to shape and form this budget.  In the process, the various organisations which presented themselves to the committee had an opportunity to advance their case.  In turn, the members of the committee could probe and evaluate the various proposals and clarify why a <Col N="952" /> particular group should benefit from a specific tax or budgetary consideration.</P>
    <P>The entire process has improved the democratic accountability of the budget preparation system.  I am indebted to the work of the various groups and the members of the committee.  I propose, therefore, that the same process should operate this year in time for the next budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Timing of the 1998 Budget</i>

      <P>Yes, they will.  Last year I announced that, in future, the budget formulation would be brought forward by about two months. In effect, the budget for 1998 will be prepared and presented to the Dáil well before the end of November this year.  This in turn will advance the timing of the annual Estimates campaign.  This will improve the efficiency of our budgetary practices. It will also enable subsidiary organisations to be informed of their exact budgetary allocation before the commencement of the calendar year. As Deputies who are also councillors and members of local authorities know, at present it can be up to three months into the year before such organisations know the total amount of their allocations for the year.  This is unsatisfactory as it does not enable proper budgetary planning. That is why it is now being changed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Conclusion</i>
      </P>
      <P>The world is changing rapidly and we, including Deputy O'Keeffe, must adapt to that change. We are very much a part of the change within Europe, as our successful Presidency of the European Union demonstrated.  We must both move with it and shape it in the coming years.</P>
      <P>The Partnership 2000 programme will accommodate change and growth and will take us to the start of the next century.  However, we need to look further ahead in order to manage the present and secure our future.  Our success in recent years gives us the experience and the courage to embrace the future with confidence.</P>
      <P>In my first budget two years ago, I set out five goals to which this country could aspire and plan to achieve by the year 2010.  They were the following: Ireland could have the average <i>per capita</i> income of the European Union, provide full employment for those seeking work, have the best managed and best preserved environment in the European Union, possess the most effective public administration in the European Union and be perceived outside of Europe as the best place in which to invest and do business within Europe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1994 we have made good progress towards all those goals.  First, the nation is becoming richer.  Real wealth is being created by our continuous economic growth which has been four times higher than the European average.  If we achieve the progress I have set out in the budget over the next three years, by the end of the new programme, Partnership 2000, we will be very close to the European Union average <i>per capita</i> income.  Second, employment has increased by 100,000 but there are still too many people unemployed.  However &mdash; this includes the periods when Fianna Fáil was in Government &mdash; for the first time in our modern history we are seeing a sustained net increase in jobs, net emigration has stopped, and some people are coming home.</P>

    <P>We have more to do, but we are doing it better now than ever before.  Third, our environment <Col N="955" /> continues to present a real challenge as we grow and prosper, but policies are being put in place which will protect and enhance it through to the next century.  Fourth, the Strategic Management Initiative provides the basis for the transformation of our public administration system.  It may take time to do it, but I am determined to push ahead on this front.  Finally, this year the IDA found that Ireland was the number one location for US investment seeking to locate in Europe.</P>

      <P>The budget lays the foundation for continuing, strong, non-inflationary growth until the beginning of the next century.  It demonstrates clearly our commitment to social solidarity and the elimination of inequality and poverty.  It makes a clear statement of our economic and fiscal goals for the next three years.  As a result, it will enable us to qualify to participate in European Monetary Union from the beginning.  The tax changes it contains will encourage personal and corporate initiative and strengthen our economy and society.</P>
      <P>The celebration of success should not be confused with the contentment of complacency.  We have much more to do and we will go on together to complete our task.</P>

    <P>(1) The figures for 1993, 1994 and 1995 reflect actual audited expenditure.</P>
    <P>(2) The 1997 Estimate corresponds to figures published in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure 1997.</P>
    <P>(3) To allow for comparison the 1993-94 figures have been adjusted to exclude expenditure and receipts in respect of the Air Navigation Services Office whose functions were transferred to the Irish Aviation Authority on its establishment in 1994.</P>
    <P>(4) From 1996, payments in respect of the Exchequer's liabilities to the An Post and Telecom Éireann Pension Funds are provided for in Central Fund Services rather than in the Vote for the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications as was the case in respect of part of the 1995 liability.</P>

      <P>Not far from here the slogan &ldquo;God loved the world so much that he did not send a committee to save it&rdquo; adorned the office of the senior partner of a very successful professional practice in this city.

      <P>I now understand why he wanted to get out, he wanted to save himself the embarrassment of having to deliver the budget speech, which took him one hour and ten minutes.  He knew that by the time the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare, other fellow socialist Ministers, programme managers, advisers and assorted hangers-on were finished, his budget would resemble the political equivalent of a camel, which we all know is a horse designed by a committee.</P>
      <P>Never in the history of the State has a Minister been in such a favourable budgetary position and never has a budget from a Minister of Finance failed so spectacularly to live up to its expectations. All the Minister's predecessors, from as far back as Michael Collins to Deputy Bertie Ahern, could only have dreamed of such a favourable Exchequer position.</P>

      <P>This was a glorious opportunity to leave a real footprint on Irish economic development, but instead we get barely a toe mark on the seashore to be washed away by the next small wave.  Could the Minister not have set himself a small number of real objectives and done something in those areas?  He has a political objective.  The budget is the Labour Party equivalent of an SOS, save our skins in 1997.</P>
      <P>There was a time when politicians and political parties cared about the medium and longer terms, and some still do.  Has political comment become so vacuous that economic and budgetary decisions in an election year are measured solely on their perceived electoral pluses or minuses? There is no economic strategy underpinning this budget.  It is an attempt to revive the electoral fortunes of the Government by trying to purchase the votes of the electorate.  Trying to please many is often a sure political recipe to antagonise all.</P>
      <P>People frequently refer to what politicians said many years ago.  I have heard the Taoiseach say on many occasions that he is entitled to change his mind and there is no need for me to remind him of how often he has changed his mind in recent years.  However, I take it he has hardly changed his mind since last Sunday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In <Col N="968" /> regard to our economic growth he went on to state that, &ldquo;None of this would have happened but for the original decision to extend free second-level education back in the 1960s.  This shows how important it is to think in a long-term sense&rdquo;.  I am not convinced there is political long-term thinking in the budget or in the Government's economic strategy.</P>

      <P>In recent months a plethora of changes were introduced by the Government, in particular by Labour Ministers.  Service charges and residential property tax were abolished, the Minister for Education altered the school capitation grants, the status of the regional technical college in Waterford &mdash; where a Minister of State resides &mdash; has been changed and the Minister for the Environment made announcements regarding roads.  All of those changes were announced by Labour Ministers.</P>
      <P>What has happened to Fine Gael Ministers in the present Government?  Perhaps they are so busy dousing the bush fires of scams and so on they have no time to pay attention to the budget and its contents. There was a time when the Fine Gael Party stood for something, for the betterment of this State in the medium and long-term, for which we should all be grateful, unlike in the more recent past when a Fine Gael Leader said he would take a more long-term view, now recognised by all and sundry.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister for Health has taken such a grilling from my good colleagues, Deputies Geoghegan-Quinn and Liz O'Donnell, or perhaps as a result of the mess into which he got himself in the course of a recent debate in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps in the future the House will be full of dull, boring Members.</P>
      <P>Against what criteria should this budget be judged?  I suppose that depends on which part of the political spectrum to which one professes allegiance but all budgets and economic strategies must be judged within the economic criteria. There are those who will say that one should have an economic philosophy which might achieve other objectives but, unless one gets the economic fundamentals right, nothing else will follow.</P>
      <P>I contend that what has been put forward today as a budgetary strategy will do nothing at all in the medium or longer term for the betterment of this country.  I would go so far as to say I would see nothing wrong with a budget &mdash; and there have been some in the past &mdash; which did not attempt to do anything momentous on the economic front.  I would classify such budgets as reasonably harmless.  I would also classify Governments that adopt a type of &ldquo;do as little as possible&rdquo; approach as not too dangerous, but I predict the budgetary strategy adopted by this Government over the past two years will do lasting damage.  I have made that prediction for some time and reiterate it today.</P>
      <P>The other criterion against which a budget can be judged is on its proposals on the social front: does it really tackle a few key areas or just spread the manure or fertiliser over a wide area, yielding no real benefit?</P>
      <P>On the taxation front, one must ask what the changes add up to.  Do they make much of a difference to the individual, the business person or company?  Does it reward risk or achieve anything in terms of equity?</P>
      <P>Finally, a budget can be judged for what it does for what is a unique Irish problem, referred to as the poverty trap.  If the broad economic strategy is wrong, the rest becomes irrelevant.  The broad strategy being adopted by this Administration is wrong, misguided and dangerous.  There is no economic philosophy behind the strategy of this Government.</P>
      <P>I have searched high and low, from Adam Smith to Jimmy Goldsmith, from Keynes to Milton Friedman and, unless perhaps the Minister for Social Welfare has been able to devise some wonderful economic theory covered in a correspondence course yet to be unearthed, conducted between himself and some Soviet bloc economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I have not come across any theory or any text book, past or present, <Col N="970" /> which says that this is the proper economic strategy to adopt.</P>
      <P>Our economy is going through an historically high growth period.  Over the past couple of years we have experienced growth in excess of 5 per cent while simultaneously increasing &mdash; which will be the case in the current year &mdash; current spending by at least 7 per cent.  The Central Bank has signalled that growth in the credit institutions is now growing at an alarming rate and yet, at the same time, it is proposed to reduce taxation, all this in one fell swoop, and to continue this strategy. Were one to advance some justification for that economic doctrine one might be more readily excused but to do all of those things at the same time is inexcusable.</P>
      <P>Ireland is probably at the top of the economic growth league.  Our economic growth cycle is unique, at the opposite end of the league <i>vis-à-vis</i> all our European Union and major trading partners, an unusual phenomenon with which nobody has yet come to terms.  The consequence of this phenomenon is that when we are experiencing something of a downturn they are doing very well, whereas the opposite is the case at present.</P>
      <P>In the very near future we shall be joining a very strict economic and monetary union which will abolish the normal financial tools available to any future Irish Administration.  While adopting that specific policy, we are also acutely aware of our nearest neighbour and major trading partner &mdash; who will remain so, because one will always trade with an economy 15 or 16 times one's size so near geographically.  Having adopted the best economic strategy over a period of 25 years, thankfully we have redressed our total dependence on the United Kingdom market.  Nonetheless the United Kingdom will remain our major trading partner, which will remain outside economic and monetary union and pursue an independent monetary policy, in itself, a major cause of concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;remembering that we shall be going down that road in two years' time.</P>
      <P>Despite our massive economic growth in recent years, we continue to have massive unemployment and to have a higher than European average number of unemployed which I predict will not decrease considerably before we join economic and monetary union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that in January 1999 and in the year 2000 the European Union funds negotiated for the years 1993-99 will expire; if I may put it like this, thereafter, hopefully Irish Administrations will be in a position to negotiate new European funds.  However, with the enlargement of the European Union it is an absolute mathematical certainty that, proportionately, the amount of funds coming into the Irish economy, post this round, will be very much less than those we have enjoyed to date.  When one bears in mind that <Col N="971" /> over the past year 1 per cent, possibly more, of our growth can be attributed to those EU funds, one clearly sees the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if we can pursue this type of economic policy at a time when all the indications point to and all the experts say that we may be fuelling inflation &mdash; I make this point in response to some backbenchers on the Government side &mdash; the one thing they should know is that we in Fianna Fáil have experience on which to make such judgments or predictions.  Experience shows that this type of economic policy does not work in an Irish context.  As a colleague has said on many occasions, what was worst about the Fianna Fáil 1977 manifesto was that we implemented it. Effectively, we spent our way out of a boom.  That type of economic policy does not work.  There was nothing wrong with trying to experiment at that time because the economies of Europe had come through an oil crisis in the 1970s which they had not experienced before and it was felt we should prime the pump.  The experiment did not work and it left lasting difficulties which took until the late 1980s to reverse.</P>
    <P>Davy Stockbrokers, in its Economic Monitor of 3 January, more or less signalled what the Minister would do and addressed some of these problems. Mr. Jim O'Leary, a columnist, said that the Minister could enter the textbooks as the man who introduced a new idea to the world of macro-economic management.  He called it disinflationary fiscal expansion or how to join monetary union by cutting the price of drink.  Most people who have looked at this problem would say that caution should be the key note of Government policy but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance allowed himself to be bought off or browbeaten by his governmental colleagues into a situation where he felt he must put forward such a budget and publish a ridiculous Book of Estimates at the end of 1996.  Over the past two years, with different Ministers pressurising him, he has had to increase gross current spending by upwards of 20 per cent at a time when inflation for the relevant period will not be greater than about 6.5 per cent.  The Minister for Finance and those advising him know this is wrong.  However, that will be little consolation in a few years' time when a future Administration made up of whatever parties &mdash; I do not care what ethos underpins the next Administration &mdash; will have to do something dramatic.</P>
    <P>The problem is that when one has to take corrective measures, it is always the poor at the bottom of the scale who suffer most &mdash; the people whom those with bleeding hearts overtly say they are trying to protect.  When changes and reversals of policy must come, whether a left or a right wing Government is in power, it is always the same unfortunate people who must suffer.  That is what will happen again.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to buy off the voters for the next election.  I have a certain amount of admiration for the subtlety with which parties of the <Col N="972" /> left buy off the electorate.  Unlike Fianna Fáil in 1977 which adopted the crude approach of trying to buy people's votes or Fine Gael in 1981 when Garret FitzGerald put forward a proposal of £9.60 for stay at home wives, the left has a far more subtle way of doing this and dress it up as if it is in the national interest.  It is a bit like their appointments to semi-State boards and other quangos.  The people they appointed are those who should have been appointed in the first place but who were overlooked by the thugs in Fianna Fáil.  These nice people who put the national interest first should have been appointed.  It is only the muck savages in Fianna Fáil who have no ethos in these matters and who look after their friends.  However, the Labour Party and Democratic Left appoint the best people, although it is important that they are members of the local branch and have always been involved in the party.  I am willing to live for the next decade with that type of economic philosophy which has been laid down by some commentators because it is quite harmless and people should not get too upset about it.</P>

      <P>Short-term popularity bought at the expense of future bankruptcy is not a worthey aim.  The electorate has become so sophisticated that such an approach will not work electorally, but that is for another day and we will let the people be the judge.  For some time the people have taken a longer-term view than politicians of any party or commentators but which they might not express as well.  We all praise the farseeing decision of 1966 to introduce free second level education but policy makers, particularly politicians and commentators, forget that the effects of that decision over 30 years have given us an electorate and a society which are more sophisticated and which will not be bought off in ways we have all tried in the past.</P>
      <P>If there were not to be an election in 1997, no Minister for Finance, let alone Deputy Quinn, would come to the House and produce this Book of Estimates and budget.  It is wrong at this time. We should look at economic history and see that this type of economic policy has not worked.  In the United Kingdom Nigel Lawson tried the same approach in the late 1980s.  Before an election, he introduced a budget very similar to that of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>He did.  The Minister has made the same mistake as that made in the United Kingdom which, in everyone's view, had a detrimental effect on all the good work done previously. Good work has been done here over a number of years by various Administrations made up of all the parties in the House but we <Col N="973" /> are prepared to throw it away because an election is imminent.</P>
      <P>We have found a successful formula which has worked.  It is amazing that economies in various parts of the world have adopted an Irish approach &mdash; for example, the Shannon duty free zone.  The World Bank gave grants and assistance to organisations to help them to set up such areas.  Shannon has been copied by others and it is a pity we did not do it a little better.  We have discovered the magic or whatever of how to run the economy.</P>
      <P>We took a long time &mdash; since the foundation of the State &mdash; to change economic strategy but, when we did, the economy grew quickly.  We made mistakes and repeated them.  When we were at the edge of financial bankruptcy, we found a successful formula which came about in the late 1980s when the Haughey-MacSharry Government totally reversed economic polices of previous decades.  It was not politically popular in the House and we had critical votes on many occasions.  Strange as it may seem, it proved to be good economics, which turned the country around, and good politics, which surprised politicians because instead of being eaten alive by the electorate, those who took this decision were respected.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the parties which make up the Government and which opposed that type of economic strategy, they came to recognise that this was a successful Irish way of doing things. The main reason this was done was that we were at the edge of financial bankruptcy, but there was a realisation by the trade union movement, employers, farmers and the Government which produced the first Programme for National Recovery.  That consensus approach gave us low inflation, low interest rates and a successful and good economy of which we are now able to enjoy the fruits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words about our joining economic and monetary union.  There is no point in any politician or Government saying there are rules about joining monetary union and at the same time not realising and being prepared to face up to what future Irish Administrations must do after we join European Monetary Union.  On one occasion during Question Time the Minister, perhaps inadvertently, gave the impression that it was not in the national interest even to question or debate joining economic and monetary union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>My party is pro-Europe.  We <Col N="974" /> believe that we can join economic and monetary union.  However, to attempt to stifle debate would be very bad.  Furthermore, we must face up to the fact that, if and when we join, it will not be the same for Irish Governments after that.  I would have no objection if the Government proposed, like the Swedes, a commission of experts to give their views; as a matter of interest, the Swedish commission decided that it was not in Sweden's interest to join at that time.  It would allow for putting forward all the ramifications of joining European Monetary Union.  The only study carried out here by the ESRI has been on the economic front.  It surprised me and many others in the pro-EMU camp that, whether the UK joins on day one or stays out, the economic benefits would be marginal.</P>
      <P>We must recognise our position when we join economic and monetary union.  We will not be able to come before this House with budget deficits. It is obvious that European Monetary Union would frown upon any type of deficit and we will be able to have them only under very strict rules. This raises the question for me of how monetary union will be operated without some form of enlarged federal budget.</P>
      <P>There are two differences between the proposed European economic and monetary union and that in the United States.  First, there is a centralised budget in the United States so that, in the event of a major economic shock, other taxes can be raised; second, there is great mobility of labour in the United States but there is no similar tradition in Europe.  That is a matter for debate and the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs has spent a great deal of time on it.</P>
      <P>The most interesting aspect is that if we are at one end of the economic cycle and our European partners are at the other, say in three years time we join economic and monetary union which once joined cannot be left, we could come to the other end of the economic cycle and there would be a depression here while the rest of Europe was doing swimmingly.  We would then be in a very awkward position.  Rules must be introduced which would allow a small nation such as Ireland to adjust.</P>
      <P>Despite what the Minister said today, after all his adjustments and trying to justify the unjustifiable, the national debt at the end of 1996 was still £30 billion.  Over the lifetime of this Government current spending will be 20 per cent &mdash; it was 6.5 per cent of late, and this year alone it will be at least 7 per cent.  If the Minister for Finance had succeeded in getting the Government to adhere to its targets of inflation plus 2 per cent since it came into power in December 1994, he would have had another £500 million available to do something about the national debt, to deal with social exclusion, to give more money to old people or to reduce income tax.  That proves that the link between debt, taxation and expenditure must be understood by all sides.  That was one of the most important breakthroughs in thinking over the past decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> The Minister said that £400 million was taken in taxation last year which was not planned for. In the last two years, £600 million has been taken which was not planned for in the Estimates.  We are supposed to be delighted the Minister is giving us back some of this money.  In 1996, the amount collected in tax revenue was £4,562 million. After all the adjustments today, the Minister will collect next year, by his own estimate, £4,926 million, an extra £364 million or an 8 per cent increase in tax this year.</P>

      <P>For the Irish taxpayer, £1 million extra per day will be collected between now and the end of the year instead of PAYE being reduced.  People are really having some of their own money thrown back at them.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made great play today of the full year cost of taxation changes.  In the last budget brought in by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in 1994, the total tax changes in the full year were £333 million.  If the Minister had stuck to his own rules in the programme, A Government of Renewal, he would have had that extra £500 million with which he could have done something real.</P>
      <P>Regarding the social changes brought forward today by the Minister for Finance, despite the great Deputy De Rossa being the Minister for Social Welfare and the statement which talks about the total cost of social welfare and health in this budget and gives the impression that this is the biggest change ever made, I want to point out something different.  This is not the biggest social welfare package ever.  In 1990, when things were really bad, the full year cost of changes made in the budget by a Fianna Fáil Minister was £235 million, and that was social welfare alone. The total cost for the year of changes today between health and social welfare is £245 million. It is not true to say that the changes made here are the biggest ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Managing the Department of Social Welfare requires care and prudence.  However, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Social Welfare would be far better off targeting a few key areas in social welfare rather than trying to spread the largesse over a large number of areas. The Minister said that the increase for an old age pensioner will be £7 over the three years of this Administration.  It may interest him to know that a bag of coal costs £7.60, in other words, the total increase for an old age pensioner over the three years of this Administration would not buy them an extra bag of coal per week.  That gives some idea of the nonsense carried on by the Minister for Social Welfare and Democratic Left.  Over three years the total increase for old age pensioners will be £7, while the cost of a bag of coal in my part of the country is £7.60.  It would be much better for the Minister for Social Welfare to target the elderly at the lower end of the scale <Col N="976" /> or give an increase to widows than spread the money over many areas with no effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would be interested to know how many of those measures were changed by subsequent Governments, including the one of which he is a member.</P>
      <P>There is no co-ordination in the Government regarding changes in social welfare.  The Minister for Social Welfare recently announced an increase in the single parent allowance.  I received a phone call and a follow up letter from an unemployed person whose wife is working and he said that if he separated from his wife he would be 150 per cent better off, taking into account child dependant allowance, tax changes, rent allowance and the new single parent allowance.  That is the type of social welfare policy that is being introduced.</P>
      <P>I read recently about changes in Irish society &mdash; this matter was referred to by the Taoiseach in an article last Sunday.  The wage earner in a household, be it the husband or wife, should be the role model.  The Minister for Social Welfare's recent unilateral announcement of a single parent allowance will create anomalies.  We must consider the issue of household income because people make economic decisions for their betterment, and who can blame them?</P>
      <P>Today's budget is founded to a great extent on Partnership 2000.  Fianna Fáil is the party that introduced the concept of that partnership.  If one reads the Official Report of that period they will find that speech after speech by the present Taoiseach, the Minister for Social Welfare and other members of the Labour Party opposed the concept from day one.  They said that it would not work and that it was undemocratic.  Some Members, particularly the Taoiseach, maintained opposition to that concept until they went into Government, but others had the decency to say some years ago that they were wrong.</P>
      <P>The figures in today's budget are based on agreement by the unions to Partnership 2000. Perhaps the unions will vote for that partnership, and everybody assumes they will, but my information is that if they do, the margins of victory will be very small.  The result is not a foregone conclusion.  From my contacts within the trade union movement, I am reasonably certain that the outcome will be very close and it will not surprise me if Partnership 2000 is not accepted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I read recently that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, was contemplating resignation from the Government as a result of being <Col N="977" /> upstaged by the Tánaiste and leader of his party. The Minister gave his views on RTE on public sector pay, but after the launch of Partnership 2000 a headline appeared in a major daily newspaper that the Minister was throwing down the gauntlet on public sector pay.  Since becoming Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn has picked Monday morning to throw down the gauntlet to some of his ministerial colleagues, but usually a few days later he gives in.</P>
    <P>The Minister is like the fighter who talks about a great fight but when he gets into the ring he just lies down and throws up his hands.  He reminds me of Mr. McNeely who fought Mike Tyson &mdash; he talked about a great fight until he jumped into the ring when he lay down with fright rather than from a blow from Tyson.  In dealing with the Tánaiste the Minister, when he got into the ring &mdash; in this case the Cabinet room &mdash; lay down and threw up his hands.  If he contemplated resignation, and he has not denied he did, he took the matter seriously.  It is a serious matter to undermine the position of the Minister for Finance, the only Minister referred to in the Constitution apart from the Taoiseach.  He has obligations and responsibilities which far outweigh those of any other Minister.  He is responsible for the budget and does not have to get agreement on it from the Government. He is named in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I give the Minister credit for believing that the matter was serious enough to contemplate resignation.  We deserve an explanation from both the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Some changes in the budget are inconsequential and will make little difference to business people and others.  As regards corporation tax, if the change in that regard signals the long-term strategy of trying to reduce the top rate of corporation tax, it is welcome.  The Minister said that he is awaiting a report in this area and will make an announcement shortly.  It is imperative that that be done in the immediate future because decisions of major companies are dependent on the rate of corporation tax post-2005.</P>
      <P>The changes in PRSI will make no difference to anybody.  I recently read the results of a survey which states that 78 per cent of small firms have difficulty getting staff &mdash; any Deputy could give that information to Department of Finance officials.  Some 20 per cent gave the reason that the people involved had no interest in the job, 37 per cent said it was due to the relationship between the social welfare and taxation systems and 43 per cent said that the problem relates to skills.  There is no incentive at the lower scale for people to go back to work and there are no measures in the budget to address that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite great economic growth it is interesting that from 1990-96 there has been no dent in the number of the long-term unemployed.  Because <Col N="978" /> we are approaching an election, much was made of the fact that the end of year 1996 live register figure had fallen by 15,000 compared to the previous year.  Nobody pointed out that the figure had increased by 15,000 in 1995.  It is a fact that in early December 1994 when the Fianna Fáil Labour Government went out of power the live register figure was 272,000 and it was 271,000 at the end of December 1996; there has been no change.  Another interesting analysis undertaken recently shows that the number of long-term unemployed has not changed.  The great growth we are experiencing has not impacted on that group.</P>
    <P>I have told the Minister that the live register is a count of the number of people unemployed week in, week out.  Government agencies should make greater use of the information which is available as a result of people signing on the register.  With the increasing use of computerisation, I suggest to the Minister that it should be possible to obtain more information on that group than we have at present.  To say that the Labour Force Survey is more accurate than a count of people is the same as saying that an opinion poll is more accurate than a general election. That does not add up.  If we said we will not bother holding a general election in 1997 but will just carry out a survey at the top of O'Connell Street, people would laugh at us.  I emphasised that point before and I do so again.</P>
    <P>Some changes proposed in the tax year 1997-98 were not dealt with in the Minister's speech. Mortgage interest relief for 1997-98 will be at the standard rate.  It is being phased in over four years.  As a principle, I like the idea of standard rating.  If a person has an ordinary job and income, he or she is more entitled to the benefits of a taxation break than, say, the higher earner who, if a standard rate does not apply, gets the tax break at 48 per cent and when tax rates were higher got it at those rates.  We should be prepared to do something in this area now because I received some interesting figures recently regarding changes that have taken place in this area.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the threshold of the interest allowable should be increased.  It may interest the Minister to note that, taking inflation into account, in 1996-97 the relief will be only one sixth of what it was worth in 1980-81 and 56 per cent of what it was worth in 1993-94.  When married couples, etc. are counted, at least 560,000 people are affected by this measure.  Taking the 1993-94 figures into account, at least 570,000 people were affected by it.  As the cost of houses is so high and interest rates are low at present, rather than tampering with standard rates, which would be a regressive move, the interest threshold should be adjusted.  At present one gets 80 per cent of £5,000, less £200 or whatever the figure is.  The benefit of it has been considerably decreased and the Minister might address this matter before the Finance Bill is introduced.</P>
    <P>The <i>raison d'être</i> behind any good economic philosophy should try to address three issues &mdash;<Col N="979" /> employment, public services and taxation, in that order.  That is a reversal of what some parties in this House would do.  The Labour Party would go about it, maybe, somewhat differently and the Progressive Democrats would approach it somewhat differently again.  Those three measures represent Fianna Fáil's philosophy on this.</P>
    <P>In future budgets we should identify and set out our core expenditures, those that a Government and a society should necessarily undertake. We should provide for them and decide that peripheral expenditures cannot be given priority under the budget or the financial plan.  There would then be some rationale behind how we run the country.  The Government should disengage from areas where individuals can best provide for themselves.  That is the underlying rationale I would like to espouse here today.  If we adopted that economic philosophy in approaching a budget or a three year plan of Government, it would be to our betterment.  It could then be tied in with annual budgeting to determine where we are going.</P>
    <P>It may interest people to note that this is the first time there has been any cut in the standard rate of tax for a number of years.  We are proud that we were able to make changes in our period of office from 1987-94.  The top tax rate was reduced from 58 per cent to 48 per cent, the standard rate was reduced from 35 per cent to 27 per cent and the debt ratio decreased from 125 per cent in 1987 to what it is today.  That is an outstanding achievement of which my party can be proud.</P>
    <P>It may also interest people to note that the Exchequer borrowing requirement in 1986 was over 10 per cent and we are delighted to note it is much lower today, but my party leader said quite recently that we should aim not to have any Exchequer borrowing requirement on joining economic and monetary union.</P>

      <P>The Government has engaged in short-termism to an extreme degree.  It has thrown caution to the wind.  It has not provided for the rainy day.  It has looked only as far as the next election.  The budget is pro-cyclical.  The last thing the economy needs at this time is the stimulus which this budget will give it.  That will be to our detriment.  The Government has not taken any account of the fact that EU funds will run out at the end of 1999 and the constraints we will have to put in place when we join economic and monetary union.  Regarding public spending, it has spent all the revenue from the growth achieved during the past number of years.  In relation to social welfare, it has tried to spread benefits over too wide an area which will not have any real impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every commentator I have read, including the Central Bank, suggests we should not adopt this type of financial approach at this time.  The Minister, <Col N="980" /> who has been tied up preparing the budget may not know, but his officials certainly know, that there was a degree of nervousness about the financial markets today in the expectation that the budget would be too expansionary.  We may think that nobody pays any attention to us, that this is good theatre and is to impress the electorate, but men and women are sitting in front of VDUs around the world noting what is happening in the Irish economy and taking a position on what they think a Minister for Finance and Government should be doing.  We have decided to spend our way out of a boom and we have not made any provision for what will happen in the future.</P>
    <P>Much was expected of the Minister for Finance and to those to whom much is given much is expected.  We never had an opportunity in the history of the State to show we were responsible and could handle things better than anybody else. The pushing through of this budget by the Minister for Finance, perhaps against his will &mdash; there are three parties in Government and it is probably very difficult to operate in such circumstances &mdash; will be to the long-term detriment of our people and the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister was impelled to quote James Joyce.  At the turn of the century, when he knew he was dying, Oscar Wilde was reported to have said:</P>
    <P>It would be more than the English could stand if another century began and I were still alive.  I am dying as I have lived, beyond my means.</P>
    <P>With a slightly changed wording, could there be any more fitting epitaph for this Administration? It would be more than the electorate could stand if another millennium began and the Government was still politically alive.  Politically, it is dying and has certainly lived beyond its means.  In sporting terms, in a penalty shoot-out without the goal-keeper, the Minister missed.</P>

      <P>I send my regards to Deputy Jim Mitchell who is unwell.  He would have participated vigorously in the debate that will take place over the next few days.  His work at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on the pre-budget process was highly valued.</P>
      <P>This budget, far from being the great giveaway, has turned out to be the great damp squib. It has been portrayed in public as an occasion on which the Government would secure its electoral future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The people will not be bought that cheaply.  The budget is the longest redundancy application form ever composed and signed by a Minister for Finance and an Administration in the history of the State.  It represents <Col N="981" /> the high point of the abandonment of every commitment made by the Government of renewal on taking office two years ago.  I do not have to remind Members that it set itself certain targets, one of which was to control public spending.  It promised the electorate that public spending would rise by no more than 6 per cent in the first year and 2 per cent in real terms in the years thereafter.  It has exceeded those sums by £500 million thus far and proposes to exceed it by even more next year.</P>
      <P>The budgetary tables show that there will be a 7 per cent increase in public spending this year. If one allows for the inflation rate which the Minister, through the budgetary changes, is pushing up to 2.2 per cent this year, one is still left with a 5 per cent increase in public spending at a time when he solemnly covenanted with the people it would be 2 per cent.  The difference between the amount he said he would run the country for for the past three years and the amount he is proposing to run it for, is of the order of £600 million to £700 million per annum.  That would make a huge difference to the capacity of this country to have a pro-enterprise, pro-jobs tax régime.  If the Government had kept its promises on the one target it set itself on the day it took office &mdash; it was not set by the Opposition &mdash; we would be in a radically different budgetary situation now.</P>
      <P>The truth is that the figure of 7 per cent is a phoney underestimate of the real underlying rate of increase in public spending.  I do not have to quote anybody more or less eminent than Dr. Garret FitzGerald who reprimanded the Minister for moving towards gross increases rather than net increases in his first budget as the real measure of increases in public spending.  Using the formula that Dr. FitzGerald said the Minister had wrongly abandoned, the net increase in public spending this year will be 8.2 per cent, four times the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>I will not ask anybody to measure up to standards which are unrealistic, I only ask them to measure up to standards which they set for themselves and which they agreed were reasonable.  If the Government had kept the spending commitments it solemnly gave to the people on taking office, we would be in a radically different position.</P>
      <P>The Minister will say that there were many unexpected and unforeseen contingencies but the £100 million paid out in equality payments was fed into the system and formed part of the cumulative total for the following year.  There is now a publicly stated contingency fund.  Although I am aware that the committee on which I served recommended that such a fund be set up, this is a very dangerous development because it seems to be an open invitation to every pressure group to demand that the money be spent and to create the contingency against which the money was provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister in attempting to control public spending, particularly in the manner in which he was betrayed by the Tánaiste.  It <Col N="982" /> is clear the Minister tried to take a stance to control the explosion in public spending and was prepared at one stage to lay his job on the line but dissuaded by others from doing so.  I admire him for taking a stance but it was always inevitable that a Government put together in the way this one was would eventually fall victim to the temptation to increase public spending and even the noble gesture of laying one's own political body across the pathway of increased public spending would not have stopped it.  That is the reason the Minister did not carry out his threat.  The Government would have carried on without him because its insatiable appetite for increasing public spending at four times the rate of inflation in net terms would not have been embarrassed even for two minutes had it to dispense with him as the price for maintaining the volume of public spending. While I sympathise with him, his gesture in offering to resign was futile.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that it was not unprecedented. In the 1980s the same force for increased public spending overrode the determination of a previous Government in which Deputy Alan Dukes, who has had much to say in recent days, played a key role as Minister for Finance before his inglorious trip to the Department of Justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two provisions in the budget for which the Minister must be commended.  He has finally agreed that PRSI is a tax on work and a reduction in PRSI is a pro-jobs, pro-employment step.  My party has been saying this for years.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, has been denying it emphatically.  I salute the Minister's achievement in turning the tide and forcing the Department of Social Welfare to accept that PRSI is anti-jobs and anti-work and should be integrated into the tax system.  I salute his first faltering step down that road.</P>
      <P>I also salute the 1 per cent decrease in the standard rate of income tax.  Why is this being done now and why the sudden and late conversion to a reduction in the rates of income tax?  If it was a good idea to reduce the 27 per cent rate of income tax in 1997, why was it not done in 1993, 1994, 1995 or 1996?  The reason is the Labour Party's insatiable requirements for public spending in 1995 not only demanded that the process of tax reform be stopped but that a 1 per cent income levy be imposed on all income that year.  This amounted to a 2 per cent increase in the standard rate of income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of the Labour Party's four years in office it raised taxation on work, but at the end of that term, following a deathbed conversion and faced with an electoral winter, the party is converted to the proposition that tax rates are important.</P>
      <P>Only those who understand how people work and what incentive really means understand that tax rates are important.  It is neither a right wing nor a Thatcherite notion.  The Progressive Democrats seek tax rates in Ireland which Tony Blair is committed to maintaining and improving in Britain.  We look for tax rates which the German Government proposes to exceed through tax reductions in the next few years.  The top rate of tax in Germany will be 35 per cent in a couple of years.  The lower rate will be 20 per cent or less. However, Ireland, under the unreconstructed, left-wing, socialist parties which hold the reins of government, has kept tax rates at their current levels.</P>
      <P>There is no decrease in the 48 per cent tax rate. This is probably justified on ideological grounds, on the basis that those who have owe more to society than those who have not.  Central to that proposition is a lie: wealthy barristers, doctors, business men and property developers do not pay 48 per cent tax.  They use every BES scheme, special savings allowance scheme and other schemes to minimise their tax liability.</P>

      <P>They employ people who are skilled in minimising their tax burden and they feel foolish if a significant portion of their income is lost at a rate of 48 per cent, in addition to PRSI in the case of some of the lower paid.</P>
      <P>Ordinary workers earning less than the average industrial wage are obliged to pay 48 per cent tax. These are the people who have never heard of or have never received through the post an application for a BES scheme.  These are the people for whom accountants can do nothing.  PAYE workers earning less than the average industrial wage are caught by the 48 per cent tax rate.  They pay 48 per cent tax in addition to 6 per cent PRSI or 54 per cent of every extra £10 they earn.  These are ordinary men and women who work in shops and factories and who earn less than the average industrial wage.  They pay more than half of every extra £10 they receive from their employer to Ministers Quinn and Prionsias De Rossa in PAYE or PRSI.  They are caught by the tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the USA, a lady known as the &ldquo;Queen of Mean&rdquo;, Leona Helmsley, was sent to jail for tax evasion.  The reason she gave for evading tax &mdash;<Col N="984" /> the judge correctly disregarded it &mdash; was that she thought tax was only for the little people.  Under the Labour Party, the 48 per cent tax rate is only for the little people, the people who cannot avoid it.  They are the people who are hammered and nailed to the floor by the tax system and for whom it spells the end of hope and an incapacity to improve the lot of their families by working harder.</P>
    <P>This was not always the case.  In 1973, when the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition came to power, fewer than 2 per cent of taxpayers were paying above the then standard rate of 35 per cent income tax.  However, when the Labour Party and Fine Gael finished with the tax system 14 years later in 1987, 42 per cent of taxpayers were paying tax above the standard rate.  Those parties brought surtax to the masses and there it has remained.  Although the wealthy and powerful in Irish society can move their money offshore, invest it in special savings accounts and BES schemes and thus avoid the consequences of the Government's massive avarice for people's earnings, ordinary PAYE workers cannot and they pay through the nose, week in and week out.</P>
    <P>I agree with a columnist in one of today's newspapers who said that the sooner we are rid of the notion of secrecy attached to the budget and the embargo on publication of copies of the Minister's speech before a certain time, the better. When today's budgetary charade is over, we will be left with one fact: single men and women earning less than the average industrial wage will continue to pay more than half of every extra £10 they earn in taxes to a State which is grinding them and their prospects of doing good for their families down and preventing them from rising through their hard work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard rate of income tax has been reduced by 1 per cent.  The band has been increased in real terms, after inflation, by 3 per cent.  Is that radical?  The value of the personal allowance in this great giveaway budget is increased in real terms by 6 per cent.  The budget tables offer examples of single people and families who will, according to the figures in the budget, have an extra £8 to £12 per week. However, these tables make no reference to <Col N="985" /> mortgage clawbacks.  None of the examples chosen reflects them.  What is also not stated in the Budget Statement is the rate at which the Minister is increasing PRSI ceilings.  The employee ceiling is being increased by 9 per cent, from £22,000 to £23,000 and the employer's ceiling is increased by 9 per cent.  Across the board there are hidden taxes to take back the apparent benefits of the budget.</P>
      <P>When people have paid the extra moneys on petrol, mortgages, cigarettes, increased television licence fees and extra PRSI, many families this year, as was the case last year, will notice no difference in their circumstances.  Those who notice a difference will see it is so small that they will wonder what a tiger economy is about.  In an effort to add literary and artistic flair to his Budget Statement, the Minister referred to Leopold Bloom's budget on Bloomsday.  We were told he spent one penny on his newspaper, the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, the predecessor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> about which the Minister was so scathing.  Even at that time, Mr. Bloom had to spend £2.19s 3d, slightly less than £3, on his day's activities.  In fact, Leopold Bloom's £3 per day budget on Bloomsday is less than the benefit to most families under the budgetary tables of this budget.  We are talking about an increase of the same amount or less.  A sum of £3 per day is a total of £21 per week.  I defy people to search through the budgets for any ordinary family who will be better off to that extent.</P>
      <P>This is a bloomsday gloomsday budget which is being put forward as something magnificent but turns out to be something very disappointing. That need not have been the case.  If the Government simply had held to the targets I mentioned earlier, the dramatic scope for tax reductions and increases in essential services would have been enormous compared to what has been achieved today.  At the end of 1997 it would have been of the order of £600 or £700 million had the Government simply kept in line with its own promises.</P>
      <P>One of the features I have noted about the budgetary process for the past three or four months is that not one governmental programme was examined to see if it was giving good value for money.  There is not one reference to the effect that the moneys to be expended under the Estimates have been revised because good value for money is not being obtained.  There has not been one saving of significance right across public spending.  All we have had is a proposal to increase dramatically the level of spending over and above an already inflated rate last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask Deputy Ryan or anybody else to say with their hand on their heart to the electorate that there is no economy to be made anywhere, all Government spending is necessary, we get good value for every penny spent, there is no overmanning in any area and there is no scope for savings anywhere.  Nobody could say that to the electorate but as far as I can see not a single penny is saved in this budget from the current levels of public spending.  There was no control <Col N="986" /> of the growth in public spending, as the figures I mentioned earlier of a real increase of over 8 per cent in net terms over the past year adequately demonstrate.</P>
    <P>A decrease which I noticed was on public housing through local authorities.  In an election year how can the Labour Minister for Finance reduce the amount of money for spending on local authority housing in capital terms?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is simple.  He found that when he gave the motor tax receipts to the local authorities there would be an overall increase which they could use for some of their purposes.  What did central Government do?  It clawed it all back and told them they must live on exactly what they had last year.  That is interesting when one thinks about it in terms of local government. They must live on what they had last year but at central Government, where the election will be won or lost as far as this Government considers its prospects to be still alive, there will be an 8 per cent increase in net terms in public spending.  That is extraordinary.  The Government was willing to implement cutbacks everywhere else but where it really mattered there was no such determination.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy correctly said that we are now in a position to begin reducing the national debt.  Last Monday week the Progressive Democrats published a budget which showed that by controlling public spending, getting better value for money, not filling every position in the public service as it became vacant but asking for a real return in terms of productivity for the moneys due under Partnership 2000 it was possible to begin the process not merely of wiping out the Exchequer borrowing requirement but going one stage further in 1997 and beginning to repay the national debt.  The sad fact is that this year the Government is planning to borrow an extra £637 million &mdash; I accept there is a surplus on the current side &mdash; simply to spend on capital projects, thereby increasing the national debt to that extent and incurring a £30 million or £40 million extra charge per annum to service that additional indebtedness.  That is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note there is no provision in these budgetary figures for the Trustee Savings Bank to be floated off into the private sector and a capital inflow to the Exchequer to arise from that.  Nor is there any proposal in respect of any part of the semi-State sector to get in private sector capital, investment funds or pension funds to substitute their investment for the capital the State has now borrowed to capitalise those ventures.  The reason for that is ideological.  Nobody will take the risk, even in this electoral year, of facing up to the reality that the Trustee Savings Bank should no longer be in the public domain.  If Greencore or Irish Life had remained in public ownership at the time we handed over the reins of power to the Labour <Col N="987" /> Party, would they still be in public ownership and what terrible effect would such public ownership have caused?</P>
    <P>There is huge scope for this country to make Government leaner and more effective.  We do not have to capitalise every project from borrowings. We can introduce private funding initiatives, as other countries are doing, for major public projects.  We can reorganise our portfolio of public sector assets with a view to reducing the role of the State, the necessity for the State to manage and to take risks and the necessity for the State to capitalise and to pay interest on borrowings for those enterprises.  All of this could be done on a non-ideological, pragmatic basis with the interests of all at heart if we were not frightened of our ideological shadows.  We are not proposing that a swingeing axe be taken to the semi-State sector.  On the contrary, we are proposing a programme of survival for the semi-State sector which enables that sector to be fully competitive in the competitive world which we have not ordained for ourselves but which Europe has delivered to us.</P>
    <P>Does it make sense for the Government to borrow money and to pour it by way of capital into an enterprise which is expected to compete with other enterprises on a level playing pitch and at the same time to have the Government be the regulator, referee and arbitrator on that level playing pitch?  Does it make sense to have a system in which one is supposed to do justice as between two parties but own, capitalise and take the risk of failure of one of the two parties?  It does not.  The days are numbered for our capacity to maintain this hybrid world where the State is both capitalising risk-taking operations in competitive fields and at the same time purporting to be the judge and the regulator of those markets. It is not I, the Progressive Democrats or the next Government, whichever way it will be formed, that are numbering those days.  It is the inevitable laws of economic competition handed down to us from the European Union.</P>
    <P>As a society we have to take advantage of the next five years, 1997 to 2002, to transform this country from top to bottom.  There is something radically wrong with our tax system and only radical steps will put it right.  Incrementalism such as the 3 per cent in real terms we have seen today or the 1 per cent decrease in income tax rates over five years of the Labour Party in office will not do.  If we are to compete with Tony Blair's Labour-led Britain, which in all probability will come to pass, our workers are entitled to as projobs a tax system as his workers.  If we are to compete with Germany, which will have tax rates of 35 and 20 per cent respectively, our workers are entitled to a Government which has made the necessary preparations to allow them compete on a level playing pitch with German industry and capital which can locate much closer to the European centre.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy mentioned the period between 1989 and 1992 when the top rate of tax was reduced from 58 per cent to 48 per cent and the lower rate from 35 per cent to 27 per cent. This was not achieved by considering what was left over each year for tax reduction but by the exact opposite arrangement with a statement that the tax rate in the following year's budget would be a certain figure before deciding what accommodation had to be made to achieve it.  All the Finance Bills which achieved that significant transformation in the tax system were voted against solidly by the Labour Party.  On occasions when I hear the vehemence with which it condemns the tax reform policies of the Progressive Democrats, which were echoed in a long since <Col N="989" /> forgotten Labour Party document in 1988 &mdash; the Deputy may have heard of it &mdash; I wonder if anybody in that party wishes to return to pre Progressive Democrats tax rates.  Do they wish to return to a 35 per cent standard rate of tax, which, in conjunction with PRSI, meant that over 40 per cent was the first effective tax rate for workers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the rate and we changed it.  People in the Labour Party who want to turn back the clock and say we were wrong should stand up and state that we should revert to the tax system which operated before the Progressive Democrats began the revolution in tax reform in this country.  Why are the people now being asked to accept, in the twilight hours of this Government, that reducing tax rates is a good idea when it was not a good idea for the last four years?</P>
      <P>I said previously that 1997 marks the end of a 25 year period in which the Labour Party has been in office for more years than any other party.  It has been in office for 15 of the last 25 years.  It brought down a Government on the issue of who it wanted appointed to the courts.  It does not lack bottle when it comes to something really important, such as that matter.  However, when it comes to something which I consider important on behalf of workers, how much the State takes from their wage packets every week, the Labour Party has never taken a stance.  It has never said it is fearlessly on the part of workers.</P>

      <P>Those decisions did not occur by stealth.  Some people think it was the effect of annual inflation at a fierce rate, the diminution of the value of the tax allowance or an unconscious process which nobody chose. However, that is not the case because the tax rates are reviewed every year in the Finance Bill. The position where workers in the Deputy's constituency are paying more than half their marginal earnings in tax and PRSI was chosen by successive Governments in the last 25 years.  The chief moving party in that process of increasing taxation so there was more money to spend at every stage was the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;tax and spend&rdquo; has been used and it is easy to throw it out as a jibe.  However, I do not use it as such.  The record shows that the taxation of workers' earnings over the last 25 years is crippling and that welfare versus taxation as a deciding factor in whether people work has dramatically changed over that period.  There must be political responsibility and accountability for that change.  Those who were in office for the great portion of that period must take responsibility for the shape of the current tax system.  I look forward to the next general election and even more so following the Budget Statement.  I thought it would be an election winning budget, but an election losing budget was announced because people will say tomorrow: &ldquo;Is that all?  Is that what we were waiting for?  Is this the bonanza we were promised?  Is this the price of our vote in the cynical minds of the Government spin doctors and programme managers?&rdquo; They will say it is not for sale at that price.</P>
      <P>The Government, which has, according to opinion polls, one third of popular support, is facing an election campaign and hoping to swing around, in a Lazarus like resurrection, its political fortunes on the basis of its performance in office.</P>

      <P>They know that in April, when they look at their pay slips, the truth of four years of the Labour Party in Government will add up, in the case of pensioners, to less than the price of a bag of coal.  That is the increase in pensioners' spending power over four years of the <Col N="991" /> life of the Celtic tiger.  How do they feel about that?</P>
      <P>However, that need not necessarily be the case because the Progressive Democrats' alternative budget, which was castigated by the Left, proposed economies in the way the State is run and also proposed an extra £5 for every pensioner. That is much more than is on offer in today's budget.  It proposed an increase in the carer's allowance which is far more than what is on offer here.  It also proposed an increase of £4 in child benefit, four times what is on offer here.  In spite of all the cant from some Deputies on the Government side about the huge revolution in child benefit, this year we are talking about £1 per month, the price of a chocolate bar per week, as the bottom line for children in needy homes in Irish society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the extent of preelection largesse, I am sorely disappointed.  I have come to the conclusion that the budget processed this year was fatally compromised by the three party process, the wrangling over whether PRSI could or could not be reduced, the wrangling over whether the top rate of income tax could be reduced and the absolute determination of every spending Minister to hang on to every penny.  All these have combined in the rather dismal and pathetic spectacle we have today &mdash; a budget which achieves very little for many people, nothing for some people and a good deal for a very small group.</P>
      <P>This is an election year and this is an election budget, but it is an election budget which will see this Government swept from office and replaced by a Government which will put tax reform as the cornerstone of the budgetary process every year.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy McCreevy was trying to draw a distinction between the approach of the Progressive Democrats and that of Fianna Fáil when he said that we had to deal first with employment, second with public sector spending and programmes and third with taxation.  If I were asked to rate their importance I would agree with Deputy McCreevy that that is a proper sense of priority.  What is peculiar is that if one does nothing about taxation one will not achieve much in relation to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is it about other countries that stimulates Irish children who go there to work during the summer, to take two jobs and work hard for all the hours of the day and night to bring money home?  What is it about this country that produces the opposite reaction, to leave the country because there is no room for enterprise?  It is our tax and welfare systems.  We have to face up to that because the post-EMU Europe will not be a forgiving society.  In the brave new world of the <Col N="992" /> post-EMU European economy, any country that has an anti-work, anti-employment tax system will suffer a haemorrhage of people to the other regions of the European Union throughout the period it struggles to remain within economic and monetary union.  Ireland is being asked to pay a heavy price in terms of financial autonomy, control of our interest rates, and perhaps fiscal autonomy, in taking the next step in European economic integration.  If we are to pay that price and be in a position to sustain that price year in, year out, we must make the changes now, because the window of opportunity when EU transfer funds will make it politically possible to effect the radical and fundamental changes in our society, in our tax system and in our expenditure patterns, that are needed to make Ireland a self-starter which hits the ground running in the post-EMU Europe is a narrow range of time &mdash; three or four years at best.  If the present Government were by any mischance to be re-elected &mdash; and I cannot see that happening &mdash; that window of opportunity will be slammed shut and the opportunity for Ireland to prosper in post-EMU Europe will be thrown away.</P>
    <P>We have seen what Labour has done with its pledges to control public spending.  It has cynically ripped them up every year.  There is no reason to believe that, if the Labour Party got back into office as part of the Rainbow or, by some disastrous set of circumstances, by wooing any other party into office with it, it would behave differently.  It is ingrained in the nature of the beast that it will always exceed its expenditure targets and never make the economic decisions that are necessary to sustain real development.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats is a party which is creating choice.  If these seats were occupied by others, if they were spread between Independents and the other parties in this House, the next election would be reduced to one single proposition &mdash; with whom would the Labour Party make the most beneficial electoral arrangement after the next election?  There will not be a Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil Coalition.  If we were not here, there would be one choice for the Irish people &mdash; to choose a mate for Labour.  Because we are here the people have a choice; it will be a straightforward choice.  It will not be a choice between extremes as some people like to characterise it. It will be a choice between sanity and insanity, between squandering and saving&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;between building a pro-jobs economy or squandering our growth in additional spending.  Over the next four years we will have the choice of matching Tony Blair's Labour Party taxation policies in England or failing to do so because we have a pre-Berlin Wall Labour Party in office in Ireland.  We will have a choice of doing in Ireland what the Labour Party did in New Zealand to transform the economy <Col N="993" /> seriously or to abandon that and allow Ministers Proinsias De Rossa and Dick Spring to continue with the squander-mania of an 8 per cent net increase in spending over the next few years.  We will have the choice of matching the tax rates that Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the Free Democrats are going to produce in Germany or carrying on with a 1 per cent change in the income tax rate every five years, which is the legacy of Labour.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt about the choice the people will make if that issue is put to them fairly and squarely.  I accept that this is an electoral budget, but it is an electoral budget that blows the whistle on an electoral year that will be decisive.</P>

I welcome today's budget from my heart because it shows clearly, as no speech of mine could do, how hopeless it would be to re-elect this Government or any Government in which the Labour Party has its hands on the levers of the economy.  It shows clearly how they will squander every opportunity to transform this country.  It shows that next year they will have another 8 per cent real net increase in public spending even though they will probably promise the electorate this summer they will do something radically different.  If Deputy Ryan is standing on his record I am glad this budget represents his best because the worst has been a lot worse.  If this amounts to the best, I face the next election with confidence and satisfaction that for once in recent years the Irish people will have a simple and straightforward choice put before them which they will make.</P>

      <P>(1)  That in this Resolution&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo; means the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972 (No. 22 of 1972);</P>

      <P>(3)  That the rate of flat-rate addition to prices of agricultural produce or agricultural services supplied by unregistered farmers be increased from 2.8 per cent. to 3.3 per cent., and that, accordingly, section 12A (inserted by the Value-Added Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978 (No. 34 of 1978)) of the Principal Act be amended by the substitution in subsection (1) of &ldquo;3.3 per cent.&rdquo; for &ldquo;2.8 per cent.&rdquo; (inserted by the Act of 1996).</P>
      <P>(4)  That this Resolution shall have effect as on and from the 1st day of March, 1997.</P>
      <P>(5)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>Resolution No. 1 relates to tobacco products. This involves an increase of 7p on a packet of 20 cigarettes and <i>pro rata</i> increases in other tobacco products.  It is expected to yield £14.9 million in 1997 and £17.6 million in a full year.  The consumer price index effect is estimated at 0.1 per cent.  There has been a fair degree of success with the tax stamps programme which is designed to deal with tax evasion in the cigarette area.  Consumption of cigarettes on which duty was paid increased by 1 per cent in the last 12 months.  A packet of cigarettes is 19p dearer in Northern Ireland than it is here at the moment.  As a result of this increase the differential will be 12p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resolution No. 2 refers to hydrocarbons.  Here the increase in duty on leaded petrol is 2.5p on a litre or 11.5p per gallon.  The increase in duty on super unleaded petrol, inclusive of VAT, is 2p per litre or 9p per gallon.  The increases in duty on <Col N="997" /> unleaded petrol, inclusive of VAT, amounts to 1.5p or 7p per gallon.  The increase in duty on autodiesel, inclusive of VAT, amounts to 1.5p per litre or 7p per gallon.</P>

      <P>Petrol is cheaper here than it is in Northern Ireland.  Leaded petrol will be approximately 5p per litre cheaper here after the increase.  Unleaded petrol will be 6p per litre cheaper here after the increase.  Leaded petrol prices decreased by nearly 15 per cent between 1987 and 1996 in real terms whereas inflation has been about 25 per cent up in real terms in the same period.  Unleaded petrol prices here have also decreased by 15 per cent over the same period.</P>
      <P>Resolution No. 3 relates to value added tax. This will increase the flat rate of farmers' rebate from 2.8 per cent to 3.3 per cent.  This is effectively due to the fact that farm output prices have fallen while input prices have not.  The net position of the farmers in terms of the differential between sales and inputs has disimproved and there is a justification for this increase in the VAT rebate.  The value added to products has decreased, therefore the value added tax rebate deserves on the formula to be increased.  This formula is revised every three years and the revision is substantial on this occasion.  The increase in the rebate for farmers is timely and significant.  Farmers clearly need some assistance because of falling product prices for many of the principal farm outputs, notably beef but also in milk prices.  I am sure Deputies understand the way the rebate works.  If they do not I can elaborate.  We are talking here about two measures of increase in taxation and one measure of reduction in taxation.</P>

      <P>The resolution on farming uses a formula that appears every year.  Will the Taoiseach indicate in value terms what this would mean to the agricultural community?  We know the difficulties being experienced.  The additional cuts announced last week will create further difficulties. What does the increase of 3.3 per cent mean and what will it provide by way of refunds based on the position in 1996?</P>
      <P>As Minister for Finance I imposed big increases on tobacco products.  Will the Taoiseach outline the assessment of what this measure will do in 1997?  How will it affect employment and consumption?  He stated that it will bring the differential between here and Northern Ireland to 12p or 13p, but that neither the Revenue Commissioners nor the Government consider this will create a great difficulty.</P>
      <P>I spent much of my time as Minister for Finance dealing with the stamp system.  It is not working.  It is difficult to avoid people selling non-stamped cigarettes on the streets.  I raised this matter last year and the previous year.  It goes on unabated, entailing a huge amount of cigarettes, despite the supposed involvement of drug barons, warehousemen and others.  In many parts of the city more cigarettes are sold on the streets than in the shops.  I am glad to see that the Taoiseach spent a considerable time yesterday visiting one such local community.  His visit was appreciated. Had he walked through the area with me he would have found that cigarettes could be bought cheaply on street corners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It demonstrates that the control of horses legislation is not working.  Nor are the stamping proposals working.  Shops which pay high rates are unable to sell cigarettes because thousands of packets are sold on the streets.  No attempt is being made to regulate this.  This was not the intention of the Government, of which I was the Minister for Finance, nor of the Revenue Commissioners, who researched the international situation when compiling their proposals.</P>
      <P>It may be a matter for the Revenue authorities or the Garda.  In the meantime, no serious attempt is being made to control this appalling problem.  Vast numbers of people are engaged in the selling of non-stamped cigarettes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not expect the Taoiseach to give his time to this, but he should ask his advisers or Government colleagues to take a walk through one or two streets of my constituency &mdash; the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, would know them well &mdash; and see where dozens of people sell cigarettes.</P>
      <P>Do such activities comply with the law?  Does it matter?  Are we imposing a percentage increase because it does not matter if hundreds of people are engaged in defying the law?  This was not the reason, as Minister, I introduced legislation.  At the time I had harsh words for some Members on the matter.</P>
      <P>I have only had the opportunity to raise this matter under Financial Resolutions in the past few years.  It is an appalling situation.  Will the Taoiseach outline the views of Revenue on the matter?  Can Revenue not get the Garda Síochána to act?  Does nobody walk through the main streets of the capital city to know what is going on?</P>
      <P>There is major disappointment with the budget outside the House and shock that the expectations which were raised gravely misled the public. Only tiny percentage changes have been made to the taxation position, entailing 1.5 per cent for those in middle income brackets.  The Government built up a false expectation of a huge tax package and then spread the package it produced very thinly.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach justify the increases of 11.5p for a gallon of leaded petrol, 9p for super unleaded petrol and 7p for leaded petrol and diesel? They filter through to the public and are a charge on transport.  Cars are no longer a luxury for the vast majority of people.  The increases are penal and are against the spirit of removing the burden of taxation.  They may appear lower when expressed in terms of litres, but this cannot disguise the size of the increases in terms of gallons, especially when the high powered cars of today use so much petrol.</P>
      <P>My colleagues from the Border areas will express their views on this issue.  The Government never appears to listen to anything regarding Border areas, indeed it does not have any Deputies from the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister of State tries to represent County Clare well, but people from the Border region are never listened to by the Government while those who attempted to make representations to Members have been ignored.  What is the Taoiseach's justification for this and what are his views on the costs to industry which these increases will impose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy's remarks on tobacco.  While I would not claim to <Col N="1000" /> be familiar with the sale of cigarettes, either duty or non-duty paid, there has been a 1 per cent volume increase in cigarette consumption, on which duty has been paid.  A very big increase in the sale of non-duty cigarettes, as suggested by the Deputy, would mean that there has been a big increase in cigarette consumption.  I do not believe this is happening.  Cigarette consumption appears to be stable; perhaps it is not falling as much as one would like but it is stable.</P>
      <P>There is good co-operation now between the Revenue and the Garda.  A year ago the Deputy would have been right, when this problem was more severe than today and there was not the kind of co-operation there should have been. However, there has been a higher number of seizures of illegally untaxed cigarettes and a higher number of prosecutions.  This can be documented. There is a review of the penalties to see if they can be increased and there is also a review as to whether additional powers are necessary to stamp out the problem completely.  Perhaps there should be a European Union initiative to deal with the issue of cigarettes on which duty is not paid.  That is all I have to say on the matter.  We will intensify efforts to deal with the problem but I believe the situation is improving.</P>
      <P>With regard to the value of VAT refunds to farmers, in 1996, on the basis of the existing rate of refunds &mdash; 2.8 per cent &mdash; the amount of VAT paid by unregistered farmers was £107.51 million on total sales of goods worth £2.8 billion.  The increase in the rate from 2.8 to 3.3 per cent will have a proportionate effect in increasing the amount of the refunds.  A figure for the total amount of the refunds which will result from such action is not available but I will endeavour to provide it to the Deputy later in the debate. However, a substantial sum of money will have been paid to unregistered farmers off a VAT bill of approximately £107 million to £110 million. Therefore, that will be substantially reduced.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also raised the issue of hydrocarbons. I am not altogether convinced by his concerns regarding the Border areas because the price of petrol is currently cheaper in the Republic than in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the increase in the duty on cigarettes because I recently produced an alternative budget which suggested a more stringent increase.  Therefore, I will not make an idiot of myself by stating I now oppose such an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> I agree with Deputy Ahern because during the first week of the 1989 general election campaign the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, stated he never realised that health was an issue.  This shows how one can become cut off from ordinary people.  If the Taoiseach visited the pedestrianised areas of north inner city Dublin to which Deputy Bertie Ahern referred, he would see droves of people selling illegal cigarettes.  The reason they are engaged in this activity is that a major market for such cigarettes exists and these people are not wasting their time.  I am worried not merely about the loss of revenue to the Exchequer but about the black market that is being created.  These markets are not dominated by the Sisters of Charity but serious black marketeers. The way such people protect their patch or enforce their rights in these markets is to break the legs, or worse, of their competitors.</P>
    <P>There is ample evidence that trading in cigarettes on which duty has not been paid is the preserve of some well organised crime bosses.  I am convinced that it could be stopped rapidly if there was a will to do so.  I am not suggesting the introduction of draconian measures but one would have to walk around with a paper bag over one's head to be unaware of the extent of this significant problem.  Such illegal trading is a source of crime, it induces people to become involved in crime and extends the influence of criminals. Many of those involved in the actual selling are not, by any stretch of the imagination, significant players in crime.  However, they are being induced into pyramids of illegality, at the top of which &mdash; the Taoiseach should not fool himself in this regard &mdash; are serious players.</P>
    <P>I support the change in relation to VAT.  It was almost inevitable that the Government would increase petrol prices because, in his budget, Kenneth Clarke, provided the opportunity to do so.  I do not believe that is a good enough reason for the increase because, between the various indirect tax changes being made, an inflation rate of 2.2 per cent is provided for in next year's Estimates which is too high.  Tourism, the creation of employment and inflation rates should have been given the benefit of the doubt in this regard and we should have organised our affairs to avoid the increase in petrol tax.  I agree with the Taoiseach as far as VAT and petrol are concerned but I disagree with him as regards cigarettes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to tobacco and cigarettes, does the Taoiseach not accept that a Government will eventually find it is at the point of diminishing returns?  Many people earn their living from the manufacture of tobacco products. The P.J. Carrolls factory in my home town has borne the brunt of problems relating to increases in excise duty on cigarettes in the past.  I accept the arguments that people should not smoke. However, there must be a better way to educate the public than by merely adding excessive amounts of excise duty each year which ultimately <Col N="1002" /> leads to the loss of jobs, as was the case at P.J. Carrolls in Dundalk.</P>
      <P>I agree with my party Leader in respect of the illegal trade in cigarettes.  The fact that people are involved in selling cigarettes on which duty has not been paid means that such a trade exists.  It is acknowledged that, for some unknown reason, there has been a huge increase in the consumption of cigarettes among young females.  The Government should attempt to curtail the illegal trade which is obviously where some of the major problems exist.</P>
      <P>With regard to petrol, the Minister of State recently referred to &ldquo;break for the border&rdquo; which represents the height of the knowledge of this Government regarding the problems in Border areas.  Deputy Carey was appointed a token Minister of State with responsibility for the Border areas because the Government, in appointing Ministers and Ministers of State, decided not to appoint anyone from the Border region.  What chance is there for Border areas as far as input at the Cabinet table is concerned?  It is indicative of the Taoiseach's lack of knowledge regarding the illegal trade on some streets in Deputy Bertie Ahern's constituency the he believes such a trade does not exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone with experience of the problem would inform the Taoiseach otherwise.</P>
      <P>The differential in the price of petrol sold north and south of the Border in favour of stations in the Republic has been minuscule.  Due to higher petrol prices in the South in the past, stations on the southern side of the Border had to compete with their counterparts on the northern side. Likewise, in recent years, northern stations have had to compete with their southern counterparts. The figures provided by Department of Finance officials may not be those which obtain in the Border areas.  This budget has obliterated the differential in favour of the southern side of the Border and helped petrol stations in the North. The overall returns from excise duties on petrol would be in the region of £40 million.  Instead of giving with one hand and taking with the other, why did the Government not reduce the overall pay out through tax cuts by £40 million, instead of raising it through the petrol increases?  This sleight of hand will affect the economy of the Border constituencies and will add hidden increased costs to haulage prices across the country. It is a detrimental act.  The Government had the opportunity not to touch petrol prices but unfortunately it did the opposite.  This must be because of the lack of knowledge of the Border area and lack of input by someone from that region.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGahon was in trouble when he intervened earlier so he should keep quiet.  While unemployment seems to be coming down nationally that is not happening in Louth and this budget hinders rather than helps the county, particularly the town of Dundalk.  The Taoiseach may feel he has helped other areas but he has hindered the Border constituencies and I say &ldquo;shame on him&rdquo;.  No one has taken cognisance of the fact that these towns along the Border have suffered more than most and will suffer as a result of this budget.  I defy Deputies on the other side who have knowledge of what I am saying to contradict me.  The Government must acknowledge that an extra 11.5 pence on a gallon of petrol will cause cars to go North again.</P>

      <P>It will &mdash; the Taoiseach does not know the position on the ground.  This increase is far bigger than the current differential in favour of southern petrol stations.  As of tonight, many people who formerly bought their petrol on the southern side of the Border will go northwards. Not only that, those who formerly came in their droves from the North to get petrol in my town will stop doing so.  Fine Gael and the other Government parties will pay the price for that, whether they like it or not.  When times were hard there may have been a reason for increasing the price of a gallon of petrol, but there is none at this point when the Minister, Deputy Quinn, says the country is awash with money.  The Government has done a disservice to the economy of County Louth and the Border area.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my cousin, the Minister for Finance, for listening to my entreaties on behalf of the workers in Carrolls and increasing the price of 20 cigarettes by only seven pence.  Deputy Ahern's Government never matched that.  It is a realistic increase and the industry accepts it. However, more attention should be given to the importation of illegal cigarettes.  This growth industry is taking place under the noses of the Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners and the Government.  Cigarettes are being openly sold on every street in Dublin, especially Henry Street.  Why has this illegal industry not been closed down?  There is a connection between that practice and the selling of drugs and the Revenue should turn its attention to that illicit trade.</P>
      <P>I repeat my annual criticism of the hypocrisy of all Governments who turn a blind eye to the drink trade and home in on the cigarette industry. I do not exhort anyone to smoke cigarettes because it is a definite health hazard but in every country more people die from the excesses of alcohol.  Drink is the most widely used drug in the world and kills more people than heroin, cocaine or any other hard drug.  Alcohol is responsible for more deaths and related illnesses than any other factor and the cigarette industry pales into insignificance beside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The glorification of drink is a problem in this country.  We are awash with drink and drinkrelated problems.  Children of 12 years of age are drinking and seductive advertising on television is at the root of the problem.  When young children are bombarded with advertisements every <Col N="1005" /> ten minutes which extol the goodness of Guinness and other drinks, is it any wonder that the number of children born out of wedlock is rising?  Is it any wonder that more and more people are falling prey to the ravages of alcohol?</P>
    <P>A survey in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> on wife beating in Dundalk showed an alarming number of victims.  I was present when President Robinson opened a residence for battered wives on Monday and there were hundreds of people waiting to get into it.  Those battered wives were not beaten by people who have problems with cigarettes but by people with alcohol related problems.  Yet, we turn a blind eye to alcohol and the damage it causes.  I do not advocate prohibition, rather a rein on the sale of alcohol because most social problems may be identified with drink.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government for recognising the annual extra burden placed on the cigarette industry and giving it some relief.  The Taoiseach should focus on the illegal trade in cigarettes which is carried out openly in Dublin and as a result of which the Revenue Commissioners have lost millions of pounds.  If our cigarette industry is to continue the Government must support the workers in this legitimate industry which pays its dues to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  Deputy McGahon referred to the bad times when people crossed the Border in droves to buy petrol in the North. That was the result of a decision by a Fine Gael Government, in which the Taoiseach was a Minister, to increase the price of petrol.  This is the second year in succession that the price of petrol has been increased.  Fianna Fáil Governments from 1987 resisted the temptation to increase the price of petrol because the economy of the Border region is sensitive to such increases.  At present, many people from the North are crossing the Border to fill their cars with petrol.  When they come across the Border they may stay for a few hours and spend money and this contributes to the economy of the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has no commitment to the Border region &mdash; all it pays is lip service to it.  I tabled a parliamentary question today asking the number of jobs from overseas firms created by IDA Ireland in the country in 1996 and the number of those in Counties Cavan and Monaghan. Out of 14,081 jobs created, 22 were in County Cavan and 25 in County Monaghan.  Taking into account the loss of jobs in overseas firms there is <Col N="1006" /> a net loss of 64 jobs in my constituency.  That is an indication of a Government's lack of commitment.</P>
    <P>This increase will have serious consequences for competitiveness in the Border region because higher transport costs will lead to an increase in the cost of all goods.  Last week the Minister for the Environment decided that motorists should pay for the provision of water in urban areas.  This Government is anti-motorist, anti-rural &mdash; people living in rural areas still have to pay for their water &mdash; and anti-Border.  The Taoiseach must address this matter urgently.  It is a major mistake to increase the price of petrol by 11.5p per gallon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>As a general observation on the budget day arrangements, it is unfair on the Opposition spokespersons, although the budget is well leaked, to have to speak on it at such short notice.  There should be a short recess so that the Opposition spokespersons may properly study the speech.</P>
      <P>I support my colleagues' comments on the increase in the price of petrol.  There would seem to be a lack of knowledge about the Border area. The Taoiseach's officials may be right that one can buy unleaded petrol at 64p or 65p per litre in mid-Ulster.  However, along the Derry Border one would pay 59.9p per litre while in Buncrana the price is 60.3p tonight and it will rise to 61.8p tomorrow morning.  Northern Ireland is being considered as a homogenous area and proper account is not being taken of the corridor along the Border where the competitiveness must be observed to understand the particular problems of the Border region.</P>
      <P>The small petrol stations in the Border region were not selling much petrol until about four years ago.  There had been little or no motor trade given the level of foreign imports and they returned to petrol retailing in a competitive manner. The Revenue Commissioners seem to be complacent about the Border petrol stations.  Is it the case that 70 per cent of the retail price goes to the Revenue Commissioners?  If that is so, the small Border stations contribute some £300,000 to £500,000.  A mistake is being made in relation to this small corridor along the Border.  The Taoiseach will be aware that three hypermarkets are scheduled to be built in Northern Ireland &mdash; in Derry, Newry and Belfast &mdash; in the next two years and they will automatically undercut the price of petrol.  This has not been taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unequal balance in the Border region raises the issue of IFI and EU funding.  When I asked why we get 20 per cent of EU funds while the North gets 80 per cent, and why we get 25 per cent of IFI funds while the North gets 75 per cent, I was told the figures are based on populations. If the Border region is to be put under further pressure it will not be long before the division of funds is 90 per cent to 10 per cent.  The small towns in the corridor along the Border had been <Col N="1007" /> doing reasonably well and the Taoiseach and his officials should be aware of the area's problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues from the Border region have spoken eloquently about the competitive disadvantage in which petrol retailers from that region have been placed in recent times.  That imbalance was redressed to some extent over the past 12 months but the competitive advantage which ensued as a result of various developments elsewhere has been obliterated in one fell swoop by a very substantial increase in duty on petrol.  This is simply a revenue raising measure.  It will erode the concessions outlined in other elements of the budget, is a substantial cost on business and will effect job creation.  It flies in the face of other taxation measures in this budget which were expressly included to encourage job creation.  It shows the lack of strategy and coherence which underlies this rickety edifice.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance advanced health considerations as one of the reasons for the increase in tobacco duty.  I am sick and tired of health being trotted out as an alibi for increases in tobacco duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government was seriously worried about the impact of tobacco consumption on health, it could increase duty to such an extent that consumption could be wiped out or it could be banned as other substances are banned.  This measure is directed at a handy target to gain revenue.</P>
      <P>I do not want to comment on the morality of it but there has been discussion about the extent of the illegal tobacco trade in Dublin.  I will give the Taoiseach figures to give him a flavour of the seriousness of the situation because, as Deputy McDowell said, some of the most nefarious people here are involved in the illegal cigarette trade.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach should know that the proceeds from this trade are funding other operations &mdash; drug dealing and its various ancillary activities, which includes the shooting of journalists.  Last year 3.5 million smuggled cigarettes valued at £530,000 were seized on the streets of Dublin which resulted in a loss to the Exchequer of £400,000 while 180 people were detected with illegal cigarettes in their possession.  How many convictions have there been?  There have been 17 convictions for smuggling and 11 for selling illegal cigarettes.  The fines imposed totalled £15,500. How seriously is the law being enforced in this area?  Will the Taoiseach reflect on those figures and bring them to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice bearing in mind that these activities are funding further activities of some of the most reprehensible people in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the flat rate VAT <Col N="1008" /> refund for unregistered farmers from 2.8 per cent to 3.3 per cent to compensate for the fact they are not registered for VAT but pay it on inputs. This is only one small glimmer of light in the gloom which surrounds the agriculture industry; an industry ridden by crisis and saddled with a Minister for Agriculture in whom nobody has the slightest degree of confidence.  I make those points to illustrate to the Taoiseach the extent to which some of the resolutions he proposes fly in the face of other measures in the budget and will achieve results which directly contradict what he is trying to achieve through other measures.  That indicates the budget is a &ldquo;mixum gatherum&rdquo; prepared by three parties, each getting what it could out of it as there is no coherent strategy or direction in it.  The benefits and allowances are spread far too widely and it will achieve nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be remiss of us if we did not object strongly to the increase in the price of petrol and diesel.  In 1983 the price increase of 16p per gallon devastated the Border region and it has not fully recovered since.  I remember bringing deputations to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, and his reply was that one cannot legislate for a region.  It is nonsense to talk about petrol being cheaper in the North.  The price of petrol is practically similar either side of the Border.  There is practically no variation in price.  It is ridiculous to add 11p to the price of a gallon of petrol and talk about breaks for Border areas.</P>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach get the report from his Minister of State on funding for Border regions?  Did he examine the returns from Forbairt and the IDA which show an 11 per cent reduction in the number of jobs in the Border region while there is a 16 per cent increase in the east?  From January 1995 to July 1996 in County Monaghan, 452 additional jobs were created while the Taoiseach said there were 24,000 extra people at work. There was a 12 per cent increase in jobs in Monaghan and a 6 per cent increase in Cavan.  The proof of success in any economy is jobs.  The Taoiseach on this occasion should have resisted such an increase.  The attitude in Fine Gael and the Labour Party seems to be it does not seem to make much difference in the peripheral regions because they will come along all right.</P>
      <P>I do not object to an increase in tobacco duty. I was at health board meetings attended by a number of specialists on throat cancer etc.  Having listened to them, I would feel like a hypocrite if I was to complain about the increase on tobacco products.  However, I strenuously object to the increase in the price of petrol and diesel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not smoke and I do not have a cigarette factory in my constituency.  Normally I would not give a damn whether 7p or 17p was added to the price of cigarettes but I am concerned about this in terms of the illegal cigarette trade which is a growing business.  It may be confined to certain parts of Dublin but it has gained <Col N="1009" /> a sizeable portion of the cigarette market.  While this part of the budget is designed to raise revenue, the big winners are those involved in organised crime because their profit margin is being increased.  I want a far greater crackdown on these people rather than adding to their profits.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said sales increased by 1 per cent last year.  Does he have figures for the past three or four years?  The market is not declining. If the economy grows by 5 per cent, perhaps people spend 5 per cent more on drink, clothing, furniture and tobacco but for those involved in illegal trade it is big business.  Some months ago someone told me that they walked down Henry Street and Mary Street from O'Connell Street to Capel Street and saw 38 people selling tobacco.  I agree with the Taoiseach that lately sellers are not as obvious on some city centre streets as they were a year ago.  There has been an attempt by the Garda to move them along, although some threats have been made against gardaí for doing so.  However, as someone else said, they have not gone away.  They may have gone from Talbot Street or Henry Street but they are now out in the housing estates.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte could tell us about that.</P>
      <P>We once used to get milk delivered to houses in Dublin every day but now cigarettes are being delivered to the door, albeit by courteous people in certain housing estates in Dublin.  That is a fact. If overall sales of cigarettes are going up I would be very surprised.</P>
      <P>This issue is discussed here every year and there is talk of stamping but the rules do not seem to be working.  Someone mentioned a strange court case the other day involving a judge's ruling which may throw out existing stamping regulations. Perhaps we could have some information on that and the repercussions.</P>
      <P>The budget is about raising revenue and the image being projected is that we have all done well today.  However, there is no point in talking about trying to crack down on crime for the rest of the year when big organised crime has to get its cut as well.  They will be big winners and that is very wrong.  There must be an extra effort to crack down on crime because big money is being made by criminals and the State is being defrauded.</P>
      <P>An additional 1.5p to 2.5p on petrol looks small but it is a different ball game when the extra cost is calculated per gallon.  Even the Minister for Finance said there will be an extra 0.2 per cent on the cost of living index which is basically 10 per cent of the forecast increase for the year.  That puts it in another context.  It is a sizeable increase in the cost of living but obviously it is bringing in money which, as usual, is needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I sat here for most of the day listening to the Minister for Finance and I wondered where all this money had gone to.  He told us how well the country is doing.  Many people would be <Col N="1010" /> furious about what the Minister was saying if they could have listened to the entire speech.  He painted a picture saying people have never been as well off in their lives.  The truth is that while the economy is on an upward turn and we are experiencing a boom, the benefits of that boom are being enjoyed by a small minority.  Many people still find it extremely difficult to live from day to day.  Many people are still paying for the things they bought at Christmas.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister said the country was a tremendous attraction for American investment. There are 424 American firms operating in the 26 counties and 16 of them are operating in the Border counties.  That gives one an idea of the deprivation and lack of balance that exists.  I am not pointing the finger just at this Government but we cannot allow that imbalance to continue. Foreign investment is important and we are happy to have it in the country.  Kildare has been lucky to attract some of the major players but in the interests of the country it is important to have a good spread in that investment.  Tough decisions will have to be made to ensure the proper balance is struck.</P>
      <P>I have heard Ministers before, including some from my own party when they have had to face the music, making comments on smoking similar to those of the Minister for Finance earlier today. I suppose there are only a few areas where one can look for the extra few pounds necessary to pay for the goodies on budget day, and today was no exception.  The Minister decided to increase the price of cigarettes and he mentioned health and environmental reasons.  I have said before in the House that if a Government was serious about the health of our nation it would ban cigarette advertising.  There is no knowing the cost of smoking financially, medically and environmentally. The tobacco industry is one of the most powerful in the world.  Its customers are dying every day so they have to recruit new ones to fill the vacuum.  Hence one has these sexy advertisements aimed at young people to make it look good and cool to smoke.  We allow this to continue despite the fact that we know the damage it is doing to our people.</P>

      <P>When one comes into the debate at this stage one faces the problem of repetition. When the budget is presented to the House there is a certain inevitability that public representatives from the Border counties will assess the impact of increases, particularly in the cost of cigarettes and fuel, and their potential for trade <Col N="1011" /> distortion.  The relationship between the price of fuel North and South has levelled out in comparison to the great disparity that existed some years ago when we had serious trade distortions.  Significant profits were made following a rush of trade northwards because the price of petrol in the North was much cheaper than here.</P>
      <P>Today's provision for increases must be seen in a broader context than the impact it will have in Border counties.  We are talking about increased freight charges, increased motoring costs for those going to work, and increased costs for a whole range of services provided daily in the economy.</P>
      <P>Petrol and diesel are essential ingredients in people's daily lives.  Motor power has become an integral part of our lives and we cannot get by without it.  The number of people who go to work on foot are few and far between.  Within the past ten days a spokesperson for one of the major insurance companies said we could expect an increase of up to 10 per cent in motor insurance costs over the next 12 months.  It is appropriate that the Minister of State with responsibility for the insurance industry, Deputy Rabbitte, is in the House.</P>
      <P>There has been a dismal failure to tackle the underlying causes of escalating insurance costs. When young drivers seek premium quotations, the insurance companies do not want to see them. Young people in their early twenties have to go to work.  They need driving licences and car insurance but they have to pay enormous sums for such cover.  It is an area we have failed dismally to tackle and it needs to be tackled urgently.  The increase we are talking about must be seen in that context.</P>
      <P>Within the past ten days the Government decided on an alternative system for financing local authorities.  It seems that motor taxation will be its principal source of revenue.  It is not unreasonable to assume that the anticipated demand by local authorities for more revenue will lead to an increase in motor taxation.  The motorists have had a bad fortnight.  Deputy Leonard said that people in rural areas must pay increased water charges.  They will now have to pay the increases in motor taxation and insurance premiums &mdash; we have not tackled the problems in the insurance industry &mdash; as a result of this budget.</P>
      <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Dermot Ahern and Deputy McGahon about this further imposition on the tobacco and cigarette industry, although it is no longer popular to defend that sector.  It was an important industry in the Louth constituency because it was the backbone of the local economy.  Although the numbers employed in it have declined, this provision will accelerate its demise.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to Financial Resolutions Nos. 1 and 3 but I strongly object to Financial Resolution No. 2 which deals with <Col N="1012" /> motor fuel.  In the age of global markets and with the imminence of economic and monetary union, it is more vital than ever that we maintain and improve the competitiveness of Irish industry. Private sector businesses, particularly in the exporting sector, generate the wealth which is needed to create jobs, to sustain our public services and to pay for improvements in our social welfare system.  This budget does little to promote the competitiveness of Irish industry but the increase in duty on petrol and diesel is a particularly retrograde and unnecessary step.  It imposes increased costs on virtually every firm in the country and makes it more expensive for Irish companies to do business.</P>
      <P>It also imposes extra costs on private motorists. As far as they are concerned, what the Minister is giving with one hand he is taking away with the other.  The same holds true for public transport users.  An increase in fuel prices must inevitably translate into an increase in fares.  At a time of record tax buoyancy, it seems incredible that the Minister for Finance should seek to impose an increase in indirect taxation in this vital and sensitive area which will have such an impact on competitiveness. The additional costs arising from this not alone affect our exporters but they also affect many companies that are competing with companies in Britain and elsewhere which are exporting into this country.  The unnecessary raising of this tax must be condemned.</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach how he justifies this continuous imposition of tax increases every year on hydrocarbons, particularly petrol, diesel and heavy fuel oil which are essential to our competitiveness, when his Government refuses to increase taxation on drink.  Is it because of the strength of the publican lobby?  The publicans introduced their own budget in early December, which is a convenient time to do it.  Strangely, every publican agreed on the same day at the same time to increase the price of drink by the same amount.  I have no doubt it was just coincidence that 11,000 publicans had the same thought at the same hour on the same day and that it was not collusion or anything of that nature.  It was not an illegal anti-competitive practice, as I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, will assure the Taoiseach.  Why were they allowed to introduce their own budget to pre-empt what might happen here tonight?  Is that why it is not happening here tonight and why increases have been imposed on something which has a great effect on the competitiveness of Irish industry and, therefore, on employment?  An increase in the excise duty on drink, particularly on spirits, has no effect on the competitiveness of Irish industry.  It is ignored for some reason about which we can speculate.</P>

      <P>I am not opposing Financial Resolution No. 1 because, apart from the fiscal <Col N="1013" /> benefits, there are valid reasons the duty on tobacco should be increased.  However, they are equally valid as far as the duty on drink is concerned, particularly the duty on spirits.  Nevertheless, drink is exempt every year under this Government.  As far as tobacco is concerned, it is a matter of regret to me and to several Deputies who have spoken here tonight that we seem to have three markets in tobacco products: the official duty paid one, the official duty free one and the unofficial duty free one where the price level of vast numbers of cigarettes sold in this country is between the two.  People get the wrong idea about the significance of duty because when they buy duty free tobacco products in official Aer Rianta duty free outlets, the profit margin is so enormous they think the duty is not as high as it is.  The profit margin at duty free level in Aer Rianta shops in airports is disgracefully high; it is approximately 300 per cent.  They can afford to profiteer like that because of the abnormally high level of duty.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that diesel and petrol are targeted and other things are ignored when it comes to increasing excise duty.  I deplore both from a competitive and a health point of view the Government's choice of priorities.  It is wrong and anyone who looks at the matter objectively knows it is wrong and damaging.  The Revenue Commissioners and customs operate fairly and equitably.  I cannot understand why they do not enforce the law against those who sell duty free products, particularly tobacco products.  The law is not being enforced and it is widely known that it is flagrantly disregarded.  I have considerable faith in the Revenue Commissioners, having pursued one area where a particular Department failed in its responsibility for certain activities while the Revenue Commissioners did not.  This is why it disappoints me that duty free tobacco products are illegally sold so widely in this country.</P>
      <P>The Government should rethink this matter. There are other ways of raising excise other than by making our already uncompetitive situation more so.  One only has to look at personal taxation on both sides of the Border to realise that. The only reason we have retained thousands of jobs on this side of the Border is people are afraid to move North.  If they were not afraid they would have left in their droves.  Who would manufacture in Dundalk, with the tax rates imposed on their employees, if they could manufacture in Newry? If the IRA had sense, we could have a different situation to the one we have now.  Advantage is being taken of that, particularly on hydrocarbons, which is one of the most vital areas where competitiveness arises.</P>

      <P>I also object to the price increases in petrol and diesel.  I may repeat what has been said, especially in the contributions of other Deputies from Border counties, but it cannot be said often enough.  People do not appreciate how we feel or understand what it is like to <Col N="1014" /> live close to the Border and the difficulties which arise.  We are often told we are peripheral.  Petrol stations in the Border areas have gone out of business because they were less competitive than those in Northern Ireland.  Recently, they set up business again in places on the Border, such as Lifford or Muff.  They are not only nice to look at, but also give employment.  However, they are under threat from the increases in the budget.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has been in Donegal and knows how far away it is from here.  A car is not a luxury but is essential.  I do not have to go beyond my home town to see this.  The local ESB shop has been closed and it is necessary to travel a long distance to pay bills.  People in the Moville area have to travel to court by car as the court cannot be accommodated there.  What commitment is the Taoiseach giving to rural Ireland, especially to those in Donegal?</P>
      <P>We need employment but this budget will not encourage its creation.  Every big business in Donegal incurs high travel costs as it must travel long distances.  Perhaps we would rely less on roads if we had pier development.  We are looking to employment.  Reported increases in employment made a big splash.  However, in Inishowen, employment has decreased and unemployment has increased.  Car owners who go to work are now being penalised, both those who are working in the county and those who are crossing the Border. What was in the budget today for the cross-Border worker?  One of the biggest employers in my area is the fishing industry.  Did we get big grants for renewing the fleet in this budget?  No, we got fuel increases.</P>
      <P>Donegal needs positive discrimination to maintain job creation, basic day-to-day living, existing employment and current competitiveness.  It does not need the petrol increases of today, the threatened car tax increases promised down the line and the further increases already announced by insurance companies.  If we do not get positive discrimination our livelihoods and businesses will be not only threatened but crippled.  I ask the Taoiseach to rethink the increases in diesel and petrol prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember this night last year when the same argument was made on hydrocarbons and petrol.  We spoke about a 10p per gallon increase on petrol and we are, unfortunately, doing so again tonight.  I know the Taoiseach may not like to listen to the argument but the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, knows the one worry we have is our ability to maintain competitiveness within our economy. Whether the Government likes it or not, we have a structural problem, unlike all our EU partners, in that we are an island.  We will always have a problem with transport costs in delivering our goods to the continent.  In every report that has been written, it has been singled out as a cost which does not have to be borne on the goods of other countries in the EU.  I cannot understand <Col N="1015" /> why we create our own artificial costs by imposing further penalties on the transport sector. It does not make sense.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to say that the differential between us and the UK is closer than it was because our transport costs need to be substantially lower than those of our competitors in Europe.  It is not good enough to say that just because the margin of difference has declined in recent years we should clap ourselves on the back.  Any company exporting from this country will speak easily and quickly about the costs that transport imposes on their competitiveness in the marketplace.  Ireland does not have the road network which exists in many other European countries.  I am glad to say our road network is improving but the cost of moving goods even within the island is substantially higher than in most EU countries because their transport systems are far more advanced than ours.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the drinks industry.  I cannot understand why the Government did not seize the opportunity to do something about the socalled soft alcoholic drinks available in the marketplace, hooch and hotshots.  These drinks are not aimed at the mature drinker but at creating a new younger market of 15, 16 and 17 year olds. The alcoholic content of those drinks is substantially higher than most of the ordinary ales and beers.  My view, which is probably extreme, is that they should not be on sale and should not be allowed in the marketplace.</P>

I feel strongly about this.  The Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and most Deputies would be aware of the problems that are beginning to emerge because of the availability of those products and the way they are targeted.</P>
      <P>I cannot complain too much about the tobacco industry, being one of the few heavy smokers, non-tipped, left in this House.  I sincerely hope the relationship between the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners can be improved in respect of the detection of non-duty products available in the market because, if what I am hearing is true &mdash; that the people who sell these products in the Dublin area have a real grip &mdash; it is inevitable they will flood the cities of Waterford, Limerick, Cork and Galway with their merchandise.  Once the problem moves out of Dublin it will become unstoppable.  I hope the right message will go out loud and clear from this House and that we can kill this market before it reaches a profitable level.</P>

      <P>Average costings will be increased by 10 per cent and those supplying goods to the various outlets will have to pass on the charges.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is foolish. If one is in the business of supplying diesel oil and petrol one has to pass on the price increase.  That is the rule of thumb in business. In this case transport costs will be increased by approximately 10 per cent and there will be a 6 per cent increase in insurance costs because of the high cost of claims.  In other words, manufacturing and transportation costs will be substantially increased.  I am concerned because the increased costs will be passed on to the consumer. Let there be no doubt about that, there will be substantial increases in transport costs which will be passed on.  It will affect employers and employees.  In my constituency many people travel up to 30 miles to and from their place of employment and they will incur substantial costs. Even allowing for the tax benefits they will receive there will be a clawback at the other end. My main concern is that transportation costs will be added to the cost of the goods.</P>
      <P>I hope the Revenue Commissioners will have tighter controls over the tobacco industry because we are led to believe that tobacco and other products of that nature are sold illegally on the market.</P>

      <P>It may not be politically correct to query the almost annual price increase in tobacco products.  There is no cigarette factory in my constituency.  We have had price increases in tobacco products every year since I came here, some savage and some not so bad.  The conventional line of the Department and the Minister for Finance was that it was for health reasons and not to raise revenue.  The Government always made the case that it was looking after the health of the nation and that that was its motivation in increasing the duty.  To a certain extent I take that with a grain of salt.  The statistics for the past eight or ten years indicate that if the policy was to curtail the consumption of cigarettes and tobacco products generally it has failed miserably.  It has succeeded in enriching the State coffers but there is evidence to suggest an ever increasing consumption of cigarettes and tobacco products; unfortunately the evidence shows the increased consumption is greatest among younger people. When we increase the cost of cigarettes we give ourselves a pat on the back in the hope that the health of the nation will be improved.  We have allowed that to blind us to the fact that that policy alone, as a means of curtailing the consumption of tobacco products, has failed miserably and it is about time we examined it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to Financial Resolution No. 2 which concerns price increases of petrol and <Col N="1017" /> diesel.  I will not repeat what has been said by Deputies Keaveney and McDaid in relation to the effect this will have on Border counties.  This motion is another example of the anti-motorist bias of the Government which we have seen on a number of occasions.  If returned to power this Government will impose tolls on the C ring road and on the Lee tunnel.  That is clear because it voted against the motion we tabled.  This resolution will take £37 million out of the pockets of motorists, a sector of the community which already pays £1.7 billion to the Exchequer in taxes.  Water charges have been abolished but, despite the impression being given by Deputies opposite, they will have to be paid for.  This increase is the first instalment in the payment for the abolition of water charges.  Taxpayers will pay a second instalment of £78 million next year when motor tax will be increased by 3 per cent and a further instalment of £156 the following year. They will have to pay a bill of £270 million over the next two years.  There is always one measure in a budget which rebounds badly on the Government and I predict that motorists will not accept this increase.</P>

      <P>The debate is perhaps not as serious in the minds of some speakers as it ought to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to reply to the substantial points made during the debate.  The first concerns the street selling and smuggling of cigarettes.  Deputy O'Dea raised questions on this matter to which I would like to reply.  During the past 12 months <Col N="1018" /> there has been a very substantial increase in the level of enforcement of the law on illegal cigarette selling.  This was acknowledged by Deputy Ahern, the only Deputy to do so; others tried to pretend that nothing had happened during the past year.  I would like to give evidence of this increased enforcement.</P>
    <P>In 1995 there were only five proceedings instituted for cigarette smuggling, while in 1996 50 prosecutions were instituted for the same offence.  Of the 50 prosecutions instituted, 17 resulted in convictions, 14 were adjourned and 24 are awaiting hearing.  This explains the statistics quoted by Deputy O'Dea who seemed to suggest that 50 proceedings were instituted and there were only 17 convictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The rest of the cases have either been adjourned or are awaiting hearing.</P>
      <P>On the question of the street selling of cigarettes, in 1995 no proceedings were instituted whereas in 1996 81 proceedings were instituted. To date there have been 11 convictions, three cases have been adjourned and 67 cases are awaiting hearing.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The bulk of the cases have not yet come to court and, therefore, the statistics quoted by Deputy O'Dea deserve to be qualified.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that this indicates significant action in regard to illegal cigarette selling.  The increase of 1 per cent in duty paid cigarette sales over the past 12 months also indicates that people are buying duty paid cigarettes in increased volumes.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the excise duty on petrol.  The excise duties in the UK budget were greater than the excise duties in our budget.  The differential in favour of the Republic has been improved as a result of the two budgets rather than disimproved.  However, having listened to the Deputies opposite one would not think this was the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDaid threw some light on the matter when he referred to the possible misleading nature of comparisons of petrol prices in, say, Portrush and Ballymena with those in Muff or Carrickmacross.  He said that the relevant price to quote is the one in the contiguous town on the other side of the Border where a more competitive approach is adopted to petrol sales in order to win custom from this side of the <Col N="1019" /> Border than might apply in Ballymena or Portrush which are distant from the Border.  This is true, but the same considerations also apply on this side of the Border.  If people can compete in Keady they can also compete in Carrickmacross; if people on the other side of the Border can try to win business then people on this side of the Border can also do so.  There is nothing to stop them from doing so, particularly as the differential in duty in this budget combined with the British budget has moved in favour of petrol sellers on this side of the Border.  One of the problems may be that because petrol prices were traditionally higher here than north of the Border there was a habit on the other side of the Border of marketing petrol with a view to winning custom from the South.  That habit may not have developed to the same degree on this side of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are trends in the petrol retailing business <Col N="1020" /> which may be of interest to Deputies.  In order to attract people to large shopping centres in some cities and towns operators sell petrol at a very low price with virtually no profit.  This is apparently happening in Belfast and it draws people to that area.  If it happened in Dublin where the retail sector is much more dynamic than it is in Belfast it could have the net effect of drawing custom away from smaller stations.  Many of the remarks made by Deputies have more to do with the problems of smaller petrol stations, regardless of whether they are on the Border, comparative to larger distribution centres.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> This Financial Resolution provides for an increase in stamp duty charged on the transfer of second-hand and certain new residential property where the amount upon which the stamp duty is chargeable is in excess of £150,000.  The rate is 6 per cent at present.  It is proposed to introduce three new rates; these are 7 per cent on residential property valued between £150,000 and £160,000, 8 per cent on residential property valued between £160,000 and £170,000 and 9 per cent on residential property valued in excess of £170,000.</P>
    <P>The background to this is that the Government announced the abolition of residential property tax last month.  The purpose of these measures is to replace the revenue lost by the abolition of residential property tax.  The yield from the measures proposed here is expected to be £11 million in 1997 and £13.5 million in a full year. This compares with the 1997 revenue that would have been obtained from residential property tax of £14 million.  Therefore, there is a slight loss of approximately £500,000.</P>
    <P>There may be many Members who may be tempted to criticise this proposal but I would ask them whether they would prefer to have residential property tax continue.  I think the answer would be &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  There may also be many vague and general suggestions as to how one might replace lost revenue from the abolition of residential property tax.  It falls to the Government to introduce a specific fair measure for this purpose, one that perhaps will have some modest effect in dampening down the increase in house prices, something to which I am sure nobody would object in view of the inflation risks flowing therefrom.</P>
    <P>No doubt there will be a number of questions Members will want to raise in the course of the debate on this resolution.  For example, the question of mixed properties may arise where part of the property is a shop and part is residential.  The test will be the one used for rating purposes.  If a property is rated as a commercial one, the portion of the house rated as commercial will not be included in the total for calculating stamp duty for the purposes of this section which applies to residential property.  There may be other questions which Deputies may wish to raise during the debate and I will be happy to provide answers.</P>
    <P>In the case of guesthouses, registered ones will be considered to be business premises and will not be subject to the residential stamp duty regime.  However, unregistered premises will not be in the same category.  Obviously, this will create an incentive to register properties so that they will not be categorised as residential properties for the purpose of the tax.</P>
    <P>A problem which might arise as regards the treatment of a farm with a substantial home is that the purchaser and the seller will separate the payments being made in respect of the residential portion of farm premises.  The residential portion will be subject to stamp duty in this instance but <Col N="1036" /> the non residential farm portion will not be.  That is a matter which can be dealt with adequately by the relevant arrangements and by virtue of agreement between the purchaser and the seller.  The arrangements reached will, in most instances, be acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners because there will be a divergence of interest as regards the apportionment of the purchase price between the purchaser and the seller.  Any agreement reached between them on the matter is likely to be approximately valid because of their divergence of interest.</P>
    <P>There may be some who will claim the level of stamp duty will be particularly high in comparison with other countries.  Some may, for example, quote the British rate.  In Britain residential property bears a council tax which does not apply here.  That tax must be paid every year, not only at the time of sale.  When comparing the stamp duty of 1 per cent in Britain with that here, one should also add the cumulative effect of paying council tax of somewhere in the region of £1,000 per year, which adds up to a much larger sum of money over a period.  Stamp duty on property in Belgium is 12.5 per cent and other countries also have high rates.</P>
    <P>The final argument which decides that this is the right course to follow is that by making these changes in stamp duty, which are only payable if people decide to sell their house &mdash; one has a choice &mdash; and which are only paid once in the normal lifetime unless one frequently buys and sells houses, we have been enabled to abolish residential property tax.  There has been much complaint about this tax.  I have no doubt many Opposition Members were looking forward to campaigning on this issue and may have already printed literature which they will find is null because the Government has acted.</P>
    <P>The Government is acting in accordance with the wishes of the majority of people.  It is substituting a simple tax, stamp duty, for a very complicated one, residential property tax, or a certain tax for an uncertain one.  The Government has made a good decision on this matter and I have no doubt the House and the country will approve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House will vehemently oppose the introduction of this iniquitous stamp duty.  The Taoiseach made the case that he has generously removed residential property tax and that this is a replacement.  Why do we need a replacement for what was an unjust tax which should never have been imposed?  It was an ideological plaything of the Labour Party which first introduced it.  It was an unfair form of taxation and the Government was merely responding to pressure from this side of the House for its removal, and rightly so.  It brought in about £13 or £14 million.  Why do we need another tax to replace it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to today's figures, overall expenditure for the year will be £13.584 billion.  This Government has lost control of the public finances.  It came to Government on a commitment <Col N="1037" /> that Estimates would not rise by more than inflation plus 2 per cent.  In the period it has been in office inflation has been 6.5 per cent and public expenditure has risen by 20 per cent.  Surely with £13.5 billion it was possible for the Government to find savings to balance the loss of approximately £13 or £14 million when removing the iniquitous and unjust residential property tax?  I do not deny that some will be able to afford to pay this tax, but it will mainly hit those who cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>In the case of a family home, if one or both parents retire and wish to move into a nursing home or a care facility, they will try to sell their home and will look for the best possible price. That price will be dramatically hit by the introduction of this tax.  We are not talking about small amounts of money.  In the Dublin region and residential areas elsewhere, a £170,000 house is not a massive one.  However, we are talking about stamp duty of £15,300 on such a house and approximately £10,500 on a house worth £150,000 which will affect the price a person will get for their property because the purchaser will have to pay.  The price of houses will drop accordingly and those who borrowed and invested in doing up their property and who want to move on for various reasons, whether they are elderly or wish to buy elsewhere, will find that the second-hand house market will be badly hit by the introduction of this measure.</P>
    <P>Property tax should never have been introduced and I find it wrong that the Taoiseach should try to link stamp duty with it.  If the Government did its business properly we would not have this £13.5 billion level of expenditure and in calculating the Estimates it should have been in a position to find savings without having to impose this unjust increase in stamp duty.  It is a totally unfair form of taxation and will have very damaging effects on the property market.</P>
    <P>It will especially hit many of our older citizens and their families who want to sell what has been the family home for many years, the nest egg bought at a lower price.  Many would not have had to pay property tax because their incomes would have excluded them from it.  Their nest eggs are being damaged by this Government to the extent of £15,000 or £10,000 in some cases.</P>
    <P>It is not a case of hitting the wealthy.  For example, I was in an estate last night in my constituency of Dublin North where houses which sold two years ago for £75,000 to £80,000 are now worth up to £150,000.  This is an unfair form of taxation.  In removing the unfair residential property tax, the Government should not have replaced it with an equally unfair system, as it has on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to what Deputy Ray Burke said.  I would take it seriously if his party in Government had not dramatically extended residential property tax, lowered the income threshold and extended it to apply to tens of thousands of houses which were previously <Col N="1038" /> exempt from the tax.  It goes against the grain to take seriously Deputy Burke's comment that residential property tax is an unjust tax which should never have been imposed.</P>
      <P>I wonder where Fianna Fáil was from 1987 to 1994?  Did anyone notice and does Deputy Burke remember that it was in a variety of Governments: a minority one and a coalition one with the Progressive Democrats and latterly with the Labour Party.  During the life of the Fianna Fáil minority Government, there was no suggestion that residential property tax would be abolished.</P>
      <P>As people got the exciting whiff of a general election, we have had the spectacle in recent months of various members of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties running an &ldquo;abolish residential property tax&rdquo; campaign.  Public meetings were held.  Trees were demolished to generate the paper required for the glossy leaflets put in people's doors.  &ldquo;Vote for us at the next election&rdquo;, they said, &ldquo;and we will abolish residential property tax&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Burke forgot in his speech tonight and what Deputy Michael McDowell and Deputy O'Donnell in my constituency forget is that the nation has not been struck by collective amnesia and there are quite a number, if not the vast majority, of people who remember that Fianna Fáil was in Government for the period I mentioned.  They can even recall the brief but unhappy sojourn of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties together.  During that Government, did anyone suggest abolishing residential property tax?  What did they do about it? We were told by Deputy Burke tonight that it is an unjust tax which should not have been imposed.  It was not only imposed but maintained and extended by Fianna Fáil in Government.</P>
      <P>I know it is usual that late on budget night people lose the run of themselves to some extent and try and think of something to say so they can stand up and be noticed.  I have a great deal of respect for Deputy Burke and for the issues he sometimes raises but his contribution on this issue is the caricature example of playground politics. It is the sort of thing that brings politics into disrepute. He said that, if the Government was doing its business properly, it could have abolished residential property tax without imposing any increase in stamp duty.  Is he suggesting his Government when he was Minister did not do its business properly because it failed to abolish it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As someone who represents the Dublin South constituency, residential property tax has been seen by many of my constituents as an unjust and unfair tax and a great burden.  People whose houses did not fall into the tax net some years ago watched the value of their houses increase notionally and suddenly found themselves falling into the net and being discriminated against, effectively because they lived in Dublin.  It was an anti-Dublin tax which affected many middle income families in Dublin who had large mortgages in that they struggled to meet the demands of the tax.  I welcome the Government's abolition <Col N="1039" /> of the residential property tax.  It has behaved correctly in abolishing it.  I would have liked to have seen it abolished a long time ago and regret that other parties in Government did not have the wit to take that action.  The Government deserves to be congratulated for doing so.</P>
    <P>As regards the increase in stamp duty, we should, in some future budget, seek a general review of stamp duties on all types of properties, how they apply and the rates of the duties.  I am pleased there has been a modification of the original proposal for the increase in stamp duty which seemed to suggest that, once a house was sold for a sum in excess of £150,000, it was immediately liable for the 9 per cent rate.  That would have been unjust and would have created the possibility that, if a house was bought for £149,500, stamp duty would be 6 per cent and, if it was sold for £150,500, £4,500 more stamp duty would have to be paid.  The Government was right to modify its original proposal and to introduce a graduated scale.  I would have preferred the graduation to be of a somewhat greater degree.</P>
    <P>However, Deputy Burke cannot have it both ways.  In the context of abolishing residential property tax, the Government has sought an alternative or replacement source of income to meet essential outgoings and to allow the Government give in a responsible way to a great many people as a result of this budget the various other reliefs and benefits which will derive.  I have no doubt that, if residential property tax had been abolished with no alternative source for raising finances, the Government would have been accused by the other side of irresponsibility for not producing some alternative revenue source.</P>
    <P>We should take with a grain of salt Deputy Burke's strictures.  If he and members of his party, or any member of the Progressive Democrats who may wish to contribute on this issue, had sufficient good grace and acknowledged the problems of their periods in Government, they would rapidly congratulate the Government on abolishing residential property tax.  For the sake of avoiding embarrassment, it should move on to other budgetary issues rather than focus on this issue.  I have no difficulty with the Government directing the spotlight on the reality that it has got rid of residential property tax, which is welcomed by thousands of people throughout the country, many of whom are my constituents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Fianna Fáil's attitude to residential property tax, I very much welcome the Government's decision to abolish that tax.  The Government has done a U-turn because it was a Fine Gael-Labour Government that introduced that tax, which was a draconian measure.  When we were in Government with Labour that party insisted, as part of the budgetary negotiations, that residential property tax should be increased and broadened, but our party was reluctant to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter has left the Chamber, but being involved in the legal profession he knows probably better than anyone that stamp duty is a penal taxation.  It is one of the most draconian taxes in <Col N="1040" /> our system.  People buying second hand houses cannot believe the amount of money they have to fork out on stamp duty.  If there was so much largesse &mdash; this goes back to the earlier debate on petrol increases &mdash; why did the Government introduce this measure, which will yield £13.5 million in a full year?  People living in Dublin know that an ordinary house on the north side of the city costs in the region of £150,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>People should go to the west side of Dublin.  That is where the boom is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Houses in Drumcondra, Phibsboro and other places which cost £80,000 a couple of years ago now cost £140,000 to £150,000.  I remarked recently that one would buy two houses in my town for the price of one that was for sale in Drumcondra.  This is another Dublin tax, and that is one of the reasons I live in Dundalk.</P>
      <P>Stamp duty affects couples, particularly in Dublin, who are not necessarily wealthy but who try to better themselves by moving to another house.  Those people do not have money to burn.  A person buying a house in Drumcondra for £150,000 will have to pay £10,500 in stamp duty while stamp duty on a house worth £160,000 will be £12,800 and on a house worth £170,000 it will be £15,300.  That is an incredible tax.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter alluded to the fact that when the Government announced this measure it said that stamp duty on houses worth more than £150,000 would be 9 per cent, but there has been a change of heart and I wonder why.  As Deputy Shatter said, there has been a very meagre tapering of the figure.  The measure should have been introduced more equitably, with a broader band. There is a huge gap between the 4 per cent rate and the 6 per cent rate for houses worth less than £150,000 &mdash; most houses are in the 4 to 6 per cent bracket.</P>
      <P>I put down a parliamentary question today to the Minister for Finance about the implications for inflation of house prices and I received a very interesting reply.  It stated that the annual rates of increase for new and second hand houses for the first quarter of 1994 and the third quarter of 1996 show that house prices have risen significantly in the past two years.  I question the figure produced tonight for the yield from this tax, which will not only increase the price of first hand houses but will make it more difficult to sell second hand houses.  The tax take will be greatly increased because of the huge demand for second hand houses in some of the better areas in Dublin where prices are significant.  A person buying a house in Drumcondra for £150,000 will need money to renovate the house, but they will have to pay £10,500 on stamp duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy know somebody who owns a house in Drumcondra?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might know more than I do.  The reply to my parliamentary question gave the year on year percentage increases in the <Col N="1041" /> price of second hand houses.  In the first quarter of 1994 the increase was 6.8 per cent while in the last quarter it was minus 0.3 per cent.  In the first quarter of 1995 the increase was 0.5 per cent while in the last quarter of 1995 it was 13.1 per cent.  In the first quarter of 1996 the increase was 10 per cent while in the third quarter of 1996, the latest figures available, it was 18.2 per cent.  There has been a huge increase in the price of second hand houses with the result that many ordinary houses will be liable for this punitive tax.</P>
      <P>As with petrol, the Government has made a mistake with stamp duty.  As Deputy McCreevy often says, Governments make mistakes &mdash; I think the Taoiseach is well aware of mistakes made in budgets, but we will not remind him of that.  As opposed to tax increases, the increase of 11.5p on a gallon of petrol sticks out like a sore thumb to people looking at the 9 o'clock news tonight.  People buying a second-hand house, particularly in Dublin, will look at this decision with a jaundiced eye.  What the Government is doing is replacing one Dublin tax with another.  It would have been cuter to bury in the overall figure for give-aways in the budget the £16 million which it cost to abolish residential property tax. That would have been much more equitable, but the Government will have to live with the consequences. There has been a dramatic increase in house prices in the past two years and the Government is adding to that a penal tax.</P>

      <P>It is beyond me to take in the 14 pages of this resolution in an hour or two.  I hope the Revenue Commissioners spend a long time on it.  Apart from its length, one aspect of it strikes me as rather unfair, that the resolution shall have effect as regards instruments executed on or after 23 January provided that it will not apply in regard to an instrument executed prior to 1 April in pursuance of a contract evidenced in writing prior to 23 January.  In other words, one could have a contract signed tonight provided one's conveyance is dated prior to 1 April.  Not every sale is closed in that timescale and it is not anybody's fault that many sales do not do so.  Any contract entered into on or before today should be stamped at the existing rate irrespective of the date of conveyance.  The level of stamp duty here is so incredibly penal that it is something of an incentive to resort to all the sorts of devices used in relation to stamp duty.  It is incredibly penal that we have a rate of tax, however one might seek to justify it in domestic terms, that is nine times greater than the corresponding tax elsewhere.</P>

      <P>At least there is some merit in the removal of the residential property tax, which I acknowledge, but it is interesting that the two parties which are represented here tonight and the Labour Party, which is never represented here when these types of topics are up for discussion, should have decided that they were not prepared to fight the next general election on the basis of the residential property tax.  However, what they claim to have substituted may, in the long-term, cause at least as many difficulties and injustices as the residential property tax ever created.  I am not sure this is the right way to approach it.  I do not believe that I or anyone else in this House can claim to understand the full meaning and nuances of this 14 page financial resolution. Certainly at short notice and without the benefit of advice from people who have had days to go over it, I cannot understand all the nuances. They may be more considerable than we believe. I am particularly mystified by the references to the vendor's estimate of the amount and vendee's estimate of the amount.  I have never heard of a vendee.  He is normally called the purchaser and I do not know why he cannot be called that here, if he is a purchaser or he may be something else.</P>

      <P>I find it particularly difficult that transfers <i>inter vivos,</i> for no consideration, within a family are subject to half this rate.  That may not be fully realised, but it is the case under the terms of this financial resolution.  This means that a family house being transferred from, say, a father to a son or to a daughter, if valued at £170,000, is subject to 4.5 per cent stamp duty, which is a penal rate for a voluntary disposition within a family.  It is rather unfair because it is <Col N="1044" /> not something someone voluntarily undertakes as one does when one purchases a property.  It is something that one feels one has no option but to be involved in.  That is regrettable and it should be drawn to people's attention that an <i>inter vivos</i> transaction is liable to half the level of duty imposed here on a conveyance for value.  There was a time when virtually all <i>inter vivos</i> transactions were subject to a fixed stamp duty of 50p, ten shillings or at a maximum of 1 per cent, we have come a long way from that.  That such a voluntary disposition within a family is now being taxed at the rate of 4.5 per cent is a great discouragement to people to pass on property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, raised an important point, that is, that the increase in stamp duty will have an effect even on the north side of Dublin.  The position has changed dramatically in recent years and the value of many homes has increased substantially. Those looking forward to selling their home on retirement and buying a smaller house or apartment or moving to a nursing home will regard this change as a particularly onerous imposition.</P>
      <P>The rate of home ownership is approximately 80 per cent.  There is, however, a change in the Government's philosophy and thinking. Mortgage interest relief has been whittled away and is now allowable only at the standard rate of 26 per cent.  I fear for young people in terms of their ability to own a home in parts of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned a figure of £13.5 million.  How much of this will be collected in Dublin and how many homes will be affected? Although not directly affected, I welcome the abolition of residential property tax because of its adverse effects, particularly in Dublin.  It is an inequitable tax.</P>
      <P>The increase in stamp duty will have a severe impact on old people in particular.  It will give rise to difficulties and problems which will have to be addressed by future Governments.  I fail to see why the burden should be shifted to middle income earners.  The rate in Northern Ireland and Britain is 1 per cent on houses worth over £60,000.  On family transfers, the increase will be regarded as particularly savage and will have a deleterious effect.  We are, therefore, opposed to its imposition on middle income earners.</P>

      <P>Although there are not many houses worth £150,000 or more in the west, I am glad, as an auctioneer, that residential property tax is to be abolished because home owners who work hard and pay their taxes should not be penalised. Couples whose first home is a new house under 1,400 sq. ft. receive the first time buyer's grant of £3,000.  Couples whose first home is a second hand house under 1,400 sq. ft. should be exempt from stamp duty, the payment of which causes many problems.  I hope the Government will consider this suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I classify the increased rate of stamp duty as a super rate of tax which will not apply solely to larger houses but to ordinary houses.  Where a father or mother wishes to transfer a house to their son or daughter there will be an increase of 50 per cent in the level of taxation where the value of the property exceeds £150,000.</P>
      <P>I reject the assertion that residential property tax affects only those living in Dublin.  There is widespread non-compliance throughout the rest of the country.  Whenever a house in Dublin is sold at public auction the work of the Revenue Commissioners is done in that they have an accurate comparative value which can be applied to similar houses.  Throughout the rest of the country no such easy comparisons can be drawn. As residential property tax is payable only by those on salaries of £30,000 or more per year, it does not apply to a substantial number of people with properties worth considerably more than £150,000.  People in Dublin are more likely to be on a higher salary scale.</P>
      <P>I welcome the abolition of this tax.  It is beyond me why any party would wish to place a tax on private homes.  In recent years further tax relief has been granted to architects, solicitors, doctors and other professionals and now successful tradesmen and others.  They can claim not only capital allowances but income tax relief on rental income on second homes which would be regarded as an investment property.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated that the new rates of stamp duty will not apply to registered guesthouses. Will he clarify that they will not apply also to registered bed and breakfast accommodation? There is a subtle difference in the registration requirements.</P>

I consider it anti-Dublin and anti-family and, as such, unfair.  I ask the Taoiseach to review the proposal to increase stamp duty from 6 per cent to 9 per cent.  If he believes it to be unfair or unbalanced or that it has the potential to act as an anti-Dublin tax, he should introduce measures in the Finance Bill to deal appropriately with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will offer the Taoiseach an example of the problem that will arise, which is a fair one.  Take a family home which was inhabited by an elderly person who died recently.  The house is a three bedroomed semi-detached residence which has not been modernised for over 30 years.  It would, therefore, require replacement windows, central heating, rewiring and complete refurbishment. The garden of this house would be probably smaller than the Taoiseach's side garden, not to <Col N="1046" /> mind the acreage of land that usually surrounds houses in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about a simple town house with a small garden.  The value on that property, which is located in Dublin 3, has been established by auctioneers who are seeking offers in excess of £180,000, notwithstanding the need to replace the windows and install central heating. The people who will attempt to purchase that property will be probably a young couple who had to move out of the area because of house prices and who now, having paid a mortgage for a number of years on a home in the suburbs and being in a better financial position, wish to move back to the area in which they were born and reared and where their families reside.  The other type of buyers who will be interested in the property are families who might require better accommodation or wish to improve their quality of life. What are we saying to such people?  We intend to penalise them because they wish to improve their family's accommodation.  On a property valued in excess of £175,000 they will pay about £20,000 in stamp duty and other fees.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Shatter's impassioned plea.  I was most impressed and I agree with much of what he said.  However, it suffered from the same fundamental flaw as the Taoiseach's earlier contribution in support of this imposition, in that both were about residential property tax.  This measure has nothing to do with residential property tax.  That tax was iniquitous, unjust and discriminatory.  The Government recognised that by abolishing it, although it was retained in the last two budgets.  Omitting the history of the tax, who imposed it and who maintained it, it was wrong and has been abolished. All parties maintained it and the Taoiseach's party introduced it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been abolished because the Government accepted the argument that it was unjust.  However, where is the logic in replacing one unjust imposition with another unjust imposition? Deputy Shatter said that if the Government accepted our case the tax would be simply buried in the general figures and we would accuse the Government of irresponsibility.  I cannot accept that logic.  The Government says it is giving away £490 million in tax reductions.  Why not give away £477 million instead of replacing one unjust tax with another?</P>
      <P>Stamp duty, as anybody who is involved with property transactions is aware, is penal.  I recently witnessed a property transaction in the United Kingdom.  A house in Twickenham, London, which is a good area, was sold for £170,000 and the stamp duty on the transaction was £1,700. When this financial resolution is passed the stamp duty on a similar property in Dublin will be £15,300, nine times as much.  There is no logic in or justification for that.</P>

Stamp duty on a house worth £170,000 in London is £1,700 but the stamp duty on a property <Col N="1048" /> of the same value in Dublin, Limerick, Waterford, Galway or County Meath will be £15,300.  Is there logic or justice in that?</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Government on abolishing residential property tax.  We have been calling for its abolition for three years and the message has got through.  That is appreciated. I wish to put on record what I believe has taken place.  The Taoiseach's party wisely decided residential property tax should be abolished. Democratic Left and the Labour Party agreed on condition the Taoiseach agreed to raise the same amount of money from family homes.  That was the political deal to square the ideological problem the Taoiseach faced in keeping his Government together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach has confirmed that Democratic Left did not demand that the residential property tax be maintained. My allegation is that Democratic Left demanded that a tax be maintained on property.  What is this fixation on taxing the family home?  It happened through the residential property tax and will now happen through this 9 per cent stamp duty on homes worth £170,000.  As my colleagues have pointed out, the average price of a family home is rapidly approaching that figure in the current property market.</P>
      <P>This is an outrageous decision.  I do not believe the Taoiseach's instincts lean in this direction.  I am certain that if his hands were not tied he would express the same sentiments as myself and my colleagues.  A 9 per cent tax on a home worth £170,000 is an outrageous measure by any stretch of the imagination.  It has been imposed because the Taoiseach was told by his colleagues that he must raise money from family homes.  Please stop attacking people's homes.  A tax on homes is not necessary.  It existed previously in the residential property tax and was removed.  Do not compound the problem by imposing this iniquitous tax on people's homes.</P>

      <P>There is no such thing as a good tax.  There is always a good objection to a tax because tax involves taking money from people by compulsion. There is no perfect tax and an Opposition can oppose every tax.  Having accepted that, let us compare what will now be in place to what was there before.  What standards would one use to compare stamp duty with the residential property tax?  First, is the tax expensive to administer both for the tax collecting authority and the taxpayer?  Second, is the tax certain or uncertain in its effects?  Third, is the tax <Col N="1049" /> convenient or inconvenient to pay?

      <P>The residential property tax was administratively costly both from the point of view of the Revenue because of the complexity of the calculations that had to be made and from the point of view of the taxpayer because he or she had to go to the expense of filing a return, making revaluations and getting tax advice every year in some cases in order to ensure they were not in a situation of moral hazard as a result of the possible allegation of paying less than they ought to pay.</P>
      <P>In terms of convenience the residential property tax had to be paid every year which is an inconvenient, recurrent liability in terms of people having to make provision each year, whereas this tax is convenient because it only occurs at a time of the choosing of the taxpayer. It is only when the taxpayer chooses to buy or sell a house that this tax falls to be paid.  In regard to certainty and equity, this tax is certain because it is levied on a known value, the value of the house as sold between a willing seller and a willing purchaser on a fixed known price.  The residential property tax was uncertain because the level of residential property tax to be paid was levied in an arbitrary way on a valuation chosen by the taxpayers which, in the case of one house on a road, could be different from that chosen by another resident of a similar house on the same road without the two having any opportunity of consulting to discuss the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those Deputies who wish to selectively quote what is good about the United Kingdom might well undertake more exhaustive research and they would find that the system of taxation is better in this country in many respects than the one in Britain.  It is certainly a more progressive system of taxation where tax is levied in <Col N="1052" /> accordance more with ability to pay, whereas the priority in Britain has been simply to reduce the top rate of tax to a point where people earning huge incomes are paying comparatively little tax. I do not believe in the British social model.  The Deputies opposite may selectively want to pick and choose bits from the British social model that suit them and then reject others.  I do not believe that model is one we should seek to emulate.</P>
      <P>The balance we have struck in this budget with this particular tax and the priority we have given to the low and middle income groups in regard to income taxation is the correct one.  I listened to Deputy O'Dea and others who said we had lost an opportunity by spreading the benefit too thinly.  The strength of this budget is precisely in that regard.  What he described as spreading the benefit too thinly was in fact giving the benefit right across the board, particularly to the large mass of taxpayers on comparatively low incomes.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of whether the lower and middle income groups and those on the margin of the poverty trap argue they are better off not working, it is right that we should target those groups, reduce tax in that area and increase allowances under the family income supplement. That spreads the benefits considerably.  It is also consistent with an enterprise approach to the economy because enterprise is for everybody, not just those who are already well off.  Access to enterprise should be available to everybody.  The philosophy of the Government of opening up access to enterprise to everybody, including the long-term unemployed, is the right approach to building a free, robust and fair economy.  This is what we are building as a result of the budget.</P>

A total of £4.7 million has been expended on substantial pier developments on the other Aran Islands of Inis Meáin and Inis Oírr by that Department also.  My colleague the Minister, Deputy Higgins will shortly open both these piers.</P>
      <P>In response to a proposal from the Islands Committee of Galway County Council, I allocated £20,000 in 1996 for a feasibility study which will identify further improvement works required at Kilronan pier.  This study was selected by the Council's Islands Committee as a priority access project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the interdepartmental <Col N="1058" /> co-ordinating committee on island development each relevant local authority, in consultation with their island committee, has been asked to draw up a priority programme of infrastructural works for its islands.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1 million has been made available in 1997 for priority infrastructural projects.  This is in addition to the local authorities' own budgets for the development of infrastructure on their islands.  The allocation of the funding will be made following an assessment of each project by the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee, with the assistance of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Galway County Council has already prepared a report on the infrastructural needs of its islands, including Inishmore, and a preliminary assessment of this is currently being carried out.  As soon as a priority list of projects, as agreed by Galway County Council's islands committee is available, the allocation of funding will then be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 30, 43, 67, 71, 74, 246, 247, 248 and 283 together.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change&rdquo;, which I published last December, lays down a comprehensive agenda for change which features increased devolution of responsibility to local authorities and a new funding system under which local authority charges for domestic water and sewerage services are being abolished.  In Galway yesterday, I announced a package of specific measures in relation to group and small public water and sewerage schemes which follow from the decisions in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the abolition of domestic charges, local authorities will no longer charge group water schemes for the supply of domestic water. This will lead to a considerable reduction in the amount of charges made to the members of groups supplied from public schemes.  Members of all group schemes will, of course, continue to benefit from income tax relief at the standard rate <Col N="1060" /> in respect of charges paid to groups up to £150 per year.</P>
    <P>I am very much aware that there are a large number of rural households served by group schemes which have their own supplies and that a significant number of these supplies are not up to standard.  I am now, for the first time, making a special capital provision of £5 million in 1997 to establish a new multi-annual programme of works by local authorities to enable them to take over existing group water and sewerage schemes, thus remedying substandard systems and eliminating domestic charges for the group scheme members concerned.</P>
    <P>I have also decided to proceed immediately with arrangements for the devolution from my Department to the local authorities of full responsibility for the administration of group scheme grant applications for new schemes or the extension or upgrading of existing schemes.  This is in keeping with the recommendations of the Devolution Commission.</P>
    <P>As a final element of the package, full responsibility for small public water and sewerage schemes will also be devolved to local authorities and capital funding in the form of block grants will be made available to them for this purpose in 1997 and future years.</P>
    <P>This overall package of measures means that a total of £15 million, plus £3 million from EU Structural Funds to support group scheme development, will be made available to local authorities in 1997 in block grant form to finance group and small public schemes, including the taking over and refurbishment of existing schemes.  It will be a matter for local authorities to decide on priorities among these categories of works, subject to meeting commitments on foot of approvals already granted.  Detailed arrangements for implementation of the package will be notified to local authorities shortly.</P>
    <P>Additional current costs incurred by local authorities in the implementation of the various measures will be among the factors taken into account in determining distributions from the equalisation fund being established this year.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the foregoing measures will be welcomed by rural communities who rely on group schemes.  They also represent a further practical step towards devolving more responsibility and decision-making to local authorities. There are no proposals to provide public funds to meet the running costs of individual water and sewerage facilities.  However, many who currently rely on these will benefit over time from the expanding network of public and group schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement setting out the information requested.  The information is based on staffing returns supplied to my Department in respect of the position at 31 December 1995.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are committed to a policy of equal opportunity which is contained in a statement of equal opportunity issued to all local authorities in February 1990 by the local government staff negotiations board.  The statement was drawn up following negotiations involving local authority and health board management and unions and the Departments of the Environment and Health.  It covers matters such as recruitment, selection, training and development.  Notwithstanding the commitment to equality of opportunity which I have outlined, there is, as has recently been indicated in &ldquo;Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change&rdquo;, a clear gender imbalance in the management levels in the local authority service.  It is, therefore, proposed that a special development programme will be established for women managers, which will be specifically targeted at ensuring that a greater proportion of women are in a position to compete effectively for posts leading to management levels.</P>
      <P>The Local Appointments Commission has already made considerable strides in ensuring that there is increasing participation of women on its interview boards.  Local authorities are being asked to place considerable greater emphasis on this important aspect of recruitment policy too.</P>
      <P>Finally, a working group representative of my Department and the City and County Managers' Association is reviewing equality matters generally in the local authority service, taking account of the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Womens' Rights on women in management in local administration.  I understand that the review is nearing completion and that a report will be available to me shortly.  I intend at that stage to issue further guidance on a range of equality related matters to the local authorities.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change&rdquo; provides for a new funding system for local authorities, under which, <i>inter alia</i>, charges by local authorities for domestic water and sewerage services will not be levied in respect of 1997 or following years.  Domestic refuse charges will remain and commercial service charges are not affected.  Domestic water and sewerage charges due in respect of 1996 and previous years will continue to be payable.</P>

      <P>The information requested is summarised in a table which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  In one case, Commission proceedings are pending in the European Court of Justice.  One reasoned opinion has been delivered under Article 169 of the Treaty and in a further eight <Col N="1064" /> cases, the Commission has sought observations prior to the possible delivery of reasoned opinions.</P>
      <P>Ireland's record of compliance with EU environmental legislation is creditable, as evidenced by recent Commission reports on implementation of community legislation.  It is our policy to respond constructively and substantially to correspondence from the Commission in this regard with a view to minimising formal legal proceedings.</P>

      <P>Problems faced by landlords or tenants involving criminal activity by drug dealers or abusers are matters for the Garda.  Terms and conditions of tenancies in private rented accommodation are a matter for agreement between the landlord and tenant. Where a tenant is in breach of the terms of a lease or other tenancy agreement it is open to the landlord under the landlord and tenant code, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, to seek termination of the tenancy.</P>

    <P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, which was published last December, is primarily designed to address problems arising from drug dealing and serious antisocial behaviour in the context of local authority housing.  However, the Bill will also give health boards discretion to <Col N="1065" /> refuse or withdraw SWA housing assistance in respect of private rented accommodation in the case of certain persons who have been evicted or excluded from, or refused, local authority housing on grounds of serious anti-social behaviour such as drug dealing.</P>

      <P>The allocation of staff to the various local authority service areas and the creation of additional posts, where considered necessary, taking account of local needs and priorities, is a matter for the local authorities concerned.  Following a major relaxation of controls in the staffing area, which I introduced in March of last year, local authorities are generally free, within broad parameters, to decide their own staffing levels.  In these circumstances, I do not propose to comment on the report published by the Irish Planning Institute which makes a case for the employment of greater numbers of planners by individual authorities.</P>

      <P>The legal provisions governing the motor tax system are based on associations between the particular vehicle and its taxation category, determined by reference to factors such as engine size, vehicle weight, type of vehicle and the purposes for which it is used.  Accordingly, the tax disc issued contains details of these criteria and is vehicle specific, and all other administrative procedures and computer systems are based on this approach.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to alter the system in the manner suggested.  I should point out, however, that there is already provision in the motor tax code for the making of a refund in respect of the unexpired period of a licence, tax disc, subject to certain conditions, in respect of a vehicle which has been stolen, scrapped or destroyed.</P>

      <P>In addition, the Environment Council began and advanced work on important proposals concerning quality of petrol and diesel fuels; measures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles; the establishment of common rules and procedures to be applied to certain, i.e. green, shipments of waste to certain non-OECD countries; quality of water for human consumption &mdash; drinking water; and a Community action programme to support non-governmental organisations working in the environmental protection area.</P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency also led and co-ordinated a strong EU input to a number of important international activities concerned with global environmental issues.  These included the following major conferences at which I led the EU delegation: the second conference of the parties to the framework convention on climate change, in July 1996; the third conference of the parties to the biodiversity convention, in November 1996; and the eighth meeting of the parties to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, in November 1996.</P>

    <P>The Irish national delegation also tabled a discussion document on the possibility of strengthening the nuclear safety provisions of the Euratom Treaty in the context of the further enlargement of the European Union.</P>

      <Quest>the number of deaths from house fires in 1996; and if he intends to initiate any measures to avert fatal fires.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1531/97]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Fire statistics supplied to my Department by the fire authorities indicate that, in 1995, 38 fatalities occurred in fires attended by fire brigades, of which 32 were in houses or flats; figures for 1996 are not yet available.</P>
      <P>As regards measures to reduce the risk of fires, the Building Control Act and the building regulations prescribe detailed fire safety requirements for new buildings, including houses, and for material alterations or changes of use.  Technical guidance documents which accompany the regulations contain comprehensive guidance on matters such as means of escape, including the provision of smoke alarms, internal and external fire spread, and access and facilities for the fire brigade. Following a review by my Department, it is intended to publish new technical guidance shortly; this will require improved standards in many aspects of new buildings, including fire safety provisions.</P>
      <P>The National Safety Council, which has responsibility for promoting fire safety, has given a high profile in its campaigns to fire safety in the home.  Particular stress has been placed on the value of smoke alarms which, if properly installed and maintained, can provide early warning of fire and save lives.  The council recently launched a new national radio advertising campaign, &ldquo;A Minute for Fire Safety&rdquo;, which emphasises the simple routine tasks which should be carried out each night to guard against fire.</P>
      <P>In the last analysis, fire safety in the home is the responsibility of the individual householder. Better awareness of the dangers of fire and of fire hazards together with simple common sense fire prevention practices, can help to prevent and reduce the number of fires and the consequent tragic fatalities and injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> As regards the services provided by the fire authorities, improvements have been made on a comprehensive basis in the fire services over recent years covering equipment, organisation and staffing, and the legislative framework.</P>
    <P>Capital investment by the State since 1981 has resulted in the provision of over 90 new or reconstructed fire stations, over 320 fire appliances and a wide range of emergency equipment, as well as major improvements in mobilisation and communication systems.  In this regard, three regional mobilisation and communication control centres at Limerick, Castlebar and Dublin are either already in operation or being developed to handle all emergency calls from the fire services.</P>
    <P>Major improvements have taken place in the training of fire service personnel.  Training facilities have been provided at several centres around the country to facilitate the training of brigades locally.  To complement this local training, the Fire Service Council has, since 1983, held almost 200 training courses for over 3,000 local fire officers.</P>
    <P>A series of codes of practice and guidelines have been issued by my Department in recent years giving advice on fire safety in places of assembly, hotels and guesthouses, flats and apartments, and nursing homes.  Work is continuing on the preparation of further guidance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 231 together.</P>
      <P>As outlined recently in &ldquo;Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change&rdquo;, the role of the value for money (VFM) unit of my Department will be enlarged in terms of scope and application. With the experience gained from projects already completed, the unit will be in a position to undertake more comprehensive and in-depth analysis of a wider range of local authority activities. Value for money audits will be placed on a statutory basis and, on foot of this, it is proposed that the VFM unit will publish full details of the results of its work.  In addition, it is proposed to identify a range of financial performance indicators against which local authorities will be required to measure their performance and publish the results; the purpose will be to identify best practice and encourage individual local authorities to improve their performance levels.</P>
      <P>I intend, in the near future, to bring forward comprehensive regulations which will modernise and consolidate the law on local authority meetings and procedures.  These will include a statutory right for members of the public to attend council meetings.</P>

Selection of projects under this scheme must be based on the strict EU eligibility criteria, the need to prioritise projects and the competing demands from different areas on the limited funds available.</P>
      <P>The corporation was recently allocated non-national road grants of £526,000 for 1997, including a grant of £200,000 for the Docks-Lough Atalia Road project.  It is open to the corporation to resubmit the application for the Western Distributor Road for consideration next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 230 and 277 together.</P>
      <P>In my letter to the mayor of Galway on 3 October 1996, I suggested that the corporation should consider the option of a treatment plant based on alternative technology that would allow facilities to be built underground on Mutton Island without the need for a permanent causeway. For reasons which I have publicly explained, that remains my preferred option.</P>
      <P>I have since received a reply to that letter from Galway Corporation stating its preference for an overground plant serviced by a causeway.  This option is currently under legal challenge.</P>
      <P>The corporation has also asked in its letter that I agree to a twin-track approach which would involve the undertaking of two detailed designs for different projects, one of which would, by definition, never be constructed.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, and bearing in mind the legal proceedings, I do not consider that it would be justifiable to approve such a twin-track approach and the major additional planning and design costs which this would involve.  I will be writing to the corporation to this effect.  However, with a view to developing an agreed approach to the matter, I intend to accede to the request for a meeting with a deputation from Galway City Council.</P>

      <P>The planning and development code aims to strike an appropriate balance between the need, in the public interest, for full consideration of a planning application and the wish of the applicant for an early decision.  Changes to the system under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, have facilitated earlier decisions on planning applications and appeals, without diminution in the quality of consideration given to applications.  The new national agreement, <i>Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness</i> indicates that further <Col N="1076" /> consideration will be given to streamlining the planning system in order to minimise delays and uncertainties, and to introducing accelerated procedures for major projects involving significant employment and added value.</P>

      <P>It is stated objective of national recycling policy to divert some 100,000 tonnes of organic waste away from landfill by means of composting by 1999. The new scheme of waste recycling grants accordingly encourages the development of composting systems, and a number of local authority proposals on these lines were approved by me in 1996, including a major one for Limerick city. This policy of encouraging composting arrangements will be continued.  Consideration will be given at a later stage to the feasibility of supplementing the policy with a regulatory requirement on composting.</P>

    <P>Efficiency Audit Group:</P>
    <P>A review of local government expenditure on non-national roads is to be undertaken by the Efficiency Audit Group this year at an estimated cost of £165,000.  Tenders have yet to be invited.</P>

    <P>Local Development &amp; URBAN Programmes</P>
    <P>The Monitoring Committee for the Operational Programme for URBAN was established in October, 1996.  The Operational Programme states that an independent external evaluator will be appointed to assist the Monitoring Committee in regard to ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the Programme.  It is likely that this appointment will be made in 1997 but the cost will not be known until the terms of reference are agreed by the Monitoring Committee and tenders are received.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the following schedule. It is not possible to give the precise duration of meetings which I attended on my foreign visits as these details have not been officially recorded.  In general, bilateral meetings can last anything from 30 minutes to two hours.  Major summits such as the European Council meetings involve a series of meetings which take place over a number of days.</P>

    </P>
    <P>The national famine commemoration committee has chosen a magnificent site for the national famine memorial at Murrisk in County Mayo, in the shadow of Croagh Patrick and overlooking Clew Bay.  The memorial will consist of a very fine and moving sculpture by John Behan entitled &ldquo;The Coffin Ship&rdquo; which we hope to have installed in July of this year.  Having examined many sites suggested to us, we chose the beautiful setting of Murrisk and we feel that it is entirely fitting that the national famine memorial should be located in the west of Ireland, which suffered most during the Famine with one in four of the population of Connaught dying in those terrible years.</P>
    <P>The events which the Government proposes to organise or contribute to include: a major international conference on the Famine in Dublin Castle on 9 and 10 May; the Great Irish Famine Event; a set of stamps commemorating the Famine to issue in May; publication of an atlas of Famine sites of Ireland; publication of a book of Irish Famine Manuscripts; an ecumenical service; a photographic exhibition; and continuing programme of support for the renovation of Famine graveyards e.g. Swinford.</P>

      <P>The State and semi-State boards under the aegis of my Department are: The Western Development Commission; Area Development Management Limited; The Law Reform Commission; The National Economic and Social Council; and The National Statistics Board.</P>
      <P>Since 25 June 1996, when the Deputy last inquired, the position regarding appointments to these boards is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> The Western Development Commission was established on 1 January 1997 and, of the seven appointments made to the commission, there were three women, 42.9 per cent.  The commission's term will expire on 31 December 1999. The term of the former Western Development Partnership Board expired on 31 December 1996. There were no new appointments to the board in the last six months.  Of a total board membership of 34, there were 13 women, i.e. 38.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Area Development Management Limited has 13 board members, of whom five, 38.5 per cent are women.  There are currently three vacancies on the board.  There is no end-of-term <i>per se</i> but one third of the board are required to stand down each year.  In this regard, there were five new members appointed in October-November 1996. Four of these new members were female.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission consists of a president, Mr. Justice Anthony Hederman, whose five-year term of office expires on 19 October 1997.  A commissioner, Mr. Simon O'Leary, was re-appointed as a commissioner for a period of two months, from 2 January to 1 March 1997. There are vacancies for up to three commissioners at present.  Each commissioner may be appointed for up to five years.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council had one new appointment made since 25 June 1996. Mr. Dara Murphy was appointed in October 1996.  There are 34 people on the council of whom 13, 38.2 per cent, are women.  The end date of the current term of the council is 31 December 1997. The National Statistics Board is currently being re-appointed.  The new board will run for a two year term.</P>
    <P>The percentages of women currently on each of these boards are as follows:</P>

      <P>Since January 1996 the following changes were made to the membership of the above boards:</P>

      <P>IAAC &mdash; three new appointments, one of whom was a woman, were made to the IAAC. There are now four women on this committee representing 29 per cent of the total membership. The term of office of the current IAAC will expire in December 1997.</P>
      <P>NCDE &mdash; two new appointments, one of whom was a woman, were made to the NCDE in 1996. There are now five women on this committee representing 31 per cent of the total membership. The term of office of the current NCDE will expire in October 1997.</P>

      <P>The provision under subhead F3 in my Department's vote relates to the EU Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties.  The Programme covers the period 1995 to 1999 with a total EU funding of £240 million (approximately) allocated for the first three year phase.</P>
      <P>While the Department of Finance has overall responsibility for the programme, my Department is responsible for the implementation and funding of two measures under the cross-Border sub-programme involving a total expenditure of approximately £10.4 million in the first phase of the peace programme.  The first measure is concerned with business and cultural links and is being administered by an intermediary funding body, Co-operation North, in association with IBEC and CBI (NI).  My Department will provide approximately £5.8 million in EU and Government matching funds to Co-operation North under this measure.  The second measure is concerned with co-operation between public bodies and is directly administered by my Department. Expenditure under this measure is expected to be in the region of £4.6 million.</P>
      <P>The amount of £5.9 million provided for under subhead F3 in 1997 includes a provision of £3.2 million for the measure concerning business and cultural links and the balance of £2.7 million for the measure covering co-operation between public bodies.  The amounts are based on the expenditure profiles provided in the projects already approved and those at present under consideration. Progress on implementation of the measures is satisfactory and it is expected that all the available funding under both measures will be committed to approved projects during 1997.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Deputy has taken a close interest in this matter and that this reflects the concerns of local residents in the area that this crossing point has not yet been fully and permanently reopened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin on 23 January 1996 in reply to a question from Deputy Jim McDaid, Donegal County Council completed the re-opening of the portion of this road which lies in this jurisdiction in early 1995.  The Department of the Environment has recently confirmed that this portion of the road remains open and that the matter is one for the Northern Ireland authorities <Col N="1106" /> to resolve, as the section which is closed lies within Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply to Deputy Keaveney on 31 October 1996, the matter has been pursued with the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish secretariat.  By way of response, those authorities have since stated that the status of the crossing in question as a right-of-way is unclear. They have further contended that under the Access to the Countryside (Northern Ireland) Order, 1983, responsibility for the assertion, protection and maintenance of public right-of-way lies with the local council.  In this context, it has been claimed that the order does not empower the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland to request that a local council act according to its responsibilities under the order.  They continue to be of the view that the decision to enforce the right-of-way, should it be established that such a right-of-way exists, lies entirely with Derry City Council.</P>
    <P>We would not wish any dispute as to the relevant competences involved to stand in the way of a re-opening of this road and we will continue to press for a successful resolution of the matter. While I am not now in a position to inform the Deputy as to when the road will become passable, I would assure her that every effort will continue to be made to expedite the re-opening of this crossing.</P>

    <P>It is extremely difficult to estimate the amount required to meet ongoings under this heading in <Col N="1107" /> any given year as there is a number of variable factors involved.  These factors include the number of cases, the length and complexity of the cases and the point in time when the bill of costs is presented for payment.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the 1997 Estimate for subhead C arose because the 1996 Estimate included provision to meet anticipated bills for costs in a small number of exceptional cases and it was expected that costs of this nature would not arise again in 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 103 together.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as at 9 January 1997, the total number of claims for repayment received under the car scrappage scheme was 24,977.  The number passed for payment was 24,874, while 103 were refused.</P>
      <P>Two vehicles in respect of which certificates of destruction had been issued under the scheme were subsequently recovered by the Garda. These are believed to have been stolen from the scrappage plant while awaiting destruction.  In addition, two further vehicles for which certificates had issued have been reported as having been seen subsequently on the road.  The Garda, the Revenue mobile task unit and the motor tax authorities have been alerted but to date the vehicles in question have not been recovered.</P>
      <P>A number of safeguards are in place to prevent abuse of the scheme.  Certificates of destruction of vehicles under the scheme can only be issued to approved scrappage plants.  Only ten such plants have been approved nationwide.  These operators are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that the rules regarding the issue of certificates of destruction are being complied with strictly.</P>
      <P>In addition, repayment is only made where the appropriate repayment claim form is completed, a certificate of destruction is produced, and the log book is surrendered.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are aware that a number of cases have been highlighted in the media where dealers have accepted cars, apparently under the scrapage scheme, but which have not in fact been destroyed and in respect of which they have not claimed repayment.  While the numbers involved are not known, it is understood that they are in the region of 20.  This practice, while not illegal, would nevertheless be contrary to the spirit of the scrappage scheme.  No loss of revenue is involved.  Discussions have taken place with representatives of the motor trade who have given an undertaking to observe the spirit of the scheme in the future.  I have been informed that the Society of the Irish Motor Industry has now directed its members that all cars offered and accepted by a member garage under the scrappage scheme must be scrapped.</P>

    <P>I do not expect that the trend in house prices over the past number of years will give rise to wage instability given the very substantial reduction in mortgage interest rates since 1994 and the overall proposals in relation to tax reductions and wage increases in the new national agreement, <i>Partnership 2000, for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness.</i> In that context my Department has stated that it expects price increases over the period to 1999 to be just over 2 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>As regards the relations between reductions in nominal interest rates and house prices, I would point out that the latter are also affected by a wide range of other factors, including the high level of economic growth, demographic changes, the substantial increase in members employed in recent years and higher real incomes.  As I indicated recently, I expect that the increases in stamp duty rates on the top end of the market will have a moderating effect on house prices.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that 7,058, 7,008 and 6,592 seven-day intoxicating liquor licences, with a turnover of under £150,000 per annum, were issued for the licensing years 1993-4, 1994-5 and 1995-6 respectively.  Records are not maintained in such a manner as would enable the information requested by the Deputy, in relation to the number of seven-day intoxicating liquor licences renewed in the last three licensing years where applicants stated that they were not trading or had nil turnover levels in their application, to be given without the expenditure of an inordinate amount of official time. However, I am informed that the number of such cases is estimated at 1.5 per cent of the total applications.</P>
      <P>The commissioners have also informed me that, as information is not readily available on the exact number of spirit retailers on licences issued in respect of the licensing years 1993-4, 1994-5 and 1995-6 on a turnover level and county basis, it has not been possible to provide this information in the time allowed.  However, this information is being compiled at the moment and I will provide it to the Deputy when it becomes available.</P>
      <P>As regards spirit retailers on licences, where turnover is required, I am informed by the commissioners that the number of such licences not renewed in the licensing years 1993-4, 1994-5 and 1995-6 was 500, 559 and 626 respectively.</P>

      <P>Sanntar leis an gConradh ar an Aontas Eorpach don Bhanc Ceannais Eorpach (BCE), atá le cur ar bun i 1998, an ceart eisiach chun eisiúint nótaí bainc &ldquo;euro&rdquo; a údarú.  De réir reacht an BCE ní mór dó, a mhéad is féidir, cleachtais atá ann cheana maidir le heisiúint agus dearadh nótaí bainc a urramú. Tá a réamhtheachtaí, an Institiúid Eorpach Airgeadaíochta (an IEA), freagrach as a n-ullmhúchán teicniúil a mhaoirseacht.</P>
      <P>Tar éis comórtais deartha, an 13 Nollaig 1996, sheol an IEA i mBaile Átha Cliath agus i Frank-furt na dearaí a roghnaigh sí do na nótaí bainc &ldquo;euro&rdquo;.  Molfaidh an IEA don BCE go nglacfar leis na dearaí sin.  Áiritear sna dearaí an focal &ldquo;euro&rdquo;&mdash; is é sin, ainm an airgeadra &mdash; in aibítrí na Laidine agus na Gréigise araon; inisealacha an údaráis eisiúna, an BCE, i gcúig mhalairt leagain, BCE, ECB, EZB, EKT, EKP; agus síniú Uachtarán an BCE.  Freagraíonn an chéad cheann de na malairtí leagain seo d'inisealacha an BCE sa Ghaeilge.  Níor chinn an IEA go fóill an molfaidh sí don BCE gur chóir don fhoras deiridh sin gné náisiúnta a áireamh ar na nótaí.</P>
      <P>Foráiltear sa Chonradh go bhféadfaidh na Ballstáit monaí a eisiúint faoi réir cheadú ón BCE maidir le méid na heisiúna, agus tugtar cumhacht do Chomhairle na nAirí Geilleagair agus Airgeadais (ECOFIN) bearta a ghlacadh chun ainmníochtaí agus sonraíochtaí teicniúla na monaí go léir le haghaidh cúrsaíochta a chomhchuibhiú a mhéad is gá chun a gcúrsaíocht réidh laistigh den limistéar &ldquo;euro&rdquo; a cheadú.  Tá ECOFIN tar éis a chinneadh gur chóir go mbeadh spás substaintiúil ar aghaidh amháin de chuid gach mona le haghaidh gnéithe suaithinseacha náisiúnta; táimse tar éis a chinneadh go leanfar den chláirseach a bheith mar ghné náisiúnta na hÉireann.</P>
      <P>Comhaghaidh a bheidh san aghaidh eile agus tá comórtas ar siúl maidir lena dearadh.  Luafar ar an gcomhaghaidh luach na monaí sa chaoi chéanna ar fud an Aontais; agus beidh &ldquo;euro&rdquo; nó &ldquo;cent&rdquo;&mdash; gan infhilleadh don uimhir iolra &mdash; mar ainm orthu.  Níl aon chinneadh déanta i dtaca le haon litreoireacht eile a bheith nó gan a bheith ar na monaí.  Ar ndóigh níor mhór d'aon chinneadh den sórt sin srianta teicniúla atá ag eascairt as toisí teoranta na monaí a chur san áireamh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules on civil servants and political activity fall into two categories; restrictions on standing for election to political office and rules regarding the maintenance of political impartiality.  Restrictions on civil servants standing for election are set out in circulars of 1925, 1934 and 1974.  The restrictions were relaxed somewhat by the Government in 1974 and the current arrangements are as follows: (a) Civil servants are not permitted to stand for <Col N="1117" /> election to either House of the Oireachtas or to the European Assembly.  This restriction applies to all categories of staff; (b) Civil servants in the industrial and in the manipulative, sub-clerical and manual grades are free to engage in political activity, subject to the general restriction in relation to parliamentary elections.  Civil servants in this category may, therefore, contest local elections; (c) Members of the clerical grades in the civil service and civil servants in non-manipulative grades with salary maxima equal to or below the clerical officer maximum may apply for permission to engage in politics on the same basis as the staff referred to at (b) but officers employed on particular types of work may have their applications refused; (d) All civil servants above clerical level are totally debarred from engaging in politics.  However, personal assistants and special advisers in ministers' offices, whose terms of appointment are coterminous with those of the relevant appointing Minister, are exempt from the present arrangements covering State employees and politics.</P>
      <P>The requirements in the area of official political impartiality are contained in circular 21 of 1932.  That circular prohibits an official from making public statements on any matter of current political interest, or which concern the political action or position of the Government or of any member or group of members of the Oireachtas. The circular also contains a prohibition on officials being members of an association or committee which seeks to advance the interests of a political party or to promote or prevent the return of a particular candidate to the Dáil.  The provisions of circular 21/32 are to be applied in the light of the relaxation of restrictions on engaging in political activity for certain grades announced by the Government in 1974 and referred to at (b) and (c) above.  Civil servants are advised to consult the Head of their Department for any clarification of the rules required or where any doubt arises as to the propriety of their engaging in activities of a political nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics on the number of applications for this relief are currently available up to 11 June 1996 only.  At the time some 300 applications had been received, with the only data on the geographic spread being that about 250 of the applications came from the Dublin area.  All of those 300 applications have since been processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> The latest data available on the number of applications approved is the position on 30 November 1996 at which time some 198 applications were recorded as being approved for individuals liable to tax under the PAYE system.  The cost to the Exchequer of the tax relief associated with these approvals is estimated at £35,000.  Corresponding figures for applications approved for non-PAYE taxpayers will not be available until after the 1996-97 income tax returns have been filed on or after 31 January 1998.</P>
    <P>The main reasons why applications were not approved was failure to meet the age and living alone conditions.  However, I have been assured by the Revenue Commissioners that they are applying this provision liberally, particularly with respect to borderline cases, and with a minimum of formality.</P>
    <P>While the figures for take up of this relief are low so far, this tax measure is only part of the Government's broader strategy to assist the elderly. The Minister for Social Welfare established a task force in January 1996 to examine how the security needs of elderly persons who could not benefit from the tax relief might best be addressed.  As a result, a number of initiatives were launched last February, one of which involved expenditure of £2.6 million in grant-aid being made available last year to voluntary groups for security initiatives for the elderly, including the installation of physical security equipment such as monitored alarm systems.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the reason for the expenditure increase under Vote 45, which is £110 million in 1997 and was £25 million in 1996 Estimates for the public services; and if there will be a similar increase for 1998.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">

      <P>Under normal Estimates procedure, provision is included in the Votes concerned for, among other things, the costs of pay increases on which agreements have been reached.  A separate contingency provision is normally included on a global basis in the Vote for Increases in Remuneration and Pensions (Vote 45) to meet the estimated cost of other pay increases which are still being negotiated under the terms of prevailing policy on pay in the public service.  The total cost of pay increases for which provision is made in the Estimates in any particular year is, therefore, the sum of amounts for settlements on each Vote and the global contingency provision for claims which are still in procedures.</P>
      <P>Funding is made available late in each year from this global provision to the Vote concerned to cover the costs, after account is taken of available savings which arise in respect of pay increases for which no provision had been made in these Votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, the contingency amounts included in the Vote for Remuneration depend on the state of negotiations at the time of publication of the Estimates Volume.  The subsequent draws on the global Vote depend on the total cost <Col N="1120" /> of pay increases arising and the availability of any offsetting savings on the Vote concerned.  Thus, the amounts provided on a global basis vary enormously from year to year and are not comparable in any way on a year to year basis.</P>
    <P>The total increase in the Exchequer pay and pensions bill in 1996 due to local bargaining settlements under the PCW was £27 million of which only £9.7 million came from the Vote for Increases in Remuneration and Pensions, the rest being provided in the individual Votes concerned. As a result, there was a saving of over £15 million on the Vote for Increases in Remuneration and Pensions in 1996.  This was mainly because of the slow rate of settlement of local bargaining negotiations in 1996.  The estimated cost in 1997 of these delayed negotiations together with the cost of other negotiations in 1997, is £110 million, which is included in the Estimate for Increases in Remuneration and Pensions for 1997.</P>
    <P>At this early stage in the year, I am not prepared to speculate about the need for, or the possible size of, a Vote for Increases in Remuneration and Pensions in 1998.</P>

      <P>Taxation, in this context, includes all direct and indirect taxation including health and social insurance contributions. On this basis the GDP ratio for Ireland from 1990 to 1996 was as follows: 1990, 35.2 per cent; 1991, 35.7 per cent; 1992, 36.1 per cent; 1993, 36.2 per cent; 1994, 37.4 per cent; 1995, 35.2 per cent; 1996, 32.8 per cent.</P>
      <P>According to Table 3 of &ldquo;OECD Revenue Statistics 1965-1995&rdquo;, the unweighted average taxation-GDP ratio for the EU 15 is 1994, the latest available year, was 42.5 per cent.  The Deputy might note that all international data give rise to comparability problems.</P>
      <P>In the Irish context moreover, owing to the significant difference between GDP and GNP, the latter is considered more appropriate for comparison purposes.  The taxation to GNP ratio for Ireland from 1990 to 1996 was as follows: 1990, 39.4 per cent; 1991, 39.6 per cent; 1992, 40.4 per cent; 1993, 40.7 per cent; 1994, 41.7 per cent; 1995, 40.2 per cent; 1996, 39.3 per cent.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 133, 134 and 135 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administration of the civil registration system is a matter for An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir <Col N="1122" /> (Registrar-General) of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for local registrars who act under his general direction.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are currently 31 cases receiving attention in the Office of An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir where there has not been compliance with the requirements for a valid marriage contained in the Family Law Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>The requirements of a valid marriage set out at sections 31 and 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995 are each declared to be a substantive requirement of a valid marriage and where either section has not been complied with a marriage may not be registered.</P>
    <P>The difficulties in the cases referred to arise primarily from the failure of the persons concerned to give three months written notification of their intention to marry to the appropriate Registrar of Marriages as required by section 32. Unfortunately, in a small number of cases these errors did not come to light in sufficient time to enable remedial action to be taken before the marriages took place.</P>
    <P>I very much regret the inconvenience that may be caused to the couples affected and every effort is being made to find an early and satisfactory resolution to the problems involved.  Officials from my Department and the Office of An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir are currently in consultations with officials from the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  All avenues of approach, including amending legislation, are being considered and decisions in the matter will be announced as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Recent evidence suggests that in western industrialised countries many children begin to use a flouride toothpaste regularly from a young age, in many instances before the age of one year, <Col N="1123" /> when there is a greater likelihood of their ingesting some of the toothpaste used at each brushing.</P>
      <P>Studies have shown that use of fluoride toothpaste from an early age is associated with higher levels of very mild fluorosis or discolouration, and this tends to support the view that infants and young children inadvertently swallow a considerable proportion of the toothpaste that they use. The fluorisis recorded in these studies is of a very mild grade, not aesthetically compromising and could only be recorded by specially trained dentists using special lighting conditions.  Such studies are carried out in this country on a regular basis and confirm the findings of studies in other countries.</P>
      <P>Properly formulated toothpastes should continue to be used by the whole population.  Parents and guardians should supervise young children up to six years of age when toothbrushing and only a pea-size amount of toothpaste should be used.</P>
      <P>My Department, through the health promotion unit, continues to support dental health campaigns aimed at parents and young children which promote this message.</P>

If the Eastern Health Board decides that a detoxification facility is required in the area in which the hospitals are located, all options for the provision of such premises will be considered by the Board, in consultation with my Department.</P>

      <P>Under arrangements currently in place persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EU regulations or where they are in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance. Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants.  The decision on whether or not a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case.</P>
      <P>It is open to all persons, be they parents or students, to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to applications from, or on behalf of, students when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 158, 159, 160, 170 and 198 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, <i>Towards an Independent <Col N="1131" /> Future</i>, was published at the end of last year.  The report highlights the need to develop a comprehensive range of flexible community services to meet the needs of people with disabilities, their family and carers.  Recommendations include proposals for the development of day services, residential places, respite places and nursingparamedical-therapy services as well as the development of personal assistance services.  The report recognises the important role played by voluntary organisations in providing services and proposes new structures at health board level to enhance the co-ordination and planning of service delivery between the statutory and voluntary sectors.  It also recommends the establishment of a database on the health service needs of people with physical and sensory disabilities to provide a firm basis for planning services.</P>
    <P>The report has now been circulated to health boards and officials from my Department are in discussion with them regarding the process of implementing the report.  The report will also be considered, in conjunction with the health recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, by the inter-departmental task force and monitoring committee approved by the Government recently.</P>
    <P>The report makes recommendations about the development of personal assistance services.  My Department currently funds a personal assistance service for people who participated in the Centre for Independent Living Horizon Pilot Project, INCARE and through which 43 people are currently employed as personal assistants.  I am aware that the Centre for Independent Living is involved in the organisation of personal assistance services through the FAS community employment scheme in a number of locations around the country.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that funding deficits for existing services be addressed in the first instance and identifies priority service developments including the personal assistance service. Additional funding will be provided in 1997 to help put the services on a more secure financial footing and to enable other priority services to be developed.</P>

      <P>The Adoption Act, 1991 imposed a statutory duty on health boards to carry out, as soon as practicable, assessments for foreign adoptions. In carrying out this function, the boards must have regard to the competing demands in other areas of the child care services, particularly in relation to the protection of children from abuse and neglect, which takes priority over all other work.  I understand that the procedure from first application to ultimate approval for a foreign adoption in the Eastern Health Board takes at least two years.  The assessment process itself takes about nine months.  However, due to the volume of applications received, the board is no longer able to estimate the waiting period before a social worker is allocated to a particular case. The board deals with applications in strict numerical order and it is open to applicants to ring the board at any time to inquire as to progress concerning the processing of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Act, it is also open to an applicant to request a registered adoption society to carry out an assessment.  However, there is no obligation <Col N="1134" /> on a registered adoption society to carry out such an assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 for use in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.  Health boards endeavour to make refunds as quickly as possible.  However, there has been a problem with delays in processing claims in the North-Eastern Health Board area where until recently a manual system of payment was in operation.  A new computer system to cater for the drug refund scheme was installed in the Cavan-Monaghan and Louth community care areas with effect from 1 December 1996.  This system is currently being installed in the Meath area and it is expected that this will provide claimants with a more efficient service and that claims will now be processed within a four to six weeks period.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that there is a scheme available for people who incur ongoing expenses on medicines whereby they do not have to await refund payments.  The drug cost subsidisation scheme was introduced to cater specifically for people who have a long-term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme pay £32 per month to their pharmacist in respect of all prescribed medicine dispensed during that month.  In order to qualify for this scheme persons must be certified by a medical practitioner on an individual basis.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of community drug schemes particularly to those who incur significant expenses on drugs and medicines.</P>

    <P>In general, the labelling of foodstuffs is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  I understand that his Department is in the process of transposing into Irish law the provisions of Directive 96/21/EC which requires that the labelling of foodstuffs containing aspartame must include the statement &ldquo;contains a source of phenylalanine&rdquo;. This labelling requirement already applies, under S.I. No. 344 of 1995, to table-top sweeteners containing aspartame.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives.  First, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all registered nursing homes registered by health boards under the Act, and second to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care have access to such care.</P>
      <P>A number of changes were made to the subvention scheme last year by amending regulations which came into effect on 31 July 1996.  One of these changes permits health boards to contract beds in nursing homes above the number contracted on 1 September 1993 and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. This amendment is to facilitate health boards which do not have sufficient accommodation in their hospitals and homes to meet the needs of those requiring nursing care and which have traditionally relied on the nursing home sector to meet this need.  Additional funding has been made available to health boards in 1996 and 1997 to meet the increased expenditure under the Act, including the cost of the amendment mentioned above.</P>

For example, I am informed that all patients were seen within one hour at the clinic on Friday, 10 January.</P>

      <Quest>the number of doctors which were provided in the accident and emergency departments of the Mater and Beaumont Hospitals over the holiday break in view of the fact that Deputy Noel Ahern received numerous complaints of patients waiting up to seven hours to see a doctor for a few minutes and it appeared that doctors had to divide their time between ward duties and accident and emergency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The hospital service has encountered problems in the provision of accident and emergency services, particularly during the winter, in the past number of years.  The winter period brings its own set of problems, particularly for our elderly population. This is not a problem confined to Ireland but is a feature in other developed countries also. The causes of the problems which arise have been well documented.</P>
      <P>The Mater and Beaumont Hospitals provide a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week, all-year-round accident and emergency service.  A total of two accident and emergency consultants, six registrars and 19 house officers work in the two accident and emergency departments.  These doctors are assigned exclusively to the accident and emergency service and do not work in other parts of either hospital. Account is taken of the needs of patients for efficient and effective accident and emergency cover when shifts are being drawn up.  While activity winds down in some areas of a hospital over the Chrisrmas period, both the Mater and Beaumont Hospitals have assured me that this is not the case in the provision of the accident and emergency service.</P>
      <P>The methods of operation in accident and emergency departments is to accord priority to those most in need.  In the normal course, this means that those with less serious complaints have to wait, from time to time, while higher priority cases are being treated.  Experience in the provision of accident and emergency services has shown that a significant number of those who attend could be treated as effectively and far quicker by their family doctor.  This is why the current public education campaign on the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments was launched.  The thrust behind the campaign is to keep accident and emergency departments clear for real emergencies.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available.  I will arrange for my Department to write directly to him when the information has been compiled.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Eastern Health Board that there has been no change in the board's policy regarding the medical card entitlement of persons aged over 65 years and that the entitlement of such persons continues to be considered in a sympathetic manner in all community care areas.</P>

      <Quest>the take-up of the scheme announced in the 1996 budget allowing long-term unemployed to retain their medical cards when they took up employment; the numbers involved; if the Eastern Health Board or other health boards were allocated an additional budget for this purpose or were they to operate the new scheme from within existing resources.</Quest>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: The information the Deputy has requested regarding the numbers of persons who have benefited from the 1996 budget provision is not readily available.  Some persons who qualified for retention of their medical card under the 1996 budget scheme could have been entitled to retain their card under previous arrangments.</P>
      <P>With regard to the need for additional funding, it should be borne in mind that the overall number of persons eligible for medical cards at any time is influenced by a wide range of factors.  The most significant of these would include the overall performance of the economic and demographic trends.  In the period from December 1995 to September 1996, the percentage of the population eligible for medical cards declined in each of the eight health board areas while the total number of eligible persons fell by 16,805.  In these circumstances it has not been considered necessary to provide additional resources to health boards to implement the scheme.</P>

Under Phases I and II of the scheme, which are already in place, treatment is available as follows: emergency dental treatment for the relief of pain or ugent denture repairs is available to all adults; routine dental treatment is available to adults in the age groups 16-34 years of age inclusive and 65 years and over; full upper and or full lower dentures are available to all adults with no natural teeth.</P>
      <P>I will extend routine treatment services to other age groups under the scheme as additional resources are available to me.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of orthodontic services in County Clare is the responsibility of the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>I understand there is an orthodontic clinic held in the County Clinic, Bindon St., Ennis, County Clare on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays of each week.  One orthodontist attends these clinics, which are carried out under the direction of the consultant orthodontist for the Mid-Western Health Board who visits Ennis as is necessary.</P>
      <P>The board plans ultimately to have a three chair orthodontic unit in Ennis.  It is not envisaged that an orthodontic clinic would be provided at each dental clinic in the Clare area.  An orthodontic clinic was provided in Kilrush Dental Clinic for some time on a pilot basis.  The board hopes to re-establish this clinic in the near future again on a pilot basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The hospital service has encountered problems in the provision of accident and emergency services, particularly during the winter, over the past number of years.  The shortage of sub-acute beds in Dublin has caused problems in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers and quickly enough to cater for new patients seeking the services of the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to provide relief for the acute hospitals and enable them discharge patients no longer in need of acute hospital care but who require sub-acute <Col N="1151" /> care, my Department has agreed a plan of action with the Eastern Health Board for the winter of 1996-97.  This involves tackling a number of areas including services for the elderly, services for the chronically disabled and the management of services provided by the acute hospitals themselves.</P>
    <P>The plan will cost £2.75 million annually and I have now provided the funding for this major initiative.</P>
    <P>Included in the plan are the following measures: an additional 30 beds in nursing homes, a new 25 bed community unit in Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, 17 extra beds in Leopardstown Hospital, 25 extra beds for the elderly in Peamount Hospital, 25 beds for the young chronically disabled in Peamount Hospital.  Six new community ward teams for the elderly, additional beds in acute hospitals, and a public education campaign on the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>I am glad to inform the Deputy that arrangements are well under way to put these initiatives in place and some of the facilities are already in operation.</P>
    <P>This is the largest package of measures by any Minister for Health to deal with the relief of the winter problems of the acute hospitals and I am confident that it will provide much needed relief for the hospital service in Dublin.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Refugee Agency, which is under the aegis of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is initially responsible for the co-ordination of services generally for &ldquo;programme refugees&rdquo;, or those permitted to remain in Ireland as a result of a Government decision.  My Department is represented on the board of the agency.  A range of medical services is being provided, through the relevant health boards, to both &ldquo;programme refugees&rdquo; and asylum seekers residing in this country. All &ldquo;programme refugees&rdquo; and asylum seekers are eligible for the range of health services available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has also been providing a counselling service to the Bosnian &ldquo;programme refugees&rdquo; since 1992.  As a result of this activity, and in discussion with organisations concerned with the welfare of asylum seekers, it was acknowledged that there was a need to develop a more specialised service for persons living in this <Col N="1152" /> country who may be suffering from the effects of trauma, warfare or torture.  For this reason, it is proposed to establish in the Southern Health Board area, during 1997, a new service for the victims of torture who are in this country as refugees. The service will cater for the needs of this client group on a national basis.  Funding to establish the service has been allocated in the current year, and the Southern Health Board is involved in ongoing discussions with my Department to agree the Protocol and detailed operational arrangements to apply to this new service.</P>

      <P>Family mediation is available from two centres operated by the Family Mediation Services of my Department.  One is located at the Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1, the other is located at Mill House, Henry Street, Limerick.</P>
      <P>As part of a programme for development and expansion of the family mediation service, two new posts of area mediation co-ordinator have been created, one for the existing family mediation centre at the Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin and one for the new centre at Mill House, Henry Street, Limerick.  Competitions to fill these posts have been held under the auspices of the Civil Service Commission and an appointment has been made to the Limerick post. I understand that an appointment to the second post in Dublin is imminent.  The persons appointed will be responsible for delivery of a quality mediation service, with the assistance of a team of mediators, each for his or her own geographical areas of responsibility.</P>
      <P>The appointment of area mediation co-ordinators will facilitate the establishment of a scheme for the use of mediators in private practice who have the necessary training and experience and otherwise meet the standards set by the family mediation service, to provide family mediation at locations distant from a family mediation centre or to relieve pressure on the centres at Dublin or Limerick.  The allocation of cases to private mediators would be done through the family mediation service.</P>

I understand that during the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, my Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Justice, and Deputy Joan Burton, Minister of State at the Department of Justice with responsibility for asylum matters, gave commitments that a suitable State scheme of legal aid for asylum seekers would be set up.

      <P>I will shortly make regulations to transpose the EU Habitats Directive into Irish law.  These will, for the first time, provide the powers necessary to prevent activities or developments which could significantly damage ecologically sensitive areas such as the Burren.  The national parks and wildlife service of my Department is committed to preventing any further significant damage to such areas and, towards this end, will continue to monitor the situation very carefully.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Heritage Council that, in its opinion, the correct decision has been made in this case and the consideration given by Cork County Council and An Bord Pleanála to the proposed redevelopment through the planning process has been very thorough and comprehensive.  The Heritage Council has stated that is has no objections to the seven conditions attached to the grant of permission by Cork County Council or to the five conditions imposed by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Council, together with the heritage service of my Department, also recommended that an additional five conditions, which would ensure the salvage and reuse of materials from the old Garda station and the incorporation of design features in keeping with the historical streetscape, be incorporated into the new building design.  I am advised that these five additional conditions have been incorporated into the new building design.</P>

      <P>The amount included for subhead C2 in the abridged version of the Book of Estimates is £8.729 million.  In general, subhead C2 provides for the allocation of grants to a number of cultural institutions and projects other than the grants towards the running costs of the national cultural institutions which are paid from subhead C1.  Subhead C2 also provides for part of the funds made available under the cultural development incentives scheme and other regional projects to be assisted from Structural Funds under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism.  Moneys required for the preparation of major exhibitions in cultural institutions under the remit of this Department, including fit-out of the National Museum exhibitions at Collins Barracks and the Chester Beatty Library, are also comprehended by this subhead.</P>

      <P>In general Exchequer funding available to my Department for institutions of the type referred to by the Deputy is intended for allocation to those institutions for which it has statutory responsibility and funds on an ongoing basis.  In addition, the cultural development incentives scheme, administered by my Department and co-financed by Structural Funds available under the Operational Programme for Tourism, provides for once-off capital grants for a wide range of groups and bodies meeting the various criteria of the scheme, including the provision of matching domestic funds.  I understand the group referred to by the Deputy was not in a position to apply for funding under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that I was in a position to make a sum of £15,000 available in December 1996 on <Col N="1166" /> the condition of it being a once-off grant towards capital costs in respect of works, undertaken by this voluntary group, for the further development of premises to house and preserve a collection of historical vehicles in its care.  This payment was made on the basis of receipts and invoices produced by the group in respect of these capital works.  The group was also required to produce in due course a certified statement from the group's accountant as to the final disbursement of the funds in question.  In the light of the financial resources available to me, I do not envisage being in a position to provide financial support to this venture in 1997 or on an ongoing basis.</P>

Detailed analysis of the Garda accident reports to provide data in relation to road users, age of victims and other matters will be carried out by the National Roads Authority in the preparation of Road Accident Facts, 1996.</P>
      <P>I launched a national road safety campaign in May 1996, with a focus on all responsible agencies working together with the road user to increase the effectiveness of enforcement, education, engineering and encouragement measures.  A number of new measures have since been taken and others are in the development stage.  Established measures, including constant media advertising, education of road users, especially children, improvements to our road network and the enforcement of road traffic law, are being maintained.</P>
      <P>New measures introduced last year include the publication of a guide to road safety engineering; new radio and TV advertisements by the National Safety Council; an enhanced role for local authorities in promoting road safety at local level; the establishment of a voluntary register of driving instructors; the introduction of on-the-spot fines for speeding offences; and the publication of a comprehensive traffic signs manual for local authorities. Further measures to be introduced include a theory test for new drivers, new traffic regulations and compulsory car testing.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Section 23&rdquo; tax relief is available only in areas designated for urban renewal.  An overall review of the urban renewal schemes as they have operated to date is currently under way.  As part of the review, a consultant's study on the impact of the schemes in economic, social and architectural terms has been completed.  The study was published on 5 December and is now the subject of a process of public consultation under which submissions have been invited from interested persons and organisations in relation to its conclusions and recommendations.  Copies of the study are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals at this stage to extend the present urban renewal scheme to any additional areas.  It would be inappropriate to consider what new areas, if any, might be suitable for designation as part of any future scheme until general policy in relation to the next phase of urban renewal is determined in the light of the review.</P>

      <P>The legal framework for local authority boundary alterations, as set out in Part V of the Local Government Act, 1991 and the associated regulations, enables all the issues in relation to such a boundary alteration to be thoroughly considered by the local authorities involved in the first instance.  It includes provision for public advertisement and consultation with the other local authorities concerned which enables submissions to be made to the promoting local authority by members of the public and by those other authorities. Such submissions must be considered by the promoting local authority in deciding whether to make an application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Act, an application for a boundary alteration cannot be made to the Minister for the Environment until this local process is completed. <Col N="1170" /> The process is still under way in the case of the Limerick city boundary and, therefore, I have no role in the matter at this stage.  The Act also includes provision which would allow for the establishment of an independent committee to report and make recommendations following receipt of such an application.  Given this legal framework, it would clearly be inappropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this point.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241 and 242 together.</P>
      <P>Spotlights which equate with headlamps are permitted on motor vehicles, provided they meet the requirements of, and are used in accordance with, the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 1996.  Enforcement of these regulations is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>While the term &ldquo;spotlight&rdquo; is not used in the regulations, it is generally understood to be a lamp which shows a white or yellow light to the front of a vehicle and is of similar intensity to a headlamp.  Such a light must be either fitted with a dipping device or be otherwise incapable of dazzling by, for example, being permanently deflected downwards and to the left or extinguished when the headlamps are dipped.  &ldquo;Spotlights&rdquo; must also comply with the height requirements for headlamps viz. not more than 4 ft. and not less than 1 ft. 8 ins. above the ground.  Exceptions to the height requirements include fog lamps which may be lower than 1 ft. 8 ins. but which may only be used in fog or falling snow.</P>
      <P>A &ldquo;spotlight&rdquo; on the roof of a vehicle and more than 4 ft. from the ground may only be used on a Garda vehicle or a public utility vehicle to illuminate works or equipment of the public utility undertaking.  In the latter case, the light may only be used when the vehicle is stationary.</P>

      <P>Under section 4 (1) (g) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, development consisting of the carrying out of works for the maintenance, improvement or other alteration of any structure is exempt from planning permission, provided the works affect only the interior of the structure, or do not materially affect the external appearance of the structure so as to render such appearance inconsistent with the character of the structure or of neighbouring structures.</P>
      <P>Article 10 (1) (a) (ix) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 provides that development which would otherwise be exempted from planning permission shall not be so exempted where it would consist, <i>inter alia,</i> of the alteration of a building or structure where such building or structure is specified in a development plan as a building or structure, or one of a group of buildings or structures, of artistic, architectural or historical interest, the preservation of which it is an objective of the planning authority to secure, or the preservation of which it is the intention of the planning authority to consider in the event of an application being made for permission to alter, extend or demolish the building or structure.</P>
      <P>If there is any doubt regarding the question of whether the removal of original windows and installation of replacement windows constitute &ldquo;development&rdquo; requiring planning permission in any particular case, a reference can be made to An Bord Pleanála to decide the issue.</P>
      <P>While I have no specific proposals to amend the Planning Acts in regard to the replacement of windows <i>per se</i>, I plan to bring forward as soon as possible a Bill which will deal, <i>inter alia,</i> with strengthening the protection afforded to the architectural heritage generally.</P>

      <P>Section 22 of the Litter Pollution Bill, 1996 proposes to make it an offence for the person in charge of a dog not to clean up when a dog fouls in certain specified public places.  It is intended that this provision will apply nationally and will replace the existing permissive power enabling <Col N="1176" /> local authorities to make by-laws on this matter. This new obligation, when enacted, will be publicised as part of the Action Against Litter initiative. It will be for individual local authorities to consider the need for increased deployment of dog wardens in light of the new provisions.</P>

      <P>Under electoral law, a candidate at a Presidential, Dáil or European election is entitled to send, free of charge for postage, to each person on the register of electors for the constituency, or to any combination of such persons, one postal communication containing matter relating to the election. Under this provision a candidate, if he or she so wishes, can send one communication to each household instead of one to each elector. Responsibility for addressing the postal communications which a candidate issues at an election is a matter for the candidate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261 and 294 together.</P>
      <P>The test wells provided as part of the site investigation contract for the Inis Mór water supply scheme are being used to augment the island's supply during periods of peak demand, particularly the summer months.  I understand that because of the recent and unusual dry spell, surface water reserves were depleted, resulting in water rationing until such time as the groundwater source could be brought back into operation.  Galway County Council has advised that supplies are almost back to normal.</P>
      <P>The Inis Mór scheme is one of the projects included in an application to the European Commission for Cohesion Fund assistance for water and sewerage schemes for Connemara and the Aran Islands.  To date no decision has been received from the Commission.  Pending the Commission's decision and having regard to the existing level of commitments under the water and sewerage scheme programme, I cannot say when it may be possible to approve this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 278 and 279 together.</P>
      <P>The European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988 fix a maximum admissible concentration for fluoride in drinking water.  This is in line with the relevant EU standard and with the standard for water fluoridation set by the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960.  All drinking water supplies are regularly monitored to assess compliance with this quality standard.  The results, which are reviewed and published annually by the Environmental Protection Agency in its report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland, indicate a compliance level of 88 per cent with the statutory limit value.  While cautioning about the need for more careful management by local authorities in order to avoid exceedances of the standard, the Environmental Protection Agency has reported that exceedances, where they occur, are neither high enough, nor persistent enough, to constitute a hazard to water users.</P>
      <P>Fluoride levels in surface waters intended for the abstraction of drinking water are also monitored by sanitary authorities.  Results are significantly below the limits fixed separately in the European Communities (Quality of Surface Water Intended for the Abstraction of Drinking Water) Regulations, 1989.</P>

      <P>Eligibility for local <Col N="1189" /> authority housing is determined by housing authorities on the basis of assessments of housing need carried out under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988.  The most recent such assessment was carried out on 29 March last.  Authorities were advised, in guidelines issued by my Department, that applicants should not be debarred from inclusion in the assessment by virtue solely of their marital status.  No amendment to housing legislation is required to provide for the needs of separated persons.</P>

      <P>While it is recognised that a house improvement grants scheme would help to promote the conservation and improvement of the housing stock, particular account must be taken of the cost of the previous scheme.  The Government's priorities in the housing area, as set out in <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> are to expand the local authority and other social <Col N="1192" /> housing programmes and to upgrade deficient local authority dwellings.  As the available resources will, accordingly, be concentrated on these programmes, there are no proposals, at this stage, to introduce a grants scheme to assist in the renovation or extension of houses, whether confined to rural areas or otherwise.</P>

    <P>Households moving under the RRI programme may be eligible for local authority house purchase loans or shared ownership, and the deposit requirement under the latter scheme has been eased in these cases.  The mortgage allowance and improvement works-in-lieu schemes can also be used to assist families wishing to resettle in rural areas.</P>
    <P>In addition, a new resettlement mortgage jointly funded by the Housing Finance Agency, through the local authority, Bank of Ireland, and RRI was introduced last July on a pilot basis.  This new mortgage will assist qualifying families to resettle permanently by purchasing and restoring, where necessary, existing houses and I understand that the first mortgages under this scheme will be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>I do not propose, at this stage, to provide for the application of speed limits of less than 30 mph which is the standard built-up area limit.  International experience indicates that such lower limits, applied in isolation, do not have any significant impact on vehicle speeds.  Where road authorities wish to restrict vehicles to a speed lower than 30 mph, they should first utilise appropriate traffic calming measures under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994.  The use of lower speed limits can be further considered in the light of experience with such measures.</P>

      <P>The requirement to carry out an environmental impact assessment (EIA) of certain proposed developments derives from Directive 85/337/EEC.  I am satisfied that Ireland has given full effect to this Directive since the introduction of the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989 and other relevant legislation and regulations.  The operation of the regulations is kept under review and I am at present examining particular aspects, such as the threshold for peat extraction, with a view <Col N="1194" /> to possible changes.  The regulations will also need to be re-examined in the light of the revised Directive on EIA which is expected to be adopted later this year.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides for the preparation by the Environmental Protection Agency of guidelines on the information to be contained in environmental impact statements and requires those preparing and evaluating such statements to have regard to the guidelines.  Guidelines were published in draft form in 1995 and these will be reviewed by the agency later this year with a view to formally issuing them under the Act.</P>

      <P>Speed limits, as provided for under the Road Traffic Acts, are applied to all public roads.  In addition, such traffic calming measures as they consider desirable to further reduce speed on public roads in their charge may be provided by road authorities under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994.  The Act provides for the use of a very wide range of such measures and it is a matter for each individual authority to apply the type of device most suited to the circumstances at any particular location.</P>
      <P>Under the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1993, which implement the requirements of an EU Directive, speed limiters are fitted to certain buses/coaches and heavy goods vehicles to prevent specific set speeds being exceeded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 306 and 318 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of requests for a remedial service from the schools mentioned by the Deputies.  I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to the primary sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department's inspectorate following the collection and analysis of data from schools.  Such allocations are also subject to resource availability in any given year.  Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and <Col N="1198" /> the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
    <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>In the current school year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
    <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>My Department's post primary building unit has received applications for emergency works in respect of roof repair and heating at Ard Scoil Eanna, Crumlin, Dublin 12.</P>
      <P>The position in respect of these applications is as follows: tender documents have been requested by my Department for the emergency roofing works.  With regard to the heating system, my Department's post-primary building unit is currently awaiting a report from the school's design team outlining details of the works required and an estimated budget.  Grant aid was sanctioned in order to maintain the heating system during the current school year.  However, the school was informed that this was only a temporary solution.  A full refurbishment will need to be carried out at the school.</P>
      <P>With regard to the current building project, the school authorities have been instructed to submit their stage 4 and 5 documentation, including tender documents, which my Department's post primary building unit is still awaiting.  Until this documentation is received it is not possible to give a clear indication when construction will commence.</P>

      <P>It is the intention of my Department to provide physical education facilities on a phased basis to schools where these do not already exist. However, the timing of the provision of PE halls must have regard to available finance.</P>
      <P>The question of providing a PE hall at Dunshaughl in Community College can only be considered in the context of capital available for post primary building purposes generally.  Because of the huge demands on the capital resources available, priority has been given for some time to the provision of essential teaching spaces.  Before additional PE halls can be included in the capital programme, the backlog of halls already planned in 1996 or under planning will have to be cleared.</P>
      <P>Provision of PE facilities where these are not being planned at present will resume as soon as pressure on available resources for classroom accommodation has eased.  Meanwhile, proposals submitted by County Meath vocational education committee in relation to the proposed joint venture between the vocational education committee and Dunshaughlin Community Centre Committee are being considered by my Department at present.  When the matter has been examined in full, a decision will be conveyed to the vocational education committee in due course.</P>

      <P>Officials from my Department met representatives of the Teachers' Union of Ireland on Wednesday 27 November 1996 and discussed this matter with them.</P>
      <P>The future of the two Colleges of Education for Home Economics has been kept under review for some time having regard to the demand for home economics teachers.  In the meantime it has not been possible to fill posts on a permanent basis.</P>
      <P>The steering committee on the future development of higher education recommended that a review and analysis of specialist teacher requirements should be pursued jointly between my Department and the Higher Education Authority. In that context a review group is examining teacher supply and demand in the second level sector generally, including home economics.</P>
      <P>Pending the outcome of this review it has not been possible to sanction the creation of permanent posts in this case.  I must also emphasise that Government policy on the limitation of numbers employed in the public service imposes severe constraints on the creation of new posts.</P>

    <P>Rinne an Foras Taighde ar Oideachas dian-scrúdú ar tháscairí a bhaineann leis an mhí bhuntáiste oideachasúil.  Ba é an t-Ionad a cheap na critéir faoinar roghnaíodh na scoileanna don tionscnamh, Breaking the Cycle agus a rinne an próiseas roghnúcháin féin a riaradh.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an ghné tuaithe den tionscnamh mheas an Foras Taighde ar Oideachas go mba cheart díriú ar scoileanna i gceantair tuaithe a bhfuil níos lú ná cúigear oide iontu, a dhéanann freastal ar dhaonraí scaipthe agus a bhfuil líon suntasach de dhaltaí iontu a bhféadfadh baol a bheith ann ina leith nach n-éireodh leo sa chóras oideachais de réir a gcumais.</P>
    <P>Is oth liom nach bhfuil an scoil a ndéanann an Teachta tagairt di i dteideal, ó thaobh méid foirne de agus ó thaobh rollaíochta de, iarratas a chur isteach ar bheith páirteach sa tionscnamh nua seo.</P>

      <P>No promise of funding was made in respect of this school.  My Department advised the school management in April 1996, that no additional classroom accommodation is warranted in Creevy national school because the current overcrowding results from a significant number of pupils being enrolled from outside the school's catchment area.  The school was advised to confine its intake to its own catchment area which would allow the general purpose room to revert to its intended use.  My Department is continuing to monitor the enrolment situation at the school.</P>

      <P>An extension is currently being planned for this school.</P>
      <P>Architectural planning is proceeding and the bill of quantities for this project was examined by my Department's technical staff.  The school's design team were requested to make amendments to the bill of quantities and these amendments were submitted to the Department on 16 January 1997.  The revised submission is currently being examined by the Department's technical staff.  When the revised bill of quantities is approved, the question of inviting tenders for this extension will be considered.</P>
      <P>The question of allowing the project to proceed to construction will be considered in the context of the capital allocation for post-primary building purposes in 1997.</P>

      <P>A programme for a BSc in Technology was developed in 1995 and approved by the National Council for Educational Awards and by my Department early in 1996.  The general aim of the programme is to provide a primary degree for lecturers who possess non-degree qualifications.  The programme is aimed at academic staff who are engaged on teaching courses primarily at craft level and who wish to expand their capabilities for teaching third level courses in technology related areas.  The programme is funded by my Department and the European Social Fund under <Col N="1220" /> the training of trainers measure of the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development.</P>
      <P>The programme has been developed specifically for lecturers in the extra-university sector; it is not available to other categories of staff in the sector.</P>

      <P>I received earlier this month the document referred to by Deputy Treacy.  The document has been studied by me and by my officials.  The proportion of marks awarded for the theoretical and practical components in the leaving certificate art <Col N="1222" /> examination at present is quite similar to the proportion that exists for other leaving certificate subjects with practical components e.g. engineering and construction studies.  It is extremely unlikely that candidates would obtain a grade D in art at leaving certificate level based solely on performance in the written (theoretical) paper.</P>
      <P>The structure of the leaving certificate in all subjects must satisfy matriculation requirements for access to university.  The syllabus in art for the leaving certificate is at present under review by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  When I receive a recommendation from NCCA for a revised syllabus in art I will consider it and make a decision about its implementation.  It is open to any individual or group to make a submission to the NCCA and the document in question is already with the NCCA.  The NCCA has available to it a wide range of expertise in art as in other subjects.</P>

    <P>My Department's post-primary building unit has arrangements in hand to meet with the Vocational Education Committee and its design team in early February, in order to initiate a detailed investigation of the proposed site.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 376 and 382 together.</P>
      <P>The amalgamation of the two post-primary schools in Kenmare and the establishment of a community school is dependent on the provision of new accommodation.  Phase one of the building development has been constructed and the architectural planning for phase two has been completed. The latter project is one of a large number of similar projects being considered in the context of the 1997 capital building programme.  I am not in a position to say at this stage when construction will commence.</P>
      <P>The two schools will continue to operate under their existing managements until the new school is established.  However, arrangements are at present in train to establish a board of management to succeed the present structures when the proposed school is due to become operational.  It is expected that this board will be put in place in the near future.</P>

      <P>There are no specific funds available from my Department to assist primary schools with the purchase of computers.  At primary level funds for the day-to-day running costs of schools, including the provision of equipment such as computers, are provided by my Department by means of capitation grants.  Since taking office I have increased substantially the capitation rate for primary schools from a level of £28 per pupil in 1992 to £45 per pupil in 1996.  This amounts to an increase of 60 per cent over a four year period.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the funding of education at primary level is the subject of ongoing review by my Department.</P>

      <P>County Laois vocational education committee requested my Department to approve the purchase of a 5.8 acre site at St. Fergal's College, Rathdowney to enhance the playing space at the school.  The matter was considered by my Department's building unit and it was decided that because of restrictions on the school site, the acquisition of the additional playing space was justified on condition that the land could be obtained economically.</P>
      <P>The Valuation Office advised that a price of £30,000 was fair and reasonable for the property in question, and as a result County Laois vocational education committee were authorised to enter into negotiations for the purchase of the proposed site within the parameters suggested. However, the vendor was not willing to sell the property for the price offered by the Department.</P>
      <P>County Laois vocational education committee were notified in July, 1996 that the valuation remained unchanged, and unless the land could be acquired at the price suggested by the Valuation Office, the school would have no option but to use the playing area already available.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers. However, the school in question has not applied to my Department for a resource teacher post.  In the current school year I have allocated an additional ten resource teacher posts to primary schools.  As the school in question had not made an application, it was not considered in the context of this allocation.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to make further resource teacher posts available to primary schools.  I wish to assure the Deputy, however, that my Department's inspectorate is urgently pursuing the issue of a suitable education placement for the child in question.  I am hopeful that satisfactory arangements will be put in place in the near future.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the school in question was granted disadvantaged status, for funding purposes only, in December 1996.  The decision to grant disadvantaged status to the school was taken in recognition of the fact that this school is dealing with the same general population as other schools in the area which had previously been granted disadvantaged status.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to include the schools in question in the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  As I have previously indicated to the House, the criteria under which schools were selected for inclusion in this initiative and the selection process itself, were devised and carried out by the Education Research Centre following consideration of a range of indicators of educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The data submitted by all applicant schools, including the schools in question, were taken fully into account by the Education Research Centre as part of its selection process.  However, I am informed by the Education Research Centre that, based on the information provided, the schools in question did not qualify for inclusion in the scheme.  My decision to give the Education Research Centre the responsibility of devising the criteria and selecting schools for inclusion in the initiative was taken in recognition of the complexity of the issues involved and the recognised expertise of the centre in this area.</P>

      <P>Primary and second-level schools are not required to notify my Department of cases where children are suspended or otherwise excluded from schools.  The School Attendance/Truancy report, published in 1994, highlighted the question of suspensions and expulsions from schools.  Subsequent to the publication of this report a Task Force was established within the Department to examine submissions on the report and to make recommendations for further action.  The establishment of a system whereby the proposed education boards are notified of any pupil expelled from school is one of the issues currently being <Col N="1232" /> considered in the context of the updating of the school attendance legislation.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the appropriate way to obtain the information sought by the Deputy is to lodge an official search in the Land Registry.  The search should be in Form 101 of the Land Registration Rules 1972 accompanied by the prescribed fees.  The search may also be made by telephone but it should be confirmed by the applicant in writing and the fees paid before a result of the search may issue.  The fees payable on a search are £4 per folio.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, the folios may be inspected at the public counter in either the local office, Courthouse, Castlebar or the Land Registry central office.  The fees for inspection are £1 per folio.</P>

Part of the vesting order relates to the folio in question.  The matter has been examined and it appears that this dealing may be disassociated from the schedule and proceed independently. I understand that provided no queries arise, it is expected that the dealing will be completed in approximately two months.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 407, 408 and 409 together.</P>
      <P>As regards petitions generally, I will be setting new guidelines shortly which will take account of the Geoghegan High Court judgment on petitions and which will assist both members of the public and public representatives to ascertain if there is a case to petition or not.  In the meantime petitions continue to be accepted and my decisions on petitions take into consideration the provisions of the judgment.</P>
      <P>During 1996 a total of 295 petitions were finalised.  Statistics in relation to petitions are maintained by reference to petitions rather than the individual penalties petitioned.  There are just over 5,000 petitions on hand at present.</P>
      <P>Statistics in relation to cases where warrants have been executed while a petition result is still pending are not kept.  In relation to the status of a fine which is the subject of a petition, I should explain that a petition does not place a stay on the order of the District Court judge.  Notwithstanding the fact that a petition has been lodged by, or on, the defendant's behalf, if the fine is not paid within the time allowed by the judge, a warrant will be issued to enforce the court's decision as is the normal procedure in cases where fines are not paid on time.  Section 1 (1) of the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1991 provides that a warrant must be issued within six months of the due date of payment of the fine imposed.  However, while there is no statutory requirement of the Garda Síochána to defer enforcement of a warrant in respect of a fine which is under petition, it is normal practice for them to do so upon production of an official acknowledgement of petition and to await the outcome of a petition.</P>

      <P>Regulation 14 of the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 1988 provides for the recruitment of persons having special technical qualifications to the force.  Members recruited under this provision do not have to fulfil all of the admission criteria required of members who are appointed to the regular uniform force.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that Regulation 14 gardaí are given appropriate training courses depending on the nature of their duties.  They are trained in various aspects of policing as their superior officers deem necessary and if it were felt that there was any deficiency in training, the in-service training unit at Harcourt Square would be requested to provide a suitable course.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that requests for training in relation to security and criminal matters, made by the non-Garda enforcement agency referred to, are normally acceded to in the interests of more effective liaison and interaction between the Garda Síochána and that agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is undoubtedly a problem of drugs misuse in Mountjoy Prison.  I can assure the House that in my time as Minister real progress has been made tackling this problem in our prisons.  There are now a number of wide-ranging and complementary initiatives in place.  The problem of drugs in the prisons is, just as in the wider community, a complex one.  The notion that in our prisons it can be solved overnight by means of any single strategy is not a well thought out one.  I can assure the Deputy that every means of preventing access to drugs by prisoners is fully explored and, if feasible, implemented.</P>
      <P>In examining this aspect of the problem, particularly in Mountjoy Prison, it was apparent to me that visits were one of the main avenues utilised by persons attempting to pass illegal drugs to prisoners. I immediately approved a number of preventative and detection measures concentrated on the main visiting area in the prison and these have now been in place some time.  I am pleased to be able to report that these measures have proved particularly effective in preventing the smuggling of drugs and drug paraphernalia to prisoners.</P>
      <P>The most effective strategy for tackling this problem, of course, is prevention through education and the rehabilitation of those already afflicted.  There are now specially designed drugs education programmes in place in all of our prisons. A range of other initiatives with offenders in custody have been promoted by me over the last two years.  These include the drug-free regime in the training unit and the drug treatment facility which is based at the Mountjoy Prison's health care unit.  Both of these initiatives were put in place with my encouragement and support during 1996 and are working well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delivery of medical services in the prisons is co-ordinated by the Director of Prison Medical Services.  The director liaises regularly with the Eastern Health Board in respect of the Prisons Medical Service and related matters in order to seek to ensure a level of primary health care for prisoners at a standard equivalent to what is available in the community.  Developments in the medical services for addicts in the community are closely monitored with a view to their application in the prisons where practicable.  I am pleased to note that there has been an ongoing high degree of co-operation between the Eastern Health <Col N="1241" /> Board including the agencies under its aegis and my Department.  An example was the assistance received in the context of the provision of the necessary professional services for the drug treatment unit.  I would hope that this co-operation between the prisons and the Eastern Health Board, in the interest of tackling this communitywide problem, would continue and, if feasible, expand.</P>

      <P>The budget provision from my Department's Vote for the Irish Presidency is £1,790,000.  The approximate cost of the Irish Presidency to my Department as of 31 December 1996 is £1,420,000.  This figure takes into account salaries, overtime and the cost of hosting the Presidency for my Department and also includes £170,000 incurred on the Garda Vote in respect of the lease of specialised vehicles used during the Irish Presidency.  Records are not maintained in such a way that would enable the operational costs of Garda duty in connection with the EU Presidency to be identified without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of time and resources which could not be justified.</P>

      <P>Section 2 of <Col N="1250" /> the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, permits persons suspected of drug trafficking offences to be detained in Garda stations for up to seven days.  It also allows for the making of regulations designating places of detention where a person who is arrested under the Act and who is suspected of concealing drugs in his or her person may be detained.  I am at present consulting with the Garda authorities about the question of making regulations under this provision.  It is, of course, the case that, in the absence of designated places of detention, persons arrested under the Act suspected of having drugs concealed in their persons can be detained in Garda stations.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals to reduce Garda strength in rural stations in counties Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the Deputy's question relates to the rural community policing scheme which has been operating in 14 Garda districts throughout the country since 1991.  It was intended that the schemes, once operational for a reasonable period, would be extended to other districts.  The Garda authorities are currently evaluating experience of the existing rural community policing schemes and reviewing their 1994 proposals for its extension.  This involves a consultative process <Col N="1253" /> taking in consultations with local Garda management, the Garda representative associations and, most critically, local community interests.</P>
    <P>This process, by its nature, will take some time to complete.  However, I am particularly anxious to ensure that there will be sufficient consultations with local interest groups before any decision is made to extend the scheme.  It is after the detailed consultative process has been completed that the Garda Commissioner will be in a position to submit to me proposals as to whether rural policing should be extended or modified as the case may be.</P>
    <P>There has been some misunderstanding over the years in the media and by members of the public about the scheme which was not designed to close rural Garda stations.  It is actually aimed at allowing the gardaí spend more time on active operational duties in their districts including in particular, visits to the elderly, while at the same time providing for station opening hours which actually suit local authority needs.  It is precisely these objectives which are being extended to see how well they have been met in the existing rural policing areas.</P>

      <P>Subhead F of Vote 20 provides for the acquisition of air support for the Garda Síochána.  As it became possible to have contracts placed earlier than anticipated, the Estimates provision of £200,000, under this subhead in 1996, was increased to £1.8 million by way of Supplementary Estimates approved by the House on 10 December 1996.  The provision in the 1997 Estimates under subhead F of Vote 20 is £2.55 million.</P>
      <P>The reason for the increase in the 1997 Estimates relates to my announcement on 12 December 1996 that contracts valued at £5.5 million has been assigned for the purchase of a helicopter and a fixed-wing aircraft for the newly established Garda air support unit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 451 and 452 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an internationally accepted concept that asylum seekers should apply for refugee status in the first safe country reached.  This concept has been mentioned in replies to questions raised in this House in the past, for example, <Col N="1257" /> Questions Nos. 35 of 15 October 1992, 41 of 15 May 1996, and more recently in my reply to Question No. 210 of 30 October 1996 to the Deputy.  In that latter reply, I stated, <i>inter alia</i>, that &ldquo;instances have also arisen of persons seeking to make applications in this State where those applications should, in accordance with customary international practice, have been dealt with in another state.  In instances such as this, applicants will not be admitted to the asylum process and will be returned to the state which should appropriately deal with their requests for refugee status.  Such return will always be preceded by a clarification and confirmation that the other state is willing to accept back the person in question and to process his or her application.&rdquo;  I might also add that this course of action has been agreed with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees &mdash; UNHCR &mdash; the guardians of the 1951 UN Convention relating to the status of refugees.</P>
    <P>In accordance with this internationally accepted practice, which has been the policy of successive Minister for Justice, 38 asylum seekers were advised in 1996 that they would not be admitted to our asylum determination process and that they should return to another state where their claims would be processed.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Convention, which was signed in 1990, arose our of a process of intergovernmental co-operation in asylum matters between the then member states of the European Communities. Broadly speaking, the purpose of the convention is to lay down criteria for determining which member state is responsible for examining an asylum application.  Its objective is to prevent a situation where an applicant for asylum could be sent from state to state &ldquo;in orbit&rdquo; with no state accepting responsibility for examining the application: essentially, convention is a set of procedural or technical rules.  A motion for a resolution approving the ratification of the convention will be placed before this House shortly.</P>
    <P>Nobody has been refused access to our asylum procedures at ports of entry.  All applications for asylum are referred to my Department where, on examination of the facts of each individual case, a decision may be taken that an applicant should more properly have lodged an application in another state.  As stated earlier, such a decision was taken in 38 cases in 1996.  This said, however, no asylum seekers were expelled or deported to a safe third country in 1996.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>whether recently adopted procedures require asylum seekers to provide documentary evidence of nationality before completed questionnaires are accepted or identity cards issued; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that many asylum seekers are forced to depart their countries of origin without such documentation; the plans, if any, she has to amend this procedure; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware that many asylum seekers are forced to flee their countries of origin without any documentation as to their identity.  For this reason, and to assist them in their contacts with State agencies, my Department introduced identity cards for asylum seekers with effect from 1 September 1995.  The Irish Refugee Council was consulted during the preparation of both the identity card and a revised questionnaire form and expressed their satisfaction with the development. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees also stated that they considered the revision of the questionnaire form and the issuing of identity cards as positive and constructive steps.</P>
      <P>It is an important feature of the asylum determination process for an asylum seeker to show that he or she has grounds for being recognised as a refugee and that he or she is who they claim to be.  It is necessary, therefore, for all asylum seekers to produce, as far as it is possible in their particular circumstances, some sort of evidence as to their identity.  It should be recognised that not all asylum seekers flee their alleged countries of origin without some form of identifying documentation; indeed, many of our asylum seekers are in a position to produce identification papers.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is common practice to advise all asylum seekers to try to secure and provide documentary evidence of their nationality and documentary evidence to support their application for asylum.  It is not the practice, and has never been the practice, to prevent an applicant completing the questionnaire simply because he or she cannot provide such evidence.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, that in a very small number of cases identification cards have been held back for a number of days where applicants have not produced documentary evidence of identification. There were cases where it was evident that the information provided by the applicant was, to say the least, questionable.  In such cases, the asylum seeker is invariably given documentation to enable him or her obtain access to the State's welfare services pending clarification of the matter.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to amend the procedures at this time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the preparation of the necessary regulations and recruitment of staff, the matter <Col N="1259" /> of the training of all persons dealing with asylum seekers is also being addressed.  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees &mdash; UNHCR &mdash; has given a commitment to provide training in asylum law and practice geared to the needs of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and his or her staff, the Refugee Appeal Board and other officials involved in the asylum process.  It is envisaged that the training course(s) will also include modules to be given by the Irish Refugee Council and a lawyer experienced in asylum law.</P>
    <P>I might add for the Deputy's information that training courses, run in conjunction with the UNHCR, have been held in recent years for both immigration officers and officials of my Department's asylum section.  Furthermore, some officials of my Department dealing with asylum matters have attended workshops run by the refugee studies programme at the University of Oxford in matters relating to refugee issues.</P>
    <P>In so far as interpreters are concerned, I am not aware of any complaints regarding the interpretation facilities currently provided.  This said, this was one of the issues examined by an interdepartmental committee which reported to me in 1996 on &ldquo;guidelines for the reception of asylum applicants&rdquo;.  The committee recommended that a panel of qualified interpreters be drawn up and that they be trained, in conjunction with the UNHCR, in the asylum process.  This issue has been taken up with the UNHCR and with the interpreters currently providing interpretation services for the Department.  This is a matter which will receive further attention in the context of the implementation of the Refugee Act.</P>

      <P>Any person making a claim for an unemployment payment must demonstrate that he or she is capable of, available for and genuinely seeking employment and any person signing for credited contributions must show that they are capable of and available for work.  These conditions apply equally to both male and female applicants.  Subject to these conditions any person, male or female, married or unmarried, is entitled to make a claim.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to ensure that persons are fully aware of their rights and entitlements and are enabled to avail of the wide range of schemes provided under the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets relating to all of my Department's schemes are available at all social welfare local offices and a large number of other public offices such as centres for the unemployed, post offices, libraries, etc.  All scheme developments and improvements are widely advertised using an appropriate media mix at local and national level. In addition, the Department actively supports independent voluntary organisations in providing information and advice on the range of social welfare services available.</P>
      <P>A number of important issues concerning women's rights to sign on the live register of unemployed persons and their access to employment and training schemes were raised by the National Women's Council in association with the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed in the recently initiated campaign entitled &ldquo;Breaking Down the Barrier &mdash; Women's Equality in the Labour Market&rdquo;.  The campaign included a national sign-on day and the circulation to public representatives of a submission concerning these matters.  The Connolly Centre for the Unemployed was among the organisations which made such a submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues raised are being addressed by my <Col N="1261" /> Department in a number of ways as follows: an information leaflet entitled &ldquo;Signing on the Live Register&rdquo; is now available at all the Department's local offices.  This leaflet gives information on the live register itself, details about unemployment payments and credited contributions and how to claim; the services available through my Department include locally based job facilitators who inform and advise people of the various options available to them; the Department is taking measures to ensure that spouses of unemployed persons are aware of their right to sign-on the live register where they satisfy the conditions to do so; the option, currently available under the community employment and the part-time job opportunities programmes, which allow a person to participate in either schemes in lieu of his/her spouse, is being actively promoted; and finally, the Government agreed to my proposal that the social partners, the National Women's Council and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed be invited to participate in a working party with the Departments of Social Welfare and Enterprise and Employment to examine the underlying issues that need to be discussed in the matter of access by women to State run employment schemes, training programmes and educational opportunities and to make recommendations to Government in this matter.  This working party will be established shortly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1262" /> allowance, the third level allowance and the second chance education schemes, is that they are specifically targeted at people on the live register.</P>
    <P>The live register includes people claiming unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance and people entitled to sign for credited contributions. Any unemployed person, male or female, who is capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work is entitled to make a claim for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  In order to qualify for payment, the person must also satisfy contribution conditions in the case of unemployment benefit or a means test in the case of unemployment assistance. People may also maintain their record of PRSI contributions by signing on for credited contributions provided they have had a recent record of paid contributions.</P>
    <P>The majority of training schemes aimed at unemployed people are administered by FÁS and the relevant qualifying criteria are a matter for that agency and for the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that my Department has prepared a special fact sheet entitled &ldquo;Signing on the Live Register&rdquo; which outlines how to access unemployment entitlements and answers the key questions in relation to schemes, training courses, educational schemes and the live register.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already indicated in my earlier replies, I intend to improve the means tests by progressively standardising the provisions for the <Col N="1263" /> assessment of capital across the various means tested payments including non-contributory old age pension.

      <Quest>if he intends to grant retrospective payments to widowers back to the date of the death of their late spouses in line with EU equality directives.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>EC Directive 79/7 provided for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security in the case of statutory schemes covering sickness, invalidity, unemployment, old age and occupational accidents and diseases.  The scope of this directive provided for a number of exeptions, primarily survivors benefits, family benefits and pensionable age.</P>
      <P>There are no EU directives which provide for the granting of retrospective payments to widowers back to the date of the death of their late spouses nor are there any EU directives which provide for equality of treatment as between men and women in relation to survivors benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, the process of providing for equal treatment as between men and women in relation to the remaining areas of the social welfare code which were not covered by EC Directive 79/7 commenced in 1989, with the introduction of a non-contributory widower's pension and deserted husband's allowance scheme for widowers and deserted husbands rearing children. The introducton of the lone parent's allowance scheme in 1990 continues this process by providing for a single social assistance payment for all lone parents who were rearing children.  The non-contributory widower's pension and deserted husband's allowance schemes were subsumed into the lone parent's allowance scheme.  In 1994, a <Col N="1264" /> contributory widower's pension scheme was introduced on the same basis as the existing widow's contributory pension scheme.</P>
    <P>The new one parent family payment, which I introduced with effect from the beginning of this month, replaces the existing lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit/allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance schemes for new claimants.  This new payment covers both men and women and also applies regardless of whether one is unmarried, separated or divorced. The introduction of the one parent family payment also marks the end of the concept of desertion in the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>Any further improvements in this area are matters for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>There is no trace of receipt in my Department of an application for free telephone rental allowance from the person concerned.</P>
      <P>To qualify under this scheme, a person must be in receipt of one of a number of qualifying payments.  For people aged 66 or over, these payments include an old age or retirement pension, a widow(er)'s pension or one of a number of foreign social security pensions.  For people under age 66, the qualifying payments comprise an invalidity pension, disability allowance or a blind person's pension.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, a person aged 60-65 who is in receipt of a widow(er) pension and who satisfies the household composition conditions of the scheme may receive this allowance if the deceased spouse received the allowance prior to his/her death.  The purpose of this special concession is to minimise any loss of social welfare entitlement to the household following the death of a pensioner.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is 63 years of age.  She is in receipt of a widow's contributory pension since March 1996 at the current rate of £73.10 per week.  This rate includes a fuel allowance of £5 payable for the duration of the winter heating season &mdash; October to April.</P>
      <P>According to the records of the Department her late husband was never in receipt of a free telephone rental allowance.  On this basis, she would not have an entitlement to this allowance in her own right at this stage.  She may, however, qualify for this allowance, and the other free scheme benefits, i.e. free electricity allowance and free TV licence, when she reaches age 66.  If she applies three months in advance of her 66th birthday, her entitlement will be determined and any allowances due will be applied when due.</P>

      <P>Information on the full range of social welfare services is available through my Department's network of 60 local offices throughout the country.  A clerical officer in each local office is normally assigned to information duties and is responsible for dealing with personal callers, telephone inquiries and correspondence.</P>
      <P>Officers assigned to such duties advise and inform people in relation to specific claims or provide information of a more general nature. Apart from dealing with individual inquiries, information officers frequently provide information through seminars and presentations to local groups and organisations.  Information officers also participate in local information campaigns and events in co-operation with other statutory and non-statutory agencies to heighten public awareness of welfare rights and entitlements to social services generally.</P>
      <P>In addition to the network of local social welfare offices, there are two public offices in Dublin located near the city centre.  These offices deal with a combined total of almost 50,000 callers per year and each has a staff of seven clerical officers working under the supervision of a staff officer.</P>
      <P>Information on social welfare entitlements may also be obtained from other areas of the Department. These include jobs facilitators in each region assigned to advise and assist people in relation to employment supports such as the back-to-work allowance, family income supplement, education opportunities, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People may also make inquiries by telephoning or writing to the relevant office or section of the <Col N="1267" /> Department.  The addresses and telephone numbers for the various schemes are listed in the telephone directories and in many regional or local publications.</P>

      <Quest>if he will confirm that the post of investigation officer at an employment exchange (details supplied) in Dublin 11 was vacant for over 12 months immediately following the promotion of the previous officer who uncovered alleged fraud of over £3 million involving thousands of claimants who were alleged to have used incorrect addresses; the reason, if any, he has to suspect the involvement of paramilitary or other criminal elements in the alleged fraud; whether the Garda were called in to deal with the alleged offences uncovered; if he refused to sanction the filling of the vacant post until recently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As I stated in a previous reply to the Deputy on this matter &mdash; Question No. 291 of 17 December 1996 &mdash; the deployment of staff resources at local level within my Department is a matter for the management of the Department and I do not involve myself in the timing of the filling of particular vacancies.</P>
      <P>I would like to state, however, that the post in question was not vacant for as long as the Deputy suggests and that during the period it was vacant, of less than six months, the work was covered by other officers in the region following normal practice.</P>
      <P>There is no record of the involvement of paramilitary or widespread criminal activity having been identified as a result of the officer's control activities in the area in question.  My Department has good working relationships with the Garda and it is participating actively in the working of the Criminal Assets Bureau which was established last year.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has relevant information regarding paramilitary involvement in fraud I would welcome it being supplied to the Department or to the Criminal Assets Bureau or the Garda.</P>

      <asker>Mr. J. Walsh</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a newspaper article (details supplied) which claimed that about 70 per cent of single mothers claiming lone parent's allowances have cohabiting partners and are thus disqualified, a high proportion of those claiming the lone parent's allowance as deserted spouses are not deserted and that almost two-thirds of those claiming living alone allowance are not in fact living alone; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1540/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the article in question a variety of alleged abuses impinging on the level of public expenditure are described, some of which relate to expenditure by my Department.  Naturally, I would share the concerns in general about any such abuses and I will do all within my power to deal with those which are within the remit of my Department.</P>
      <P>Controls against the types of social welfare abuse mentioned are exercised by the Department both at the initial claim stage and at subsequent review.  Explanatory literature with the application forms sets out the statutory conditions and disqualifications for the information of claimants.  They are required to answer questions and make a written declaration as to their fulfilment of the relevant conditions at new claim stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> Claims in payment are also subject to ongoing review.  The Department has an extensive programme of control activities across the whole range of its schemes and services.  The programme is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.  New approaches and measures are identified and adopted on an ongoing basis.  This control programme includes specific targeted reviews on the various qualifying conditions for lone parents and for pensioners. This programme yielded estimated savings of £141 million across all schemes in 1996, including £15.2 million savings on deserted wife's benefit and allowance and on lone parent's allowance.</P>
    <P>In relation to cohabitation, the Department follows up any situations where this is indicated.  In 1996, a total of 27,200 new claims from deserted wives, lone parents and widow(er)s were received out of which just 164 were rejected on grounds of cohabitation following investigation.  Claims in these categories reviewed during 1996 because of indications of potential non-entitlement resulted in over 1,000 clients having their claims terminated by the Department due to cohabitation.  A further 900 claims were terminated on review during 1996 due to marriage or remarriage.</P>
    <P>The question of proving desertion has always been a contentious and difficult area.  The new one parent family payment which commenced on 2 January 1997 no longer seeks to prove desertion as a qualifying condition but instead provides income support on a needs basis for separated people with dependent children, as well as for those who are unmarried or widowed parents.</P>
    <P>There are 100,000 social welfare clients in receipt of a living alone allowance, the vast majority of whom are elderly or widowed people. The rules allow pensioners living in specific housing arrangements, such as granny flats or certain types of sheltered housing complexes, to qualify for the allowance.</P>
    <P>Under the control programme, over 8,000 old age and widowed pension claims were reviewed by the Department in 1996, as part of a general reassessment of their continuing entitlement to pension.  These reviews normally encompass a reassessment of household composition in order to verify ongoing eligibility for various free scheme supplements and the living alone allowance where payable.  These specific reviews resulted in cessation of living alone allowance in just 335 cases during the year.  Overall, nearly 3,200 living alone allowances were terminated during 1996 for a wide variety of reasons, including routine review and change of pensioner circumstances.</P>
    <P>The results achieved through the control programme came from a combination of data matching, investigation and information received from members of the public.  Every suspect case, regardless of how it is identified, is fully investigated and entitlement is revised or confirmed as appropriate.  I am determined to eliminate fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and will <Col N="1271" /> take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that payments are made only to those who are legally entitled to them.</P>

      <Quest>the guidelines under which the health boards can give assistance towards mortgage payments; and if it is in order to refuse an applicant on the grounds of the level of arrears and on the presumption of fact that the lending organisation may or will take court action for the surrender of the house.</Quest>

      <P>Under the provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, health boards may pay a weekly supplement towards mortgage interest payments to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.  The supplement is payable in respect of the interest content of the mortgage only.  The legislation governing the payment of mortgage interest supplement is outlined in section 10 of S.I. No. 382 of 1995.</P>
      <P>In awarding a mortgage interest supplement the health board will have regard for the position of the applicant to meet the repayments at the time that the loan was agreed, and that the mortgage interest was reasonable.  It would also take into consideration the extent of the arrears at the time of the application.</P>
      <P>For the Deputy's information the following is a copy of section 10 of S.I. 382 of 1995.</P>
      <P>10.(1)  Subject to these Regulations, a person shall be entitled to a supplement towards the amount of mortgage interest payable by him in respect of his residence:</P>
      <P>Provided that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the loan agreement was entered into at a time when, in the opinion of the health board, the claimant was in a position to meet the repayments thereunder, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the residence in respect of which the loan is payable is not offered for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> (2)  Subject to sub-article (3), it shall be a condition of any claimant's entitlement to a supplement under sub-article (1), that the health board is satisfied that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the amount of the mortgage interest payable by the claimant does not exceed such amount as the health board considers reasonable to meet his residential and other needs, and</P>
    <P>(b)  it is reasonable to award a supplement having regard to the amount of any arrears outstanding on the loan.</P>
    <P>(3)  Notwithstanding sub-article (2), a health board may award a supplement where the amount of mortgage interest payable by the claimant exceeds such amount as the board considers reasonable to meet his residential and other needs:</P>
    <P>Provided that no sum shall be paid in respect of such supplement for any period more than 12 months from the date on which the claim therefor is made.</P>

      <P>Maternity benefit is payable to a woman whose employer certifies that she is entitled to maternity leave under the Maternity Protection Act, 1954, and who satisfies the relevant PRSI contribution conditions.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, all women who are employed under a contract of employment or an apprenticeship are entitled to maternity leave, irrespective of the number of hours worked.</P>
      <P>Where a woman, who is qualified for maternity benefit in one employment, subsequently moves to another employment, then she will retain entitlement to that benefit so long as it is certified by her new employer that she is entitled to maternity leave under the Maternity Protection Act and she continues to satisfy the relevant contribution conditions.  Maternity benefit is, accordingly, transferable between employments.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  In addition applicants must live alone or only with qualified dependants, a carer, a person in receipt of a short-term unemployment assistance payment <Col N="1273" /> or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right.</P>
      <P>A review of the scheme was recently carried out on behalf of the Department by independent consultants to ensure that the scheme is operating effectively and equitably.  Extending the scheme to all senior citizens was examined in this context. A draft of the consultant's report was recently received in the Department and is being examined. Decisions to revise the scheme will be made only when the consultant's final report has been received.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 208 of 19 December 1996.  Total payments under the Presidency subhead, A9, of the Department's vote amounted to just over £69,000 in 1996.  The temporary posting of an officer to the Irish Mission in Geneva for the duration of the Presidency cost just over £14,000 while the preparations for the WTO Ministerial conference in Singapore accounted for almost all of the remaining costs.</P>
      <P>Because some Presidency payments may arise in 1997, I am not in a position at this stage to give a final outturn figure.</P>

      <P>The average waiting time between application and hearing of an unfair dismissal claim before a Rights Commissioner is approximately three months.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Employment Appeals Tribunal it is difficult to be precise because of the variations from area to area.  However, a recent review of the procedures in the tribunal found that the waiting period was about six months in Dublin and slightly longer outside.</P>
      <P>Management consultants and information technology consultants have been reviewing the tribunal's procedures and systems during 1996.  In addition, a consultative committee, representative of employers and trade unions, has been set up.  It is intended that these measures, along with additional resources, should enable delivery of an improved service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 483 and 484 together.</P>
      <P>Following the closure of the Tambrands plant in Tipperary and the Schiesser plant in Carrick-on-Suir I appointed an inter-agency enterprise group to ensure that the Tambrands and Schiesser plants were made available for alternative investment purposes, to assist employees with training and retraining opportunities and to assist workers who wish to pursue entrepreneurial ventures in their own right.  The group has been working closely with public representatives and local interest groups to exploit to the maximum opportunities for job creation in the area.</P>
      <P>The Tambrands plant consists of two buildings. The group successfully negotiated with Tambrands to transfer the smaller of the two buildings to Tipperary South Riding County Council for use as an enterprise unit.  IDA Ireland has been actively marketing the larger building and the Schiesser premises to investors.  Some of these contacts are being pursued further by the IDA. Both plants continue to be marketed by the IDA internationally.  At my request, concentrated efforts are being focused on the task and I continue to be optimistic that a replacement project can be found at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forbairt and the county enterprise board for South Tipperary are also actively promoting <Col N="1276" /> industrial development and job creation in both towns.  Forbairt is in discussions with local interests concerning the development of a community enterprise centre in Carrick-on-Suir, while the county enterprise board has to date approved 14 projects in Tipperary town and 13 in Carrick-on-Suir which have yielded 34 additional full and part-time jobs to date.</P>
    <P>In addition, an audit of the skills of the former employees of the Tambrands and Schiesser plants has been undertaken by FÁS and specialised courses provided to assist those interested in retraining.</P>

      <P>As I previously indicated to the <Col N="1277" /> House, the provision of additional matching funding does not arise in relation to the readaptation aid of 627,000 ECU approved by the EU Commission in late November 1996 under Article 56 (2) <i>(b)</i> of the ECSC Treaty for 209 former Irish Steel workers made redundant in 1994, 1995 and early 1996 under the 1994 Irish Steel restructuring plan.  The extra statutory redundancy payments received by the former workers constitutes the matching funding and this has been accepted by the EU Commission.  The only other occasion when readaptation aid was paid to former Irish Steet workers by the EU Commission was in 1985 and on that occasion the extra statutory redundancy payments received by the workers made redundant also constituted the matching funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may rest assured that my Department will make payments to the 209 eligible former Irish Steel workers as a matter of priority on receipt by the Department of the redaptation aid <Col N="1278" /> from the EU Commission.  The amount payable to each of the 209 former Irish Steel workers will be 3,000 ECU per person, which I understand works out at approximatley £2,200 per person.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 489 and 490 together.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the preliminary figure for new overseas jobs created nationally by IDA Ireland and Forbairt was 14,081.  Of these, 22 were created in County Cavan and 25 in County Monaghan.</P>
      <P>The number of overseas jobs lost in County Cavan in 1996 is estimated at 84 and those in County Monaghan at 23.</P>
      <P>It is clear from these figures that, despite the best efforts of the agencies concerned, Cavan and Monaghan have not attracted a sufficient share of overseas investment in recent years.</P>
      <P>I made particular reference to the need to address the regional spread of such investments in my recent address to the IDA's annual staff conference, and am satisfied that they will maximise their efforts, in conjunction with local interests, and the local authorities in particular, in this regard.</P>

      <P>Subhead M2 of my Department's Vote provides Exchequer matching finance for projects sponsored by my Department's agencies under the European Commission's Employment Initiative.  This funding represents 25 per cent of the total projected cost of the projects in question. The remaining 75 per cent of the projects' costs are met from the European Social Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original provision for subhead M2 in my Department's Estimate for 1996 was £415,000. This Estimate was prepared during 1995 in advance of projects becoming fully operational and was based on the projected costs of projects up to the end of 1997.  The requirement was revised downwards to £208,000 in the context of <Col N="1280" /> my Department's Supplementary Estimate at the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>The 1997 Estimate for subhead M2 makes provision for £180,000.  While this represents a 57 per cent decrease on the original 1996 Estimate it is, in fact, a much smaller decrease compared to the revised Estimate for 1996.</P>
    <P>The 1997 Estimate is based on the latest projection of expenditure by my Department's agencies and this accounts for the decrease compared to 1996.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the Estimate for subhead M2 does not affect the amount of EU funding generally available for projects under the EMPLOYMENT Initiative.  A new call for proposals under EMPLOYMENT from projects to operate in the period 1998-99 was advertised in the national daily newspapers on 17 January.  A sum of approximately £32 million in European Social Fund aid will be available to projects selected to operate in that period.  I anticipate that all money available from the European Social Fund under this call for proposals will be absorbed.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the increase in the grant for Jobstart in subhead K6 of Vote 34 in the 1997 Estimates for the Public Services.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Jobstart is a recruitment subsidy scheme aimed at enticing employers to take on those who are three years or more unemployed. All unemployed people who are in receipt of an unemployment compensation payment or lone parent's allowance for more than three years, as well as those who are referred by the National Rehabilitation Board and travellers, are eligible to be recruited under Jobstart.  Under the scheme employers are paid a recruitment subsidy of £80 per week for one year when filling new or existing vacancies with an eligible unemployed person.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed with this initial slow take up and I arranged to have steps taken to raise the profile of Jobstart and improve the promotion of the scheme on the ground by actions such as: radio advertising at peak times; targeted newspaper and business magazine advertising; high profile regional launches with attached publicity; FÁS personnel taking opportunities to address local business associations; intensive work by FÁS in matching clients with potential employers; discussions with the various employer organisations, including IBEC, ISME and the SFA, and with ICTU and the INOU, to discuss how best they could assist in promoting this programme. All these organisations reaffirmed to me their full support for the programme and agreed on a range of further measures to promote it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of these steps, the rate of take-up increased towards the end of 1996.  This year a sum of £5.5 million is being provided under subhead K6 of my Department's Estimates.  This will <Col N="1281" /> allow for a steady expansion of participation in 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 497, 551, 552, 553, 554, 556, 557 and 558 together.</P>
      <P>The Protocol concluded with the Russian veterinary authorities in October 1996 sets out the basis for the continued import of Irish beef into Russia, including categorisation by county relative to the level of BSE in 1996.  The first category comprised the three countries which were restricted from the Russian market, commencing November 1996.  A second category comprised a number of counties from which the continued import of beef would be reviewed in the light of the future incidence of BSE in those areas.  All other counties could continue to export beef as usual.  It was also agreed that the BSE situation in Ireland would be reviewed in three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Russian veterinary authorities announced a decision last week to extend the export restrictions to five more counties &mdash; Cavan, Donegal, Limerick, Meath and Wexford &mdash; based on the level of cases of BSE in these counties since October 1996.  The announcement followed discussions <Col N="1283" /> in Russia between a high level technical delegation from my Department and Russian experts led by the Russian chief veterinary officer.  Very importantly, however, the Russian authorities have agreed a formula for the lifting of the restrictions.  In the cases of Limerick and Cavan, both of which had four cases of BSE in 1996, the restriction will be lifted if no new case emerges between now and 1 May.  More generally, it has been agreed that normal trading arrangements will be restored if there is evidence that the level of BSE has reached a peak in Ireland and the number of cases has declined.</P>
    <P>While the extension of the restrictions is regrettable, nevertheless, I am confident that the full Russian demand for Irish beef in 1997, which will be significant, will be met by counties not involved in the restrictions and that there should not be any undue impact on producer prices.  The Russian authorities have indicated that they are fully committed to the continuation of the beef trade with Ireland and it is important that this very critical market remains open to Irish beef. Furthermore, on the basis of the arrangement they have defended the safety of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to Iran is that during discussions at technical level in October, the Iranian Veterinary Organisation presented a draft veterinary Protocol which contained conditions, including regionalisation, which were not acceptable to me.  My views have been communicated to the Iranian authorities.  Following bilateral discussions between the Taoiseach and the Iranian Vice President late last year, it was agreed that an Irish technical delegation would visit Iran in an effort to resolve outstanding issues.  It is expected that the delegation will travel to Iran in late February following the ending of Ramadan.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to Libya is that renewed efforts are being made to finalise the visit of the technical delegation to Ireland.  This has been a market primarily for live cattle but I am anxious that there should be full access for both Irish cattle and beef.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 498 and 541 together.</P>
      <P>The calf processing scheme was originally introduced by the European Union as part of the 1992 CAP reform package in an effort to reduce the number of calves available for beef production. This scheme, which was voluntary on member states, was implemented only by Portugal, the United Kingdom and France.</P>
      <P>Both the European Commission and the Council of Agriculture Ministers recognised that the fall in beef consumption in the EU in 1996 created a new surplus of beef in the EU and that the surplus could most effectively be removed in the short to medium term by a reduction in production. The measures adopted by the Council in October 1996 for this purpose obliged member states to introduce an early marketing premium scheme for veal calves or the calf processing scheme.  As Ireland has no veal industry we are obliged under Council Regulation (EC) No. 2222/96 to introduce the calf processing premium scheme.</P>
      <P>Nine EU export licenced meat premises have been selected as processing centres.  The centres are strategically located to minimise haulage distances for the calves.  The transport of these calves is subject to the strict conditions set down under EU and national legislation.  In addition, the processing centres are required to meet the hygiene and animal welfare requirements applicable to meat plants.  Failure to comply with these requirements would result in the applicant concerned being removed from the scheme.  The calf processing premium will be paid only on animals which are in a fit and healthy condition on presentation at the processing centre and are processed in conformity with the very strict conditions applying under the scheme.</P>
      <P>In view of the foregoing, I am satisfied that the scheme as operated should not give rise to any serious animal welfare problems.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 505, 575, 576 and 577 together.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has raised certain issues in relation to the application of tax clearance to headage payments and following discussions with the Commission, who have decided not to pursue proceedings under Article 169 of the Treaty of Rome, certain modifications were made to the tax clearance rules for headage payments.  Applicants for payments over £500 and less than £5,000 are requested to supply their RSI number and a declaration that their tax affairs are in order and applicants for payments over £5,000 are requested to provide a tax clearance certificate. Failure to supply a declaration or tax clearance certificate may lead to a delay in processing the application and to an examination of the applicant's tax affairs by the Revenue Commissioners. Payment will not be refused.  In relation to RSI the EU Commission has agreed that failure by the applicant to supply and RSI number will result in the application not being accepted.</P>
      <P>The modified rules also apply to applicants for farm development grants who must however produce a tax clearance certificate in respect of contractors engaged by the applicant.</P>

      <P>There is great potential for employment in the forestry sector.  Total employment in forestry &mdash; direct and indirect &mdash; in 1992 was estimated at about 16,000 and it is anticipated that over 11,000 jobs could be created in forestry from now to the year 2020, if the programme set out in the Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector in Ireland is implemented.  The number of jobs in the planting sector will increase with the planned increase in afforestation but the biggest increases will occur in harvesting and haulage, followed by the primary processing sector, as the existing forest estate reaches maturity. This employment will be of particular benefit to rural areas.</P>

      <P>The Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector, published by me last year, advanced a most compelling economic and social case for the undertaking of a major afforestation programme over a 35 year period or so. The plan provides for both Coillte Teoranta and private planters undertaking afforestation with the aim of doubling the country's current level of forest area of approximately 600,000 hectares to 1.2 million hectares over that period.  Some one million hectares of land here, predominantly wet mineral soils, have been identified as being particularly suitable for afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total area of land currently under management <Col N="1292" /> by Coillte Teoranta amounts to approximately 430,000 hectares which includes some 44,000 hectares of unplantable areas such as swamps, lakes, ponds and areas of amenity and conservation importance.  Other examples of unplantable land would include mountain tops and areas under ESB lines.  Intensive commercially-oriented silvicultural practices are applied to plantable areas and where instances arise that a particular species is not performing optimally, Coillte Teoranta adopts a policy of premature clear-felling, replanting such areas with alternative, more productive species.</P>

      <P>The principle of sustainable yield, which involves the maintenance of a sustainable balance between timber production and timber harvesting, is the traditional cornerstone of forestry management.  Timber harvesting is controlled by felling licence and a normal stipulation is that clearfelled areas must be replanted.</P>
      <P>Supporting statistics relating to sustainable yield consist of national or regionalised comparisons of growth increment with licensed felling to establish that annual growth increment exceeds annual harvesting.  Such statistics are available in relation to the former State forests, now managed by Coillte Teoranta.  Prior to licensing Coillte Teoranta's general felling operations my Department undertakes an analysis of such statistics.</P>
      <P>The extension of such comparisons to encompass privately owned forests and the refinement of such comparisons to incorporate wider and changing facets of sustainable forest management is also being examined in my Department.  Such comparisons will be available on a national basis upon completion of the national forestry inventory which is being developed at present by my Department.</P>
      <P>Annual planting, including reforestation, currently some 28,000 hectares, far outweighs annual felling, currently some 5,000 hectares, so that the net impact is a rapidly growing timber resource.</P>

      <Quest>if he will have investigations made into and review the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry who has not received the proper compensation under a scheme for cattle sold in April and May 1996; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is considerable disquiet throughout the country regarding payment of this type of compensation; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that it appears that it is not the relevant person who received the compensation but other agents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I have had the matter referred to examined thoroughly in my Department.  The position is that the person named did not qualify for aid for young bulls under the 1996 BSE compensation scheme for heifer and young bull producers.</P>
      <P>The scheme in question was part of an EU BSE compensation package, worth close to £70 million to Irish farmers.  The details of the scheme were finalised following careful consideration of the views and recommendations of the farming organisations.  I am satisfied that the scheme has made a substantial contribution towards easing the income difficulties suffered by beef producers as a result of the difficult market situation in 1996.</P>

However, the use of this power of compulsory division has been suspended pending the resolution of an appeal to the High Court against the compulsory division of a commonage in the County Mayo townlands of Glenamadoo and Bunnahowna.

      <P>The Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) is a requirement under EU Regulations. Failure to implement the system would jeopardise all suckler cow premium, special beef premium, extensification premium and disadvantaged areas scheme payments in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that the introduction of LPIS for the first time in 1996 led to some delays in making payment.  However, I would point out that in the period 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1996 payments totalling £787 million were made to farmers under the various headage and premia schemes.  This was a record level of payments under these schemes.  While there were some teething difficulties in implementing the system in 1996, the problems encountered should not arise in future.</P>

      <P>Under EU Regulations 3886/92 and 3887/92, as amended, farmers holding suckler cow quotas and ewe premium quotas are required to use a minimum percentage of their quotas every year.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has recently decided that, with effect for 1997 and 1998, farmers holding suckler cow quotas of more than seven are required to use at least 90 per cent of the quota every year, otherwise the part not used will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.  Farmers holding quotas of seven or less are required to use at least 90 per cent of the quota in any one of two consecutive years, otherwise the part not used in the second year will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.</P>
      <P>Farmers holding ewe premium quotas are required to use at least 70 per cent of their quotas every year, otherwise the part not used will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.</P>
      <P>Farmers who are unable to use the required percentage of quota may lease out the unused part.  The leasing out of quota is regarded as using the quota.  However, from the year of first leasing, the farmer must use the required percentage of quota himself in two consecutive years in any five year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers who can show that, because of exceptional circumstances, they were unable to use the required percentage of quota, may, depending on <Col N="1301" /> individual circumstances, be allowed retain the full quota.  My Department adopts a sympathetic and flexible approach in deciding each case of exceptional circumstances on its merits.</P>

      <P>The extension of the Russian restrictions on imports of beef from Ireland should not <Col N="1302" /> significantly interfere with our high volume beef export trade to Russia.  Approximately 60 per cent of our steer beef production remains eligible for the Russian market and this should provide sufficent scope for the Irish beef industry to maintain beef exports to Russia at the 1996 levels.  In view of this, I do not expect the new arrangements to have serious repercussions on cattle prices here.  I should point out that, in the context of adoption of the 850 mecu BSE compensation package last June, I succeded in having the trigger level for the deseasonalisation premium reduced from 40 per cent to 35 per cent in order to insure the continuation of this premium into 1997.  This premium, which is equivalent to 7p/lb, will be of major assistance in protecting the incomes of beef producers this winter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 559, 561, 562 and 563 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The epidemiological study carried out in each case of BSE involves, <i>inter alia</i>, investigations of the feed system used in the herd.  As the average age of the onset of clinical symptoms is five years, the historical information available in regard to feed used in calfhood is not regarded as being entirely reliable.  No prosecutions in relation to a breach of the ban on feeding of meat and bonemeal have been initiated.  Legal difficulties could <Col N="1303" /> arise in sustaining such a prosecution.  In the case the Chief State Solicitor has sought a direction from the Attorney General as to whether a prosecution should be initiated.  Furthermore in one case in County Cavan a deduction of £9,000 on the market value of the herd was made due to the failure of the herdowner to take reasonable precautions to protect against the disease; the sum paid in compensation in the case was £81,000.</P>

      <P>Substantial resources are being made available under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry (OPARDF) 1994-99 to assist farmers involved in investment in traditional agriculture enterprises and in farm diversification measures.  These measures include the installation of pollution control facilities, farm improvement facilities including horticulture, and the upgrading of dairy hygiene facilities.  They complement and continue schemes commenced <Col N="1307" /> under the old farm improvement programme and the scheme for the control of farm pollution 1989-93. There are some 25,000 applicants participating in these schemes with approvals issued to about 20,000.  It is expected that the outstanding applicants will be approved for works during the current year.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, there are currently very generous capital allowances for farmers opting to invest on farm.  The write-off period for investment in farm buildings and structures was reduced from ten to seven years in the 1994 Finance Act.  In recognition of the importance of maintaining an environmentally sound farming sector the Government agreed in the context of the Partnership 2000 to introduce improved allowances for investment by farmers in necessary pollution control measures.</P>
      <P>In order to improve the competitiveness of the agriculture sector, productive investment is required to upgrade and replace facilities necessary to reduce production costs and enhance on-farm efficiency.  The continued availability of general stock relief at the 25 per cent rate and the continuation of the relief for young trained farmers, agreed in the context of Partnership 2000, will release scarce resources to productive on-farm investment.</P>

      <P>Under the installation aid scheme it is essential that the lands the subject of the application are fully registered in the name of the applicant.</P>
      <P>The issue of land registration for applicants under the scheme of installation aid for young farmers has been examined on numerous occasions since its inception in 1986.  Legal advice has been sought on these occasions and has remained constant.  As the applicant for aid is the ultimate beneficiary, it is essential that the he or she be the full registered owner of the lands the subject of the application prior to the payment of the premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The applicant for the pension under the farm retirement scheme is the ultimate beneficiary and accordingly the evidence that the lands have been transferred to another person is deemed adequate to satisfy the basic criteria under the scheme.  In these circumstances it is sufficient to show, by the production of a dealing number, that the lands <Col N="1308" /> have been transferred and that the necessary papers have been lodged with the Land Registry.</P>

      <P>My Department currently operates two schemes which are co-financed by the European Commission, and are specifically intended to encourage the earlier transfer of land from existing landholders to young farmers.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme of early retirement from farming older farmers are encouraged to transfer their lands to younger farmers with suitable qualifications. The aim is to increase the viability of the younger farmers' holdings as well as facilitating the entry of younger farmers into farming.</P>
      <P>Young farmers, under the age of 35 who set up as full-time farmers for the first time, may apply for the scheme of installation aid for young farmers. This scheme requires that the applicant have a minimum standard of education and be farming in such a way as to require a minimum of one man work unit within two years of setting up.</P>
      <P>There are a number of taxation measures in place to encourage early transfer of land.  Under the 1994 Finance Act the stamp duty payable on the purchase or gift of farmland for young trained farmers was reduced by two-thirds.  In recognition of the importance of this measure, the Government agreed, in the context of Partnership 2000, to consider extending this tax concession for a further period of time.  In addition to the stamp duty exemption young farmers are benefiting from very favourable tax exemption limits for long-term leasing of land.  The 1996 Finance Act increased the limit for leased income to £4,000 for leases of five to six years and £6,000 for leases of seven years or over.  These has also been significant improvements in the Capital Acquisition Tax code that should act as an incentive to early transfer. Under the 1996 Finance Act, a flat rate relief of 75 per cent applies to transfers by way of gift or inheritance taken on or after January 1996.</P>
      <P>I believe that these measures are making an important contribution to necessary structural change within the farming sector.</P>

      <P>The promotion of renewable energy, including wind energy, is a priority of the Government's overall energy policy.  To date several support initiatives have been taken to encourage the exploitation of this resource.  Under the first Alternative Energy Requirement, (AER1), which I announced in 1995, contracts for the construction of ten wind farms with a combined total electricity generation capacity of 73MW were offered. Details of the succesful AER1 projects are on <Col N="1312" /> tabular statement supplied.  The commercial operation deadline date for all AER1 projects is 31 December 1997.</P>
      <P>As a follow-on to the AER1 competition, I initiated a detailed review of renewable policy and support programmes.  This led to the launch, in April 1996, of a new long-term support strategy under which I have set targets up to the year 2010.  I have set a target of 90MW for wind energy up to the end of 1999 with further targets of 30MW per annum set for the post 1999 period. All capacity will be secured by competition, the first of which, (AERIII), I will launch shortly. AERIII will seek to secure 90MW of electricity generation capacity from wind energy systems before the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>In addition, my strategy also guarantees electricity market access for EU Thermie funded renewable energy projects.  Two Thermie funded wind farms are currently being developed, one in County Donegal, (3MW) and the other in County Roscommon, (5MW).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 580 and 583 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of reports about high levels of technetium-99 found in lobsters and some other shellfish produced near the Cumbrian coast.  Such reported levels exceed the safety thresholds which would apply in the aftermath of a nuclear emergency and have aroused media attention accordingly.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland's programme of monitoring of radioactivity in the Irish marine environment has detected comparatively sharp increases since 1994 in the levels of technetium-99.  The institute recently drew attention to these increases in its published report &ldquo;Radioactivity Monitoring of the Irish Marine Environment 1993 to 1995&rdquo;. However, the RPII has stated that increases detected do not represent a hazard to shellfish consumers in Ireland.  The RPII is intensifying its monitoring programme to ensure that any increased levels of radioactivity which may occur, due to technetium-99 discharges from Sellafield, will be detected quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to these reports, I wrote to the UK Secretary of State for the Environment and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food expressing my concerns and requested that they use powers available to them to order the immediate and complete cessation of the discharge of technetium-99 from Sellafield into the Irish Sea.  In the course of his recent reply to me, the UK Secretary of State for the Environment, <Col N="1315" /> Mr. John Gummer, said it would be inappropriate for him to intervene while the UK's environment agency is considering BNFL's recent application for a variation to their existing liquid discharge authorisation.  However, he assured me he would maintain a close interest in the matter and would not hesitate to use statutory powers should it prove necessary.</P>
    <P>I have also written directly to the responsible European Commissioner, Ritt Bjerregaard.  In addition, I have made the necessary preparations to have the question of radioactive discharges from Sellafield raised again at a ministerial meeting later this year of the Commission for the Protection of the Environment of the North East Atlantic established under the Paris and Oslo Conventions dealing with the prevention of marine pollution.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>if he has received commitments regarding the proper abatement of the radioactive gas Krypton 85 which is to be released in large quantities by THORP; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1146/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>Spent nuclear fuel reprocessing results in the discharge to the environment of all the Krypton-85 in that spent nuclear fuel.  Therefore, all Krypton-85 which is contained in fuel reprocessed at the magnox and THORP reprocessing plants at Sellafield is released in gaseous discharges to the environment.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is not aware of any plans by BNFL to limit the discharges of Krypton-85 through the introduction of abatement technologies.</P>
      <P>The RPII's atmospheric monitoring programme has, since 1993, included the measurement of Krypton-85 gas at Clonskeagh in Dublin. While the concentrations revealed in Dublin are broadly consistent with those expected at temperate latitudes of the northern hemisphere, any emissions from Sellafield are unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I might add that during the 1993 public consultation process relating to the THORP reprocessing plant, the Irish Government in the course of two submissions to the UK authorities stated that THORP should not be allowed to proceed without Krypton-85 gas removal technology being in place.</P>

      <P>A sum of £320,000 was provided in the 1996 Estimates to cover the cost to my Department of the Irish Presidency of the EU.  It is not possible at this stage to give the Deputy the final cost as there are a significant number of bills due from a number of areas, particularly the Department of Foreign Affairs which will affect the final cost to my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an autonomous intergovernmental organisation established in 1957 by the United Nations General Assembly.  It is the world's central intergovernmental agency for co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  It now has 124 member states, the overwhelming majority of which are non-nuclear states like Ireland.  Ireland became a member of the IAEA in 1970.</P>
      <P>Membership does not in any way restrict Ireland's opposition to the expansion of nuclear energy, even for peaceful means.  Indeed, our membership ensures that we have a direct say in seeking to ensure that the highest standards of nuclear safety and radiological protection apply in the nuclear industry and to influence the agency on other matters such as non-proliferation, safeguards and nuclear damage liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recent past, our active participation with other like-minded countries has yielded favourable results such as the recently adopted Convention <Col N="1317" /> on Nuclear Safety.  We are now actively involved in the preparation of a global Convention on Nuclear Waste Management and for improvements in the Vienna convention on nuclear damage liability and compensation.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the non-proliferation treaty, the IAEA is specifically accorded the responsibility for monitoring and verifying that nuclear states comply with the undertaking to use nuclear energy solely for non-military purposes. The agency therefore functions as the principal guardian of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime.  Participation in the IAEA's information network is also of crucial importance in providing the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) with early warning of a nuclear accident abroad.</P>
    <P>The Government does not consider it prudent, therefore, to seek the dissolution of the IAEA.</P>

      <P>Reports of interference to the broadcasting of Dublin Weekend Radio (DWR) have been investigated by officials of my Department who are liaising with DWR on the <Col N="1319" /> matter.  An unlicensed station, operating on a frequency close to that assigned to DWR and which may be the cause of the interference, has been detected.  The Deputy will appreciate that I do not wish to prejudice the outcome of any action which may be taken by giving advance notice of it to the House.</P>
      <P>It has become relatively easy for determined people to acquire the necessary equipment for illegal broadcasting.  On the other hand it is sometimes difficult to identify the operators and the location of the transmissions, due, for instance, to the transient nature of the activity and the tendency of these stations to move about on the frequency bands.  This has led to difficulties in the effective enforcement of the law in this area.</P>
      <P>This function is among those to be transferred shortly to the new telecommunications regulator. My Department is in the course of a review of the enforcement procedures with a view to strengthening the regulator's enforcement powers. In the meantime, I want to make it clear that the full provisions of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Acts will be invoked against such stations in any situation where the circumstances allow, and those involved in illegal broadcasting, including businesses and people advertising on, or providing services to, illegal stations, should have no doubt that action may be taken against them at any time.</P>

      <P>Ireland was responsible for the control and management of the European Community Monitor Mission to the Former Yugoslavia (ECMM) during the six month period of the Irish Presidency of the EU.  There was a total of 88 Irish personnel serving with the ECMM of whom 78 were members of the Permanent Defence Force. A total of 23 Irish personnel, of whom 20 are members of the Defence Forces, continues to serve in the mission as part of the arrangements under the EU Troika.  The additional costs in respect of Defence Forces participation, payable from the Defence Vote in 1996, are estimated to be slightly in excess of £1.5 million but the final figure has not yet been computed.</P>

    <P>Additional costs were also incurred by the Department of Defence during Ireland's Presidency of the EU in the area of security and in <Col N="1322" /> the use of an air taxi service to meet additional transport requirements of Ministers during the period.  The final cost of the air taxi service operated for the duration of the Presidency was £875,000 approximately.

      <P>All categories of applicant for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force under the recent recruitment campaign were required to be under 22 years of age on 1 October 1996.  The reduced upper age limit, which was introduced in 1996, follows specifically on the recommendation of the efficiency audit group and their consultants who recently completed a review of the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The very unsatisfactory age profile of the members was identified by the efficiency audit group as one of the serious problems facing the Defence Forces.  If the problem were to remain unaddressed a situation would be reached where the operational effectiveness of the force could be seriously compromised.  Therefore, in order to address the age problem it is necessary to recruit persons in the younger age-group.</P>

      <P>I am fully satisfied that the helicopter cover off Kerry Head on the night of Friday, 10 January 1997 was adequate.</P>
      <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service (IMES) of my Department is the co-ordinating authority for marine emergency response in Ireland and has helicopters available for tasking at three bases, Shannon Airport, Finner Army Camp and Casement Air base, Baldonnel.  These helicopters can and are tasked individually or collectively to any area as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the night of 10 January 1997 the three helicopters were available.  However, the IMES helicopter presently at Shannon is not yet fitted with an auto-hover system which allows the helicopter to automatically come to a hover over a vessel. The absence of an auto-hover makes winching from a small vessel at night difficult but not impossible.  Otherwise the IMES helicopter is <Col N="1327" /> fully equipped for 24 hour marine emergency response.</P>
    <P>Helicopters are just one of a range of resources available for marine emergency response around our coast.  We have excellent cover from the first class resources of the fast, purpose-built lifeboats of the RNLI, the rescue boats of the Community Inshore Rescue Service and the IMES Coastal Units.</P>
    <P>I presume the Deputy's question is prompted by an incident 30 nautical miles north west of Loop Head on the night of the 8-9 January 1997. In this incident a crewman on a fishing vessel was injured, losing the tip of his finger.  The vessel was put in contact with a doctor who advised that the crewman should be evacuated.  Consideration was given to use the helicopters and/or the lifeboats for the evacuation.  He was evacuated by the RNLI lifeboat from Fenit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> Under the terms of the current contract for the IMES helicopter at Shannon a fully equipped Sikorsky S61N helicopter incorporating an auto-hover system must be operational before 28 February 1997.</P>

      <P>With effect from 1 January 1997 the contract for the provision of the marine SAR helicopter service from Shannon was awarded to Bond Helicopters (Ireland) Ltd., at a cost substantially less than the previous contract.</P>
      <P>The resultant savings to the Exchequer are reflected in the 1997 Estimates.</P>
