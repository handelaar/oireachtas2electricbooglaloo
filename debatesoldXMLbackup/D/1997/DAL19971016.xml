        <i>(Dublin West):</i> The Taoiseach is proposing that this matter be decided without debate.  Therefore this is the only opportunity I have to make a point on the matter.  I do not know about other Deputies, but I was sent here to deal with urgent issues arising from my constituency such as long-term unemployment, poverty, neglected working class communities and the heroin crisis.  I want time to debate and get action on these issues.  There is no good reason the Dáil should miss four days in an already short session.  I strenuously object to the proposal.</P>

      <P>Statements made by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and others have cast doubt on the Government's acceptance of the Fine Gael motion regarding support for the legal case of the Louth Residents Group against British Nuclear Fuels and its support for the legal costs incurred by STAD.  Will the Taoiseach make clear the Government's commitment to contribute to the legal costs of the STAD case as well as the research costs preliminary to any legal action?</P>

They have pointed out to the Government that in addition to the research currently being undertaken there are other aspects of research that will be necessary to help build the case.

      <P>Will the Taoiseach undertake a fundamental review of the manner in which we are seeking to prevent road accidents? The carnage on our roads has reached an appalling level.  Last night a very dear friend and party colleague was killed in such an accident.  I do not know the full details of that accident, but he will <Col N="1086" /> be a great loss to the public life of the country and to his people in Wexford.  He made an enormous contribution at local and national levels, in Teastas and during his brief period in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to undertake a fundamental review of what is being done to prevent speeding, drunk driving and the elimination of accident blackspots all over the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the parties in Government I extend sympathy to the Leader of Democratic Left on the sudden and tragic death of Michael Enright and we pass our condolences to his wife, Mary, and his two daughters.  While I did not know him personally, I was aware of his work in Wexford and Kilmuckridge over the past 12 years as a councillor and of his work with the TUI.</P>
      <P>In a matter of days 19 or 20 people have died on our roads.  I will discuss the matter today with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to see what can be done on the issue.  For a number of years Garda and safety council reports have been pointing out that speeding is the major cause of traffic accidents, replacing other problems.  If 20 people had died in four days from any other cause, it would be a major issue of national concern.  We do not seem to express the same outrage when people die because of road accidents.</P>
      <P>This is a tragic morning for Senator Enright's family and for the families of those others who have died over recent days and whom I include in our sympathies.  I will raise the matter with the Minister today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only when a Member or former Member of either House is killed in a road accident that the prevalence of road deaths is brought home to the community of Leinster House.  I had the privilege of appointing Michael Enright to the Seanad and am deeply affected by his death and extend my sympathy to Deputy De Rossa, Democratic Left and all his friends in County Wexford.  I know the sense of loss extends far beyond one political party.</P>
      <P>I endorse what the Taoiseach has said regarding the problem of speeding.  There is a need to understand why speeding occurs, what drives people to put their own lives at risk in this manner and what inner forces are causing this outer expression of desperation, risk taking and turning of their face against the world.  It is evidence of a fairly profound psychological problem being faced by many young people.  While political action alone will not solve this sort of anomaly it is important to address it and recognise it for what it is.  It is a problem that has many manifestations, one of which is speeding on the roads.  Unfortunately there are many other self-destructive forms this takes and there are many occasions when others are destroyed in the process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As a colleague of Michael Enright on Wexford Corporation for more than a decade, I express my sympathy and that of the Labour Party on the news that Michael was killed tragically last night.  Later this evening I will travel on that road, a road those of us from the constituencies of Wexford and Wicklow know well.  This is a good road, extremely straight and wide which unfortunately seems to lend itself to excessive speed.  As our road system is being improved the issue of speeding is one on which we must focus.</P>
      <P>A number of reforms have been introduced in recent times.  Unfortunately many of the tragic accidents which have occurred have reversed the downward spiral up to 18 months ago.  Obviously there is a huge new volume of traffic on the roads which explains some of the problem.  Despite our best efforts many of the accidents occur in the small hours of the morning.  Even if we had a comprehensive system of monitoring speed we cannot monitor every road 24 hours a day but certainly there will have to be a concerted national effort to see what measures can be taken.</P>
      <P>We have looked at engineering problems on roads and have rectified them.  We have also looked at signage and road-markings.  Last year new regulations were introduced and on the spot fines were imposed for speeding.  The Minister commenced the process by introducing Operation Lifesaver.  A summit involving all the agencies involved, the Garda Síochána, the National Safety Council and the local authorities is necessary to see what concrete measures would have broad support in the House and across the country to attack what is now the greatest cause of death among young people here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The tragedy of the carnage once more on the road and the loss of a former Member of the Seanad is unspeakable.  Michael Enright had recently become known to many people in the Green Party through the Presidential campaign.  He was well respected and held in high esteem by the people of Wexford.  On behalf of the Green Party and on my own behalf I extend sympathy to his family and to Democratic Left.</P>
      <P>I hope the question of roads and the dangers will begin to receive the priority it deserves.  The previous Government and this Government have been involved with the car scrappage scheme. Many new cars on the roads are capable of doing considerable speeds.  Tragically, it is too late for many but I ask that we look at the whole area of car maintenance and controlling speeds.  In some other countries a bell rings inside a car to alert people they are exceeding the speed limit.  We have reached that point here and this tragedy underlines the urgency of doing something similar.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to urgently support the legal case of the Louth Residents' Group against British Nuclear Fuels through the provision of the necessary financial assistance towards research and legal costs as well as the appropriate technical expertise and information.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Yates).</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret the circumstances whereby this debate was unable to be completed last night.  The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs did a grave disservice to the issue, the Louth residents group and to the purpose of the motion which is to support the case against British Nuclear Fuels.  His speech was not one I would expect of a Cabinet Minister.  He acted in a way that not only damaged the case by referring to the &ldquo;insufficiency of evidence&rdquo; in terms of the legal advice to the Government which is grist to the mill of British Nuclear Fuels and something I would have to reject, but he failed to take the opportunity, despite repeated requests, to spell out the detail of the Government support for the Louth Residents Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business this morning the Taoiseach when asked, as he was asked about the ministerial task force yesterday, mumbled and murmured support for this cause.  This is leaving us all in the dark.  This morning I spoke with the <Col N="1090" /> legal representatives of the Louth residents group and they are totally unclear.  Last night the only indication we had from the Government was that the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Jacob would meet the group in the middle of next week.  I have no indication of the terms of the support that will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The motion clearly and unambiguously includes the terms &ldquo;legal costs&rdquo;.  There has been utter confusion on the Government side.  Yesterday there were reports from the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting that the Government would be co-plaintiffs.  At a press briefing later last night to political correspondents the Government said it would support phased help research projects.  Again this morning the Taoiseach talked about amassing the research and seemed to nod assent on the question of legal costs.  The position is unfair to the residents' group.  We need clarity on the Government's position.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Government has moved forward from its position of 6 October whereby it made a full and final offer of £200,000 based on an invoice system which did not include legal costs, the appointment of a health research worker, the recruitment of Masons, the information technology people, or the submission of a report from a nuclear engineering physicist. Those are the detailed questions the group want answered.  Some of those items would cost £50,000 and others would cost more, but they would not be extraordinarily expensive.  The Government has offered a global figure and claims that is the end of it.  We do not know its ultimate position.</P>
    <P>The residents submitted a letter to the Minister yesterday seeking an urgent meeting with him to clarify the position before the end of the debate on the motion.  He replied stating he was not in a position to meet the clients yesterday and stated:</P>
    <P>Further consideration is required in relation to certain aspects of the improved level of support which will be available from the Government. I can assure you that when we next meet I will have much more positive news about funding.  I intend that this meeting should take place in the middle of next week.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Minister's commitment to meet the residents, I am concerned there will be another stand off next week similar to that of 6 October and that the matter will end in tears.  I am concerned the Minister will make an offer that will fall short of what is required and we will be debarred from tabling another motion for six months.  I hope the motion is not being accepted as a parliamentary device to avoid the defeat that could have been inflicted, given the indications of support from several Independent Deputies, to whom I express my appreciation.</P>
    <P>I am still not clear on this matter.  It was regrettable that when the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs was asked if he could give an indication of the level of support that <Col N="1091" /> might be forthcoming from the Government, he deliberately evaded and politicised the issue.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions on the question of co-plaintiff and removing the status of co-defendant from the issue.  While I cannot speak for the Louth residents' group, I am sure these matters are negotiable and that the group would welcome a partnership with the Government because of its resources and expertise.  However, it would not welcome a takeover of the case which would not give it control over its future shape and direction. A decision on the case could take three years.  If the State decided to drop the case next year, the group would have no say in the matter.  That is a legitimate concern for the residents.  They favour partnership, but not a takeover.  They would have to agree the procedures of a co-plaintiff arrangement and would welcome movement in that direction.</P>
    <P>A plenary statement of claim has been lodged by the Louth residents' group.  The next step is to lodge a plenary summons against BNFL who will then have to file a defence, following which there will be a long and winding process of discovery. The existing legal requirement of discovery on the state of its documents has not been met by the State and its offices in providing documents to the group.  On the eve of lodging a plenary summons and statement of claim, the Louth residents' group does not know the level of support it will get from the Government.  The group is being frustrated.  Yesterday's national newspapers carried advertisements as part of the group's voluntary fund raising campaign.  It does not know the level of funding it will receive or whether it needs to initiate a voluntary fund raising campaign.  The residents are in the dark.  They are dissipating their energies with needless fractious negotiations with the Government.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to be clear-cut and generous in its approach and to reach an accommodation with the Louth residents' group next week.  I will continue to monitor this issue.  At the last meeting it was agreed that a stenographer will be present at all meetings and a verbatim report published.  Such transparency will benefit the Minister in that neither side will be misrepresented.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter between the Minister of State, the Louth residents' group and its legal representatives.  It is not a matter for me. The group took on this case in good faith, with the prospect of no personal gain, the possibility <Col N="1092" /> of financial devastation if it lost the case and a counter claim was lodged by BNFL.  In those circumstances, the group has shown resolution and courage over a sustained period over successive Governments.  It will proceed with or without Government support.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a ministerial task force or committee was raised on the Order of Business yesterday.  For a number of reasons, I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to re-establish such a committee.  This is not the domain of one Department.  The Attorney General and the Department of Health have roles to play in the matter.  We are talking about congenital defects, in that babies are born with the risk of exposure to radioactivity and developing cancer.  I draw the attention of Members to the report Cancer in Ireland, 1994 &mdash; Incidence and Mortality compiled by the National Cancer Registry Board, a State office.  The report covers all types of cancer and includes maps with the incidence of cancer shown in different colours.  The orange colour, which shows the highest incidence, covers a pocket along the mid eastern seaboard, covering Counties Louth, Dublin and Wicklow.  It is a remarkable coincidence that those counties are in close proximity to the UK western coastline, Sellafield and other nuclear installations given the concern raised by the report of the Radiological Protection Institute into aerial and marine emissions.</P>
      <P>Members referred last night to all party consensus on this issue.  I resent remarks from the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, about some of us being Johnny-come-latelies to this matter and about what he and his family had done compared with other Members.  That type of divisive and provocative language has no part in this matter.  I was recently appointed spokesperson on public enterprise and at the outset of the debate I said I became immersed in this matter in a detailed way only in the past few weeks.  I have come to respect the Louth residents' group, its bona fides and objective in this regard.  It accuses the State apparatus of negligence in monitoring in this regard over the past two decades which, in its view, should have been carried out and that is why it, as opposed to a bigger, more powerful and financially affluent authority, has been forced to take this case.</P>
      <P>I want the impasse resolved and this motion accepted in good faith.  I do not want another rupture between the Government and the Louth residents' group next week or to get faxes indicating that another offer has been made and the matter is irreconcilable because, while this breakdown has been overcome through agreement to accept this motion, a further one will be irreparable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I view this matter in the same context as the cases being taken by the US statutory authorities against the tobacco companies.  They are seeking to recover the fortunes spent in healthcare in relation to the tobacco industry in the US.  This <Col N="1093" /> case is analogous to them.  That is why the State should not only be removed as a co-defendant, but act as a partner as a co-plaintiff.  I want the Minister and his colleagues to know that I will be hovering over this issue like a hawk.  I hope I do not have to descend on my prey if matters are ruptured and do not reach a successful conclusion.  I also hope that ultimately the Government, the LRG and their legal teams will combine against British Nuclear Fuels and will have a historic victory over the next three years in winning this case through the national and European courts which will lead to the closure of Sellafield and THORP.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address Dáil Éireann on the subject of the Treaty of Amsterdam.  I am sure that all Deputies will agree with me when I say that the opportunity of making and hearing statements about the treaty is one we all value. Such statements provide a most useful opportunity for informing the Dáil, and through it the wider public, of the content and significance of the treaty and thereby encouraging public debate on it.</P>
      <P>This information process does not start and it will not end today.  In briefing the Dáil on 10 July on the outcome of the Amsterdam European Council of 16 and 17 June, the Taoiseach and my predecessor in office made presentations on the content of the treaty.  The previous Government had at all times kept the Oireachtas informed of progress in the Intergovernmental Conference which negotiated the treaty.  The House is aware that a White Paper on the treaty is in preparation in my Department.</P>
      <P>The treaty, signed by Foreign Ministers on 2 October in Amsterdam, is subject to national ratification procedures in all member states.  Prior to ratification by Ireland, a constitutional referendum will be necessary.  The Government has yet to take a decision on the exact date for holding a referendum.  The Taoiseach last week in Dáil Éireann expressed the hope that the referendum would take place in March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government attaches the highest importance to fulfilling its duty to explain the background and implications of the treaty.  Its scope and complexity mean that basic information on its content is the very first requirement.  The full title of the new treaty indicates the complexities we will have to unravel to make it understandable and comprehensible to the gnách duine.  The title is &ldquo;Treaty of Amsterdam amending the Treaty on European Union, the Treaties establishing the European Communities and certain related Acts&rdquo;.  The Treaty of Amsterdam is, therefore, a treaty amending the existing treaties including the Maastricht Treaty signed in 1992 and the treaties which established the European Coal and <Col N="1094" /> Steel Community, the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community over 40 years ago.  The cumbersome full title reflects the fact that European integration is an incremental process, developing from Treaty to treaty.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam was negotiated in an intergovernmental conference convened for this purpose in March 1996.  The Intergovernmental Conference's work programme was a practical one.  It involved revisiting two of the major innovations of the Maastricht Treaty, notably in the areas of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Justice and Home Affairs and addressing two broad challenges which had been identified subsequently.  The first of these challenges was that of bringing the European Union nearer to the people of Europe.  The second was the prospect of the enlargement of the Union to the East and West.  A complete revision of the Maastricht Treaty was considered neither opportune nor necessary.</P>
    <P>In addressing the House on the Treaty of Amsterdam, I shall use five broad headings which were used throughout the Intergovernmental Conference: the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice; the Union and the citizen; the effective and coherent foreign policy; the union's institutions; and flexibility.</P>
    <P>On an area of freedom, security and justice, in the Treaty of Amsterdam the reaffirmation of the principles on which the Union is founded &mdash; liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms &mdash; is accompanied by an explicit provision that only countries which respect these principles may apply to become members of the Union.  Importantly, this is underpinned by a provision which allows for the suspension of certain rights of membership, ultimately including voting rights, if a member state is found guilty of a serious and continuing breach of those principles.</P>
    <P>The treaty incorporates a new provision which would allow the Council acting unanimously to adopt measures to combat discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.  The provisions for ensuring respect for the principle of equality between men and women are strengthened.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam provides for the progressive establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.  It does so through three interlinked sets of provisions.  The first of these is the insertion in the treaty establishing the European Community of a new title or section on visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons, such as external border control.  The new title sets out a five year programme for the accomplishment of measures in these areas.  Nearly all the issues it covers were dealt with on an intergovernmental basis under the Maastricht Treaty.  Their communitarisation in the Treaty of Amsterdam involves enhanced roles for the Commission and the European <Col N="1095" /> Court of Justice in the matters covered.  The possibility of qualified majority voting and a full co-decision role for the European Parliament after the five year period, are also major innovations.  I shall set out the particular position of Ireland, which like the UK and Denmark is exempt from the provisions of Title IV at present.</P>
    <P>The second of the three interlinked sets of measures in this field is the residual, but greatly strengthened third pillar containing provisions on police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters.  This aims to provide citizens of the Union with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the member states in the fields of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters and by combating racism and xenophobia. Common action is envisaged to prevent and combat terrorism, trafficking in persons and offences against children, illicit drug trafficking and illicit arms trafficking, corruption and fraud.  Closer co-operation between police forces and other competent authorities, such as customs authorities, is to occur in a variety of ways.</P>
    <P>The revamping of the third pillar in the Treaty of Amsterdam extends to giving the Commission a shared right of initiative in all third pillar matters and to allowing member states, by means of a declaration, to accept a role for the European Court of Justice in this area.  Ireland remains open to the possibility of making a declaration to this effect and will keep the option of doing so under continuing review.</P>
    <P>The third of the three interlinked sets of measures relating to the progressive establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice is a Protocol integrating the Schengen <i>acquis</i> into the framework of the European Union.  Thirteen member states of the Union &mdash; all except Ireland and the UK &mdash; as well as Norway and Iceland had already committed themselves, outside the framework of the EU Treaties, to operate provisions designed to make a reality of open frontiers by lifting border controls while at the same time cooperating closely on immigration matters.  The incorporation of the Schengen arrangements into the treaty, by means of this Protocol, means that the Schengen <i>acquis</i> will become Union law as far as 13 member states are concerned.  Thus the 13, and indirectly Norway and Iceland, will be able to avail of the institutions of the Union for their co-operation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Irish position with respect to the provisions on free movement of persons, the principle of free movement of persons, together with free movement of goods, services and capital, is a cornerstone of the Union's internal market.  In recognition of this principle, the continental member states believe that controls at the borders between them should be abolished so that anyone lawfully within the Union may move from one member state to another without border checks.  In the Schengen arrangements, 13 member <Col N="1096" /> states, with Norway and Iceland, have already gone a long way in this direction.</P>
    <P>A similar long-standing area of free movement exists between Ireland and the UK.  Ireland's first concern in this part of the negotiations was to protect the common travel area.  The right to maintain this area has been explicitly accepted and confirmed by the Treaty of Amsterdam.  The UK wishes to maintain the principle and practice of control checks on travel documents at ports of entry to Britain, other than from Ireland.  While of necessity closely linked, Ireland's approach during the negotiations was distinct from that of the UK.  We had no difficulty of principle about the communitarisation of this whole area and were concerned to play as full a part as possible, compatible with the common travel area, in developments at EU level in the field of justice and home affairs.  Protecting the common travel area with the UK is important for us, since more than 70 per cent of travel originating in Ireland is to, or through, the UK.  In these circumstances, freer travel between Ireland and continental member states would have made no sense if it meant the imposition of certain new controls on travel between Ireland and Britain.  We are satisfied Ireland is not bound by any provisions that would cut across the common travel area.</P>
    <P>A protocol to the treaty exempts Ireland and the UK from the provisions of the new Title IV on free movement of persons but allows them, on a case by case basis, to join in the adoption of measures or to accept measures retroactively. Ireland may terminate this arrangement at any time and accept to be fully bound by the terms of Title IV.  Ireland also made a unilateral declaration annexed to the final Act of the treaty stating that, subject to its wish to maintain the common travel area, it will participate to the fullest extent in the future development of the Union in this area.</P>
    <P>Similar considerations lie behind that part of the Schengen protocol which states that Ireland and the UK, which are not bound by the Schengen <i>acquis</i>, may at any time request to take part in some or all of its provisions.  We are satisfied that the declaration setting out the procedure in the event of such a request by Ireland or the UK meets our concerns.  Essentially, it provides that the Council must seek a Commission opinion before deciding by unanimity on such a request and that best efforts must then be made to accommodate Ireland or the UK.  A related declaration states that, thereafter, best efforts will be make to make action under the Schengen <i>acquis</i> possible among all member states where Ireland and the UK have accepted some or all of the provisions of the Schengen <i>acquis.</i></P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam includes a protocol on asylum for nationals of member states of the European Union.  It states that member states shall be regarded as constituting safe countries of origin for all legal and practical purposes in relation to asylum matters and goes on to identify the cases in which an asylum application from a <Col N="1097" /> national of a member state may be taken into consideration or declared admissible for processing by another member state.</P>
    <P>It also states explicitly that the protocol respects the finality and objectives of the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees.  A declaration annexed to the final Act confirms that the protocol does not prejudice the right of each member state to take the organisational measures it deems necessary to fulfil its obligations under the Geneva Convention.  The Government is satisfied the new protocol is consistent with the obligations of member states under the convention and intends to take the organisational measures necessary to fulfil those obligations.</P>
    <P>In the preparatory stages of the Intergovernmental Conference, the concept of a citizens' Europe was expanded.  It came to embrace the idea of bringing the European institutions closer to the public and of greater transparency in Union affairs.  The negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam tried to keep this very proper concern to the forefront.  On this occasion, and to some extent in contrast with the Maastricht Treaty negotiations, the Intergovernmental Conference made considerable efforts to keep the public informed.  This is attributable in no small measure to the Irish Presidency and to its exceptionally lucid and coherent first draft outline of the treaty, produced in December 1996.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam clarifies the concept of citizenship of the Union.  It stipulates explicitly that &ldquo;citizenship of the Union shall complement and not replace national citizenship&rdquo;.  The Amsterdam Treaty also reinforces the existing rights of European citizens in their dealings with the institutions of the Union by including a new treaty provision which allows every citizen to write to any of the Union's institutions in any treaty language, including Irish, and have an answer in the same language.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty strengthens the European Parliament's powers and, other than in relation to EMU, limits to three the number of legislative procedures; assent, codecision with the Council and consultation.  Obviously, the codecision procedure is the most important politically as it gives the Parliament maximum influence.  Its scope is extended to a large range of new policy areas, ranging from employment and social policy to the collection of statistics and the protection of data.  This codecision procedure will be made simpler and faster and the Parliament will be on a more equal footing with the Council.  In addition, in future the nomination of the European Council as President of the Commission will require formal endorsement by Parliament.  The Treaty of Amsterdam also contains a protocol which provides for the speedy forwarding of Commission consultation documents and legislative proposals to national Parliaments to assist them further in their role in shaping legislation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the necessary strengthening of the democratic and participative nature of the Union, <Col N="1098" /> the treaty contains substantive provisions on a number of issues which are of direct concern to citizens of the Union.  These include employment, social policy, the environment, public health, consumer protection, and transparency.  It was recognised that a high degree of public concern existed in these areas and that concerted action could augment efforts already being made at national level.</P>
    <P>With regard to employment, the treaty establishes the objective of a high level of employment to be taken into account in all other Community policies.  It provides for the setting of employment guidelines and for Community incentive measures such as studies, sharing of experience and establishment of best practice among the member states.  In the field of social policy, there are strengthened provisions for equality between men and women, and provision for incentive measures such as studies and pilot projects in the area of social exclusion.  This latter provision was adopted on foot of a proposal from Ireland which had made action on social exclusion a priority during the treaty negotiations.</P>
    <P>In this context the Government welcomes the fact that the new provisions on social policy mean the social protocol is now fully incorporated into the treaty.  It had been a major goal of Ireland's approach in the negotiations to achieve this as there had been until now, given the non-participation of the UK, the potential to create two different social regimes within the Community.  I do not propose to go through each of the provisions in these and the other substantive areas concerning the Union and the citizen exhaustively today.  The White Paper will give a more detailed account of these.  However, taken as a whole, they represent a significant effort by the Union to enhance its relevance to the daily lives and concerns of its citizens.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty established the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy at a time of profound and rapid change in the international scene in the period following the end of the Cold War.  That treaty provided that the CFSP provisions would be reviewed at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference in the light of the experience gained in the interim.</P>
    <P>The years since Maastricht have demonstrated that, while the threat of East &mdash; West and global conflict has drastically receded, new challenges have emerged in international affairs, as intractable and complex conflicts in the Balkans and Africa demonstrated.  In consequence, the essential aim of the review undertaken at the Intergovernmental Conference was to create a more coherent, effective and visible foreign and security policy which would reflect the importance of the EU on the international stage, maximise its contribution to international peace and security and respond to the concern of its citizens that the EU could and should make a greater contribution commensurate with its very considerable economic capacity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> The Amsterdam Treaty incorporates reforms which will equip the European Union to play a more effective role in international relations.  The treaty reaffirms the objectives of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy, and affirms explicitly that they are to be pursued, under the treaty, in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter.  The European Union will, as in the Maastricht Treaty, work through the CFSP to strengthen the security of the Union and its member states and will seek to preserve peace and strengthen international security, in accordance with the fundamental principles of the UN and the OSCE.  The treaty also affirms the commitment of the member states to enhancing and developing their mutual political solidarity.</P>
    <P>I will outline the principal changes to the CFSP which have been brought about by the Amsterdam Treaty, and the reasoning behind these changes.  One of the principal innovations is the provision for developing common strategies.  The European Council may adopt by unanimous decision an approach to a specific wide-ranging issue, for example, the Middle East peace process or regional conflicts in Africa.  Once a common strategy has been adopted by the European Council, subsequent decisions required for its implementation will be taken at foreign Minister level by qualified majority vote.  Unanimity will continue to apply in respect of all other policy decisions on CFSP issues taken by the General Affairs Council.  In addition, the Treaty of Amsterdam specifically provides that all decisions having defence implications will require unanimity.</P>
    <P>The definition and scope of two existing policy instruments, joint actions and common positions, have been revised and refined.  Where either a joint action or a common position is adopted in the context of an agreed common strategy it will be the subject of qualified majority voting. However, a joint action or a common position which reflects a policy decision on an issue which is not covered by a common strategy will continue to be adopted unanimously.  This limited introduction of qualified majority voting, where the broad outlines of policy have already been established, will assist the Union, both in its present composition and following enlargement, to avoid the risk of paralysis in decision-making on foreign policy issues.</P>
    <P>The introduction of qualified majority voting in the Treaty of Amsterdam has been accompanied by adequate safeguards to prevent a member state being outvoted on a sensitive foreign policy issue.  A key provision allows any member state to oppose the adoption of a decision by qualified majority for &ldquo;important and stated reasons of national policy&rdquo;.  This safeguard has been described as an emergency brake and, as that term suggests, is expected to be used only in exceptional circumstances .</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> In addition, there is provision for a procedure known as &ldquo;constructive abstention&rdquo; where, in a case where unanimity applies, a member state can opt to abstain while allowing other partners to proceed with a particular action, thereby introducing an element of flexibility into decision-making.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the Union's external representation have been modified.  While the presidency continues to play a key role, the secretary general of the Council, acting as high representative for the CFSP, will assist the presidency in representing the Union and facilitate the work of the Council of Ministers by contributing to the formulation, preparation and implementation of policy decisions.</P>
    <P>Effective and timely preparation of EU positions is crucial.  To this end a policy planning and early warning unit, essentially a development and strengthening of the existing support structures which exist within the Council secretariat, will be created.  This body will be asked to make assessments, undertake research and analysis and assist in the planning and formulation of policy.  The unit will be subordinate to the Council of Ministers.  The CFSP will be financed as a general rule from the EU budget, except for matters with defence or military implications or when the General Affairs Council unanimously decides otherwise.  In cases where the General Affairs Council so decides, financing will normally come from member states according to the GNP scale of contributions.  An inter-institutional agreement has been reached between the General Affairs Council, the Commission and the European Parliament to create a budget line specifically for expenditure of this nature.  I wish to make it clear that member states who constructively abstain from any operation having defence or military implications will not be obliged to contribute financially to such an operation.</P>
    <P>The revised provisions on security and defence reflect the realities that security is a broad concept which is of interest and concern to every member state and that the maintenance of security requires a range of approaches &mdash; political, civil, economic, diplomatic, humanitarian &mdash;some of which also entail a supportive military dimension.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall that the foundations of the EU's role in the security and defence area, namely, its relationship with the Western European Union, were first laid down in the Maastricht Treaty.  The outcome of Amsterdam on security and defence is realistic and takes account not only of the different defence situations and commitments of member states but also of the broader European and global security context which has presented new challenges particularly in the areas of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and crisis management.</P>
    <P>The CFSP will encompass a new role for the European Union in the field of peacekeeping and the prevention and management of international crises and conflicts through the inclusion in the <Col N="1101" /> treaty of what have become known as the Petersberg Tasks.  The Petersberg Tasks include humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and international crisis management activities which have been developed to meet the new problems which have arisen since the end of the Cold War.</P>
    <P>The Petersberg Tasks have been included in the treaty on the basis that the implementation of these tasks will be a matter for the Western European Union at the instigation of the EU. This development gives a practical focus to the approach set out in the Maastricht Treaty, which provided that the Western European Union is an integral part of the development of the European Union and also that the EU could request it to elaborate and implement EU decisions and actions which have defence implications.</P>
    <P>Participation in a Petersberg Task will be on a voluntary and case by case basis; there is no obligation on Ireland or any other partner to participate in a Petersberg Task should it not wish to do so.  However, those EU member states which are not members of the Western European Union&mdash; the Western European Union Observers, namely Ireland, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Denmark &mdash; will be entitled to participate fully in Petersberg Tasks undertaken by the Western European Union at the EU's instigation, including participation on an equal footing in the Western European Union planning and decision-taking associated with such tasks.</P>
    <P>This development accords fully with Ireland's interest, as a UN peacekeeper with over forty years' experience, in contributing to these tasks in a manner that is fully in keeping with our commitment to international peace and security, with our non membership of military alliances and also with our wish to play an active part in helping to ensure security in Europe and further afield, in co-operation with our EU partners.</P>
    <P>While the new treaty gives the EU the right to avail of the Western European Union for Petersberg Tasks, it does not, however, provide for integration of the Western European Union into the EU, seen by many member states as the desirable institutional route by which the EU could arrive at a common defence.  Instead, integration of the Western European Union is referred to as a possibility, made subject also to the unanimous decision of the European Council and the assent of each and every member state.  Moreover, integration of the Western European Union into the EU, or any institutional arrangement which imposed a common defence commitment on the EU, would entail amendments to the Treaty of Amsterdam or a new treaty, and thus a further Intergovernmental Conference.  However, unlike the Maastricht Treaty which provided for a review after five years, the review clause in the Amsterdam Treaty sets no date for a further Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>The new treaty provides for the &ldquo;progressive framing of a common defence policy&rdquo;.  This is a revision of the Maastricht Treaty provision which provided for the &ldquo;eventual framing of a common <Col N="1102" /> defence policy&rdquo;.  There was no agreement at the Intergovernmental Conference on proposals by some of our partners to incorporate the objective of a common defence into the treaty, which would have had implications for those member states, including Ireland, which are militarily neutral.  Instead, the treaty states that the framing of a common defence policy &ldquo;might lead to a common defence&rdquo;, essentially the same formulation as in the Maastricht Treaty.  Under the Amsterdam Treaty, such an eventuality would also require a unanimous decision to that effect by the European Council, which would in turn need to be agreed to by each and every member state. These additional qualifications and safeguards did not feature in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>With regard to armaments, efforts were made by some partners to strengthen the basis for co-operation under the Rome and Maastricht Treaties.  This is a sensitive issue for many states, including Ireland where it is very important.  We do not produce arms and we have a strong commitment to restraint in arms transfers.  The compromise which emerged amounts to a permissive, as distinct from mandatory, approach to the issue.  The Amsterdam European Council conclusions, in response to an Irish initiative, singled out the importance of greater joint efforts in the area of arms export controls.  I am, accordingly, encouraged to see that the British Government has set itself the task of elaborating a code of conduct on EU arms exports during its forthcoming presidency.</P>
    <P>Certain key provisions of the Maastricht Treaty remain unchanged.  The treaty acknowledges the &ldquo;specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states&rdquo;.  This reference takes account of Ireland's position as a neutral non-member of military alliances.  It is accompanied by a reference which records that certain other states see their common defence realised in NATO, as distinct from the European Union.</P>
    <P>The new treaty does not provide for the integration of the Western European Union into the EU, nor is EU/WEU integration stated anywhere in the treaty as an objective.  The treaty, through an attached protocol, does provide for closer institutional relations and practical co-operation between the EU and the Western European Union, which is natural and indeed warranted in view of the inclusion of the Petersberg Tasks.  It is important to remind ourselves of the nature of the Petersberg Tasks and not distort the situation. It is expected that the progressive framing of a common defence policy, as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty, will concentrate on developing the EU's role in Petersberg Tasks.</P>
    <P>The Western European Union remains, as it was under the Maastricht Treaty, &ldquo;an integral part of the development of the Union&rdquo;.  The Western European Union also sees itself as a means of strengthening the European pillar of the Atlantic Alliance.  This dual vocation of the Western European Union, which was reflected in a <Col N="1103" /> declaration by the Western European Union appended to the Maastricht Final Act, is reflected also in an updated Western European Union Declaration appended to the Final Act of Amsterdam.  Of practical relevance in this connection is that, in view of the inclusion of the Petersberg Tasks, and the fact that the Western European Union does not possess significant military resources, the Western European Union will most probably call on NATO assets and resources, for example, airlift, communications and infrastructure, to facilitate implementation of such tasks.  The Western European Union and NATO are currently developing arrangements to this end, in the framework of NATO's evolving role towards greater support for peacekeeping activities under the UN or OSCE.  Our current participation in SFOR in Bosnia, which operates under a UN mandate, is very much in line with this broad approach which enables us to stay in the mainstream of international peacekeeping at a time when the UN is turning increasingly to regional peacekeeping solutions.  I was witness to it firsthand and I would like to see the Defence Forces expand into these areas of regional conflict.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's view that the Amsterdam Treaty will lead to the more effective and efficient functioning of the CFSP: limited movement towards qualified majority voting while providing adequate safeguards to prevent a member state being outvoted on sensitive foreign policy issues should ensure a balance between the ability of the Union to respond adequately and the need to safeguard the interests of individual member states; the outcome on security and defence has been highly satisfactory to Ireland.  Ireland's policy of military neutrality is not affected; a decision whether or not to participate in a particular Petersberg Task remains a sovereign one for each member state.</P>
    <P>There will no doubt be much focus in the months ahead on the security and defence provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty.  All aspects of the treaty should be read, debated and understood, and when the time comes the people will make an informed decision on its ratification.  In setting out the Government's views on these matters, I ask that these matters be discussed and debated in a fair and balanced manner, based on the facts.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to some of the changes under the Treaty of Amsterdam in the role of the European Parliament.  In this connection I would add that an eventual ceiling of 700 members was agreed for the Parliament, subject to ensuring that a minimum representation is guaranteed to smaller member states.</P>
    <P>Within the Council itself, provision is made in the treaty for the extension of qualified majority voting to a limited number of new and existing treaty provisions and we welcome this.</P>
    <P>The treaty also contains a &ldquo;Protocol on the institutions with the prospect of enlargement of <Col N="1104" /> the European Union&rdquo; which recognises the right of all member states to nominate a full member of the European Commission.  This was one of Ireland's key negotiating objectives.  We can also welcome the fact that, at the date of entry into force of the first enlargement, the larger member states will give up their second Commissioner, provided that, by that date, the weighting of the votes in the Council has been modified, whether by reweighting of the votes or by dual majority, in a manner acceptable to all member states.  The provision for a later review of institutional arrangements does not prejudge any outcome with regard to the nomination by each member state of a full Commission member.</P>
    <P>In summary, as my predecessor said in this House in July, from the Irish point of view the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference in the area of institutional reform has been very satisfactory.  In this area, Ireland shared the concern of other member states to preserve the broad balance within and between the European Union's institutions which has been essential to the success of the Union.  In particular, Ireland attached priority to protecting the position of the European Commission and to maintaining the right to nominate a full member of the European Commission.  We continue to believe it is central to the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Commission and of the Union's institutions as a whole that each member state is entitled to nominate a full member.</P>
    <P>The treaty contains new provisions according to which enhanced co-operation may take place among a group of member states.  Provisions are incorporated which are designed to ensure that such closer co-operation would preserve the cohesion of the Union and its institutions and would not exclude any member state which may wish to participate, either initially or subsequently.  It makes clear that only participating member states shall decide upon, and bear the cost of, acts and decisions necessary for the implementation of closer co-operation, and that the European Parliament will be regularly informed of developments.</P>
    <P>The application of such enhanced co-operation or flexibility would be confined to matters which are fully communitarised, such as the internal market which lies in Pillar 1, as well as to those questions, for example judicial and police co-operation, which lie in Pillar 3.  As regards Pillar 1, and largely at Irish insistence, the Commission's sole right of initiative is fully preserved in relation to any use of flexibility.</P>
    <P>I have highlighted the main features of the Treaty of Amsterdam with a view to illustrating its significance for Ireland and for the citizens of Europe more generally.  It will be evident from my remarks that the Treaty of Amsterdam builds upon the achievements of earlier treaties and adds new strength in areas of most relevance to people's daily lives.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the role of the previous Government in concluding the treaty and in successfully <Col N="1105" /> protecting and advancing Ireland's interests during the course of its negotiation.  The immense work done by Deputy Gay Mitchell and the leadership given by Deputy Spring as Minister for Foreign Affairs is deeply appreciated and has enhanced Ireland's name among the nations of the world.</P>
    <P>I hope that the vast majority of Members will join the Government in next year's referendum in seeking support for the treaty as a further milestone in the development of Europe.  There is a large programme of work ahead in the European context which will be facilitated by the Treaty of Amsterdam.  It will be important that we in Ireland continue to demonstrate clearly and unambiguously our support for a strong and effective European Union.</P>
    <P>Let me pay tribute to my predecessor in office, Mr. Ray Burke.  He gave immense leadership in Opposition and in Government on the peace process and in other areas.  I wish him happiness and peace, and extend that wish to his family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give ten minutes of my time to Deputy Bernard Durkan.</P>
      <P>First, I wish the Minister well in his new appointment.  He has been in the Department of Foreign Affairs before, so it is not new to him, but he has my best wishes as he starts out in a Department where we will have to face very difficult tasks in terms of Europe, Northern Ireland and elsewhere throughout the world.  I promise to be as constructive as I can in prosecuting the case on behalf of the Fine Gael part of the Opposition. I thank him for his kind words about my contribution to the Amsterdam Treaty and the Reflection Group.  I also join him in wishing Ray Burke well and thank him for the courtesy he extended to me during his period as Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I would like what I say this morning to be read in the context of what I said in a similar debate here on 10 July.  I will not go over that ground again.  However, I will make a few points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people who said when we joined the European Union, called the European Economic Community at the time, who said when we signed the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty, and who say again now that this is an attack on Irish neutrality.  It is nothing of the kind.  It is time we had a debate on Irish neutrality to establish the principles on which Irish neutrality is based so that we all understand them and they cannot be departed from surreptitiously. This is not something on which we have had a healthy debate.  There is something wrong, something anti-intellectual about it when we cannot debate issues and understand the principles on which they are based.  It is time we stopped the nonsense of pretending that it is not in our interest to join Partnership for Peace, and pretending that somehow we have something in common with Tajikistan, that we are somehow put in a more compromising position than Russia which has joined the Partnership for Peace, than the <Col N="1106" /> Baltic countries, than the countries in the Balkans and the neutral countries, including Switzerland, Austria and Finland.  It is time we got ourselves off this petard on which we have been hoist.  Let us stop saying, as we were saying in the White Paper, that we will examine the possibility of joining Partnership for Peace and open negotiations to join.</P>
    <P>I attended a conference in recent days which was attended by people from Latvia, Finland, Austria and other countries talking about their relationship in the Partnership for Peace which is a bilateral agreement tailored to the needs of the participating countries.  I was particularly struck by what a Norwegian delegate said.  Norway is a member of NATO albeit a member that does not have nuclear missiles located on its soil, and it is next door to Sweden, a neutral country.  Both have joined Partnership for Peace, and the Norwegian speaker made it clear that it has worked well for both countries.  Discussions are taking place in Northern Ireland about future relations between North and South, east and west and internally. Britain has been a member of NATO since l949. Ireland is not a member.  We should look at the relationship that has developed between Norway and Sweden and, in terms of North-South and east-west relations, consider membership of Partnership for Peace as a means of bringing us closer together in security co-operation without affecting Irish neutrality.  It would be beneficial if, as part of the Partnership for Peace agreement, priority was given to co-operation on the interdiction of the importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>It is time this matter was put on the agenda. We should open negotiations on Irish membership of Partnership for Peace.  This would allow us to ensure our armed forces will be up to date on best peacekeeping methods and use our great experience in peacekeeping to the benefit of others.  It is time this issue was dealt with, we are being far too sanctimonious about it.</P>
    <P>On the drugs issue generally, I welcome the developments in Europol.  I heard one MEP say this would involve us in police activity which would be detrimental to the security and safety of law-abiding citizens.  That is nonsense.  Criminals are operating internationally.  The Garda Síochána and police forces throughout Europe should co-operate with each other to deal with these problems.  Everybody knows where I stand on the issue of law and order.  I do not care what the surnames or pet names of criminals are or where they are located.  Out of a sense of public duty and as a father of four young children I want all these crooks behind bars.  I strongly support the inclusion of a reference to co-operation between police forces throughout Europe in the treaty.  Without breaking confidences, I pushed hardest for this at the Reflection Group, the Intergovernmental Conference, the co-ordinating committee which I chaired and at ministerial meetings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> The Reflection Group stated &mdash; this was accepted by the Intergovernmental Conference&mdash; that the Maastricht Treaty criteria on economic and monetary union should not be revisited. In the first half of the century two world wars started in Europe.  In the second half what is now the European Union has helped to bring about prosperity through peace and stability.  Approximately 190 million people, including 60 million Europeans, have lost their lives so far this century in world conflicts.  With the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community, ECSC, in l951 the first steps were taken towards European integration.  In integration different and differing traditions agree to coexist and co-operate in an atmosphere of mutual respect.  Compare this with assimilation where one, usually the strongest tradition or culture, absorbs the rest.</P>
    <P>The European Union has evolved from the ECSC which now has 15 member states.  It may double in size in the next 20 years.  Having created a single market of 370 million people, a market which will increase to almost 500 million people in time, why should the cost of currency exchange between member states or uncertainty about future exchange risk not be removed?  To argue against the single currency in a Europe which is integrating is like suggesting Texas should have a different currency to Connecticut. Some say nobody has given a good explanation as to how currency unification would create jobs. It will assist in doing so by providing economic benefits such as the removal of exchange rate uncertainty and costs in trade, investment and tourism &mdash; the estimated transaction and hedging costs to business in the European Union amounts to more than US$16 billion per annum and I have reason to believe this is a conservative estimate; converging interest rates among participating member states, and deepening and enhancing the EU single market.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union, EMU, is being accompanied by a stability pact to ensure continued budgetary discipline within participating states and an exchange rate mechanism, ERM II, for EU states outside EMU.  This removes for those within EMU and restricts for those within ERM II the capacity for competitive devaluation. Why should a member state which has full access to the market of another have this competitive edge?  The alternatives to EMU are not cost free. The so-called safety valve of devaluation may have employment consequences if removed but so would a disintegrating Europe which would almost certainly follow the abandonment of the EMU project.  Devaluation is only a short-term solution to underlying problems of competitiveness which in the long term must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Integration is primarily about building a stable and peaceful Europe so that prosperity, including employment, can thrive.  It is also about ensuring an integrated Europe can organise to play an effective role in an increasingly regionalised <Col N="1108" /> world.  Like all business decisions, it is a question of calculated risk.  Given the clamour to join the European Union and the desire to meet the EMU qualification criteria by a majority of existing member states it is clear that most European leaders have made their calculations.  Politicians are businessmen, their business is politics.  Economists should and must be free to comment, criticise and advise but business decisions are best taken by those who know the business at hand.</P>
    <P>Membership of the European Union has helped modernise Ireland into one of the most vibrant economies in Europe.  This is an example the poorest central and eastern European states can follow.  What is happening in Europe is exciting.  An integrated continent from the west coast of Ireland to the Black Sea is emerging through a peaceful process.  This takes time, we do not have a blank page on which to write a new constitution.  Eurocrats and Eurospeak are part of the process but this is a small price to pay.  We need to see the wood as well as the trees.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Treaty dealing with non-discrimination which the Minister mentioned.  Before departing from the subject of economic and monetary union, I have to say I find it extraordinary to observe hard, left wing socialists or whatever they may call themselves in the same camp as the money traders who want to break EMU.  They should ask themselves why they are in that camp.</P>
    <P>The rainbow Coalition negotiated and signed the draft treaty and the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ray Burke, signed the final treaty earlier this month.  We in Fine Gael will strongly support its ratification and implementation.  In respect of ratification there appears to be a sense in the media that balance requires that the approximate 90 per cent of Members of this House in favour must have their arguments balanced by the 10 per cent against it in every case.</P>
    <P>I would like to put the case for a re-examination of the court decision in the McKenna case. Since the court decided that the State has to put both arguments is it not then incumbent on those with a public service tradition to ensure that the approximate 90 per cent support of this treaty gets its due weight, that the people hear those arguments, so that not every outrageous comment made receives equal attention.</P>
    <P>Great challenges face us as we prepare for enlargement of the European Union.  The Treaty of Amsterdam constitutes but one step in that preparation for further integration.  Enlargement brings with it great opportunities, above all that for peace and stability to continue on this Continent, which did not happen in the first half of this century.  Without that peace and stability we shall not have the prospect of prosperity and the great prosperity now being enjoyed within western Europe will be thrown away.  The further integration of Europe, including the 11 applicant states and in time others, is as much in our interest as in theirs.  It is not merely a question of being good neighbours or of being altruistic.  Our <Col N="1109" /> own selfish interests are served by further integration.  We do not want our children or grandchildren in the forthcoming century to become statistics, part of another 60 million Europeans who kill each other because of narrow concepts of nationalism.  We want them to be integrated, to survive and prosper.  For all its shortcomings, the Treaty of Amsterdam, coupled with economic and monetary union, constitutes a most important step along that road to further integration.</P>
    <P>I strongly support its ratification and will be shoulder to shoulder with the Minister for Foreign Affairs when it comes up for ratification.  I am delighted to have had this opportunity of contributing but it is a pity that serious debates of this kind, when the House is doing its duty, do not receive the coverage they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gay Mitchell for affording me the opportunity to contribute to this important debate, to welcome the Treaty of Amsterdam and the discussions which must take place between now and the holding of the referendum.  It would be my hope that it will be an informed, rational, well argued debate, important from the point of view of the European Union itself, our citizens and this House, the national Parliament of a member state with a major contribution to make not only in respect of our citizens but to the overall concept of an integrated and enlarged Europe.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will ensure that, in the course of this debate, the information made available is as broad, well founded and as clear as possible because there is nothing as damaging to any debate, on one side or the other, as misinformation or badly founded information.</P>
      <P>This debate is a continuation of tradition whereby the Government makes available to Members an updated progress report on Intergovernmental Conferences, particularly whenever milestones such as this one are reached. I suggest that the forthcoming referendum be held as early as possible in the new year but following reasonable debate, allowing adequate discussion without becoming bogged down in extraneous issues that may arise in the interim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also need to recognise and appreciate the importance of Europe so far as our citizens are concerned.  The much vaunted Celtic Tiger did not happen accidentally or overnight but rather as a consequence of the important bearing Europe has had on our economy over past years. While we at present enjoy prosperity and are the envy of many of our European colleagues, it must be remembered we went through a considerable valley period.  Within the forthcoming debate on enlargement, relating to the spending of Cohesion and Regional Funds in the future, we should not allow ourselves to be second-guessed or down-graded in the manner in which those future funds are likely to be expended on the basis that we have achieved the ultimate and no longer need such funds.  We must emphasise to our European colleagues that we had to make <Col N="1110" /> considerable sacrifices when in that long, dark valley.</P>
    <P>We have a huge contribution to make to Europe in the future.  Our influence as a small nation is vital, along with all the other small nations who are constituent bodies of the European Union and others likely to join.  Since we hear a certain amount of fear expressed here and in other member states of the European Union on enlargement, it is no harm to reflect momentarily on the subject.  I have always believed that the enlargement of the Union would prove ultimately to be to the benefit of the concept of Europe and all its peoples.  If we reflect on the reasons for the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic Community and the basic thinking behind their establishment &mdash; the elimination of war and strife among the European peoples &mdash; we must also accept that, in order to spread the benefit and develop that concept further, we must welcome the inevitable enlargement of the Union, decide how best we can contribute and how best those additional member states are likely to contribute.</P>
    <P>Any increase in membership carries a corresponding increase in population, coupled with social and economic possibilities.  We may have to make some small sacrifices for that enlargement but should not allow ourselves go overboard, bearing in mind what I have said about the sacrifices we made over very many years.</P>
    <P>With the increased market prospects that enlargement of the European Community currently presents to us, given the standard of our education and our ability to penetrate world markets, we must also acknowledge that it opens up a whole new vista for us.  Far from there being greater threats to our economy, it will open up new opportunities so that our entrepreneurs, Government and economy overall will benefit.  It is important that we seize those opportunities, that we are not reticent, that we continue the trend begun in the past few years and become totally immersed, integrated and committed.</P>
    <P>I might deal now with the single currency, the euro.  Over the next year in particular, there will be the obvious vested interests moving on one side or the other of that argument.  I am in favour of the introduction of the single currency and the operation of the euro as soon as possible.  Nothing should be allowed to happen which would cause the postponement of the implementation date. Any attempt to postpone that date would put a question mark over the whole concept, and that would be a disaster.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the enormous benefit likely to accrue to the business community here and in every other member state as a result of the penalties imposed by virtue of the interchanging of moneys at airports and ports, between businesses and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the exchange rates.  The removal of impediments to the transaction of business, which in turn will reduce the overheads of the respective businesses, will be enormously beneficial to us in particular as we depend largely on our ever expanding export market.</P>
      <P>Rumblings were heard in the not too distant past that the implementation date should be reconsidered or postponed or that changes should be made to the manner in which the start up system is implemented.  I must emphasise the danger of any such proposal.  Once an indication is given in any quarter of a wavering in the intentions of member state Governments there will be an automatic reaction which may jeopardise the implementation of the single currency.</P>
      <P>Postponement of the implementation date by a year may result in a postponement for five years which in turn may have serious implications for the whole Union.  That is not to say we should not have an informed debate on all the possible implications and obstacles.  The lesson learned from the debate on the Maastricht Treaty was that we were a little complacent in the run up to that referendum with the result that there was a reaction from some members of the general public.  Members of this House, and some people outside it, were subject to some criticism that sufficient information was not made available to the wider public.  It must be said that some of the information made available to those opposing the referendum was not entirely well founded and caused serious questions to be raised.  Regardless of the information we make available in an attempt to enhance the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty, or future treaties, it is essential that such information is well founded.  We must ensure that the dissemination of misinformation by somebody does not jeopardise what we are trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>Europe has not reached its full strength.  If it continues at its present rate of progression over the next 20 years, and provided it takes sufficient stock of the need to encompass within itself the needs of all its peoples, Europe will become the most powerful economic and political entity in the world.  It recognised that possibility a little late in the day but we are now on the right course. I compliment the Minister for making this information available to the House.  I wish him well in his ministry as I did his predecessor and the previous Government in this regard.</P>

      <P>I join you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in welcoming our colleagues from Sweden, as I am sure does every Member of the House.  I take this opportunity of congratulating my colleague, Deputy David Andrews, on his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I wish him well in his ministry, which he occupied previously, and I know he will bring to it the breadth of vision and compassion I know him to have exercised in the human rights area in the past.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased to have an opportunity of speaking on a matter of foreign policy because it has been so many years since I did so.  I intend, therefore, to use this freedom which has been conferred upon me and which will inevitably be informed by my experience as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I want to develop a few themes which I spoke about two weeks ago in Stockholm at a conference on the report of the Council of Europe, <i>In From The Margins</i>, which points indirectly to a fundamental missing component of the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
      <P>One does not have to be against European integration to be in a position to set the Amsterdam Treaty in context.  The Amsterdam Treaty generated a set of expectations as it was coming at a certain moment in the historic evolution of Europe.  In matters of foreign policy, context is as important as form and style to diplomacy.  That context is interesting, and while there is no need for me to repeat what the Minister and Deputies Mitchell and Durkan said in their contributions, expectations were upset in two respects on which people could express some disappointment.</P>
      <P>First, the more enthusiastic interpreters envisaging the new treaty thought it would make far more gains in relation to redressing the gap between citizenship, the reaction of citizens, and the Union.  Second, the approach is wrong.  There is an assumption that a Europe of consumers can translate itself into a Europe of citizens, and that what one creates first is a liberal economic space that can later be converted into a space of citizenship.  Unfortunately for those who hold such a view, it is both modern and not particularly well informed.  Historically it has never happened. What has happened is that all forward movements of integration have been built on strong theories of citizenship with economics being regarded as a source of instrument for the achievement and enhancement of that citizenship.  Depending on the point at which one starts, the language inevitably will be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give another example.  Commentators today speak of letting other countries in, but the people in some of the countries I visited speak of joining.  Joining is different from being let in. Joining creates issues of respecting diversity, including cultural diversity.  That brings us to one <Col N="1113" /> of the points where this treaty, the tenth in the current European drive, can be properly put in context.</P>
    <P>There is no reference to culture in the founding treaties of the European Union and there are many reasons for this.  Europe was too close to war and it had seen culture used as an informing principle of intolerant and appalling attitudes which in turn generated the most devastating effects on people in the name of a narrow version of culture.  Europe saw culture, as it drew in on itself in an insular sense, as being very close to that part of the spirit of a nation which could not be negotiated.  Hence, it was usually linked with education and later became part of subsidiarity, two untouchable areas.</P>
    <P>Another was the excuse given on the foundation of the Council of Europe in the 1940s that Europe would deal with culture.  One of the great disappointments is that when the larger family of nations, the Council of Europe, has discussed matters of culture, diversity, tolerance and so forth it has largely left the European Union's evolution untouched.  The relations between the European Union and the Council of Europe in the sphere of culture are scandalously sparse.</P>
    <P>There are also other reasons for this which are interesting.  One is that the version of humanity in which we lived did not regard the cultural experience and creativity as central to being European.  When the treaty was being discussed at Amsterdam Europe became dislodged on its philosophy and assumptions.  It is trite to say that the European Union was started because of the experience of two world wars.  The human rights movement was mainly based on the low point to which humanity had sunk in Dachau and Auschwitz, events we should never forget.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that the construction of &ldquo;homo Europeanus&rdquo; as &ldquo;homo economicus&rdquo; had led to the payment of an enormous price.  I regret that we do not have a ministry dealing with cultural matters only.  The Government decided to give responsibility for cultural matters to the Minister for Arts, Culture, Gaeltacht and the Islands and anything else one can think of on a fine day.  It took this decision at a time when it was decided to call the British heritage secretary the Secretary for Culture.</P>
    <P>This important omission in the Amsterdam Treaty is very revelatory in terms of the missing connections between the Union and its institutions.  It also raises another issue to which the Minister referred in his fine speech in which he accurately and thoughtfully summarised the treaty for us, that a Europe of consumers will have different attitudes to security than a Europe of citizens.  The issue of security for citizens, whether they are employed or unemployed poor or rich, usually derives from a theory of human rights and such constitutional certitude as is put in place as different states evolve.  On the other hand, a view of security derived from a theory of sovereign consumership is about the safety of property.  Common to this are issues such as the <Col N="1114" /> rights of children etc.  I will not indulge in nonsense and say that one will be threatened by the greater co-operation in dealing with the drugs menace.  Of course this is an area in which there should be co-operation if we want to eliminate this awful blight which affects so many people in Europe.</P>
    <P>The 18 million unemployed people in Europe will not see hope in the present relationship between economic issues and issues of culture and citizenship.  I do not want to bore the House but I want to give an example of this.  I thank the Minister for acknowledging the preparatory work carried out by Deputy Spring and join in paying tribute to the officials for their work.  The public gallery is not packed with people interested in which dimension of Europe we are discussing. Neither are they marching outside the gate with placards.  We have a reflective view of Europe &mdash;we are not madly interested but we are anxious to take as much as we can at times.  However, it is wrong to portray us like this at seminars as some people keep stressing our contribution before the European Union was heard of.  We were European before many other countries in the sense that we had a relationship with other countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>In addition to the democratic deficit in Europe in an institutional sense there is also a philosophical deficit.  The thinking which existed at the end of the last World War which gave a great impetus certainly does not exist now.  When the President of the Czech Republic visited the European Parliament he said he had come as an enthusiast but when he looked at the institutional operation he felt he was looking into a machine and could not discern the heart of Europe.  If one speaks of Europe in terms of its citizenship one could be criticised for being weak on economics.</P>
    <P>In addition to the philosophical deficit the economic model is seriously flawed because it is out of context.  The only function of any instrument of economic integration is to serve a wider social purpose to which the 18 million unemployed people in Europe stand as an empirical contradiction.  In his July speech the then Minister said we had come out of the Amsterdam process fairly well, the Commission was still strong and we had benefited from that.  He also said that the Council of Ministers was very strong and there were appropriate strengthenings of the European Parliament.  When that language is decoded the game is given away &mdash; it is that the last place European enthusiasts want to place their trust is the European Parliament.  Thus, if one examines the treaty one will see that the enhanced powers of the Parliament are provided for in an annex.</P>
    <P>I am making the case for a better and more generous Europe.  The philosophical deficit has led to the neglect of culture.  I stress that cultural diversity is very important as a feature of appropriate discussion on enlargement.  It is not a matter of whether countries should be let in, it is a matter of who joins.  The neglect of this dimension <Col N="1115" /> has led to net losses in terms of how economy and social space are used.</P>
    <P>Lest people think I have lost the run of myself, it is important to point out that the cultural industries here employ approximately the same number as the banking sector.  This is a comparison which usually sticks with people.  The cultural industries employ 33,800 people, have a value of approximately £441 million per year and earn 88 per cent of their income by way of direct trading activity, with only 12 per cent coming from grants. They employ slightly more women than men, 54 per cent to 46 per cent, and seven out of ten jobs are full time.  These statistics were published in the Coopers &amp; Lybrand report published some years ago.</P>
    <P>Millions of jobs can be created in the cultural area of Europe if we recognise the wonderful component of creativity which lies in our citizens. At my first meetings of cultural Ministers the view was expressed that when economic growth returned to Europe we could consider projects such as those put forward by Jack Lange, the former French Minister for Culture, and others, that culture would be a residuum of economic recovery.  One of the points I advanced was that the cultural space is wider than the economic space, and it is at times of unemployment and poverty that an active cultural space is needed to head off racism and anti-immigrant feeling.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is good to mention this matter calmly here when people will take it in the spirit in which I want it understood.  I have always had a reservation about images such as the Celtic Tiger.  I have never understood the idea of putting forward the image of an animal with claws.  It is not a very helpful image and for that reason I do not use it.  We have a good economy with high growth, low inflation and low interest rates, but our experience of that is blemished by attitudes expressed towards those coming to Ireland, immigrants and others.  In recent weeks and months I received some of the most appalling racist correspondence from people who direct their hatred against those who are black or Asian, people working in Dublin and other parts of the country. Given the way in which we sometimes speak of our diaspora 150 years after the famine, it is difficult to understand the unacceptable attitudes to those who come to Ireland.</P>
    <P>We should ponder long and hard on what that tells us about ourselves at the end of this century. We began this century unfree.  We established our own State.  In the middle of the century tens of thousands of people left the country every year &mdash;55,000 left in 1955.  When I was young I worked in England for the summer and cards were to be seen in windows stating that Irish people could not stay.</P>
    <P>We are morally tested by our attitude to the way we share our prosperity and distribute it internally.  As we make finance arrangements, I cannot see the case for an indiscriminate reduction of tax when the fruits of growth are so <Col N="1116" /> desperately needed in health, housing, education, remedial work and so on.  It is time we spoke clearly about that.  We must share the fruits of our growth with those from abroad.  I am not saying we should throw the gates open, but some of the attitudes to people coming here are unacceptable. I have referred to the Minister for Justice correspondence relating to racism against the Asian community in Dublin.</P>
    <P>My comments so far are by way of context in dealing with the Amsterdam Treaty, a great achievement in difficult circumstances.  I do not agree with those who suggest a change in political direction has wrecked the prospects of a more complete treaty.  Only a person with a completely historical view would suggest Maastricht was not influenced by the ideological complexion of the time it was framed.  At that time Europe had moved to the right whereas at the time of the Amsterdam Treaty, Europe had pulled itself back from the right to the centre or possibly the left. It is reasonable to expect that would be reflected in the Treaty.  It is important to bear in mind that what has been represented by way of iron laws through monetary union and the single currency must be put back in political context into a social Europe, a Europe of citizens, and account must be taken of the cultural space that is Europe.</P>
    <P>I could spend a great deal of time dealing with interpretations of the treaty as it refers, for example, to fish or benefits that will accrue from enlargement.  Enlargement is the second dimension by which people hope for greater benefits. Given our historical experience of poverty and emigration as well as recovery and shrewd management in the modern period by Governments of different composition, we must be very careful about the way we treat applicant and aspirant countries.  I recall informal meetings during my time as Minister, conducted under presidencies other than the Irish Presidency, where it was evident that other countries had become like us.  I regarded the attitudes of some European colleagues as almost offensive in that at best they were patronising.  At informal Ministers' meetings, countries on the periphery suggested they had become very much like Ireland in issuing hundreds of radio licences and dozens of television licences to companies that usually collapsed within a year or two.  They indicated they were adjusting themselves to become like us.  At the same time many of the cultural institutions about which I spoke, ballet, theatre and drama, were collapsing as they were privatised and agents took over from the State.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty is about Europeans, and Europeans are entitled to ask what being European means and what it means to share and accept a common citizenship, which is a bigger agenda and requires a different moral vision than being similar consumers.  For example, we could unite on issues such as public service broadcasting.  That matter was discussed under the World Trade Agreement and the debate continued within the European Union as to the Union's attitude <Col N="1117" /> towards a product from the United States. The French supported the view that we should not be dominated.  The issue was not to exclude anything but that all the audio visual product should not come from the one source.  We could agree on that, but it is much more difficult to take on the bigger agenda of what we as citizens should think.</P>
    <P>The next stage of development which will include enlargement will have to engage the issues I mentioned in a more overt way.  Having begun with an admirable impetus to peace in place of war, the evolution before and throughout Maastricht has been one of incremental accretion of economic co-operation in an economic space. Various Governments have found it incredibly difficult to turn to their citizens and tell them what has been happening.  They have fought back by telling people they are very lucky to be &ldquo;in&rdquo;. The tacit evolution of economic co-operation has been a substitute for debate on principles of political and cultural co-operation that could create the correct atmosphere for the citizenry.  That is why people spoke in the Intergovernmental Conference of a necessary component in the agenda of improving citizenship, although I am at a loss to say how citizenship can be enhanced with such a comprehensive neglect of culture.  I accept the views expressed about those who suggest that the unemployment problem can be solved as a consequence of monetary union.  I do not think the evidence supports that.  It is why I welcome Commissioner Flynn's proposals on promoting the employment agenda, often against the opinions of national governments.</P>
    <P>Subsidiarity has also been one of the biggest blocks in discussing the issues of culture which I raised.</P>
    <P>If flexible labour markets are a recipe for low wages and the suspension of protection for workers I hope it will be exposed for what it is. The Europe of which we speak which is creating prosperity and makes the joint experience possible, is not worth very much if it means rolling back the protections introduced in the 1970s, even when the former President Hillery was Commissioner for Social Affairs and when Michael O'Leary was Minister for Labour.  It would be retrograde to regard the obdurate presence of 18 million unemployed as somehow explainable in terms of the characteristics of those people.  It is not that the 18 million people have failed, rather that the European economy is failing them.  That is the correct emphasis and one which must be stressed.</P>
    <P>The next years will be crucial.  I welcome acceptance of the obligations of the Geneva Convention.  However, it is time to clarify any confusion concerning our compliance with such measures in a manner acceptable to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and to the international agencies aimed at welfare.  It would not be a great statement if it were said we had looked after the free movement of commodities and capital but had made everything about <Col N="1118" /> the free movement of people, particularly when they lacked assets, extraordinarily difficult.  I mention these to be positive and constructive in a debate which I hope will encompass the full gamut of all that needs to be discussed between now and the referendum.</P>

      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty is yet another milestone in the history of co-operation between European nations which has occurred in the past 46 years.  It is easy in the context of rapid development to forget the progress made by such nations since the end of the Second World War. The lessons of bridge building and friendship forging which have occurred in Europe ought not to be lost on us as we embark on negotiations with a view to creating a peaceful and agreed Ireland.  Europe has come a long way in the past 50 years.  It has developed economically, socially and politically in a fashion which few envisaged. It is a tribute to the vision and determination of a small body of men who strove to make their dream of a peaceful Europe a reality.  Achieving that reality required negotiation and determination.  The extent of the negotiation can be eclipsed by the scale of European economic success.</P>
      <P>It has taken nine treaties to bring Europe to where it is today.  The Treaty of Paris in 1951 established the European Coal and Steel Community.  Its six states formed the nucleus upon which the Treaty of Rome of 1957, establishing the European Economic Community, was based. The Euratom Treaty, also signed in Rome the same year, established the single council and single commission of the European Community.  The merger treaty of 1965, the Luxembourg Treaty of 1970, the treaty which amended the financing provisions of the community and the merger treaty of 1975 all modified the structures and financing of the European Community.  The Maastricht Treaty, which came into force in November 1993, established the European Union and laid the foundations for co-operation on justice and home affairs.  The Amsterdam Treaty has built on those foundations.</P>
      <P>As one who, in the 1980s, worked in the European Parliament and spent my time at international youth work, for which I was awarded the Robert Schuman silver medal for services to the European Union, I welcome and recognise the progress and development which has brought us to the Europe we have today.  The Amsterdam Treaty provides the necessary structures for increased co-operation between members states of the European Union on a variety of fronts.  It is a recognition that the problems which confront Ireland are problems which increasingly have an international dimension and require an international effort to arrive at a solution.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the field of organised crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the past decade Ireland has been transformed from a country where crime was local and disorganised into a country where crime, to a disquieting <Col N="1119" /> degree, is organised on a professional basis.  This transformation is the result of the profitable nature of illicit drugs sales in this jurisdiction.  We have witnessed socially disadvantaged areas being flooded with cheap addictive drugs by unscrupulous pushers who foster addiction in vulnerable young people to create a market to make profits and provide a luxurious lifestyle for themselves and their associates.  The priority of every democratic society must be to separate the pushers from their liberty and their profits.  The message must go out clearly that any person who deals in drugs will go to jail and his assets will be confiscated.  We must wage a remorseless campaign until drug dealing is inextricably associated in the public eye with incarceration and penury.  That campaign must be both international and domestic.</P>
    <P>In recent years, it was considered in some quarters that domestic governments were individually powerless to deal with drug dealers.  It was believed that pushers not found in possession of drugs were untouchable in so far as criminal law was concerned.  We have shown in the past 15 months that some effective action can be taken on the domestic front.  The passing of the Proceeds of Crime Act in July 1996 is an example of what can occur when society resolves to act rather than prevaricate.  It is possible in respect of any area of human endeavour to find reasons for inaction.  Leadership requires action and a calculation of consequences.  This House showed leadership in July 1996 when it accepted the Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy O'Donoghue now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  That leadership has led to the devastation of drug empires.  Fifteen months ago it was unthinkable that criminals whose notoriety had led them to become household names would become international fugitives as a result of concerted Garda action, yet that is what has occurred.  Within the past year the Garda, utilising the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act have stripped drug dealers of their illicit profits. Property, houses, cars and money have been seized and confiscated.  That action will continue as long as a single criminal remains in possession of wealth derived from his criminal endeavours. That is a worthwhile objective but is not enough on its own.  Society is entitled not alone to seize illicit assets but to demand that those who have broken the law, fostered addiction, ended and ruined young lives pay for their crimes.</P>
    <P>Two years ago phrases such as &ldquo;witness protection programme&rdquo; were exclusively associated with America and Hollywood productions.  Today such a programme is a reality in Ireland.  I welcome this reality and every citizen should do likewise.  It is a further example of the people's Government acting on their behalf.  It facilitates the hands of the law on the shoulders of the untouchables.</P>
    <P>We have demonstrated that domestic action can be swift and effective.  However, the problem <Col N="1120" /> will continue for as long as it remains internationally feasible and profitable.  It is for this reason that the crime co-operation provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty are to be welcomed.  In particular, the more formal establishment of Europol should result in a transfer of information and intelligence among European police forces to the detriment of transnational criminals.  The establishment of domestic committees will give Europol a tangible existence which should lead to rapid further development towards the much needed European police force.</P>
    <P>The concept of Europol is about sending information across national borders in order to frustrate criminals who operate across borders.  It is a measure capable of dealing a devastating blow to organised crime.  It is incumbent on each Government to provide the necessary resources and skilled personnel to ensure that the initiative is a success.</P>
    <P>Europol must be successful and be seen to be successful.  It should have a firm, identifiable presence in a major port of entry.  Dun Laoghaire is such a port.  It is a gateway for tens of thousands of visitors to Ireland.  Some 1.7 million passengers pass through it each year.  Many arrive in cars and it is one of the ports used by drug traffickers.  The physical presence in Dun Laoghaire of the Irish wing of Europol would be a strong signal of our determination to eradicate the evil of drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>The European Union will soon grow to include 25 or more member states.  Ireland need have few fears about such a development.  We have shown an ability to compete in a single market.  Our education, skills, capacity and productivity equip us well for the future of Europe.  Within our lifetime the EU will stretch from Ireland to the Black Sea, from Finland to Malta.  It will be a vast and stable continent which, if properly managed economically, will guarantee peace and prosperity.  It will also enable Europe to play a major role in ensuring global development and prosperity.  Europe ought not to be insular and exclusive or adopt a &lsquo;them and us&rsquo; attitude.  We owe a duty to our neighbours in Africa and Asia to see that technological developments are shared with them.</P>
    <P>The spectre of a bloated Europe and a starving Third World is one which we must avoid.  Europe will only be successful if it uses its resources to assist other continents.  Hunger, famine and drought are all afflictions capable of being assisted.  Europe has a duty to assist those less fortunate.  I hope the external social dimension will be highlighted in future European treaties.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo ar siúl inniu mar is ceist antábhachtach <Col N="1121" /> é an Treaty seo.  Ba chóir go mbeadh díospóireacht níos doimhne againn seachas ráitis mar atá ar siúl againn.  Ba chóir an Treaty a chur os comhair Coiste den Teach agus é a chur os comhair ná Dála roimh an reifreann chun go mbéadh díospoíreacht againn ar na ceisteanna bunúsacha ann.</P>
      <P>One of the issues which needs to be addressed is the chaotic manner in which the treaty amendments are negotiated.  The clear lesson to be learned from Amsterdam is that the current method for revising the treaties is entirely inappropriate.  As Maastricht and Amsterdam have shown, a more democratic and constructive system must be put in place to process the next revision which may be required before the end of this decade.</P>
      <P>The failure to develop a meaningful social dimension to balance the neo-liberal character of EMU was the biggest single failure of Maastricht. In the lead up to Maastricht this was the issue which most occupied the minds of those for whom European integration represented an opportunity rather than a threat.  The story of Amsterdam is a series of mildly significant incremental advances but no real feeling that effective instruments have been provided to ensure real, visible and lasting change.</P>
      <P>However, I welcome the inclusion of the &lsquo;promotion of a high level of employment and social protection&rsquo; among the specific objectives and tasks of the EU.  I also welcome the recognition of the parallelism between employment policies and the community's economic guidelines and the insertion of a new chapter on employment which is entirely devoted to formulating this strategy.</P>
      <P>While I welcome these items on employment as an attempt to provide a counter weight to the implementation of EMU and to respond to the aspirations of European citizens, judgment must be suspended until we see how member states and community institutions respond in practice. The practical effects must be in doubt given that the guiding principles are short on substance and specifics and, above all, extremely vague as regards details of financial programmes to give them effect.  The constant iteration that employment policy is the exclusive responsibility of member states flies against the clear wishes of European citizens who are inclined to ask what is the point of Europe if it does not take action on unemployment.  Offers of co-ordination and encouragement for pilot projects are likely to be given short shrift in such circumstances.  The incorporation of the social protocol into the treaty is a genuine advance which gives community social policy the potential for greater unity and consistency.  It also has a symbolic value in marking another shovel of clay on Thatcherism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased with the new Article 118(2) which provides the legal basis for measures to combat social exclusion.  This was an issue in which my own Department and the previous Government invested a lot of effort with <Col N="1122" /> much support from the European Commission and social, non-governmental organisations.  It is regrettable that, at the last minute, measures to help the elderly and disabled were excluded from this article.  This highlights the inadequacy of the kind of negotiating process which produces the amended treaty.</P>
    <P>The incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the treaty is an advance but much of the good is undone by the retention of unanimity and the exclusion of the European Parliament with all its implications for democratic scrutiny and transparency.  Similarly, Europol has been given operational powers without any enhancement of the limited powers of the Court of Justice and the European Parliament.  In the wider sense, it is regrettable that the necessary integration of European police and judicial activity is not going hand in hand with integration of the administration of justice, and especially the rights of those brought before a court.  The emphasis continually seems to be on providing instruments and mechanisms to take action against the potentially erring citizen with very little consideration for ensuring that his or her individual rights are protected, or that the actions of those in charge of police and judicial decisions are subject to adequate public scrutiny.  I fear the democratic deficit in the justice and home affairs areas has been reduced little if at all after Amsterdam.  The lack of transparency and the extreme complexity of the procedures are likely to increase rather than reduce public disaffection.  The concept of free movement, an area where Europe really means something especially to young people, has been described as receiving a ceremonial burial at Amsterdam.  Nonetheless, it must be admitted that the opt out be three member states from Schengen, the further five year delay following ratification of the treaty before free movement comes into force and the conditional provisions on external border checks which are simultaneously very stringent and vague make it unlikely that genuine free movement will be a reality in our lifetime.  The fireworks of 1 January 1993 were obviously somewhat premature.</P>
    <P>The most significant development for common foreign and security policy at Amsterdam was the retention of the separate pillar structure and the continuation of intergovernmental horse trading in the Council.  The continued exclusion of the Commission, Parliament and Court of Justice does not best serve the interests of smaller member states or those of us who seek an alternative to the power block approach which has dominated Europe since the Second World War.</P>
    <P>Among the changes being introduced are the establishment of a policy planning and early warning unit which will be integrated into the Council secretariat rather than the Commission as I would have preferred; the creation of the position of high representative for the CFS; the replacement of the old Troika with the current presidency, the high representative and the Commissioner for CFS and possibly the next presidency <Col N="1123" /> and a new decision making mechanism whereby common strategies will be defined by the European Council by unanimity.  The general guidelines will be implemented by the Council by common majority when adopting joint actions and common positions.  However, in the event of objections by one member state for reasons of national policy, a decision may be deferred to the European Council for agreement by unanimity.</P>
    <P>With regard to security policy, the most significant change is the inclusion of the so-called Petersberg Tasks in the treaty.  Operational capability will be provided by the Western European Union but non-WEU members will be entitled to fully participate in planning and decision making on Western European Union actions where these have been requested by an EU decision.  Such a decision must have a two thirds majority of the willing and the constructive abstainers combined. Non-participating states will not contribute financially.  This rather complicated system has been interpreted to allow for a scenario where a European force could have intervened in Bosnia after Dayton on a peacekeeping basis but could not have carried out the earlier NATO intervention because the peace enforcement option was excluded from the final treaty text.</P>
    <P>While the changes increase the potential scope and efficiency of EU decision making on foreign and security issues, it is unlikely to have more than a gradual effect, and certainly much less than many would like, on its capacity to take common decisions or embark on common actions.</P>
    <P>From an Irish perspective there is little in the new treaty which cuts across established foreign policy positions.  Contrary to what some have loudly argued, it appears the integration of the Western European Union into the EU is even further away than Maastricht envisaged and given the requirement for unanimity at European Council level, most unlikely to arise in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The notion of common defence presented as possible within the EU and the Western European Union in the future is considered in the new treaty as &ldquo;realised within a NATO framework&rdquo;, thus reinforcing the subordination of European defence to NATO.  As non-participants in the Western European Union or NATO we might be told this is none of our business.  However, I disagree as any EU or NATO action will involve or affect us at least indirectly.  In this context we should encourage a Europeanisation of defence and security within democratic and accountable structures, even if as a country we decide not to be part of it at this time.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty involved a series of small and generally beneficial technical steps forward.  Compared with expectations and the task facing it, it failed to take the decisive steps that might have convinced sceptical European citizens that their lives would improve as a consequence. Some of this failure is attributable to the revision <Col N="1124" /> procedure in operation which ensures that as time runs out the lowest common denominator is the only agreement reached.  Similar dissatisfaction with the outcome has been trenchantly expressed by both Commission President Santer and his predecessor, Mr. Delors.  A new and better system must be found to fully involve the European and national Parliaments in the next revision process.  This is a matter which the current Dáil might address with alacrity as it is likely that a new revision process will begin fairly soon due to the inadequate outcome from Amsterdam.</P>
    <P>Some advances were made on the big economic and social issues which, while individually significant, are insufficient to effectively assist those who comprise Europe's misery statistics.  The references to employment were agreed to by many states in the hope that they would merely remain as words on a page.  By setting a higher employment target as the enemy of competitiveness and doing everything possible to deprive the employment chapter of the necessary financial resources, they have sought to ensure that their hope becomes reality.  The special employment summit in Luxembourg on 20 and 21 November, a concession to French led pressure, will provide the first and probably definitive judgment on the EU's capacity to tackle the unemployment and poverty crises in the Union.  The repeated assertion that no new money, not even a budget underspend, is available to tackle the unemployment problem does not bode well.  I strongly urge that Irish Government representation at the summit insists on clear decisions being made which will take on board the concept of full employment.  I expect this call will be taken on board by the Government.</P>
    <P>The document, <i>Full Employment: a European Appeal</i>, is signed by hundreds of Members of the European Parliament, national Parliaments throughout Europe, trade unionists, representatives of local and regional government, writers, academics and Churches.  While the vast majority of the signatures from Ireland are of Democratic Left and Labour Party members, there is one significant signature, namely, Deputy Mary O'Rourke's, which bodes well for taking on board the full employment appeal by the Government and its promotion of it at the summit.  I strongly urge Deputy O'Rourke, if she is not present at the summit, to insist that the Government representatives call for the inclusion of meaningful and binding employment policies as a determining element for all fields of economic policy and that this should take priority over the pact for stability and growth; that we seek full employment as a central aim of the EU, guaranteeing a high level of equal access to dignified labour with proper conditions and remuneration for everybody without discrimination; that we seek the provision of a clear legal priority for full employment requiring the necessary adaptations in the fields of fiscal and monetary policy; that we seek the provision of a legal basis for combined and co-ordinated European actions to combat <Col N="1125" /> unemployment and that we seek a decision which binds member states to the useful and meaningful process of co-ordination of their policies in the area of employment.  I strongly urge that we refuse of accept a Europe of mass unemployment. Ireland's good growth in employment should not blind either the Opposition or the Government to the fact that we still have mass unemployment in this State and that it is one of the biggest social problems in Europe in general, leading to the massive poverty and exclusion of 50 million European citizens.</P>
    <P>Amsterdam graphically illustrated that the Community's decision making process is scarcely able to cope with 15 member states, much less a possible extension to 25 or 26.  The current situation only benefits those who want a weak and imprudent EU which can be caricatured as bumbling and indecisive.  The veto card is of little use if there are 25 others holding them.  In practice it has long been recognised that only the powerful states have a real veto.  We should support the positions adopted by the European Commission and Parliament and in the joint declaration from Belgium, France and Italy which call for strengthening of institutional structures before the conclusion of the first new membership negotiations.</P>
    <P>Just as the budgetary proposals that made up Delors II were closely linked to the Maastricht Treaty changes, it is necessary to take account of the budgetary arrangements which will complement the Amsterdam Treaty.  Regrettably, Agenda 2000 which includes the revision of the financial perspective &mdash; the Eurospeak for the budget &mdash; for the period 2000-2006 gives no grounds for optimism.  In 1992 the original Delors II budgetary proposals provided for a ceiling of 1.4 per cent of GDP of the then 12 member states by 1999.</P>
    <P>It has been argued by many that that figure &mdash;subsequently reduced at Edinburgh &mdash; was inadequate to manage the federal entity the EU was about to become.  Economic and monetary union demanded that there be a central budget with the capacity to compensate for the loss of the adjustment mechanisms which a single currency involved.  Five years later, on the eve of EMU, with EU unemployment almost 50 per cent higher than predicted, and the EU about to open negotiations with ten prospective member states, none of whom has a GDP even half the EU average, the Commission is proposing a budget ceiling of 1.27 per cent of GDP &mdash; less than Delors proposed five or six years ago.  This is crazy.  Even without enlargement the current budget could not be adequate to manage the degree of integration EMU will bring.  Inevitably a pressure point will develop somewhere in the Union after EMU where a member state will be faced with a choice between mass unemployment or re-establishing national controls to protect jobs.  That would be disastrous for the European Union.  It is extremely shortsighted of those member states who control the purse strings not to see this and recognise that what they are doing is digging the <Col N="1126" /> grave of the European Union by refusing to provide the resources necessary to ensure we can develop full cohesion in Europe.</P>
    <P>A federal budget with sufficient capacity to intervene will be required if a smooth single market and single currency area is to be preserved.  It goes beyond madness to think we can manage to incorporate ten CEECs as members as well as adjust to EMU on a central budget less than was thought adequate with half the membership ten years ago.  We cannot have enlargement on the current budgetary proposals and should say so now.</P>

      <P>I pay tribute to Deputy De Rossa on his contribution.  It is no accident that he is not only leader of his party and has led it through tremendous and tumultuous changes but also has served nobly for a period in the European Parliament where I had the privilege of knowing him as an MEP.  He has learned a great deal and is greatly interested in the European ideal and the practical implementation of that ideal through this and other parliaments.  It is important also to recognise the contribution by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  Both of them personify in some way the transformation of the left in Europe, Ireland and Britain in its attitude to the European Union.  Many years ago the left was traditionally an opposition view point, viewing European Union as a nasty form of conspiracy. The debate has gone beyond that.  In his contribution today Deputy De Rossa recognised that and made a traditional but timely appeal for a further more vigorous commitment to full employment.  I agree with his sentiments, to which I hope the Government will give some form of declaration at European level.  The whole issue of social exclusion is a practical one near to all of us as public representatives.  In our different ways we all represent constituencies that have become so urbanised &mdash; both rural and urban constituencies are included in that definition &mdash;that we encounter in our daily work as public servants, severe economic deprivation among people without education, training and opportunities. The call for full employment is not a totem pole we bow to in misplaced idealism, it is a real call and one that should be taken seriously.</P>
      <P>An economist would recognise that full employment can be achieved at an unemployment level of 2.5 per cent to 5 per cent.  In certain economies including the US in recent years, that level of employment has been achieved.  It is an attainable objective and is not some sort of Keynesian totem pole to which we should all bow ritually now and then and circumspectly run away from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins is right in saying the muddy compromise that emerged at Amsterdam was not symbolic of a new direction in the European Union.  I disagree with him to the extent that he analyses much of the lack of progress achieved at European level on a strictly left-right basis, that the Community, in simplistic terms, veered to the <Col N="1127" /> right for a number of years in its desire to create a single market and has now rebalanced and moved to the left.  Social democratic values are reasserting themselves at European level through the Community.  In some ways one can argue the European Union, as an institution with all its frameworks, is dirigiste by its nature, is almost socially democratic and underpins socially democratic values, because of its commitment to planning and to the social debate.  I agree with both speakers in the sense that the social agenda has been greatly neglected.  One cannot simply ignore the figure of 15 million unemployed.  It cannot be sustained and the only largescale economy with which the European Union could be compared is the US or the former Soviet Union which has a similar population and similar problems.  We cannot ignore them and pretend they do not exist. There is a huge impetus to try to reassert the social agenda and the social democratic values that underpin it.  It is important we push ahead and secure serious commitments at European level in respect of training and education &mdash; the key to the future of anybody seeking a job whether they live in Berlin or Dublin.</P>
    <P>An issue raised by Deputy De Rossa was that there has not been significant altering of the security implications under the Amsterdam Treaty for our country.  That is important.  It is an emotive issue in Ireland because of our relationship to defence structures of one kind.  I agree with Deputy De Rossa when he said we should encourage the establishment of European defence structures.  If one takes a serious long-term view of Europe's development one has to look at security arrangements that involve defensive structures, in which inevitably, if we believe in the goals of European political union, we will have to participate.  There tends to be a rather psychotic approach to this whole debate in Ireland.  I am pleased Deputy De Rossa is not part of that psychosis, that he is looking at it in a practical way and to the future and not at certain constituencies who tend to play on the unreasonable fears people might have about a militarisation of European life.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins spoke eloquently about the cultural space needed in Europe.  Having worked for the European Commission for a period in the 1980s I am acutely aware of new applicant members being treated in an aggressive, arrogant or patronising manner, as being somehow supplicants at the door, looking for crumbs from the European table.  We do not have a vested interest in restricting the further expansion or enlargement of the European Union.  When I worked with the European Commission I noticed the almost total arrogance which was often directed in private at the long standing Turkish application to become a member.  Rightly or wrongly, people in Turkey and elsewhere believe there were racist overtones to the rejection of their potential ability to become members of the Union.  We must reject that and encourage the greater expansion <Col N="1128" /> of the Union to include small countries that, to a large extent, share our values.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins's reference to the cultural space is important.  We are not talking about a Union that will evolve with a single or stereotypical culture such as the United States or other large transnational conglomerate nations.  We must consider the questions of culture, citizenship and the debate on the democratic deficit.  These are important, not least because of the shared sense of values that exists on the European Continent.  How to harness those values in a nonintrusive manner will be a great challenge. Deputy Higgins has championed the cause of film making and European film directives in the context of preserving our cultural inheritance and promoting the development of the European cinema, albeit from a low commercial base.  As a small island nation we sometimes appear to be under siege from productions, good and bad, from Hollywood and the consumerist culture for which America is renowned.  It is important that we build a separate cultural identity on the European Continent.  That does not necessarily mean a single European identity, but one that cherishes the plurality of cultures and traditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the swings to the left and right in Europe.  I often characterise it as swings from digestion to indigestion.  The Union is going through a period of indigestion as a result of enlargement.  Some rich members have been integrated into the Union which can cause indigestion.  It will take a long time for such a large Union to develop the institutional framework to bring about another great leap forward.  I worked in the Commission during the l980s when the l992 campaign was being launched by Jacques Delors and Lord Cockfield.  While practical moves, like the l992 Single Market campaign and the current drive to create economic and monetary union and a single currency by the year 2002, are important, the EU tends to get strung out on issues such as Euro federalism, cherishing the European ideals of Monnet.  We need practical expressions of European integration and the currency is the single most practical example of how Europe will deepen and develop.</P>
    <P>The primary task of the European Union should be to create a single currency and bring it to reality.  The single currency will be a visible sign for ordinary people that there is a reality to the Euro rhetoric, to which Deputy De Rossa referred.  We need to underpin that rhetoric with a practical example of a shared coinage.  I do not know if Deputy De Rossa is young enough to remember our old money system.  I cannot remember the denominations, but I recall vividly the introduction of the new currency.  Decimalisation and the change of coins over night was a strange event which influenced our thinking and outlook.  It certainly impacted on my mind as a small child and the introduction of the single currency will do likewise.</P>

      <P>Economists recognise that there is an inbuilt inflationary aspect to the introduction of any new currency and that it will also apply to the single currency.  We must harness economic and monetary union, introduce the currency and then concentrate on the social agenda, to which Deputies Higgins and De Rossa referred.  In that context we must develop an institutional framework within which we would play out the important mission of harnessing the economy to the needs of the people of Europe.</P>
      <P>We should postpone further enlargement and not because of any subjective or national consideration.  Some people here believe the European Union should not be enlarged because it would damage our access to European funds.  I do not concur with that view.  The principle of enlargement is worthwhile, but the practical reality of introducing ten new members would be difficult, particularly in the context of introducing a new currency which will have to be carefully patrolled by the new monetary institute and the new Central Bank for a number of years after its introduction.  We should postpone entry of new members, particularly countries such as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic whose economies must match up to a far greater level of prosperity than that which they currently enjoy.  They will experience the same difficulty as us in meeting the Maastricht criteria.  While there is a political benefit to be gained from including them, in terms of smaller nations like Ireland, the Union must address its social agenda and the type of institutions that would make decision making more efficient.</P>
      <P>The lessons of Amsterdam are not disappointing, it is a matter of practical compromise. In the political atmosphere that existed then it was not possible for the leaders to make decisions about the institutional agenda, voting power and the position of commissioners for smaller countries.  Only a few months ago the environment was hostile to great leaps forward.  Germany was encountering great difficulties in terms of indebtedness and over spending by the Lander government.  There was considerable doubt about the viability of economic and monetary union at that time.  All those doubts have been dispelled and the project appears to be on course and meeting the tight schedule it set itself.  Many other happy events have occurred for Ireland in the meantime. It is clear the British Government will participate in some form, albeit in a delayed manner, in the new currency.  Deputies De Rossa and Higgins expressed concern about the social democratic ethos of Europe.  Mr. Blair's thinking has developed along similar lines.  This is good news for Europe, Ireland and for social democracy and socialist parties throughout Europe.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt it works both ways.  There has been a remarkable transformation here and in Britain on socialist and social democratic thinking.  I would like to count myself as a social democrat, but not of the variety of the two Members opposite.</P>
      <P>The question of social security and how it impacts on our neutrality is important.  The questions of security and enlargement are better parked than dealt with now, given the importance of achieving monetary union and developing the social agenda.  I do not believe the social agenda and the call for full employment can be addressed in an environment in which the European Union is trying to transform its governmental institutions.  A great deal of consideration must go into this matter.  In politics people tend to yearn for great periods of leadership, dynamism and radical leaps forward.  Europe is moving into a period when everything will settle down and it will be slightly more inward looking.  We will be oiling rather than building a bigger machine or getting a higher performance from it.</P>
      <P>In terms of defence, security and the development of Europe it is important to keep in mind the situation in Northern Ireland.  Members on different benches should look to Europe as playing a positive part in resolving our problems on this island.  John Hume and many others inside and outside this House have made that point.  We should look to our Constitution, in terms of the way we run ourselves and govern this House, and the European context to provide the answer to the problems that exist north of our Border.  The great European ideal provides a fabulous framework and point of reference for this country to resolve its difficulties of marrying different traditions and people with major disparities in terms of their political outlooks and ambitions.  It is important that we, as a country and Parliament, demonstrate our commitment to the European ideal because the development of Europe has been the single most important development on our island in terms of bringing about the peace process we now enjoy and I hope it will provide a model and a reference point for developing it further.  I urge the Minister, Deputy Andrews, who is preoccupied with the peace process, to look at European institutions in terms of his negotiations in Stormont.  Those inclusive institutions are not perfect because of their democratic deficit, the powers enjoyed by the Parliament and other vexing issues, but we must look to them in the context of the north of Ireland. They may provide a form of Government that would be welcome in the long-term.</P>

      <P>As a committed European, I welcome the opportunity to reflect on the Amsterdam Treaty, but there are differing views on whether is it a step forward.  I will outline the reasons I believe it is a step forward, but it is interesting to note that people would say Europe and Europeans are unwell, are hurting and that we must react more quickly than we do to the major problems of the day.  That is the key point that will determine whether the Amsterdam Treaty is meaningful for the people of Europe. There has been a question in recent years about the relationship of the citizen to Europe.  That was illustrated dramatically during the course of the Maastricht Treaty when it became clear that people felt distant from many of the European institutions and did not find it easy to relate to the language, perceived secrecy or institutions of Europe.  Great changes have been made since then and the Amsterdam Treaty reflects a taking on board of the concerns expressed at the time of the Maastricht Treaty, but that is an ongoing task. The Amsterdam Treaty is another step on the road to European integration and to linking citizens' concerns.  The terms of the treaty and the areas it addresses mean that Europe will be seen as more relevant and accountable to citizens.  It is part of the journey but not the final statement. There are many areas that need to be addressed in an ongoing way.</P>
      <P>As a national Parliament, we have a strong role to play in this.  It is important that we have a European affairs committee and that we are discussing the Amsterdam Treaty but very little is known about it in this country.  As the Minister said, there is a need for much more information. We will have to be imaginative and creative in the way this is addressed in the run-up to the referendum.  There are many key issues that need to be debated openly and I would be interested to hear how the Minister intends to deal with this ongoing information deficit &mdash; an overused term&mdash; in the coming months.  There is scope for a fairly creative approach to it.  That deficit is there despite the best efforts of the previous Government and of all parties in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a gap between those who are actively involved at NGO level within Europe, whether in anti-poverty networks, the European women's lobby or in various other projects.  They have an ongoing creative, demanding and interesting relationship at European level, gain greatly from it and are very tuned in, but there is a gap between those who are actively involved at that level and the rest of the citizens.  Europe will be seen as most relevant if it tackles matters of concern to citizens, such as long-term unemployment, social exclusion, marginalisation of minority groups and the growing gap between the rich and the poor.  If the credibility of the European Union is to be sustained and developed, we must show that Europe can be effective in tackling those issues, that it has something to say about them and that there is interaction between member states in tackling them.  I have no doubt that is <Col N="1132" /> the direction we should be going, but we should not underestimate the task involved in giving real example by how those areas are addressed at European level.  It is important we do that in an ongoing way, but we should not underestimate the task involved in that.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty represented a step forward and put citizens at its heart.  For the first time the social issues of fundamental human rights and tackling exclusion became more central at European level by the way the treaty dealt with them and that is very important.  Lack of taking account of the social issues led to a gap during the campaign on ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and that was a primary reason people felt disconnected and somewhat uninvolved in the debate.  They did not feel their concerns were being taken as seriously as they should be at European level.  They felt the focus was centred too much on economic and financial aspects of the Union.  While the best way to deal with marginalisation and exclusion is to give people jobs&mdash; and economic policies are critical &mdash; we must reach the point where we give equal balance to social and economic issues.  The treaty represents a strong move in that direction.  I congratulate Members of the previous Government and the former Minister, Deputy De Rossa, who is present, for his work on this aspect of the treaty to ensure that the question of social exclusion was placed more centrally in the debate.  That is a major advance and will mean a good deal in the future in terms of citizens having more confidence in the treaties and in European integration.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention specifically the new provisions in relation to women.  They have reason to be grateful to Europe.  Many an Irish Government has been dragged kicking and screaming to develop equality provisions because of European Court decisions and European action.  Equality has always been given a great boost by the actions of the European institutions.  For the first time in the Amsterdam Treaty there is a strong antidiscrimination clause which gives the EU powers to outlaw all discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion and belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.  I welcome that as it firmly includes the concept of equal pay in its provisions.  Many women's organisations feel it does not go far enough and should deal more strongly with other areas of equality, not just those in the workplace.  This should be considered in the future.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that so much work had to be done to ensure those equality provisions were included.  There is still some concern about the final wording of the relevant provisions which was chosen by international women's NGOs.  As we enter the 21st century, it is interesting that the equality provisions only apply to the area of employment.  The area of equality has been given a boost by the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>This also applies to environmental protection. For the first time environmental protection provisions have been included and these will give <Col N="1133" /> more scope to member states.  The provisions on employment will also ensure that EU institutions have something real to say to citizens.  I hope innovative measures will be introduced and the yearly report on this area which member states must submit will ensure that tackling unemployment receives priority.</P>
    <P>On defence and neutrality, the treaty makes it more possible for us to be involved in further peacekeeping work, which has a major role to play in developing democracy and furthering human rights.  We have to think about our position on a common defence and security policy. We need a new debate on this area.  It is not good enough to stick to the old-fashioned approach which underestimates the potential of neutral countries in Europe to play a strong role.  If we are to do that, we need to create a new means of discussing our neutrality and how it can be used in the future.</P>
    <P>The Swedish position on security and defence has progressed significantly.  Sweden's sense of what security encompasses is probably the one Ireland would feel most comfortable with.  It includes issues such as the environment, democracy, human rights, the disparity between rich and poor regions, sound economic growth and progressive social welfare as well as harmony and world peace in their understanding of what constitutes security.  We could use this model in the inevitable debate on the progression of a defence and security policy.</P>
    <P>We need to move beyond the &ldquo;pulling at heartstrings&rdquo; debates we tend to have when discussing our defence and security policy and neutrality. What constitutes Irish neutrality within the EU in a modern world?  In what manner should the Government represent Irish citizens' interests in the CFSP framework and its successors?  I look forward to being part of that debate which must be seen in the context of a changed, post-cold war world where the role of armies is changing and the potential of international peacekeeping is recognised by all.</P>
    <P>As we move towards European integration, it is inevitable this debate will gain momentum.  The Amsterdam Treaty is a step towards this integration and we owe it to our citizens to develop a well-rounded debate on this topic in the future. While this issue was not dealt with in detail in this treaty, the greater support for various humanitarian and peacekeeping missions means it is on the agenda and will inevitably develop in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Socially, the Amsterdam Treaty is an important step forward and gets closer to addressing citizens' real concerns in its focus on equal rights, the environment, employment creation and its protection of emigrants.  This is all positive but we still have a great deal of work to do in showing citizens the EU is dealing with its concerns. Ireland has benefited enormously from its membership of the EU.  The Amsterdam Treaty will continue this and give us hope for a more social <Col N="1134" /> Europe which addresses the concerns of its citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Ireland is regarded as one of the best European countries as we have responded to the challenges and opportunities that membership of the EU has given us.  Europe has been good to Ireland as it has had an opportunity to lift our economy to the same level as some of the best performers in Europe.  Governments over the past 20 years have responded to these opportunities.  As we now become one of the net contributors to Europe, we should ensure we continue to remain good Europeans.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer specifically to the free movement of persons and the withdrawal of border checks.  I welcome the treaty's outlining of police co-operation in criminal matters to ensure the citizens of Europe a high level of safety.  Common action is envisaged to prevent and combat terrorism, trafficking in persons, offences against children, drug trafficking, corruption and fraud.  In a debate in the Seanad on 28 March 1990, prior to the introduction of the Maastricht Treaty, I said the removal of frontier checks within the Union would create a situation similar to that in the United States, which has a police system consisting of state forces plus an overall, nonuniformed countrywide force in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The system has given rise to dissatisfaction in the United States.  I also said that the president of the Association of Chiefs of Police stated there was no apparatus available to help the nation mobilise, co-ordinate and focus their multiple law enforcement efforts. He also said the law enforcement of the state and local areas needed a collective voice at national level.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say the European policing system is in that situation which I forecast in 1990.  The association president also urged a common front against crime, with agreed strategies and remedial measures that focus resources, efforts and expertise.  He argued that such an approach should be used to tackle the crime problem, particularly in relation to drugs.  It is widely acknowledged by police and others that the drug problem in the United States was out of control at that time.  I suggest that the drug problem in Europe is out of control.  The fragmentation of the police forces in the United States, according to the President of the Association of Chiefs of Police, has been an advantage to criminals giving them freedom to move from one state to another with local police jurisdiction ending at the state lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar system exists in Europe where states have independent police forces but do not have the advantage of an overall police organisation such as the FBI in the United States.  The creation of a uniformed European police force with authority to cross borders and arrest suspects for certain scheduled offences such as drug selling, arms trafficking and others is desirable.  I am not advocating <Col N="1135" /> a blanket police force for Europe but we must look at the cross-border movement of crime and criminal activity.  In the light of the massive scale of international criminal activity, drug trade, terrorist activity and so on, it is important that the police forces of Europe integrate in a cohesive unit which would have adequate resources to carry out detailed research into crime and formulate laws and strategies to combat it.</P>
    <P>Urgent action is required to improve co-ordination and efficiency in all law enforcement agencies throughout the EU, especially in the area of drug trafficking which operates on a multinational basis and knows no boundaries.  The war against organised criminal drug organisations will be lost unless we co-ordinate our forces.  We urgently recommend that a European community drug task force be set up, modelled on the existing task force programme in the United States.  I understand there is a semblance of this type of programme in Europe and that the Trevi group has looked at this.  Perhaps the Minister could update us on the effect of the co-ordination and policing of the drug problem in Europe.</P>
    <P>With open borders, the harmonisation of laws within the EU is an essential ingredient in the fight against criminal activity.  In the event of continuing disparities in the law, criminals, drug dealers, illicit arms traders and others will centralise operations in the country which is perceived to have the most lenient legislation in the areas of penalties, seizure of assets and so on.  We must look at harmonising policing activities and laws to ensure we tackle serious criminal activity on a European Union-wide basis.</P>

      <P>This debate on the Amsterdam Treaty presents the Oireachtas with an opportunity to initiate a national debate on Ireland's participation in the EU in general terms.  It allows the House to examine the very important provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty itself and the way in which it will impact on Ireland, the Irish people and our continued involvement in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very high level of agreement across most parties in the House in relation to our role in Europe has been one of the interesting aspects of the debate.  Such agreement has not generally been seen in the past.  I wondered what factors might have contributed to that.  One may be that various parties, not very long ago, would have had great difficulty in imagining themselves in coalition Government or in Government at all. However, such parties were in Government and looked at the European experience and the reality of the EU from that perspective.  People may have seen positive aspects to EU involvement which may not have been obvious to them previously.  At one level, that approach to Europe and the EU is welcome; at another level, however, there is a feeling that a substantial number of people have very strong reservations about involvement in the EU at various levels or, indeed, involvement in it at all.  Debate in this <Col N="1136" /> House on this and other matters is confined to a particular approach and voices in the House would generally tend to support one side of the argument, while examining various measures and differences, within an overall supportive context.</P>
    <P>This debate provides an opportunity to examine the impact of the European Union on our lives as Irish and European citizens.  It underlines a major change in approach by Irish people in general and by Members of this House in particular.  We are gradually beginning to see ourselves as players who contribute in a very positive way to Europe.  Heretofore, Irish people and successive Governments generally tended to approach Europe from the standpoint of the opportunities it presented, some of which were only monetary, and did not flatter us in the process.  We are now contributors to Europe, financially, economically and culturally and we are helping to develop a forward moving Europe.</P>
    <P>The Europol Bill was debated and passed in this House some weeks ago.  That Bill recalled a number of levels of co-operation which have existed for some time and are now being expanded on.  One of the points I made in relation to the Bill was that there was a worrying tardiness in initiating movement in various areas.  The necessity for a body such as Europol became obvious some years ago and we are now at the stage where various parliaments are enacting the required legislation.  The pace at which various criminal activities developed in this country and the Union in general has, in my view, underlined a tardiness on the part of European institutions, in co-operation with national institutions, to respond to them.  While Deputies representing urban areas were drawing attention to the gradual growth in lawlessness and the drastic worsening of the drug situation, there seems to have been a delay in responding to the issues raised. People who were small time drug dealers four, five or ten years ago have now become huge international players in crime, involved in drug trafficking and money laundering.  They are responsible for appalling abuses of people in various communities throughout this country.</P>
    <P>One of my concerns in relation to the Amsterdam Treaty is that it has not moved as quickly as it should to ensure that there is pre-planning in the areas I have referred to and in ensuring that action across the community can be initiated and brought to fruition quickly enough to respond to the various problems being faced.  There are some negative aspects associated with our involvement in Europe and there are two or three current debates which underline this.  One such debate concerns the European ban on duty free sales. That will undoubtedly impinge on Ireland more than on any of our European partners as we are an island country which depends to a huge extent on external trade.  As a small open economy we depend on having ready access to our markets in Europe and elsewhere and that can only be achieved through sea and air travel.  The cost <Col N="1137" /> factor is enormous, particularly in terms of exports and travel by individuals.</P>
    <P>Duty free sales have made a huge contribution to ensuring that fares to and from Ireland are kept at a reasonable level so that goods can be exported and people can travel at a competitive rate.  A great fight has been initiated by the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Taoiseach, but there is a need to recognise that in matters such as this we need to look at all aspects that come up for discussion and ensure that the national interest is preserved.  In this instance, whatever needs to be done will have to be done to ensure that Ireland continues to have a derogation in relation to duty free sales and that we continue to be competitive in the European market.  If that does not happen there will be an immediate loss of jobs in that area.  Those who argue against borders, tax and import duties say that the displaced jobs will show up elsewhere, but that has seldom happened in relation to any change.  In this instance it is highly unlikely.  Even if it happened we would still have the ongoing difficulty presented by the rise in the cost of access fares. That is something we simply cannot afford.  It is within the competence of our membership of the EU to be dealt with and should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>A similar problem has emerged over the past week or two whereby some of our provisions to aid job creation by grants and particularly by tax incentives also appear to be under attack.  There are countries in central Europe and in the main European economies that would benefit enormously from the removal of these incentives but we continue, no matter what we do, to be on the periphery of Europe geographically, and we continue to need to have these provisions in place to ensure that we remain competitive within the Union.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, transatlantic air services in and out of this country have been guided by bilateral agreements between this country and the United States or Canada.  There is a strong move afoot to have that taken over by the European Union. There are some advantages in doing that.  There may even be some advantages for Ireland, but in the short to medium term there are extraordinary disadvantages in terms of direct access to various parts of the country and in relation to the national airline.  Even as politically and economically strong a country as France with its huge airline, Air France, finds it necessary to seek a derogation in relation to that.  We need to look to those countries that are potential allies in that area to ensure that if the evil day must come it will be put off as long as possible to ensure that our sovereignty on that matter in particular is held for the longest possible time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Conor Lenihan referred to the situation in the North where one community wishes to be part of the United Kingdom and the other wishes to be part of a United Ireland, while all of them are simultaneously citizens of a great united Europe which is moving ahead through a series of treaties towards closer and closer integration, <Col N="1138" /> and towards European citizenship &mdash; which in some senses supersedes national sovereignty &mdash;becoming a reality.  It seems extraordinary that in that context we do not seem able to make a connection between the European citizenship which is common to us all and the various aspirations people have for national sovereignty and the great tragedies surrounding those aspirations. Let me take this opportunity to wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, well in his work in that regard; I believe he will make excellent progress, but a huge amount of work remains to be done.  It is a great pity that the focus on national sovereignty could not be transferred at least a little towards the common European citizenship which we all enjoy although we sometimes curse it because it has its disadvantages as well.  In that area there seems to be offered a lifeline and support to the efforts of national Governments which is not always brought into play.</P>
    <P>In looking at the overall impact of the EU it struck me there are various groups here and within the Union who have a much closer feel for Europe than others.  Agriculture is probably one of the areas where people feel closer to Europe, and farmers and people involved in farmer politics are more Euro-literate than people involved in national politics.  There is a good reason in that Europe has impinged very strongly on agriculture here.  It is sometimes said that the European Community or Common Market, as it initially was, did enormous damage to Irish agriculture, that it spelled the death knell of the small farmer and, by extension, did enormous damage to rural communities by removing the people who were involved in agriculture.  Whether the arrival of the Common Market expedited or caused change that would have happened in any event, or whether external forces would have brought about these events, is a debate that has gone on for a long time and will undoubtedly continue into the future.  There is a question about the commitment of the European Union to rural communities.  There may well be a question about the commitment of the European Union to various urban communities.  However, agriculture is still central to the continuation of rural communities.  I was quite surprised when I made that point as a panellist on a programme coming from Galway that the vast majority of the audience disagreed with me.  I am used to being disagreed with on a host of issues, but this struck me as an unusual issue on which to find such a huge level of disagreement.</P>
    <P>People in employment and in trade unions who are close to trends in employment are also finding themselves gradually more and more connected to European than to national policy.  As late as last night there were headlines about the Dutch experience.  They have been gradually moving towards shorter working hours &mdash; they have obviously done other things which are right &mdash;and getting a huge level of employment, having easily the lowest level of unemployment in <Col N="1139" /> Europe at about 5 per cent.  They are clearly doing some things right which others could copy. Some of the larger economies such as France and Germany which seem to have advantages are, unfortunately, moving in the opposite direction. We in Ireland have to be concerned about our own performance in that area.</P>
    <P>The speed of the Celtic Tiger in economic development and economic progress has been encouraging recently, but there is a belief that it is not matched by the speed of job creation, and that continues to be a source of concern.  Nevertheless, people in employment are gradually benefiting from the many European protocols and provisions which are subsequently transposed into national law.  In the area of fisheries, for example, there is a common belief that Ireland got off to a poor start and subsequently went mostly downhill.  This is an area where we have never been able to claw back ground and where, because of our geographic location and our access to the seas, a future treaty must allow us to regain some lost ground.</P>
    <P>In the Amsterdam Treaty Ireland is, for once, credited with having been a leader in the area of social policy.  There has been a perception that we have been dragged along screaming and against our will by our European neighbours, by the liberal elements of the media and all kinds of other people, into a new and improved social dimension.  I welcome this as we have a contribution to make in the field of social change.</P>
    <P>The Treaty deals at some length with environmental issues of which the level of awareness here has increased at a phenomenal rate in the past five to ten years.  We can now afford the luxury of paying attention to such matters where previously we were too busy surviving.  I am glad the Treaty strengthens provisions in this regard.</P>
    <P>It deals also with health care issues which have dogged various Administrations here and in nations with greater wealth at their disposal. Infectious diseases which it was thought ten years ago or less had been defeated are gradually reemerging as a threat.  It is appropriate that Europe should take the lead.</P>
    <P>On the issue of transparency, while large volumes of information have traditionally been made available about the workings of European institutions, for one reason or another citizens of the European Union appear to have difficulty in accessing it.  This is ironic.</P>
    <P>I could not hazard a guess as to the percentage, but the European Union has played a major role in prompting the introduction of national legislation.  Moves are made in the Treaty to increase the powers of the European Parliament.  We should welcome this as parliamentarians and democrats but as a small country we should be concerned that our interests will be ignored.</P>
    <P>The Treaty contains provisions dealing with minority languages and cultures.</P>

      <P>To say the least the Minister's statement is complex, unenlightening, woolly and unclear and I am none the wiser having read it. This is unusual.  It is &ldquo;tongue in cheek&rdquo; and gobbledygook.  I hope somebody will unravel it and the White Paper promised by the Minister will be more forthcoming and explain clearly exactly what is involved.  Various caveats have been entered.  While Ireland has observer status at the Western European Union we can opt-out of a defence pact.  The same is true in the case of majority voting.  The Minister said the Treaty specifically provides that all decisions having defence implications will require unanimity.  One wonders whether it will achieve what it sets out to do.</P>
      <P>At this stage heads of state have a good idea of who the new members of the European Union will be and the number and timescale involved but we are talking around the subject of enlargement.  The Minister did not even mention the countries involved.  While Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are likely to join in the next three to four years, will the Minister indicate when Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Malta and Cyprus are likely to join? Their membership would have major implications for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to opt-out clauses, the Maastricht Treaty criteria, the Petersberg Tasks and Schengen arrangements but failed to address the real issues.  What we should talk about is our Structural and Cohesion Funds allocations.  Will these be scaled down after 1999 following the accession of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary and, if so, by how much?  Will they be reduced gradually to nothing over a five to ten year period?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to illegal immigrants and racism, subjects we could discuss at great length. There is racism within the European Union as some of our entertainers discovered recently in Manchester Airport.  All the cosy arrangements will count for nothing unless the words are translated into plain English.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>whether he has set or intends to set specific targets for the numbers of children who leave school with no qualification, which stood at 3,600 in the latest year for which figures are available.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the National Economic and Social Forum's &mdash; NESF &mdash; report on early school leavers and youth unemployment, an interdepartmental working group to examine the NESF's recommendations was established.  That group reported to Government and proposed, as a realistic target, halving the rate of unqualified school leavers by the year 2000, with the further objective of full participation by the year 2006.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to addressing this issue on a concentrated and co-ordinated basis.  I have already announced a major expansion in the Youthreach programme for tackling early school leavers among 15 to 18 year olds. The number of places will expand from 4,525 at present to 6,250 in l998 as an extra 1,000 places are provided, and an additional 725 places within FÁS are redeployed to provide progression options on Youthreach.  This represents an immediate implementation of a specific proposal in the Government's programme.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to go beyond these and to develop a range of interventions, starting at primary level, which will identify and assist children in danger of leaving school early.  The provision of a range of curriculum options which addresses the needs of children who would not benefit from participation in the traditional, academicallyfocused, curriculum, is also an important part of any plan to reduce early school leaving.  In this respect, the leaving certificate applied and leaving certificate vocational programmes are particularly important.  I am fully committed to their expansion and intend to ensure full resourcing for that purpose.</P>
      <P>When taken together these actions will make a major contribution to reducing the number of children who leave school each year without completing their courses or any adequate qualification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the target of halving the number of school leavers without any qualification by the year 2000 is wholly inadequate and unambitious bearing in mind that, in the last single year for which figures are available, there was a reduction of 33 per cent which means the Minister proposes, over a three or four year period, to reduce it by only a tiny proportion?  Does he agree that the target he has set himself needs to be radically revised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not state that that was my objective.  I intend to revise those objectives and be more optimistic in terms of achieving realistic rather than mere aspirational targets.  I did point out that the interdepartmental working group established by the Government of which the Deputy was a member proposed those targets he <Col N="1142" /> has just criticised but I take his point, that we need to be somewhat more ambitious in terms of increasing those targets.  However, that interdepartmental working group, having assessed the NESF's work on early school leaving, produced these figures.  I would be concerned that perhaps to wait until the year 2006 for a full reduction is not sufficiently ambitious.  I know that the Taoiseach in particular is concerned, within the context of social inclusion, that we make every effort to ensure that every child is given the opportunity to leave school with adequate qualifications, recognising that the life chances of any child who leaves school early, without qualification, are diminished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree to this alternative target: to eliminate all those children who leave school without having sat their junior certificate, without any qualification, at present comprised of some 2,200, by the year 2000, a cohort we know is experiencing well over 66 per cent unemployment?</P>
      <P>In respect of the main vehicle the Minister announced as the response to this phenomenon, namely the increase of 1,000 places on the Youthreach programme, is he aware that 66 per cent of those who leave school without any qualification do not participate in Youthreach or any other training programme?  Does he accept that extending a programme at present bypassing those target groups does not constitute a sufficient response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the Youthreach programme is bypassing the targeted groups.  I suggest that if the Youthreach programme ceased the numbers of those in that targeted group would be much greater.  The Youthreach programme has proved a very valuable intervention in terms of providing alternative opportunities for young people who have left the mainstream schools system, which perhaps was not in a position to respond adequately to their needs.</P>
      <P>I accept that we need to intervene earlier in the life cycle of an individual and we are examining a pilot programme for eight to 15 year olds.  In this respect I met our Commissioner, Padráig Flynn and another European Commissioner particularly interested in this subject and committed to it.  Together we are working actively to produce a programme very quickly on the eight to 15 year olds within the informal, &ldquo;out of school&rdquo; and formal &ldquo;in school&rdquo; contexts, to try to integrate young people who are experiencing difficulty in the schools system.</P>
      <P>Our first target should be to ensure that the estimated 1,000 students who do not even make the progression from primary to secondary level is one of immediate concern to me, a problem I should like to have eliminated by the year 2000 and in respect of which I am striving and doing everything possible.  I accept Deputy Bruton's bona fides in terms of the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister begins devising new programmes, on which I commend him, does he agree he should examine why two-thirds who, on his own admission constitute the target group for the Youthreach programme &mdash;the children who leave school without any qualification &mdash; are bypassed?  That is not acceptable. Therefore, the Minister must look beneath the programmes and address the issue of access for them which clearly, in the case of Youthreach, is not being sufficiently targeted at them to attract more than one-third into participating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason many of those within the target group do not reach the Youthreach programme is that, by the time they reach 14 or 15, they have become totally uninterested in the schools system or in participating in any such programme.  Therefore, it appears we should head in the direction of beginning earlier, down to the very earliest years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The interdepartmental working group established by the Deputy's Government, no doubt in good faith, proposed the original target.  Nonetheless, I consider the targeting of eight to 15 year olds an interesting objective.  I feel instinctively I must begin earlier as early education is the key to resolving this problem since there are many complex reasons for and issues pertaining to why children leave school early.</P>

      <P>In devising that primary education programme will the Minister be conscious that the study showed 66 per cent of disadvantaged children live in rural areas, necessitating the devising of programmes of access for them in urban and rural areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's view in that respect.  I am conscious that the Combat Poverty report on educational disadvantage highlighted the fact that over two-thirds of all children suffering from educational disadvantage reside in rural areas, in population centres of fewer than 10,000. Therefore, the strategies to cope with that educational disadvantage will be different from that deployed in urban areas and, because of the dispersed nature of the problem in rural areas, will require a different approach.  I accept the Deputy's point that we must be conscious of disadvantage <Col N="1144" /> in rural areas, particularly as the population decline will create difficulties in rural primary schools in terms of class numbers and so on.  I began a process in the Department of studying the demographic trends and the implications for education in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to promoting the concept of lifelong learning and this commitment is reflected in its Action Programme for the Millennium.  In this context, and as the first Minister of State with specific responsibility for adult education, I will be giving priority to the development of a range of educational responses in the area of lifelong learning.  I am currently in the process of producing a Green Paper which I hope to have available by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>On the question of funding, almost £2 million was allocated last year for the literacy and community education programme.  The organisations involved in that area requested an increase of £1 million.  The actual increase granted by the previous Minister was a mere £70,000, or less than 3 per cent of an increase in actual terms.</P>
      <P>Following representations made by me to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, last July I am glad to inform the Deputy that we have an additional £250,000 to spend this year.  As the Deputy will be aware, discussions are ongoing in the context of the Estimates debate and I will make the strongest possible representations for a substantial increase in funding for 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is their first Question Time, I wish the Minister and the Minister of State well in the area of education.  Arising from what the Minister of State said about continuing education and lifelong learning, it is my understanding &mdash; he may correct me if I am wrong &mdash;that there may be only 20 literacy officers working in the Republic.  I have read the Minister's statements on the Action Programme for the Millennium, but leaving aside the question of the adequacy or inadequacy of my colleague's provision in the last Administration, will the Minister indicate whether there will be an increase in the number of people dealing with the problem of literacy? The Minister of State said the Green Paper will be available by the end of the year.  If that is the case, he should be in a position to anticipate the provision necessary for the increase in the number of people dealing with literacy. Will the Minister comment on the international observation made in recent weeks that the Irish <Col N="1145" /> level of illiteracy was very high, particularly for a country with such good economic indicators?  At a time when we compliment ourselves on our high economic performance some people have been left uncared for in relation to literacy.  Does that not make an outstanding case for giving a clear commitment, in the preparation of the Estimates, to the issue of literacy alone?  We can return to the question of lifelong learning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised a number of points.  I do not have the figures for the number of people employed full time in literacy provision. I am sure it is more than 20 but I will get the figure for the Deputy.  Since coming into the Department, I have become aware that the amount of tuition time for adult literacy classes is two hours per week which is equivalent to two weeks full time study in a year.  Eighty-five per cent of the people providing tuition are volunteers.  We are committed in our manifesto to reducing the dependence on volunteerism, introducing more flexible hours, providing more suitable premises and money for materials such as computers and software.  I intend to press ahead with that.  As the Deputy acknowledged in his question, that will require a substantial increase in resources.  I have made the strongest possible representations to the Minister for Finance who listened sympathetically to my request and has given me an additional £250,000 for this year.</P>
      <P>I do not need the Green Paper to tell me about the demands on the ground.  I have spoken to people who are taking adult education classes and to the organisations representing those people both at national and local level &mdash; I refer specifically to NALA and Aontas &mdash; and I know many people who are involved in the system in my own area.  The objective of the Green Paper is to rationalise and put a structure on the adult education system.  Interest in adult education has grown to an extraordinary degree in recent times but there is total disorganisation in this area where not even all the actors in the field have the full picture.  We need to establish some sort of national board to direct adult education and that is the primary purpose of the Green Paper.  We are also committed to improving access to literacy tuition and that is the reason I am seeking substantial increases in funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins is correct on the question of international comment.  The OECD carried out a survey of eight countries &mdash; not all EU countries, they included Canada and the United States &mdash;on levels of literacy.  The people at level 1 could hardly perform the smallest literacy tasks in terms of reading and writing while those at levels 4 and 5 could perform the most complex literacy tasks. In terms of the people at the lower end of the scale, Ireland was second last with Poland coming in last.  The figure for those at level 1 was 25 per cent which is extraordinary and exceeded even the worst estimates of NALA and other organisations.  I intend to publish the survey shortly but <Col N="1146" /> I am aware some details of it have already leaked out, as the Deputy will be aware.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, the survey concerned three age groups &mdash; 16 to 25, 25 to 45 and 45 to 64.  It is obvious from the survey that the biggest problem occurred in the older age group which fared much worse than the second age group, with the lower age group performing the best.  I associate that with the introduction of free education in 1968.  The problem becomes much more acute from the 45 age group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for the figures which I am sure will have a beneficial impact on the Minister for Finance as he prepares the Estimates.  On the issue of lifelong learning, it was my understanding that Aontas had made a submission to the Department of Education in relation to additional arrangements.  Will the Minister of State indicate if talks have taken place with other Departments, such as my old Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Public Enterprise, about using new technology for adult education?  I am aware preliminary discussions took place before I left my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am engaged in an ongoing review of all aspects of higher education grants, including the eligibility rules.  In particular, I am seeking to focus on areas of the operation of the grants scheme where room for improvement has already been clearly identified.  The administration of the scheme is of particular concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Advisory Committee on Third Level Student Support, chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitléir, was published in February 1995.  The report dealt with eligibility and reforms.  The advisory committee found the present system of student support to be fragmented, cumbersome and very confusing for grant applicants.  It identified overlaps and duplication, with up to 70 different organisations involved in the administration of the grant schemes.  It also found that payments were too frequently delayed and that students were often disadvantaged by various administrative problems in the system.  The advisory committee recommended that there should be one applications <Col N="1147" /> form for the three existing schemes which have the same means test, the same rate of grant and cover virtually the same courses.  It also recommended significant changes in the processing of grant applications and payments.  It is clear that the current administration of the student support schemes must be improved.</P>
    <P>Apart from reservations about the need for a new body, I have an open mind as to the best and most appropriate options for a new centralised system.  A joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has begun an examination of various options and the possible role of that Department in any new system. I expect to have a report and recommendations in the matter towards the end of this year.  When I have the report I will give it full consideration with a view to having any recommendations for improved and more efficient and effective administrative arrangements implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements without appropriate consultation with all interested parties.  My only objective is to ensure that the system properly addresses the concerns of students and parents.  I intend to continue to seek ways of improving support for students engaged in third level study and research and will consider a range of options to achieve this objective.  Deputies will, of course, accept that changes will inevitably have financial implications and will have to be dealt with in the context of wider estimates provisions for third level education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his interesting reply which relates more to Deputy McManus's Question No. 6 than to my question. I am specifically interested in the action being taken by the Minister to implement the commitments made by Fianna Fáil when in Opposition&mdash; the manifesto is still on its web site &mdash; to increase the maintenance level of higher education grants, to increase the income limits for higher education grants, to introduce marginal relief for those over the income thresholds, to give a better deal to large families, to have better post-graduate facilities, to provide concessions for dependent children of mature students, to provide the same grant terms for those in PLCs, to give part-time students access to proportionate grants and to give additional grants to mature students from low income backgrounds.</P>
      <P>I tabled a written question to the Minister but his Department was unable to give an estimate of the cost of any of these commitments.  Has the Minister done a complete U-turn on the commitment he made in Opposition to improve access to higher education grants for students?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question relates to a working party on the eligibility rules for higher education grants.  The word &ldquo;eligibility&rdquo; was not <Col N="1148" /> included in the original question sent to my Department.  In referring to the Fianna Fáil manifesto, the Deputy omitted some very important sections.  The Government has made it clear that the commitments to which the Deputy referred are a priority in terms of improving the student support system.  The manifesto clearly states that these are our priorities and they will be implemented as resources permit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not emphasised by Deputy Bruton because it did not suit his line of questioning.  I was very concerned to make this clear at the USI press conference.  In any event this is an obvious position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Improvements to any system have resource implications.</P>
      <P>It is not true to say that there are no estimates of what the improvements would cost.  For example, a £100 increase in the maximum maintenance grant would cost £3.5 million per annum, while an increase of 2 or 3 per cent would cost £1.3 million.  The cost of improving the income eligibility limits by £1,000 for each bracket would cost £5 million per annum.  The figures are in the Department but these issues are obviously a matter for the wider Estimates provision.</P>
      <P>The Deputy omitted to refer to commitments in the manifesto to increase the number of third level places, which is my first priority.  The previous Government did not address the appalling under capitalisation of regional technical colleges and universities, the lack of proper equipment in universities and the scandalous under funding of research in third level institutes.  The key issue for many young people is access to third level education and a first class learning environment which has a proper input in terms of capital funding, equipment, etc.</P>
      <P>There are many headaches in the third level education area, including the historical deficit in terms of the regional technical college sector, which must be dealt with.  Most regional technical colleges are trying to cater for double the number of students they were intended to cater for when they were built more than 20 years ago.  I am looking at the overall sector and will bring forward a package to tackle all the issues which relate to third level education.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave a very elaborate enunciation of his position but what I want are answers to simple questions.  What precisely does the word &ldquo;priority&rdquo; mean in the context of <Col N="1149" /> the manifesto which states that the system must be reassessed?  It is clear that the priorities set in the manifesto are very much posteriorities.  The Minister listed umpteen other areas where action will be taken first.  What are the public to make of these clear commitments to PLCs, post-graduate and part-time students and people just outside the eligibility criteria?  Will provision be made in the 1998 Estimates for a substantial number of these commitments?</P>

      <P>In response to the de Buitléir report, I set up a working group comprising officials of my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to simplify administration of the grant system to give better service to the student.  Ultimately that is what I am concerned about.  An excellent job was done by de Buitléir on the higher education grant system and it was a great pity the report was left on the shelf.  In 1995 the Government of which Deputy Bruton was a member allocated £250,000 towards a centralised grant agency, but later that year it changed its mind and ignored the report. Deputy Bruton has some neck to talk about reform of the higher education grant system when the Government of which he was a member did nothing for part-time students, mature students and postgraduates.  Resources permitting, they are my priorities in terms of higher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton is aware from his time in the Department of Enterprise and Employment that the key issue facing third level education as we approach the end of this century is that young people should be given the opportunity to participate in third level education.  We should ensure a sufficient number of young people emanate from our colleges to meet the skilled needs of the economy.  I am proud those issues outlined by Deputy Bruton <Col N="1151" /> are on the political agenda for third level education.</P>

This consultative status is statutorily based following the enactment of the Youth Work Act, 1997, and will be maintained in the forthcoming amending legislation.  On a more general level, the National Youth Council of Ireland is consulted by Government as part of the social partnership structures under the Partnership 2000 agreement.</P>
      <P>The views of young people and youth organisations are articulated at international level, particularly in the European Union, the Council of Europe and the United Nations, by the European Youth Forum.

I am informed by the Department of Foreign Affairs that, to ensure the best possible value for money, the people who comprise delegations which meet those bodies must be skilled in negotiation, policy areas and the diplomatic area.  The involvement of non-governmental organisations, specifically youth organisations, is being considered actively by the Department of Foreign Affairs.

      <P>I announced on 18 July that my objective is to develop a framework for the structured development of institutions in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands while ensuring the maintenance of the complementary third level systems of university and technological education.  I further stated that the diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements.  I agree with the need to change the title of regional technical colleges, incorporating the common feature &ldquo;institute of technology&rdquo;, as recommended in the report of the high level group on the technological sector.</P>
      <P>A consultation process is under way and I hope, following conclusion of this process, to publish legislation as early as possible next year, which will provide for the co-ordinated development of the technological sector and enhance its contribution to national and regional development.  I am giving this matter priority but, pending the conclusion of the consultative process, I cannot be more precise about the timing of the publication of the legislation.  I am concerned with the need to upgrade the infrastructure of the technological sector which has suffered from lack of investment over many years.  I am determined to put in place a framework for the technological sector which will protect and promote the quality provision of courses which have been so important to regional and national development.</P>

He said that in the context of future developments of institutes, whatever structure may exist, the institute in Waterford will be a stand alone institute, will have its own degree awarding status and will not be answerable to INIT.  Will the Minister comment on the reason offered by the Minister of State, that no other college in the previous regional college structure stands up to the marking quality of the institute?  Does that indicate the Minister will grant a different status to Cork and other areas that aspire to institute of technology status from that in Waterford?</P>

      <P>The interim review group has met and the process of delegating the authority to make awards has already started in Waterford and Cork.  Every area which has a regional technical college has a perspective on its needs and objectives.  That is clear from the debate last year. What happened was that all sectors were not included in the process.  I am determined to discuss this issue in a genuinely consultative way with all involved, notwithstanding and acknowledging the various interest groups from the different regions.  It is extremely important we retain a national technological structure which retains the distinctive feature of the technological sector which is the multi-level nature of the qualifications on offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have met the heads and directors of the regional technical colleges and made it clear to them that I consider the multi-level provision essential to their remit.  That includes the Waterford and the Dublin institutes of technology. <Col N="1154" /> Whatever new institutes emerge in time and no matter how they progress and evolve, they will have to retain that multi-level profile of awards because it is very important to industry and business needs.  It is important we focus in on this debate.  Many regional technical colleges have sold themselves short in terms of this debate. They have done a fantastic job to date and industry and business have tremendous confidence in what they have produced.  I am confident we can work out a solution in the national and regional interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my earlier reply to Priority Question No. 3 tabled by Deputy Richard Bruton.  As I indicated, a joint working group involving my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has begun an examination of various options available for the administration of the grants schemes and the possible role of that Department in any new system.  I expect to have a report and recommendations in the matter towards the end of this year.</P>
      <P>My main concern is to improve the service to the students.  De Buitléir, in his report in 1995, was in favour of a centralised grants agency. Many Deputies were concerned at the time it was published that students might not have access locally to some body or institution to process their claims.  I am interested in the discussions under way between my officials and officials from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  A centralised agency, a potential local network and a tried and tested appeals system were all features identified by de Buitléir in his report in 1995.  I am seeking ways to implement them in the most cost effective way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we did.  There is a continuing demand, especially from the student body, on this issue.  The situation is not very satisfactory.  Will the Minister elaborate on the timeframe? Certain dates have been reported, including 1999, and it seems extraordinary it would take that long to put a system in place.</P>
      <P>Two problems which continually arise at local level are appeals and the time of the notification of grants.  All TDs have experience of them at certain times of the year.  Can the Minister guarantee that, if we have a centralised system, these problems will be resolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I would have the report at the end of the year.  That is our target, to have the discussions between my Department and those of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs concluded.  I share the Deputy's view that it is surprising we have not had progress on this since 1995.  I cannot accept responsibility for that as I have only been in office for three months.  Funding was provided by the last Government in the Estimates in 1995 for a centralised grant agency, but the then Minister <Col N="1156" /> changed her mind and decided not to proceed with such an agency.  There the matter rested and little was done in terms of implementing de Buitléir, especially on that issue.</P>
      <P>The issues are as the Deputy has outlined. Students depend on the various local authorities in the areas in which they live, they have to wait too long for grants and there have been undue difficulties in processing grants.  I like what de Buitléir devised, for example, regular monthly payments to students.  When students have been deemed eligible for grants, they should receive them regularly and they should also have a degree of certainty as to when they will receive them.  They should also receive them on time and there should be an independent appeals process. I acknowledge the system is not satisfactory and I am determined to improve it in the interests of students.</P>
      <P>I do not want to pre-empt what is happening because my colleague in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will have his views.  However, it seems his Department has been modernised over the past decade in terms of computerisation.  It is probably the most computerised Department and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, was instrumental in starting that process.  Its service to the public has been transformed over the past ten to 15 years.  It has a general income support function so there is a logic in attempting to develop a system in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent one of the counties with the lowest level of people attending third level.  Many of the students from the area have been able to travel to the North and Great Britain and that option may not now be available to them.  I want to see not only a competent central grants agency but that some of the anomalies in the grants system are rectified.  For example, I had a case today where a farmer had to construct a farm building to control pollution under a section 12 notice, yet that is treated as unnecessary capital expenditure and the interest is not allowed against his income.</P>
      <P>There are many such anomalies which I ask the Minister to examine.  In another case, a county council employee was forced to work overtime because of an emergency, and this made him ineligible for grants.  As a result of a major breakdown, this PAYE worker had to spend a weekend working at that, which made him ineligible for grants.  There should be the same criteria for education grants as for taxation.  There are 16 different levels of evaluation of people's income and one of the most difficult is that for third level education grants.  It is obvious that in rural areas, such as Monaghan, where there is no alternative form of education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy gives me the details of this case I will see if the eligibility rules have been properly applied.  I am conscious of many anomalies in the system.  It would cost money to deal with all of them.  I am also conscious of the Deputy's concerns about the implications of the Deering report on students in Border counties. The Department is working actively on this issue.</P>

      <P>I endorse the points made by Deputy Crawford.  I also come across many anomalies.  These are often spoken of in general terms but they exist and I hope the Department will try to eradicate them.</P>
      <P>How will the proposed new central agency for paying grants work alongside the existing local authority grant structure?  Will it take over from that structure or is there to be a formal arrangement so that there will not be further complications? One of the biggest problems is the delay in the payment of grants rather than access to grants.  Will the new structure offer any guarantee that there will not be future delays and, if there are, is there any sanction which can be taken against those responsible if they can be pinpointed? Can the Minister guarantee that we will have this report before the end of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>My target date for the report is the end of the year.  Consultations will have to take place with all interested parties.  That relates to those working in local authorities, vocational education committees and so on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  As a former member of a local authority I can remember at Estimates time on Cork Corporation we were always annoyed that we received the money in arrears from the Department of Education.  This cost approximately £100,000 in interest payments, money which could have been useful to the authority.  The solution which emerges will be dependent on a consensus being achieved in terms of a new system which will guarantee payments, bringing a degree of certainty to the system rather than the varied response to date.  In fairness to those working in local authorities, they have been under a great deal of pressure because of other responsibilities.  There are 74 organisations dealing with three different schemes and three different forms.  This seems very cumbersome and there is an obligation on us to try to simplify this in the interests of students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The de Buitléir report was prepared at a time when there were 74 authorities processing grants.  This was far too many.  Application forms for grant aid were not published <Col N="1158" /> until the end of August when people had received their CAO offers.  The major change which has occurred during the past two years is that the application forms are now distributed in May and processed before the CAO offers are announced. This makes a big difference in terms of when payments can be made.  The major change needed is that we centralise locally rather than nationally so that there is one authority in each county processing applications.  This would make for a more efficient system.  Local authority members would accept this.  Many will be opposed to having this function being taken from them as it has been theirs for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Deputy's comments on the improvements which have taken place in issuing forms.  This was a beneficial reform but there were many other suggestions in the de Buitléir report which were not taken up. When I was a member of a local authority I was not conscious of a great power or function in terms of administering education grants.  The higher education grant rules are fairly definitive in terms of queries from Deputies.  It would overstate the case to suggest this was a major function for local authority members.</P>
      <P>The best interests of the students should be our main concern.  I am open to the Deputy's suggestion in terms of a county organisation.  I am not closing my mind to these issues other than to say that I have gone down one route to see if there is any advantage to be gained from this line of inquiry.  We will not delay it.  In the interim we will see what can be done to improve the existing system.</P>

      <P>Teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14, are recognised by my Department as qualified to teach in special schools for the mentally handicapped, the emotionally disturbed and the hearing impaired.</P>
      <P>I have recently met representatives of the Association of AMI Teachers of Ireland.  We discussed the question of extending departmental recognition to AMI teachers beyond the categories recognised at present.  I assure the Deputy I am currently undertaking a full examination of the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that recently I announced my intention to set up a national forum on early education.  The recognition of Montessori and other early childhood education <Col N="1159" /> qualifications will be addressed in the forum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I declare an interest in this issue as my sister is a teacher using this method.  Perhaps that should disqualify me from asking questions.  However, the Fianna Fáil manifesto indicated  the Government would recognise Montessori teaching.  Is the Minister pulling back from that commitment in saying he will only recognise it should some study group come out in favour of such a move?  What precisely does recognition mean?  The main concern of groups involved in Montessori teaching is that they come under the Department of Health.  Their pupilteacher ratios are different from those of a normal teaching environment.  Their concerns are not solely about existing recognition in special schools but their right to be treated as educationalists and to comply with the provisions that apply to all education rather than under health boards which deal with cre ches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I too must declare an interest in this subject as my three year old son attends an AMI Montessori school.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto made a clear commitment that AMI Montessori teachers would be recognised for the purposes of early education.  The question is broader in terms of being a full and integral part of the primary system.  What gave rise to this issue was the introduction of the early start initiative in 1994 when Association Montessori Internationale teachers were specifically excluded by the then Government from applying for positions on the programme even as classroom assistants in some respects.  The people involved are specifically trained with a view to teaching in early education and have full professional qualifications. During the by-election in Cork in 1994 I met a number of AMI teachers who had received commitments about eligibility to apply for the programme.  This is where my interest in the case began.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the issue is broader than this.  The national forum does not refer to an expert group. I, the Assistant Secretary of the Department and others have been working since July on this matter and it is a complex issue in terms of early education.  AMI teachers are but one element.  There are approximately 100 pre-school groups associated with the Irish Pre-school Play Groups Association which comes under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Children being funded by health boards in a varying and uneven manner.  There are AMI Montessori teachers who work largely in the private sector but also with Irish Pre-school Play Groups Association play groups, St. Nicholas Montessori Society and naonraí and Comhchoiste Réamhscolaíochta which provide pre-school through the medium of Irish.  Seven Government Departments are involved in early education.  The INTO is also <Col N="1160" /> involved in the early start initiative in the formal education system.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many tensions developed after the formation and initiation of the early start programme.  I met many experts such as Dr. Douglas in UCC and Noreen Hayes in Dublin Institute of Technology who have pioneered research in Ireland in early education.  We need to bring everybody forward together to develop a national coherent policy and framework on early education.  To this end we are inviting all organisations to a national convention on early education in January.  Much preparatory work will have to be done in this context.  I have already addressed the Irish Pre-school Play Groups Association conference and will address the AMI conference next Saturday.</P>
    <P>For the first time the Department of Education is looking at the overall sector and at all those involved in it.  In this context the issue of recognition of qualifications will be dealt with and resolved.  If we start making moves based on individual groupings we may not proceed too far towards the development of a national coherent policy on early education which is essential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a small number of teachers with secondary teaching qualifications, usually with a degree and higher diploma in education, who are teaching groups such as travellers. At present they cannot be recognised as the stream of entry into that type of teaching is through national teaching qualifications.  Those who had a national or secondary teaching qualification could adjust their training or qualifications by undertaking a course which was offered several years ago.  There are a small number of people looking after special groups.  If the Minister is to look at the general issue of recognition it would be worth while eliminating the anomalous position of this small number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister envisage by recognition?  Does it mean that Montessori teachers will no longer be solely recognised as unqualified assistants in national schools?  Does it mean that the ratio their schools will have to adopt will not be the 1:8 required by the health boards for cre ches but something more related to a schoolroom setting?  Will the bodies conferring qualifications be recognised as third level institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to recognition for early education provision and the possibility of those involved in the sector applying for new State organised projects.  They were excluded from doing so by the previous administration.  I am conscious that substitutes in national schools are not paid the full rate.  These are the issues I want to discuss in consultation with the Department because other bodies also have legitimate <Col N="1161" /> interests in this matter.  It is important that we achieve a resolution of these issues by consensus involving all partners because we will not achieve much if we pursue a unilateral route.  It is a complex area with tensions and much mistrust.</P>
      <P>Pre-schools feel primary schools were excluded from regulations pertaining to the child care legislation regarding the required ratio and the health and safety regulations.  Pre-schools, which do not see themselves as cre ches, were included.  The Irish Pre-school Play Groups Association, with which I recently met, is taking a constructive approach to the child care legislation.  They have met health boards and it feels that it is in everybody's interest that we do our best to fulfil the criteria outlined in the legislation.  Notwithstanding the difficulties the association's members are encountering, it is working constructively with the health boards to fulfil the legislative requirements.  That legislation was passed by the last Dáil and the regulations were agreed prior to the dissolution of that Dáil.  I am conscious of the difficulties it is causing a number of providers in this area but we must work constructively to deal with these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the recognition referred to by the Minister in the context of the child care legislation extend as far as providing the means whereby Montessori teachers, especially those affiliated to the Irish Pre-school Play Groups Association, can comply with the new regulations which are causing considerable difficulties?  In relation to the recognition of Montessori teachers in national schools, will fluency in Irish and qualifications to teach the curriculum through Irish be necessary for Montessori teachers as is the case with other national school teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>When this issue arose, the initial concern was eligibility to teach in early education, that is classes up to four years of age.  The wider issue of complete qualifications is more complex and will take much more time to resolve, if it can be resolved.  It will be debated in the context of the upcoming convention.</P>
      <P>I have met the Irish Pre-school Play Groups Association which has had ongoing contact with health boards.  The executive of the association made it clear to me that they were quite impressed by the response of the health boards to their concerns.  There were fears that people would be closed down overnight.  Those fears have not been realised and there is a genuine working together in terms of meeting the requirements of the law and progressing from there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key issue, in which the Irish Pre-school Play Groups Association is interested, is that we have much to do in terms of early education.  I am trying to put a national framework in place. Seven Government Departments are involved. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has in excess of 100 child care projects, significantly resourced from Europe; the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, <Col N="1162" /> under FÁS, has an input into providing for early education, child care provision, community employment schemes and so forth; the Department of Education and Science has Early Start; the Department of Health and Children deals primarily with 1,800 IPPA groups; the Department of Social, and Family Affairs, through the NOW programme and voluntary grants, funds a number of early education initiatives; the Department of Agriculture and Food, through the Leader project, funds a number of early education projects in rural areas; the Department of the Taoiseach, through the area partnerships and ADM, funds a number of initiatives.</P>
    <P>Noreen Hayes in Dublin Institute of Technology did an excellent study on early education. The clear message was we need a national policy on early education to bring together everyone who has an input on the one road.  That would involve accreditation &mdash; people would have standards in terms of qualifications and a ladder of progression which would reflect their experience in the field and have opportunities to progress. The groups involved are working towards national curriculum guidelines for early education.</P>
    <P>As the economy of modern Ireland progresses, child care and early education will become more central to society.  Most European countries are more advanced in terms of national policy on the provision of early education and child care.  I am endeavouring to develop a coherent framework. The national convention I have outlined today is the first step towards developing a national consensus on the issue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, provides a commitment to the introduction of equitable support of students attending PLC courses.  The commitment in the programme for Government reflects the importance which the Government attaches to students in the PLC sector.  This is the first time issues of concern to PLCs have been put firmly on the political agenda and on a Government programme for action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> There is no reliable detailed information available to my Department in relation to the overall costs, including living expenses, to a student of attendance at a PLC course.  Such costs could vary widely.  The cost of introducing a support scheme for PLC students on lines similar to the higher education grants scheme would be of the order of £13 million per annum.</P>
    <P>My Department is providing in excess of £39 million this year towards the running costs of PLC courses which are playing a key role in preparing young people for employment and further education and training.  These courses are a significant element of the Government's response to meeting the skill needs of the economy.  Their importance is reflected in the Government's intention to introduce an equitable support scheme for the students in this sector.</P>
    <P>In this context I recently announced details of a national initiative to provide training to meet the skill needs of the international teleservices industry.  The PLC sector is central to this initiative with over 700 places being approved.  As this new initiative involves extensive placement abroad, a new student support scheme is being introduced towards the cost of the overseas placement.</P>
    <P>Through action to properly resource different aspects of their work, I am confident the Government will consistently demonstrate its commitment to recognising and promoting the role of the PLC sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 17,000 students are disappointed this initiative was not in place in September, as they had been led to believe by the Minister.  Will the Minister agree it is totally inequitable that a student attending Ballyfermot Senior College should not receive a maintenance grant while his equivalent attending Trinity College receives free fees and a maintenance grant? Will he agree that a Minister who condones this situation could be accused of outrageous indifference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good description of the previous Administration because that was exactly the position.  It is inequitable.  Students on PLC courses have been treated in an inequitable manner.  That is the reason there is a commitment in the programme for Government to deal with that inequity.  That is not the full story in terms of the inequity.  There has been no capital expenditure on PLC colleges since their inception.  In my view many PLC colleges have performed miracles in terms of the range of courses on offer.  In July I met a number of chief executives in industry who were appreciative of the role of the PLC colleges in meeting the skill needs of the economy.  The Government is committed to ensuring the PLCs will have a strong role in meeting the demands of the economy, particularly the skill needs.  This means more resources for the PLC sector.  The package I will be announcing in that respect will <Col N="1164" /> reflect the Government's commitment to the PLC sector.  In the manifesto we made no reference to 1997 since that is obviously in the context of the Estimates debate which is now taking place.  The Government of which the Deputy was a member decided to put nothing into the Estimates for PLC students.  Since coming into office I have met with all the heads and the chief executive officers of the vocational education committees.  I made it clear to them that unlike their experience under the previous Administration, this Administration will give priority placing to and hold in high regard the vocational education committee sector in terms of its role in education, particularly in terms of the PLC sector.</P>

      <P>I chose carefully the words I used earlier.  They came from a statement Deputy Martin made in August 1996, prior to becoming Minister.  He said that any Minister who would preside over this would be accused of outrageous indifference.  The Minister made a promise in the programme for Government to provide funding for PLC courses.  Many students and their parents voted on the basis that it would be in place this year.  Is the Minister giving a commitment that there will be equity in regard to PLC courses and ordinary higher education grants for 1988?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the process of discussing the Estimates and I am not in a position today to give a precise reply to that question.  The Government is committed to the PLC sector.  That we have put it into the programme for Government reflects the Government's commitment to the PLC sector generally.  Since coming into office I have initiated the teleservices initiative in the PLC sector which for the first time introduced a maintenance grant system for the 700 PLC students who were studying that course.  That maintenance grant system was in respect of the placement abroad of those students for about six months to develop a competency in foreign languages for the teleservices initiative.  Forfás and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who were very much involved in that model initiative to determine how education and industry should proceed in the future in terms of a dynamic partnership, estimate that up to 10,000 people will be employed in teleservices in the next three to four years.  Obviously we will need more schemes such as maintenance support schemes for PLC students to meet the skill needs of the economy.  This is the first time that a Minister for Education has said that the PLCs, just as <Col N="1165" /> the regional technical colleges and the universities, will have a strong role in terms of meeting the skill needs.  This means the provision of equipment and additional capital resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent months I listened to much debate about the Amsterdam EU Council meeting.  There appears to be an almost universal desire to press ahead to a fully integrated Europe. Political leaders and commentators seem to know where we are going, but do the people of this country know where they are going?</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty is the tenth treaty of Europe and I doubt if many people can name the other nine.  Most are familiar with the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht Treaty.  If one were to carry out a vox pop on any street, village, town or city, the knowledge of European affairs and the treaties we have signed would be limited.  For many the EU is represented by the blue sign with little stars that greets one as one enters a good stretch of road.  For others it is the absence of their favourite brown bread on the local shopping stall.  I have not heard in casual or any other form of conversation a person express concern at the terms of the stability and growth pact and our ability to present stability programmes, nor was the subject raised with me during the run-up to the recent general election.  Yet we are constantly told we are good Europeans and we do not dispute that accolade.  What is a good European?  Do we know what makes a good European?</P>
      <P>Opinion polls tell us there is an unprecedented distrust of politicians, but on this issue the general public has given <i>carte blanche</i> to the Government. This is something of which the body politic should be proud.  It is hard evidence that belies one of the latter day soft theories.  Yet there is a duty on Government to make people more aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Government attaches great importance to fulfilling its duty to explain the background and implications of the treaty.  I hope the White Paper on the treaty currently under preparation is as reader friendly as possible and clearly identifies and explains the five broad headings to which the Minister referred.  There is an onus on all of us to make ourselves more aware of Europe and our involvement in its evolution.  In l972 there was an 83 per cent vote in favour of joining the then European Community and we have enjoyed the willingness of the population to push towards Europe.  For the past four years Ireland has boasted the fastest economic growth rate in Europe.  Its GDP growth rate reached double figures of 10.7 per cent in l995 against an average EU rate of roughly 2 per cent.  We are enjoying an unprecedented boom as Exchequer returns exceed all expectations and <Col N="1167" /> forecasts and we are on course to meet the Maastricht criteria.</P>
    <P>Of late people will have noted the headline &ldquo;pay back time&rdquo; and other such phrases as all groups push for a slice of the cake.  The record of the Minister for Finance to date has shown him to be pragmatic.  In the forthcoming budget he should address the needs of the marginalised in society, particularly in the areas of health and education, but tread softly and not squander tomorrow for the sake of today.  Despite claims to the contrary many of us have not fared badly and we will never be asked to make the sacrifices our forefathers made.</P>
    <P>On a practical level, there are many areas that need to be addressed in the context of Europe. Our linguistic skills are poor.  We need to examine in greater detail how this problem can be addressed.  We are an island nation and community interaction is more difficult for us than for other states.  Greater emphasis should be placed on job exchange in the public and private sector. This could only be beneficial and would afford us an opportunity to demonstrate our skills and culture to other Europeans.</P>
    <P>Some quarters have expressed disappointment that the treaty does not go far enough.  We should tread slowly and knowingly rather than quickly. I welcome the treaty and note in particular the provision that allows the Council to adopt measures to combat discrimination on the grounds of disability.  We have improved greatly in this area in recent times, but we have a long way to go.  Common action is envisaged to prevent offences against children and I look forward to that development.  If we cannot protect our children what can we do?</P>
    <P>The Minister said there would be great focus in the months ahead on the security and defence provisions of the treaty.  This area requires separate debate and we will watch that space.  The treaty affords us an opportunity to once again reappraise our attitude to Europe and the direction we want to take.  We should ensure it does not bypass our citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I am deeply concerned about the implications of the Amsterdam Treaty for this country, particularly in regard to military and security matters.  If it is passed next March it will mark a major departure for our society on military and so-called defence issues. In the debate leading up to the referendum ordinary people should take serious note of what is involved.  Because of the amount of bureaucracy surrounding EU matters, the distance of decision-making from our citizens and the complexities involved, ordinary people tend not to take much notice.  The implications of this treaty in a range of areas, particularly on military matters, warrant thorough discussion.  Ordinary people will reject what is planned if the debate is carried out in an open and fair fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> In the debate leading up to the referendum right wing parties represented in the Dáil and other parties will overwhelmingly support this treaty and a small minority of Members will oppose it.  I do not want the Government to be allowed to command large State resources to push its case.  There must be a fair distribution of resources to allow for an informed debate which means that all sides of the argument must be put clearly before the people.</P>
    <P>Article 11 under Title V of the consolidated version of the Treaty on the European Union states &ldquo;The Union shall define and implement a common foreign and security policy covering all areas of foreign and security policy .&rdquo;. This is a new departure.  For the first time it gives corporate existence to the EU on the question of military alliances and strategy.  Some of us who fought the Maastricht Treaty were accused at that time of being alarmist when we warned this was the direction in which the major parties here were taking us, but when one examines the provisions of the this treaty it is clear that our warnings in 1992 were justified and the leadership of our country is taking us far further down the line of being involved in military alliances with the European powers.  The document also states:</P>
    <P>The Member States shall support the Union's external and security policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity.</P>
    <P>The Member States shall work together to enhance and develop their mutual political solidarity. They shall refrain from any action which is contrary to the interests of the Union or likely to impair its effectiveness as a cohesive force in international relations.</P>
    <P>The Council shall ensure that these principles are complied with.</P>
    <P>This is forcing our people to tie into a military alliance with the major powers in Europe with which our people fundamentally disagree on many questions.  Some of the powers that make up the European Union, such as Germany and France, have a shameful colonial past.  Some countries continue to interfere in the affairs of the Third World, an example is France's intervention in Africa.  France has its own agenda in pursuit of its objectives and economic profits for its State and this new departure is attempting to tie our people into that position.</P>
    <P>Article 17 in the document states:</P>
    <P>The common foreign and security policy shall include all question relating to the security of the Union, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, in accordance with the second subparagraph, which might lead to a common defence, should the European Council so decide.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility that our people through the Government of the day may be dragged into a military alliance with the European powers without <Col N="1169" /> holding a referendum.  It is important the people understand that.  Our people have traditionally and still strongly resist being involved in military alliance with any of the European or other powers, but that aspiration is not included in our Constitution.  If this treaty, as it stands, is agreed, the Government of the day will be empowered to form part of a military alliance without referring to the people by way of a referendum.  The ordinary people would greatly resist any attempt to do that.  They do not wish to be part of military power blocs whose main agenda is to defend the economic interests of those states, which means the economic interests of the main monopolies and the capitalist concerns that dominate states like France and Germany.</P>
    <P>I am reminded strongly of the words of a previous President of the Commission, Jacques Delors when he referred to the European States being involved in the resource wars of the 21st century.  They are chilling words when viewed against the context of what is employed in this treaty.  The desire is to bring the EU into a merger with the Western European alliance, the Western European Union, a nuclear armed military alliance but it will be opposed by a majority of our people.</P>
    <P>I do not speak as a nationalist, as someone who wants to put up barriers around the country, but as a socialist and an internationalist in the spirit James Connolly approached these issues.  I stand for a genuine union of peoples, a union of the ordinary people and a fair and free exchange between the ordinary people of the states of Europe in regard to trade, know-how and technology and between the people of European and the Third World on the basis of justice and equity, but that is not what is involved in this treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to make a statement on the Amsterdam Treaty.  On 16 and 17 June the heads of state and government of the 15 countries of the European Union drew up a new treaty for Europe.  It lays the foundation for the Europe we want to build into the 21st century.  It sets out the rules Governments will have to observe and establishes rights for all their citizens.  That is why the heads of state and government of the European Union wanted the treaty to be transparent and easy to understand.  They also wanted to produce a treaty which would respond to the European people's real concerns.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam establishes a more democratic Europe that addresses social needs.  It also makes clear progress on matters relating to the Union's foreign policy and the free movement of its citizens.  Thanks to this treaty the European Union will be more effective and more democratic and more jobs will be created.  The European Union will make its voice heard on the international stage and will guarantee its people freedom of movement while enabling the war on organised crime to be waged more effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> After 50 years of peace in Western Europe the Amsterdam Treaty addresses our concerns today. The challenges ahead are considerable, but there are also opportunities.  For the first time in 500 years we have a chance to bring together the European continent by enlarging the Union, but before enlargement takes place it is important to bestow on the European Union a fresh identity. The Treaty of Amsterdam has four main objectives: to place employment and citizens' rights at the heart of the Union; to sweep away the remaining obstacles to freedom of movement and to strengthen security; to give Europe a stronger voice in world affairs; and to make the EU's institutional structures more efficient with a view to enlarging the Union through new membership of states.</P>
    <P>The treaty is important for a variety of reasons, but particularly for its employment strategy. What is the legacy of Amsterdam?  The heads of state and Government agreed a new treaty which confirms that employment should be considered a matter of common concern.  What does this mean for the EU and its member states?  The EU has been successful in the way it has treated the economic policies of member states as a matter of common concern.  It is now in the advanced stages of doing the same with monetary policy.</P>
    <P>EU member states have benefited immensely from their interdependence in terms of trade and GDP.  At Amsterdam, member states agreed that employment policy should be treated in the same way.  In the past, member states followed their own national policies, sometimes to the detriment of another member state or the Union as a whole as far as the labour market is concerned.  When Governments follow passive labour market policies and give low priority to jobs, it affects economic and social activity beyond their own frontiers.  In taking measures to promote employment at home at the expense of jobs elsewhere, devaluing currencies, the over-enthusiastic use of State subsidy, and driving down labour standards in the hope of attracting foreign investment, EU Governments have had a negative effect on the labour markets of other member states.  Amsterdam has recognised that interdependency extends to employment.  Member states will now work together on unemployment policies at EU level as part of a common jobs strategy.</P>
    <P>In the run-up to Amsterdam the main focus among commentators was on the need to make significant progress on institutional questions &mdash;justice, home affairs and foreign and security policy.  However, this did not happen.  The real success was the employment strategy.  The jobs issue finally lived up to its long-trailed description as the major priority on the European agenda.  It was finally recognised that monetary discipline and job creation are equally crucial if we are to secure the Union's future.  They are not mutually exclusive but must be pursued in close association.</P>
    <P>We now have a well-defined and detailed title on employment in the treaty.  The European <Col N="1171" /> Council resolution on growth in employment has established a place for employment policy at the core of the economic decision-making process in the Union.  Jobs are a matter of common concern. Creating employment has been made an explicit objective of the operation of the Union.  The Council agreed in its resolution that therefore member states should give high priority to employment objectives.</P>
    <P>At an EU level, the objective of a high level of employment still has to be taken into consideration in the formulation and implementation of community policies and activities.  There is a new awareness among member states of their broadly based economic and social interdependence and this is highlighted in the treaty.  The treaty aims to promote a positive interplay between the full range of economic and social policies.  Its provisions offer us the tools to ensure the long run growth of sustainable employment development of which the European economy is capable.</P>
    <P>Two political consequences emerge from this new approach.  First, EMU can no longer be seen as an optional extra.  It is the necessary counterpart to the increasingly integrated European economy and the almost complete single market in which national economic policies lose much of their force if exercised alone.  Second, economic and monetary union alone is not enough.  There needs to be an effective and positive co-ordination of broad national policies and objectives, especially in providing the framework for high and sustainable rates of employment as well as an appropriate economic and monetary policy.</P>
    <P>To make all of this work, Europe requires a reorientation of public policies for employment. The objectives of this reorientation are ambitious and far-reaching.  We must attack Europe's high and persistent unemployment and the damage it is doing to its people and their communities.  We must also shift Europe into a higher gear as far as employment creation is concerned.  We need more jobs to put more of our people in work. Therefore, we need to equip the workforce and the enterprise community to adjust to changing market conditions, new technological developments and more diverse patterns of work. Training is the key in bridging the skills gap which exists in our community.  The more successful such policies are, the more amenable Europe's workers and companies will be to managing change, the more productivity will grow and the more room there will be for growth-orientated macro-economic policies.</P>
    <P>This progress can flow from the proper integration of employment and economic policies which the Amsterdam Treaty envisaged.  We have to adapt our employment systems to address existing problems and to position ourselves for the future.  We must move more dynamically from old to new skills.  We cannot compete in the world while offering those new skills to only 10 per cent of the unemployed while leaving the other 90 per cent languishing in delearning.  We cannot compete <Col N="1172" /> while sending 20 per cent of our young people into the labour market without recognised, marketable qualifications.  We cannot meet our productive potential with a labour market still segregated by gender and still fraught with barriers to reconciliation of work, family and lifelong learning.  These flaws in the functioning of our systems must be addressed as a matter of efficiency as well as equity.</P>
    <P>In the midst of all these complex issues to be discussed by the new Council in November, there are four main lines of action which member states must develop: entrepreneurship, employability, adaptability and equal opportunities.  Entrepreneurship means engendering a new climate and spirit to stimulate the creation of more better jobs.  Employability means tackling the skills gap by modernising education and training systems and by strengthening their links to the workplace so that all workers are equipped to take new employment opportunities.  Adaptability means the adaptability of enterprises and the workforce to respond to changing market conditions, ensuring no group is left behind and facilitating the restructuring of industries and workplaces in a way acceptable to both workers and employers. The issue of equal opportunities is dear to my heart.  It is important to modernise society so women and men can participate in work on equal terms with equal responsibilities.  We need to engage the whole workforce, women and men, if we are to realise the full productive potential of the European economy and sustain our high economic and social standards in the face of demographic change.</P>
    <P>I want the member states to set clear and measurable targets for tackling the immediate priority issues of youth unemployment, long-term unemployment and equality between men and women.  It is vital these actions are part of an integrated and comprehensive ongoing economic and social strategy.  We also need to move quickly from declarations and analysis, of which we have plenty, to the framing of a concerted and concrete action plan.  This is what the European Commission and the citizens of Europe want and what the Amsterdam Treaty envisages.</P>
    <P>The new employment provisions in the treaty give the EU the means to make low growth and persistent unemployment a thing of the past. They provide the political and operational means to address our failings of the past and represent the full intermeshing of national and EU employment policies.  As the Minister stated, the Amsterdam Treaty is a significant effort by the Union to enhance the daily lives and concerns of all its citizens and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning's statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave an overview of the Treaty of Amsterdam and its main provisions under five broad headings.  The main objectives of the Treaty are: to place the citizen at the heart of the Union; to remove as far <Col N="1173" /> as possible the remaining obstacles to freedom of movement while strengthening personal security; to give Europe a stronger voice in world affairs and to make the Union's institutional and decision-making arrangements as effective as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister' s statement outlined how each of the three &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; on which the Union's work has been based since the Maastricht Treaty will be consolidated and strengthened in the Treaty of Amsterdam &mdash; the European Communities being the first pillar; the common foreign and security policy the second pillar and co-operation in the fields of justice and home affairs the third pillar.</P>
      <P>The areas of the treaty which fall under the heading &ldquo;the Union and the citizen&rdquo; represent a significant effort by the Union to enhance its relevance to the daily lives and concerns of the citizens.  Many Deputies referred to the need to make European affairs relevant to our citizens.  I shall mention just two areas in which the Union has sought to achieve this.  While confirming that the member states bear primary responsibility for employment, the Treaty of Amsterdam makes the promotion of a high level of employment one of the major objectives of the Union.  Obviously, we cannot expect the Union to solve long-standing economic difficulties, such as unemployment, by means of treaty language alone.  The treaty establishes a framework within which member states can take concerted measures to promote employment while benefiting from community incentive measures such as studies, sharing of experience and the establishment of best practice among the member states.</P>
      <P>In the fields of environmental and consumer protection, there is now a treaty basis for taking such protection into account in all Community policies and activities.  With respect to the environment, the treaty for the first time incorporates the objective of promoting balanced and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>In his statement this morning, the Minister for Foreign Affairs set out comprehensively the way in which the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for the progressive establishment of the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice.  On the issues of freedom of movement, asylum, immigration and the incorporation of the Schengen <i>acquis</i> into the treaty, Ireland's essential concern was the preservation of the common travel area with the UK.  As the Minister stated, we are satisfied Ireland is not bound by any provision that would cut across the common travel area.  We have, however, secured the right to take part in the adoption of measures in this area to the maximum extent compatible with the maintenance of the common travel area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On reform of the common foreign and security policy, I will underline a few key points.  First, the objectives of the CFSP, enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty, are explicitly enshrined in the principles of the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act.  It is right and proper that the European Union should be pro-active in its support of these <Col N="1174" /> principles which are the basis of the international community's search for peace, security, justice and the development of friendly relations and co-operation among nations.  The provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty will enable the Union to play a more decisive role on the international stage.</P>
    <P>Second, the new Treaty is a realistic response to the challenges which the EU now faces.  The optimism which greeted the end of the Cold War has been tempered somewhat by the realisation that war and injustice do not respect diplomatic timetables and treaty negotiations.  Even during the negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty, the tide of blood and destruction was rising in the former Yugoslavia and in the Great Lakes region of Africa.  These crises questioned in a profound way the political will of the international community.  Throughout Europe, our citizens wanted to know why their Governments, the European Union and the United Nations could not stop the bloodshed, rape and destruction which was taking place in former Yugoslavia and in Central Africa.</P>
    <P>The new treaty is not only a practical response to the challenges posed following the end of the Cold War.  It is also a response to the wishes of the citizens throughout the European Union who want the EU to act, and be seen to act, in defence of democracy and human rights, and against intolerance and injustice.  I am sure every Member of the House will recall the sense of frustration and helplessness we all felt as the former Yugoslavia slid into war and Central Africa into genocide.  The EU must have a central and courageous role to play in international affairs.</P>
    <P>It is against the background of these experiences that EU governments agreed to the reforms set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam.  A major practical achievement is the inclusion of the Petersberg Tasks within the scope of the CFSP. One of the inescapable lessons of the post Cold War years has been that emerging conflicts and crises have been complex and multi-dimensional, requiring multi-faceted responses in the areas of, for example, election monitoring, humanitarian assistance, civil policing, economic assistance, human rights monitoring, assistance to re-establish civil society as well as military tasks of peacekeeping and peace support.  Some, or all, of these elements must be combined if the international community is to prevent specific crises from occurring or in managing those crises successfully when they occur.</P>
    <P>The European Union has, at its disposal, diplomatic, humanitarian, economic and political instruments.  The inclusion of the Petersberg Tasks should enable the European Union to play an enhanced, more coherent and effective role in international relations in support of international peace and security.</P>
    <P>The reforms in the Treaty of Amsterdam are fully consistent, and do not conflict with the objectives and principles which have always inspired Irish foreign policy.  We want the EU to maximise its contribution to international peace and security, respect for human rights, the pursuit <Col N="1175" /> of justice in international affairs, including the development needs of the third world; I have a ministerial interest in development co-operation. Ireland, through its participation in the development of a more effective and coherent CFSP, can pursue and promote the kind of foreign policy which has the broad support of this House and the significant, democratic support of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The functional reforms of the CFSP are positive and pose no threat to Irish interests.  The introduction of some qualified majority voting in the CFSP area does not mean Ireland will be forced to support policies with which it does not agree.  The treaty contains adequate safeguards to prevent a member state being outvoted on a sensitive foreign policy issue.  A key provision allows any member state to oppose the adoption of a decision by qualified majority for important and stated reasons of national policy.  This is referred to as &ldquo;an emergency brake&rdquo;.  In addition, there is provision for a procedure known as &ldquo;constructive abstention&rdquo; where, in relation to decisions requiring unanimity, a member state can opt to abstain while allowing other partners to proceed with a particular course of action.  As regards the sensitive area of defence or military implications &mdash; an issue raised by many Deputies &mdash; decisions remain subject to unanimity.</P>
    <P>Discussion of military neutrality in this House sometimes generates more heat than light. Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unaffected by the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty.  As was the case in the Maastricht Treaty, the Amsterdam Treaty acknowledges &ldquo;the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states&rdquo;.  This reference takes account of Ireland's position as a neutral nonmember of military alliances.  The new treaty does not provide for the integration of the Western European Union into the EU, nor is such integration stated anywhere in the treaty as an objective.  Development of closer relations and practical co-operation between the EU and the Western European Union is provided for.  This is natural and, indeed, necessary in view of the inclusion in the treaty of the Petersberg Tasks.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged by the tone of today's statements.  Far from posing a threat to Irish neutrality the Amsterdam Treaty will enhance the EU's ability to respond to the new and emerging challenges.  It will also enable Ireland to continue to play a full and active role with our EU partners, building on our long tradition of commitment to and achievements in UN peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>The treaty's protocol on the institutions with the prospect of enlargement of the European Union is highly satisfactory from Ireland's perspective.  Maintaining the right of each member state to nominate a full member of the Commission was, and will continue to be, a priority for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the European Council in Amsterdam was unable to reach agreement on <Col N="1176" /> the institutional arrangements which would apply when the Union exceeds 20 member states. This question was left to a future intergovernmental conference, to take place at least one year before the Union will exceed 20 member states. That Intergovernmental Conference will conduct a &ldquo;comprehensive review of the provisions of the treaties on the composition and functioning of the institutions&rdquo;.  The outcome of the Amsterdam Treaty in this area enables the Union to embark now on the enlargement process on a basis which respects the concerns of all member states.</P>
    <P>In the perspective of future enlargement, institutional review must continue to balance the need for more efficient and effective decision-making with the need to preserve the broad balance within and between the Union's institutions, while ensuring that those institutions are visibly democratic.  In this connection, Ireland could have accepted a greater degree of extension of qualified majority voting in the Council than was finally agreed at Amsterdam.  We did not, however, favour the inclusion of fiscal policy among the areas to which qualified majority voting would be applied and we were pleased that this position was accepted in the treaty.</P>
    <P>The previous Government attached importance to keeping the public and the Oireachtas informed about the negotiations leading to the Treaty of Amsterdam.  During the Irish Presidency, there were regular press briefings at European level on developments at the Intergovernmental Conference and every effort was made to ensure the transparency and openness of the process.  The Oireachtas was kept informed via statements to the Dáil, replies to parliamentary questions and briefings to the European Affairs and Foreign Affairs committees.  Copies of Intergovernmental Conference documents were lodged in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs commented this morning on the need for basic information on the content of the new treaty.  Today's statements, following the presentations on the treaty made by the Taoiseach and the former Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House on 10 July, are part of our efforts to address that need.  Copies of the Treaty of Amsterdam as signed on 2 October have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.  A link to the text of the treaty is being added to the Department of Foreign Affairs web site on the Internet.  Bound copies of the treaty will be published by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities and will be available within a matter of weeks from the Government Publications Office on Molesworth Street.  I understand that a special issue of the Official Journal of the European Communities containing the Amsterdam Treaty and the compilation of the texts of the consolidated treaties will be published in English and Irish in early November.  A White Paper on the treaty is at an advanced stage of preparation in the Department of Foreign Affairs and is expected to be published in a matter of <Col N="1177" /> weeks.  The White Paper will be an important means of informing the public of the provisions of the treaty and their implications.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam is subject to national ratification procedures in all member states.  To date Ireland, Denmark and Portugal are the only member states which have indicated that they will hold national referenda prior to ratification. Denmark announced last week that its referendum will be held on 28 May 1998.  I am aware that Deputies have a keen interest in the timing of our own referendum.  The position is that the Government has yet to take a decision on the exact date.  Interested parties have already noted that the Taoiseach, last week in Dáil Éireann, expressed the hope that the referendum would take place in March.</P>
    <P>The nub of the Supreme Court judgments in the McKenna and Hanafin cases is that, arising from the constitutional imperative of equality in the political process, the Government cannot run from public funds a campaign which advocates a specific outcome in an electoral contest.  At the same time, the Supreme Court judgments acknowledge the right and even the duty of Government to ensure that the public is aware of any proposal to amend the Constitution, of its meaning and of the Government's intentions in relation to the proposed change.</P>
    <P>The House may rest assured that, in so far as preparations for the referendum relating to the Treaty of Amsterdam are concerned, they will be made in the light of legal advice and taking into account the significant implications of the relevant Supreme Court judgments.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised when the Treaty of Amsterdam will be brought before the House for approval.  Approval of the terms of the treaty as required by Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution is expected to be one of the steps which will have to be completed before Ireland can ratify the treaty.  What is clear is that the Oireachtas will have to legislate to hold a referendum.  Assuming the referendum is carried, it will have to again legislate prior to ratification to amend the European Communities Acts.  The timing of all the necessary steps will have to be considered and decided by the Government.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the importance of economic and monetary union and employment.  The Government believes that EMU will come on time and that Ireland will be a member at the outset.  The Taoiseach has identified the successful transition to EMU as a key challenge facing the Government.  Decisive steps on the road to EMU were taken at the European Council in Amsterdam.  Those steps include the agreement on detailed legislation to give effect to the stability and growth pact; adoption of a resolution on growth and employment &mdash; this resolution, with the new title on employment in the Treaty of Amsterdam, is evidence of the firm commitment to place employment at the top of the political agenda throughout the Union; adoption <Col N="1178" /> of a resolution which lays down the principles and fundamental elements of ERM II.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that Ireland is a strong supporter of action on unemployment at European level.  It is essential that the special meeting of the European Council in Luxembourg next month seeks to produce concrete results to tackle very serious unemployment throughout the European Union.  We are encouraged by the intensive ongoing preparations by the Presidency and the Commission.</P>
    <P>References were also made today to the question of the future enlargement of the Union.  One of the key objectives of the treaty review exercise which produced the treaty was to allow the Union to turn its attention to the major challenges which lie ahead.  It is of huge importance to the Union and the member states, including Ireland, that these be successfully addressed, and that is Agenda 2000, the future enlargement of the Union and the financing priorities over the period 2000 to 2006.  These issues are now being intensively addressed by the Union following the presentation by the Commission of its Agenda 2000 package in July.</P>
    <P>Ireland is committed to the process of further enlargement which is in the interests of the European Union as a whole.  In these enlargement negotiations we will, like every other member state, seek to protect and promote our interests and ensure that the consequences of enlargement apply in a balanced way to those existing member states.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Union's financial framework post-1999 and the Structural and Cohesion Funds, which are of compelling interest to most people in the House and the general public, the House will be aware that what is involved at this stage are Commission proposals.  It will be at a much later stage, after lengthy negotiations in the Council with key decisions to be taken at the level of the European Council, that the present proposals will be translated into the precise level of funding for each member state.  As far as Structural and Cohesion Funds are concerned, the Government's aim will be to ensure the best possible outcome for Ireland and the maximisation of receipts in the next funding round.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me a further opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I first raised it a number of months ago following the shock announcement that Asahi was to close at the end of November with the loss of 315 jobs in an area that is regarded as an employment blackspot.  In recent weeks there have been a number of job announcements; 350 jobs are to be created in Dublin and 150 in Cork.  It is good that the economy is booming and that the rate of job creation is at an all-time high but there have been no job announcements in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>Following the announcement that Asahi was to close its plant in Killala the Tánaiste visited the county and informed us that the north Mayo region would be given top priority so far as job creation was concerned.  She acted extremely swiftly and established the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative comprising many local bodies as well as the IDA.  It has made many efforts to attract a replacement industry.  It stated in a press release issued in September that it was trying to secure a project for the advance factory in Bunree in Ballina and that an attractive package of support was being put in place by the IDA to increase the attractiveness of this location.  That was a welcome development but there has been no good news to date.  Will the IDA be successful in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> The North Mayo Enterprise Initiative has informed us that the Asahi plant and site are available and that a brochure is being prepared to attract a replacement industry.  Is there information available on this?  Many of Asahi's employees are beginning to panic because there is no prospect of alternative employment in north Mayo.  They have written to me as their public representative seeking answers.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of infrastructure in north Mayo. This is a major problem.  Is there a commitment to carry out improvements to make it easier to attract industry to the region?  The road to Ballina is in a disgraceful condition.  Water and sewerage schemes are also required.</P>
    <P>There is a view that the spinning plant in the Asahi complex is a viable option.  I wrote to the Tánaiste and the Minister of State at her Department, Deputy Tom Kitt, asking if the IDA and the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative would examine this possibility.  I was informed that the matter was under consideration.  What is the current position?  Has this option been ruled out?</P>
    <P>What the people of County Mayo need are answers and, more importantly, jobs.  Any positive indications would be welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste, who is unable to be present, has asked me to respond on her behalf.</P>
      <P>Following the decision by the Asahi Chemical Industry Company of Japan to close its synthetic fibre and spinning operations in Killala the Tánaiste immediately announced the establishment of North Mayo Enterprise Initiative.  She attended its inaugural meeting on 14 July.  In the three months since its establishment, it has been active.  It has met on five occasions and established two subcommittees which are examining ways and means of addressing the urgent employment needs of north Mayo.  The Tánaiste expects to receive an interim report from the chairman around the end of this month.</P>
      <P>The task of the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative is to explore what options remain to secure the future of the Killala plants as synthetic fibre manufacturing operations; to ensure maximum endeavours are made to market north Mayo for foreign direct investment and actively encourage indigenous business opportunities; to assist employees with training and retraining opportunities, and to assist employees who wish to pursue entrepreneurial ventures in their own right.</P>
      <P>The North Mayo Enterprise Initiative recently issued a press release detailing its work to date. It has taken the following specific measures: it is working closely with IDA Ireland to encourage site visits into the north Mayo area.  The IDA has had discussions with companies involved in the synthetic fibre business, some of which have visited Killala.  Further site visits are planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is being made by the IDA to secure a project for the advance factory in Bunree in Ballina.  Site visits to this location have also taken place.  An attractive package of support is <Col N="1181" /> being put in place by the IDA to increase the attractiveness of this location.</P>
    <P>Now that the Asahi plant and site are available the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative is preparing to publish an up to date marketing brochure setting out the benefits of investing in north Mayo and to highlight the attractiveness of the area. The brochure will incorporate the various incentives available for investment in the area.</P>
    <P>In association with SIPTU, the trade union representing the workforce, the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative is seeking to identify areas where the workforce of Asahi can be assisted either with career change training, retraining, job searching or setting up their own enterprise.  The resources of FÁS, the county enterprise board and the regional technical colleges in Castlebar and Sligo are assisting in this programme.  With the co-operation of Forbairt and Moy Valley Resources, the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative is examining the need and suitability of establishing an enterprise centre in Killala and Ballina.</P>
    <P>When the Tánaiste established the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative she emphasised that it would liaise closely with public representatives and local interests to ensure every opportunity is exploited to maximum advantage.  To this end the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative has opened a public office in the offices of Ballina UDC and invited submissions from interested parties &mdash; individuals, community groups, businesses or business organisations &mdash; who wish to offer assistance.</P>
    <P>The Government urges all those who consider they have a contribution to make to the work of North Mayo Enterprise Initiative to take up this invitation and make direct contact with it.  The members of North Mayo Enterprise Initiative have committed a great deal of time and effort to their task to date for which I express my appreciation and that of the Government.</P>
    <P>Since the establishment of North Mayo Enterprise Initiative there have been some positive results in employment creation in the north Mayo area.  It was announced on 5 October that Carrokeel Seafoods Limited is to expand its manufacturing operations.  The Forbairt backed investment of £2.3 million will create an additional 85 jobs in Killala.  Another positive development is the proposal by Hydro Energi, a subsidiary of Norsk Hydro, to establish a smokeless fuel manufacturing facility in Bunnahowen, west of Ballina.  While I am not in a position to give details of this until the company has finalised its plans, I understand a number of people are employed in the construction phase.  Others were given seasonal employment during the summer. These new developments are welcome news for all those working to create employment in the area.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that there is a spirit of co-operation between the workers in Asahi and the company.  I understand there has been general acceptance by the workforce of the generous redundancy terms offered by Asahi.  The positive industrial relations climate can only enhance the <Col N="1182" /> prospects of attracting replacement industry.  I compliment the Asahi management and the workforce in this regard.</P>
    <P>I will take up the issues raised by the Deputy, including the need for improved infrastructure in the Ballina area, with the relevant Ministers and ask them to reply to her directly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In this morning's newspapers there were widespread reports of an inquest held yesterday into the circumstances of the death of Mr. Gordon Hearty.  Before referring to that inquest I should like to convey my condolences to his family on the very sad loss they suffered.</P>
      <P>Mr. Hearty was a young man of 24, riding a motorcycle, who was seriously injured in a road traffic accident and was brought by ambulance to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.</P>
      <P>The newspapers have reported that he suffered from haemophilia and from hepatitis A and hepatitis C. Statements were made by a doctor attached to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital at the inquest indicating that plasma required to treat Mr. Hearty as a haemophiliac was not available in the hospital.  It was reported that frozen plasma was subsequently obtained from the Blood Transfusion Board which could not be used.</P>
      <P>Mr. Owen Hearty, Gordon's father, is reported in today's papers &mdash; and I heard him speak on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;&mdash; as saying that if plasma in powder form had been available he believed his son's life could have been saved.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to address the issues reported in this morning's papers and to inform the House, on the basis of the inquiries he has had an opportunity of making, whether those reports are accurate.</P>
      <P>It is very important that people who suffer from haemophilia feel confident that, if and when involved in an accident, blood products are available in our hospitals to provide the treatment they require on admission.  I have had a great deal of feed-back today from members of the general public who expressed concern to me, as my party spokesman on health, about these reports.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to examine these and, if necessary, to hold an inquiry into the circumstances of the death of Gordon Hearty in addition to the role of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda and of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If reports in today's newspapers are inaccurate, if the inquest was given wrong information by a doctor who treated Mr. Hearty on admission to the hospital, that is something the Minister should also inquire into.  It was quite clear having listened to the radio this morning that Mr. Hearty's father is a very sincere, distressed man who expressed his concern with great dignity in the very difficult, trying and distressing circumstances in which he found himself.  He did not go overboard in making accusations but, in a very simple way, expressed the view that, arising out of the <Col N="1183" /> inquest, it appeared his son's life could have been saved if plasma had been available.</P>
    <P>If today's newspaper reports are not accurate, the Minister must inquire why the hospital did not make comprehensive, accurate information available to the inquest.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will examine this matter in detail for the sake of the family of the late Mr. Gordon Hearty and in the interests of the wider community to assure them that our hospitals have available &mdash; in their Accident and Emergency Departments and for the purposes of emergency surgery &mdash; any blood product that may be required to save the lives of those who suffer injury.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for raising this matter.  I too would like to convey my sincere condolences to the family of the late Mr. Gordon Hearty who suffered a deeply sad loss and to say my thoughts are with them at this time.</P>
      <P>It is important to clarify the questions raised resulting from this morning's reports of the case in the media.  My Department has made inquiries about the matter and, contrary to certain reports, I understand the hospital in question &mdash; Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda &mdash; had a supply of plasma available on the day in question and used it in the treatment of the late Mr. Hearty.  I also understand that the principal blood product required for Mr. Hearty's treatment was the clotting agent known as &ldquo;Factor 8&rdquo;, supplies of which the hospital also had available.</P>
      <P>I am informed that Mr. Hearty was treated with Factor 8 from the hospital's existing stocks and that the hospital ordered a further 60 vials from the Blood Transfusion Service Board at 4.30 p.m. on the day in question which were dispatched by taxi at 4.35 p.m. No request for frozen plasma was received by the Blood Transfusion Service Board from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, on the day in question.</P>
      <P>The point that must be emphasised is that Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, had supplies of both Factor 8 and plasma available to it on the day of Mr. Hearty's accident and that both products were used in his treatment.</P>
      <P>The North Eastern Health Board assumed responsibility for the hospital at the end of May l997 and was not responsible for the operation of the hospital at the time of the late Mr. Hearty's accident on 24 March 1997.  The board has now begun a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death, on completion of which, a detailed clinical report will be forwarded to the chief medical officer of my Department.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that it is already standard practice for acute hospitals to stock Factor 8 and other blood products for use in emergencies.  The medical director of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, would be happy to meet Mr. Hearty's family to further discuss the facts of the case with them personally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> Once again, I offer my sincere condolences to his family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter refers to circumstances surrounding the return to this country of a constituent of mine, born in Canada, who has lived here from the age of two years.  She is married and has been living here at a permanent address for many years, she holidayed occasionally outside this State.</P>
      <P>On her return here on 13 September last &mdash;when she and her husband arrived at Shannon Airport &mdash; when it was discovered she held a Canadian passport, which I understand she is entitled to hold in addition to an Irish one, she was informed that she had three months to get her documentation in order and was given a stay of three months or, alternatively, must leave the country.</P>
      <P>I bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for the reason that I do not think it possible for our immigration authorities to know anybody and everybody entering our various ports; I fully accept that and the pressures under which they operate.  Nonetheless, I wonder whether they have been given any special orders or terms of reference within which they must operate.  I should have thought that a very simple investigation would have brought to the attention of all and sundry that this woman was as much entitled to be in this country as anyone else.  If changes have been implemented, of which the public has not been made aware, they should be made aware at the earliest possible date to avoid the confusion, annoyance and upset caused in her case.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister's office on the fact that one of his departmental officials contacted my office within the past couple of days, in dramatic contrast to the reply to my original parliamentary question of 1 October which did not elicit a reply of that nature and which led to my raising this matter on the Adjournment.  That official was quite helpful, explaining in so far as he could the circumstances that arose and has probably contacted my constituent as a result.  I hope by now my constituent has been contacted and that any misunderstanding has been ironed out.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, if changes have taken place in relation to the manner in which people of that category are dealt with on re-entering this State&mdash; I reiterate that this woman entered and reentered this country on countless occasions over the past 20 years &mdash; the public must be made aware of them so that others, such as my constituent, are not meted the same treatment.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this matter.  Before he tabled his parliamentary question, now the subject matter of this Adjournment Debate, neither I nor the Department <Col N="1185" /> of Justice, Equality and Law Reform had any knowledge of it.</P>
      <P>An official of the Immigration and Citizenship Division of the Department has contacted the person involved, explained the position fully and to her satisfaction and has offered to assist her in taking steps to avoid this difficulty in future.</P>
      <P>The person in question, who appears to be a citizen of both Ireland and Canada, only has a Canadian passport.  When making her recent journey she did not have time to gather all the documentation necessary to support her application for an Irish passport.  This documentation would include her long form Canadian birth certificate as well as the birth certificates of one or both parents.</P>
      <P>On her return from her trip to Canada, she presented her Canadian passport.  The immigration officer had no option but to treat her as a Canadian citizen only in the absence of documentary evidence that she was also an Irish citizen.  This difficulty will not arise again for her if she either obtains an Irish passport or adopts the course of action suggested to her by the Department official.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, on his recent appointment.  The general view is that it was an appointment well made.</P>
      <P>There is need to construct four classrooms as well as additional toilets, a cloakroom and a store room in Pallaskenry national school, County Limerick.  As a proposal has been with the Department for the past 18 months, this issue must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Currently 70 pupils are catered for in two classrooms situated in a totally unsuitable 20 year old prefabricated building.  A remedial teacher also works in the building.  It has been used as a school for 11 years and was in service for eight years prior to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone accepts that prefabricated buildings are unsuitable.  It is unacceptable to allow school children use such facilities.  Teachers cannot do their work properly because of the conditions in which they work.  The building is in an extremely bad state of repair.  While some moneys were provided for work last year it was merely a holding operation which did not improve the situation.  I visited the school last year and my foot went through the floor.  The external walls of the building are rotting and there is dry rot in the floors of the classrooms.  The building is cold in winter and warm in summer.  In warm weather classes are obliged to move outdoors because of the intense heat.  There is no insulation nor is there a toilet attached to the building.  Children are obliged to cross the main school yard to reach the toilet which creates enormous difficulties during wet weather.  Pupils must cross from the permanent structure to the prefabricated classrooms <Col N="1186" /> under similar conditions to receive remedial teaching.  The Minister will agree this is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The school has a current staffing level of a principal and seven assistant teachers, one of whom is a shared remedial teacher.  The school has an enrolment figure of 194.  The accommodation in the school consists of five permanent classrooms and three prefabricated structure classrooms.</P>
    <P>The board of management wrote to the Department seeking approval for the replacement of the prefabricated rooms and the planning section of the Department undertook a full review of enrolment trends at the school.  Following that review, it was considered that the school's medium to long-term accommodation requirement was six permanent classrooms, a general purpose room and ancillary accommodation.  In August 1996 the Department advised the school's board of management that it considered the provision of an additional classroom, a general purpose room and ancillary accommodation would satisfy the accommodation needs of the school.</P>
    <P>Pallaskenry is a growing town.  It is a satellite of Limerick city and the student population has expanded in the past 20 years, and will continue to expand.  The population has quadrupled in that period.  Council housing estates have been built and building developments have been initiated by Aughinish Alumina as well as private developments.  It is an attractive area and there is a great demand for sites.  More families will move to this area.</P>
    <P>The current position is totally unsatisfactory and we should pay tribute to the teachers who are working under such conditions and the tolerance of the parents.  Demonstrations take place outside this House from time to time and we should respond favourably to the parents in Pallaskenry who are protesting as effectively as they can without doing so publicly.  I understand procedures are necessary and various stages must be gone through but I ask the Minister of State to move this process forward quickly.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed last week to obtain notice of a reply to a question to the effect that £20,000 was spent to repair prefabricated classrooms and that this should satisfy the parents.  When we discussed this matter with the Department in Tullamore it was made clear that the acceptance of the £20,000 would not interfere in any way with building the new classrooms required.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the Department's current position regarding Pallaskenry national school, County Limerick.  I sincerely congratulate the Deputy on his election to the House, I hope he has many happy years here and I thank him sincerely for his warm words of congratulation on my recent appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pallaskenry national school has a current staffing level of a principal and seven assistant <Col N="1187" /> teachers, one of whom is a shared remedial teacher, and an enrolment of 194.  The accommodation at the school consists of five permanent classrooms and a three classroom prefabricated structure.</P>
    <P>The board of management of the school wrote to our Department seeking approval for the replacement of three prefabricated classrooms.  A full review of enrolment trends at the school was undertaken by the Department's planning section.  Following this review it was considered the school's medium to long-term accommodation requirements were six permanent classrooms, a general purpose room and ancillary accommodation.</P>
    <P>In August 1996 the Department advised the school's board of management it considered the provision of an additional classroom, a general purpose facility and ancillary accommodation would satisfy the accommodation needs of the school.  The school was further advised that it was <Col N="1188" /> not possible to indicate when the project would proceed due to the level of contractual commitments.  The Department sanctioned grant aid of £17,000 to carry out repairs to the existing prefabricated accommodation.  I understand this work was completed recently.  In light of this there are no immediate proposals to replace the existing prefabricated accommodation with permanent classrooms.  The matter will be considered in the context of future capital allocations.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the proposed extension was fully explained to the school at a meeting with officials on 5 November 1996.  The Deputy can be assured of my desire to see further improvements in conditions at the school and I thank him again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the position.  I will make the Department aware of his comments and have the matter further investigated.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 21 October 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 9 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The skills group, which was established by Forfás, identified skills needs in the areas of software engineering, engineering technicians and teleservices up to the end of the century.</P>
      <P>In response to these identified needs, a steering committee, chaired by the chairman of the Higher Education Authority, was asked to identify the most cost effective way of providing the additional software and technician graduates.  On receipt of the steering committee's report, I obtained Government approval for an immediate additional £5 million capital investment to fund an expansion in places on these high-technology courses in the 1997-98 academic year.  No financial provision has previously been earmarked to meet these critical needs.  The question of additional financial investment is under consideration in the context of the 1998 estimates.  An additional 650 places in software engineering and 500 places in engineering technician programmes have been approved for the 1997-98 academic year.</P>
      <P>I have also established a joint education/industry task force to improve the supply of technicians for the high technology sector. Arising from the work of the task force I have already announced the setting up of a new industry-college initiative to jointly recruit and educate and train technicians.  The objective is that over 150 students will commence new courses in January 1998.  These students will be recruited on a joint basis by institutions in the third level technological sector and by industry.  The courses will involve structured work placement.  Students undertaking these courses are expected to enter the workforce about 18 months after the courses begin.</P>
      <P>In the teleservices area, I have introduced a national initiative to provide training to meet the skill needs of the international teleservices industry; 690 training places have been allocated in 20 PLC colleges throughout the country which will offer full-time two year post leaving certificate courses in international teleservices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of our education system is crucial to the economic development of our country both <Col N="1190" /> in terms of our ability to attract inward investment and in the development of our indigenous enterprises.  The availability of a highly educated workforce is of critical importance in this regard. One of my priorities is to ensure that our third level education system responds to the specific needs of the economy and the specific measures which I have outlined are concrete evidence of my commitment to this priority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 28, 34 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland at present lags significantly behind its European partners in the integration of information and communications technologies (ICTs) into first and second-level schools.  It will be a major national challenge to meet the need to integrate technology into teaching and learning right across the curriculum.  It is vital, in the interests of our future national welfare, that we succeed.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be publishing a comprehensive policy framework document on ICTs in education reflecting the Government's commitment in the <i>Action Programme for a New Millennium</i> to achieving computer literacy throughout the school system.  I will also be announcing a very substantial Government investment to underpin the implementation of the programme.  This investment will target action on the following key areas:</P>
      <P>&mdash; Classroom resources and equipment infrastructure;</P>
      <P>&mdash; teacher skills development and support; and</P>
      <P>&mdash; policy development and research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> I am determined that the national programme will be an integrated one, with the installation of equipment in schools being closely linked to actions on curriculum development, teacher training and the provision of support services. The ICT training needs of teachers will be addressed, with training being delivered to one-third or more of all teachers.  Internet usage will be one element of a comprehensive training initiative.</P>
    <P>The national programme will substantially increase the number of multimedia computer systems in our schools.  I will be publishing details of the Government's equipment targets in the policy framework document.  A partnership approach will be fundamental to the programme and I expect to be able to meet, and possibly exceed, our equipment targets with the support of public and private sector partners.  Telecom Éireann, for example, has already announced that it will be making a significant contribution in this regard.</P>
    <P>Appropriate organisation structures are being put in place to implement the action programme on ICTs.  I have already established an educational ICTs co-ordination unit within my Department which is acting as the focal point for my Department's involvement in educational ICT issues.  I am also establishing a national centre for technology in education (NCTE) at Dublin City University which will carry forward the implementation of the national programme in all 4,000 schools in the State and provide policy advice to my Department.  In implementing the national programme, the NCTE will develop a database which will include information on ICT capacity and utilisation in all first and second-level schools.</P>

      <P>I would be seriously concerned if any child, who has been properly assessed as requiring placement in a special school, is being unreasonably denied access to such a facility.</P>
      <P>It is undoubtedly the case that instances arise where placement in a special school cannot be arranged as expeditiously as one would wish. These difficulties can arise for a variety of reasons.  In some cases, it may be necessary to adjust the composition of existing classes or to establish an additional class to accommodate extra pupils.  In other cases, the particular special needs presented by a child may require the deployment of additional special support measures.  There may also be need for a co-ordinated response involving both educational and health care inputs.</P>
      <P>In any situation like this, my Department makes every effort to ensure that the necessary arrangements are made as speedily as possible. Where necessary, my Department also seeks to arrange interim support measures pending final placement.</P>
      <P>Children are referred for admission to special schools and special classes on the basis of psychological and other relevant assessments.  Placement in a special school or special class can only take place on the basis of such assessments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that present assessment procedures, coupled with the large and increasing range of special responses now being provided, <Col N="1193" /> will ensure that children requiring placement in a special facility will have access to such facility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The payments of fees at third level involves a wide range of issues and must be seen in terms of all levels of study in the sector.</P>
      <P>It is not true that fees have been abolished at third level as they were left in place across a wide range of courses including post-graduate, evening and part-time study.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there continues to be a significant debate on the effect of the removal of tuition fees for full-time undergraduate study.  While it does restrict the ability of the Government to concentrate resources on helping students from disadvantaged backgrounds to gain access to third level, I recognise that middleincome earners lay particular store on the absence of tuition fees.  Moreover, in the light of available resources I can see little scope for extending this concession.</P>
      <P>Whatever about these points, Deputies should realise that the most important debates in third level involve other areas and we should not be distracted from concentrating on them.  To this end, I achieved Government sanction to expand the number of places made available this year to the highest in our history and created 1,850 places in third level and PLC courses in areas of particular skills needs.</P>
      <P>The entire third level sector has been underresourced and I am particularly conscious of the need to deal with the existing and future capital requirements of the sector.</P>
      <P>The Government's agenda is a comprehensive one to maximise the resources available for third level, to increase the opportunities to avail of third level education and to meet the development needs of our society and economy.  I am confident that we will deliver on this.</P>

      <P>Some delays have occurred in processing pension entitlements under the early retirement scheme which the Deputy will be aware is in the first year of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important to ensure that teachers are given full credit for all pensionable service.  The verification of this service is quite a complex process, particularly in the case of second level teachers, where membership of the superannu ation scheme has been voluntary.  In many <Col N="1194" /> instances, teaching service extends over a long number of years and may relate to a number of different schools.</P>
    <P>Where delays have occurred my Department has issued payment on account of monthly pensions to individual teachers.  This payment on account approximates closely to the actual monthly rate of pension.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that all primary teachers who accepted offers of early retirement have received lump sum payments and will be in receipt of regular monthly pension payments from the end of October.  Second level teachers paid directly by my Department have received payments on account of pension and all will have received their lump sum payments by 31 October.  Following this they receive monthly pension payments.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that attrition rates in the technological sector are a matter of concern.  This problem is a matter in the first instance for the individual colleges and the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives have been taken by the colleges and the NCEA in relation to the monitoring of uncertified departures:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> A system has been developed for a statistical monitoring of uncertified departures from certificate and diploma programmes and has been applied on a pilot basis in some colleges.</P>
    <P>Other studies, in both individual colleges and in groups of colleges, have also been carried out with a view to developing actions to minimise uncertified departures.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive study on the guidance services in regional technical colleges was carried out with assistance from the National Centre for Guidance in Education.</P>
    <P>A further study began in October 1996 aimed at providing a comprehensive examination of the reasons underlying uncertified departures.  The study covers the 1996-97 session and encompasses background research, case studies, surveys and questionnaires.</P>
    <P>In December 1996, the NCEA initiated a study into admission requirements, academic standards for transfer from national certificate to national diploma to degree and into attrition rates within courses in NCEA designated institutions. An interim report from the study was presented to the council's academic committee last April.  I understand, however, that presentation of the final report has been deferred in order to take account of other ongoing studies on attrition rates with a view to providing a more comprehensive analysis of the problem.</P>
    <P>In July I established a joint industry-education task force to identify a range of proposals and measures to develop the demand and enrolment process and throughput of successful students on relevant certificate and diploma programmes of study.  The findings of this group will be of assistance in developing strategies to improve retention rates generally.</P>
    <P>As a first step, I have already announced an initiative whereby industry and colleges will jointly recruit, educate and train technicians.  The courses will involve structured work-placement. As applicants will have a clear understanding of their future role in industry, I am confident that the majority of the participating students will complete their courses successfully.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 18 and 97 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training was introduced in <Col N="1196" /> October 1994 on a pilot basis and has since been extended to a large number of other schools of nursing in association with local higher education institutions.  The programme is fully funded by the Department of Health, at a cost of some £13 million in 1997.  Accordingly, the question of student fees does not arise.  Similarly, as the student nurses receive an annual maintenance grant under the programme, their entitlement under the higher education grants scheme does not arise.  Successful completion of the three year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware the National University of Ireland, Galway, is proposing to offer from January 1998 a one year degree programme on a full-time basis.  The background to this issue is that the Department of Health has been engaged in consultations with a number of third level institutions in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes which would be open both to nurses who complete the new education and training programme and to nurses who qualified under the traditional model of education and training.  The purpose of these programmes is to provide those members of the nursing profession who wish to obtain a postregistration qualification at degree level with an opportunity to do so by means of a one year part-time programme.  The first such programme was offered by Dublin City University earlier this year and I understand that Trinity College, Dublin, proposes to offer a similar part-time programme from February 1998.  As these are part-time programmes, the nurses involved are entitled to claim tax relief on their course fees.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Higher Education Authority has discussed the proposed course with the National University of Ireland, Galway, and has asked the university to align its proposal with the approach adopted in the other colleges.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that we will make special provision for one teacher schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, there are 103 one teacher schools with ten or more pupils each.  A further 24 schools <Col N="1197" /> were due to become one teacher schools from 1 September 1997.  Following my appointment as Minister for Education, I made special arrangements to ensure that these 24 schools would retain their two teacher status for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
    <P>I am currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments to all one teacher schools with ten or more pupils.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive programme of in-career development on the implementation of the new leaving certificate syllabus has been put in place. This has included cluster meetings of music teachers and music technology courses in nine venues in the west.

      <P>Consultants were appointed in July 1996 to make recommendations on the future reorganisation of the Department of Education and to suggest administrative structures for the education boards which had been proposed by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as the Deputy will be aware, after my appointment I announced that I would not be proceeding with the establishment of the education <Col N="1201" /> boards.  In any event the work of the consultants to date has focused on the organisation and structures in the Department and this work will not be completed for some time.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends to review the conditions of third-level grants to eliminate anomalies, for example, the case of a person who has completed first year study in a regional college is barred from getting fees for first year in university in the same faculty, whereas, the reverse situation of doing first year in university does not debar a person getting fees for first year in the regional college.</Quest>

      <P>The situation referred to by the Deputy arises from the different criteria applied to entitlements under the free fees initiative on the one hand and the ESF-aided middle level technician and higher technical/business skills programmes on the other.</P>
      <P>The ESF-aided middle level technician programme consists of one or two courses up to national certificate level and the higher technical/business skills programme consists of three year national diploma and one year &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; diploma level courses.  The programmes apply to those who require higher level initial education and training to enhance their employment prospects.  In general, free tuition is granted for the approved duration of one ESF-aided course only.  However, subject to a maximum duration of four years in all trainees who having, passed, failed or not completed the first year of a course are allowed to transfer to a different course and receive a grant for the normal duration of the new course.  Trainees who have completed not more than the first year of a degree level course are eligible to receive free tuition for a maximum of three years on an ESF-aided MLT/HTBS course.  These regulations governing the payment of tuition fees for ESF-aided MLT and HTBS courses form part of the Operational Programme for Human Resources and are part of the Community Support Framework 1994-99.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to the free fees initiative, is that tuition fees are payable in respect of students attending full-time undergraduate courses, other than ESF-aided courses, which are other than exceptionally, of at least two years duration.  In practice, other than in certain arts and science courses, the duration of undergraduate courses covered by the initiative is four years.  Indeed, in some cases the courses may be of five and six years duration.  Free fees are not <Col N="1202" /> payable in respect of students repeating a year or repeating at the same year level except in the case of second chance students who return to college after a break of five years and students who due to exceptional circumstances, such as certified serious illness, did not complete their course year.</P>
    <P>If the regulations applying to the ESF-aided courses were to be applied to the free fees initiative, students who complete the first year of an ESF-aided course and then pursue a four year degree course, would receive free fees only for the first three years of the degree course.  Under the criteria applying to the free fees initiative, such students would not receive funding for the first year of their degree course but would receive funding for the remaining three years of the course.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I do not propose to amend the criteria for the free fees initiative. However, I will keep this matter under review.</P>

      <P>Assistance from the EU Structural Funds for the period 1994-99 is provided to my Department in respect of specific measures in support of the human resources development priorities identified in the Community Support Framework 1994-1999.  These measures are implemented nationally across the first, second and third levels of education through schools, vocational education committees, regional technical colleges &mdash; regional technical colleges &mdash; the Dublin Institute of Technology &mdash; Dublin Institute of Technology &mdash; the Waterford Institute of Technology &mdash; WIT &mdash; and the universities and include support for curricular reform in the senior cycle as well as programmes such as the vocational preparation and training &mdash; VPT&mdash; programme and vocational training opportunities scheme &mdash; VTOS &mdash; and certificate and diploma courses in the regional technical colleges, Dublin Institute of Technology and WIT.</P>
      <P>The Agenda 2000 Communication from the EU Commission deals with the financing priorities of the Union for 2000 to 2006, in the context of the enlargement of the Union.  In the context of Structural Funds, proposals contained in the Agenda 2000 recognise the need for transitional arrangements for those regions currently eligible under Objective 1, but which will have passed the 75 per cent threshold.</P>
      <P>There is a strong recognition in Agenda 2000 of the crucial role of education which it states is &ldquo;a powerful tool for social equity and inclusion&rdquo;. It proposes, in this context, that a new objective should be created which would pursue a strategy to &ldquo;help the member states to adapt and modernise their systems of education, training and employment&rdquo;.  The Commission's proposals will of course be the subject of detailed negotiations at Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any reduction in the overall level of transfers to Ireland in the next programme period will have implications across the whole range of Government <Col N="1204" /> expenditure.  The level of transfers to the education sector from the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and the European Free Trade Association are very substantial, an average 180.5 mecu at 1994 prices, in the current Community Support Framework. Therefore we need to examine carefully the potential implications of any reduction in such transfers in terms of the existing range of measures supported by the EU Structural Funds. To this end, I immediately established a working group in my Department to examine the implications for the education sector of Agenda 2,000 proposals.  My Department's consideration of these matters will feed into the overall consideration by the Government of the issues arising in the post-1999 situation.</P>
    <P>I have already had a meeting with the EU Commissioner responsible for employment and industrial relations and social affairs, Mr. Padráig Flynn, to discuss matters relevant to the European Social Fund, with a view to ensuring that there is a recognition within the Commission of the importance of continued European Social Fund support, in the post-1999 period, for the vital role of education and training in the enhancing of employment prospects and in our continued economic development.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>My aim is to have the new Education Bill published before Christmas 1997.  Drafting of the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, is as yet at a very early stage and I do not wish to pre-empt the drafting process and the procedures for publication of Bills by outlining in detail the provisions of the Bill at this stage.  However, I am prepared to outline, in a general way, my key proposals for the Bill.</P>
      <P>The establishment of an intermediate administrative tier in the form of education boards, as proposed in the lapsed Bill, is unnecessary and would not deliver advantages commensurate with its cost.  I do not intend to proceed with this proposal.  My priority is to channel the resources available for education directly into the schools and other education institutions.</P>
      <P>The provision in the previous Bill that public funding would be frozen where schools did not establish boards of management will not be found in the new Bill.  Any element of compulsion in the setting up of boards of management runs counter to the principle of partnership and the building of consensus in this key area of school management.</P>
      <P>On the issue of school governance, the partners in education should have a meaningful say in the management of schools and partnership and consensus are important principles which should underpin in-school management.  These important principles will be given practical effect in the legislation.  The aim of my proposals will be to support and encourage the education partners to find agreement among themselves on how schools are to be managed.</P>
      <P>I propose that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will be established on a statutory basis, in the interests of giving the council greater status and autonomy.</P>
      <P>It is also my intention to bring forward proposals to address certain important matters relating to the State certificate examinations and the protection of their integrity.  In addition, I propose that the Bill will remove some of the provisions of the earlier Bill which could have placed a much increased administrative burden on schools.</P>

      <P>The Education Research Centre &mdash; ERC&mdash; following a detailed study of educational disadvantage in urban and rural settings, recommended that two different types of support means be made available to urban and rural schools under the breaking the cycle pilot initiative.  In the case of the urban dimension of the pilot initiative, the ERC recommended that the focus be on schools which already had disadvantaged status and were located in the urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. A total of 33 schools were selected for inclusion in this phase.  In the case of these schools, the ERC recommended that the approach which should be adopted should include the introduction of a maximum class size of 15:1 for all junior classes.  In the case of the rural part of the scheme, the ERC recommended that the focus should be on schools nationwide with fewer than five teachers.  In the case of these schools, the ERC recommended that the approach which should be adopted should include the appointment of a locally-based co-ordinator to serve each cluster of rural schools.  A total of 123 rural schools were selected and these are grouped into 25 clusters.</P>
      <P>All the selected schools, both urban and rural, receive special funding for the purchase of materials and equipment and to support out of school initiatives.</P>
      <P>The ERC has been commissioned to evaluate the effectiveness of both dimensions of the pilot initiative.  One of the key issues to be covered in the review will be the question of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the two distinct approaches, urban and rural, which are being tested under the initiative.</P>

The report made a range of recommendations, including the establishment of two research councils under the Higher Education Authority, one for science and technology and one for humanities and social science.

      <P>In December 1996, approval was confirmed for the provision of a new regional technical college at Blanchardstown to serve the north, north west and north east Dublin region as well as the growth areas in Meath and Kildare. The decision was based mainly on the recommendations of the report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education.</P>
      <P>The original site for the regional technical college, beside the Blanchardstown Shopping Centre, proved unsuitable after extensive investigation.  Detailed negotiations are under way between officials of my Department and the IDA/Fingal County Council for the acquisition of approximately 45 acres at Buzzardstown, County Dublin.  A price has been agreed for the site and funding which was previously approved has been set aside for the acquisition.  The proposed new site is part of a comprehensive 230 acre industrial-technology park being developed jointly by Fingal County Council and the IDA and is only a short distance from the original site.  The site is of sufficient size to also facilitate the provision of research, innovation and incubation centres on the college campus, thereby facilitating the forging of close links between the new institution and industry.</P>

      <P>Some difficulties of a temporary nature have arisen in the post-primary pensions and salaries sections of my Department.  These are primarily due to the exceptionally heavy workload which has emanated from the implementation of the agreement on pay and conditions of teachers under the PCW.  Some of the difficulties have been resolved and the remainder are being addressed as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>The report of the Advisory Committee on Third Level Student Support, chaired by Dr. Donal de Butléir, was published in February 1995.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee found the present system of student support to be fragmented, cumbersome and very confusing for grant applicants.  It identified overlaps and duplication with up to 70 different organisations involved in the administration of the grant schemes.  It also found that payments were too frequently delayed and that students were often disadvantaged by various administrative problems in the system.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee recommended that the three existing schemes, which have the same means test, the same rate of grant and cover virtually the same courses, should have a single application form.  It also recommended significant changes in the processing of grant applications and payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the current administration of the student support schemes must be improved. Apart from reservations about the need for a new body I have an open mind as to what the best and most appropriate options are for a new centralised system.  A joint working group involving <Col N="1210" /> officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has begun an examination of various options and the possible role of that Department in any new system.  I expect to have a report and recommendations in the matter towards the end of this year.</P>
    <P>When I have the report I will give it full consideration with a view to having any recommendations for improved and more efficient and effective administrative arrangements implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements without appropriate consultation with all interested parties.  My only objective is to ensure that the system properly addresses the concerns of students and parents.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the amalgamation of vocational education committees were made by the Commission on School Accommodation Needs in October 1996.  Orders were made by the previous Minister to amalgamate the five scheduled urban district vocational education committees of Bray, Drogheda, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford with their respective counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently met with representatives of the five town vocational education committees including Drogheda and Wexford and discussed arrangements to ensure that the interests of the former town vocational education committee areas will continue to be fully taken into account, following <Col N="1212" /> the coming into effect of the amalgamation orders.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department, the Irish Vocational Education Association and IMPACT met on 7 August 1997 and agreed that a review of the staffing structure of the amalgamating vocational education committees should be undertaken.  It is intended that this review will assist in ensuring that the amalgamated vocational education committees will continue to provide their services in an efficient manner which will meet the needs of the vocational education committee areas.  Following the meeting, my Department sought tenders from consultants in accordance with the agreed terms of reference and it is now in the process of appointing a consultant to carry out the review.</P>

      <P>During the period referred to by the Deputy a very broad range of applications for capital funding was received by the Department of Education and Science from the Waterford Institute of Technology, formerly the Regional Technical College, Waterford.</P>
      <P>Those received and approved included development of a multi-purpose centre, new staff accommodation (third floor block), atrium development phase I and canteen, atrium development phase II and central administration, refurbishment of Good Shepherd Convent phase I, internal refurbishment works, lecture theatres, acquisition of property to accommodate apprentice training programmes, and infrastructure works (roads etc.) in preparation for further developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the Department of Education and Science's policy of having an ongoing rolling capital <Col N="1214" /> programme to address the provision of additional accommodation in the regional technical college sector, a further phase of development of the Good Shepherd Convent is at present under construction.  In addition, the new library/information technology building, which is designed to be built in four stages, is at present at an advanced stage of the planning.  Some £4 million has been set aside and remains available for stage 1 of this project.</P>
    <P>My Department has also received a programme from the institute which sets out proposals for future developments.  The proposals are for an immediate capital expenditure of £23.2 million with an additional £16.3 million required in the medium to long term.  The proposed programme, in so far as capital investment is concerned, will be considered in the context of future available capital and the number of students to be catered for in the institute.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources.  While no firm decisions have yet been taken in this matter, clearly the redistribution of any surplus posts arising within the primary sector would represent an efficient manner of achieving this objective.</P>
      <P>Because there are so many variable factors involved, I regret that it is not possible at this stage to forecast the number of teaching posts which may become surplus over the next few years.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there may be difficulties involved in securing a school placement for pupils who have left or been excluded from a second-level school.</P>
      <P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in second level schools is the responsibility of individual school managerial authorities.</P>
      <P>The managerial authorities are also responsible for devising and applying a code of discipline in their schools.  My Department has issued guidelines to schools to assist them in discharging their role in this area.  These guidelines stress both the need for proportionality of response to incidents of misbehaviour and the use of expulsion only as a last resort.</P>
      <P>A disciplinary ruling involving either exclusion or suspension may be appealed in the first instance to the appropriate management authority of the school concerned, normally the manager, board of management or Vocational Education Committee.  If matters are not resolved at that level it is then open to parents to raise the matter with my Department which will liaise with the school and assist in securing an alternative school placement where necessary.</P>
      <P>My Department's psychological service is available to assess pupils with special needs in order that the most appropriate provision can be made. In addition, placement may be possible on either a youth encounter project or a youthreach programme both of which are designed to cater for pupils whose needs can best be dealt with outside of the mainstream school system.</P>
      <P>Proposals in the areas of pupil exclusions and school attendance are under consideration within my Department at present and will be addressed further in the context of forthcoming legislation.</P>

      <P>I appointed six independent examination commissioners in August.

The transparency of this new layer of redress will be ensured by the publication of the examination commissioners' report within a month of the conclusion of their task.</P>
      <P>I have also established an expert group to advise on the examinations.

      <P>The data collected for the report on physical education in 25 European countries by the European Physical Education Association were provided by the national physical education associations in these countries.</P>
      <P>The data for the different countries are difficult to compare because of varying interpretations of what constitutes physical education in schools.  In a number of European countries physical education and sport education are synonymous.  The data supplied for Ireland excluded time allocated to sport-games in our schools which can be significant in many cases.</P>
      <P>The primary school curriculum provides for a physical education programme which includes health education.  My Department recommends that schools devote a minimum of one hour per week to this aspect of the curriculum.  This time allocation does not include the very considerable level of games and athletics activities which are organised by school staffs for the children outside the official hours of instruction.</P>
      <P>In the &ldquo;Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools&rdquo; issued by my Department, a minimum of two hours per week is recommended for the physical education programme in second level schools.  I am aware of the need for an appropriate initiative to improve the physical education programme in our post-primary schools.

      <P>Following the National Economic and Social Forum's (NESF) report on early school leavers and youth unemployment, an interdepartmental working group to examine the NESF's recommendations was established.  That group reported to Government and proposed, as a realistic target, the halving of the rate of unqualified school leaving by the year 2000, with the further objective of full participation by 2006.</P>
      <P>I and the Government are committed to addressing this issue on a concentrated and co-ordinated basis.  I have already announced a major expansion in the Youthreach programme for tackling early school leaving among 15-18 year olds.  The number of places will expand from 4,525 to 6,250 in 1998 as an extra 1,000 places are provided, and an additional 725 places within FÁS are redeployed to provide progression options on Youthreach.  This represents an immediate implementing of a specific proposal in the Government's programme.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to go beyond these and to develop a range of interventions starting at primary level, which will identify and assist children in danger of leaving school early.</P>
      <P>The provision of a range of curriculum options which address the needs of children who would not benefit from participation in the traditional, academically focused, curriculum, is also an important part of any plan to reduce early-school leaving.  In this respect, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programme are particularly important.  I am fully committed to the expansion of these programmes and intend to ensure full resourcing for that purpose.</P>
      <P>When taken together, these actions will make a major contribution towards reducing the number of children who leave school each year without completing this course.</P>

      <P>I announced on 18 July that my objective is to develop a framework for the structured development of institutions in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands, while ensuring the maintenance of the complementary third level systems of university and technological education.  I further stated that the diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained so as to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also announced that I agree with the need to change the title of regional technical colleges, incorporating the common feature &ldquo;Institute of Technology&rdquo;, as recommended in the report of <Col N="1225" /> the High Level Group on the Technological Sector.</P>
    <P>A consultation process is now under way and I hope, following the conclusion of this process, to publish legislation as early as possible next year which will provide for the co-ordinated development of the technological sector and enhance its contribution to national and regional development.  I am giving this matter priority but, pending the conclusion of the consultative process, I cannot be more precise about the timing of the publication of the legislation.</P>

      <P>The number of gaelscoileanna operating in Dublin has increased in recent years and will probably continue to do so.  This growth in turn is leading to an increase in the number of pupils seeking postprimary education through the medium of Irish.

      <P>The requirements of this sector are regularly monitored in the planning section of my Department to ensure that there will continue to be sufficient pupil places available to meet future needs.</P>

Price Waterhouse acknowledged that first and second markings of candidates' work are carried out under a regime designed to ensure that the same set of standards is applied to both markings.

      <P>Entitlement to a grant under the higher education grant scheme for the 1997-98 academic year is based on a candidate's reckonable income in the tax year ended 5 April 1997.  In the case of the self-employed, the reckonable income is that based on their accounts for the year ending in the tax year ended 5 April 1997.  Similarly, entitlement for a grant for the 1998-99 academic year is, in the case of the self-employed, based on their accounts for the year ending in the tax year ended 5 April 1998.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, reductions in the income of the self-employed, including cereal farmers, are taken account for grant purposes, provided they are reflected in accounts which form the basis for reckonable income for the particular grant year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education recommended that the number of mature full-time entrants into third level education should be progressively increased from 1,000 in 1993-94 to 2,200 by the year 2000.  Preliminary data indicate that the intake of mature students at third level in the 1996-97 academic year was in the order of 1,500 which represents significant progress towards meeting the recommendation in the steering committee report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to developing initiatives to facilitate this increased participation.  A number of measures in recent years have benefited mature students.  Improvements have been made in the student support arrangements to extend them to mature students and to enable these students to be assessed on their own means. Mature students also benefit from the free fees initiative and from the provisions allowing tax relief on fees for certain third level courses.  There are also special arrangements to enable mature students to train as primary teachers.  The Higher Education Authority, in co-operation with third level institutions is promoting the co-ordinated development of a system of modular course structures and related credit transfer arrangements. Such flexibility in course structures has the potential to facilitate access and enable mature and <Col N="1232" /> part-time students to study for qualifications while remaining in full-time employment.</P>
    <P>In the context of the steering committee report the Higher Education Authority made funding available in 1996 for university initiatives relating to mature students, with the focus on disadvantaged mature students.  A sum of £240,000 was allocated for projects such as training of tutors for adult learners, evaluation of foundation courses, provision of community animateurs, development of materials for open and distance learning and access programmes for disadvantaged mature students.</P>
    <P>In July I established a joint education/industry task force to improve the supply of technicians for high-technology industries.  As a first step, I announced last week an initiative whereby colleges and industry will jointly recruit, educate and train technicians.  In seeking applicants for the courses over the next few weeks, the aim is to attract the kind of applicant who might not before have considered a technician career.  These applicants might include, for example, mature applicants who may have been out of the workforce for a while and under-employed or unemployed persons.  This is a most important initiative for providing a second chance for people to acquire technical qualifications while addressing one of the clear areas where skills are needed in the economy.</P>

There is a psychologist available to all second level schools in County Kildare.  As yet, there is no psychologist available to primary schools in the area.</P>
      <P>I have established a planning group to prepare proposals for the development of a national educational psychological service.  This planning group has held its first meeting and will be reporting to me early in 1998.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure, my Department, in co-operation with Mary Immaculate College of Education in Limerick, is making arrangements for the employment of educational psychologists in order to extend the service at primary school level.  Applications have been sought already for these posts.  When these additional posts are filled, the needs of children and of schools in County Kildare and in other areas, will be borne in mind when the new psychologists are being deployed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>While no redundancies are proposed at present, I am naturally concerned that Ballinamore Textiles Limited is experiencing difficulties in filling its order book, which it attributes to the intense competition from low cost countries.  The downturn in sales has forced the company to temporarily lay off a number of employees with effect from 17 October 1997.  In discussing the current situation with the unions, I understand that Ballinamore Textiles, while expressing an optimistic note for its future viability, cautioned of the risk of redundancies if business does not improve.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the company is currently pursuing new sales opportunities in both Ireland the UK.  In this regard, I have asked IDA Ireland to do everything possible within its remit to assist the company.  In addition, Ballinamore Textiles is also in close contact with IBEC regarding the possibility of obtaining new sales outlets.</P>
      <P>The current situation at Ballinamore is very fluid.  If new customers are found, it may enable the company to minimise the duration of the layoff period.  The company has given a commitment to the unions to keep the employees fully briefed on developments over the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am hopeful, therefore, that the combined efforts of all concerned will enable Ballinamore Textiles overcome its current order book downturn <Col N="1236" /> and continue to maintain a viable operation in Ballinamore.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the company has put forward proposals to the workforce in order to improve the competitiveness of the plant, which manufactures moulded rubber components for the European automotive industry.  These proposals have been the subject of negotiations between the company and the representatives of the workforce.  The parties have also availed of the services of the dispute settlement agencies in their efforts to resolve their differences.  Regrettably, to date, they have not been able to agree the implementation terms associated with the required flexible work practice changes.  The company has decided to undertake an assessment of the future viability of the plant, and such assessment is expected to be concluded by mid-December.  It is therefore critical that the parties resolve their outstanding difficulties concerning flexible work practices at the earliest possible opportunity.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that both parties have agreed to attend a Labour Court hearing on 30 October.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that if the competitiveness of the plant is not improved in the short term, its future viability may be in doubt, which would not be in the interest of the company, its workforce or the local community.  I therefore urge the parties to approach the forthcoming Labour Court hearing in a spirit of co-operation and a willingness to address the concerns of the other party.</P>

      <P>As I have previously advised the House, overall policy is aimed at maximising on a sustainable basis the value of the wild salmon resource.  The basic premise underlying policy is that the balance of advantage, on conservation, ecological and economic grounds, should lie increasingly with redirecting salmon exploitation towards the rivers and estuaries.</P>
      <P>In that context, as I have previously stated, my immediate priority is to review the various salmon conservation measures introduced for the 1997 season.  My decisions in relation to conservation measures for 1998 and future years will be informed by a comprehensive analysis by our salmon scientists of the state of Irish salmon stocks as well as of the international data; the impact and effectiveness of the conservation measures taken this year, and an assessment of fishing effort, enforcement and compliance levels.</P>
      <P>I have also announced my intention to move to a catchment-based approach for inland fisheries management, which will <i>inter alia</i> address the specific and localised impacts of salmon management and conservation strategies.</P>
      <P>The requirements and concerns of the commercial and recreational salmon fisheries on the River Boyne will be assessed in the context of these overall reviews.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>I have received direct representations from Rotary International in this matter, and have responded that I would be happy to consider an application for funding under the NGO cofinancing scheme under the Irish aid programme. This scheme gives priority to applications for projects which meet the basic needs of the poorest sections of the population in categories such as primary education, primary health care, water, sanitation, urban and rural development and vocational training.</P>
      <P>I fully recognise the importance of the international campaign for the eradication of polio, with its aim of ending the tragic impact of this crippling disease on the lives of millions of children, particularly in developing countries.  The Department already contributes to this campaign through its annual voluntary contribution to the United Nations' World Health Organisation (WHO).  WHO, which is the leading international organisation in the field of health, plays a central role in assisting developing countries to strengthen their national health programmes and also promotes research aimed at controlling specific diseases, including polio.  It has been operating a global campaign against polio since 1988, aimed at the eradication of polio by the year 2000 and based on a strategy of surveillance and immunization.</P>
      <P>The Department has made a voluntary contribution of £525,000 to the WHO in 1997, of which £250,000 was allocated between the WHO's global programme of vaccination, its emerging and communicable diseases programme and its essential drugs programme, all of which are directly involved in the WHO's campaign against polio.</P>
      <P>This voluntary contribution is in addition to Ireland's annual membership contribution to the World Health Organisation, which is paid by the Department of Health and which totalled £547,856.77 in 1997.  The Department of Health also funds the fight against polio at the national level.</P>
      <P>Rotary International is to be commended on its initiative in support of the international health effort to eradicate polio by the year 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 to 113, inclusive, and 115 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is seriously concerned at the deteriorating human rights situation in East Timor.  This concern was expressed by my predecessor in his address at the 52nd session of the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September.  Furthermore, earlier this year, at the meeting in Geneva of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Ireland co-sponsored the resolution which was passed on the situation of human rights in East Timor and which, <i>inter alia,</i> calls upon the Government of Indonesia to take the necessary measures to ensure full respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment by the United Nations Secretary General of Mr. Jamsheed Marker as his special envoy on East Timor has been welcomed by Ireland.  We stand ready to support any initiative taken by the Secretary General on East Timor which may be considered as feasible and appropriate.  It will be recalled that during the Irish presidency of the European Union in the second half of 1996 Ireland approached the United Nations in Geneva to express EU support for the establishment of a branch of the UN human rights committee in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.  Unfortunately, it did not prove possible to secure the agreement of the Indonesian Government for the establishment of such an office at that time.  The Indonesian Government is also opposed, it is clear, to any UN office in East Timor. <Col N="1240" /></P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the proposals for upgrading the Dublin-Maynooth line and I recently met a delegation from the Dublin 15 area to discuss this issue.  The requirements of the Dublin-Maynooth service are being evaluated as part of the review of Dublin's suburban rail development needs which is being undertaken by CIE at present.  I can assure the Deputy that the possibility of seeking EU funding for the line will be fully considered in the light of the conclusions of this review.</P>

      <P>A number of requests seeking the designation of Tipperary town for urban renewal purposes have been received.  However, as the urban renewal scheme introduced in 1994 generally expired on 31 July 1997, except for certain projects in progress which have a further year for completion, the question of extending the scheme to additional areas does not arise.</P>
      <P>The Government has approved a framework for a new, more planned and targeted urban renewal scheme which will come into effect on 1 August 1998 when the qualified extension of the current scheme terminates.  Cases for designation under the new scheme will be considered on the basis of integrated area plans prepared for priority areas selected by local authorities. Accordingly, the question of the designation of areas in Tipperary town could only be considered should Tipperary South Riding County Council decide, on the basis of the criteria now being finalised, that the town, or part of the town, is in an area for which an integrated area plan should be prepared.</P>

A new joint venture company, in which Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board together have a 26 per cent shareholding &mdash; the remainder is held by Fexco &mdash; is, as a result, solely responsible for the management and operation of the Gulliver network.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been policy, for some time, not to provide support for tourist accommodation projects on the basis of the proven ability of the commercial accommodation sector to respond to growth in visitor numbers without grant assistance.  This approach was incorporated into the Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-93 agreed with the European Commission and, by and large, carried forward into the current operational programme.  However, the current programme does make an exception in the case of a number of specific market segments where the quality of existing accommodation was recognised to be deficient.  Hence, it includes a provision to assist, on a selective basis, investment in such areas as: accommodation-related conference and leisure facilities; a limited scheme of accommodation improvements to existing small and medium-sized hotels with a capacity of up to 100 bedrooms and graded up to and including three star; limited grant aid for certain specialist accommodation needs such as caravan and camping park facilities; upgrading and improvement of existing buildings for hostel or other specialist accommodation and associated facilities on branded walking routes; provision of new and improved accommodation at approved outdoor pursuits centres in remote areas without appropriate accommodation; improvement of existing accommodation at approved residential equestrian centres; horse-drawn caravan and motorhome investments; the additional cost of providing, in existing hotels, suitable access-friendly accommodation for people with disabilities; and improved access for people with disabilities at hotels and major visitor centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In keeping with the overall strategy in the programme, such support is aimed primarily at the enhancement of existing investment rather than supporting new development and all accommodation supported must be registered or approved, as appropriate.  All funds in this regard under the programme are fully committed. <Col N="1249" /> The mid-term review of the operational programme is being completed, as part of the overall mid-term review of the Community Support Framework for Ireland and outstanding issues will be dealt with at the Tourism Monitoring Committee meeting scheduled for November next, including the matters of possible financial transfers within the programme, reorganisation of priorities and selection criteria.</P>

      <P>Music education is an integral part of the primary schools curriculum.  The existing music programme is being revised as part of the overall review of the primary curriculum by the NCCA. Music education in the revised curriculum will be a significant part of a wider and more firmlybased arts education programme.</P>
      <P>The NCCA is finalising the review of all curricular areas at primary level.  Preparations are also in train within my Department for the implementation of the revised curriculum.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level, a new leaving certificate music syllabus was introduced this September. The first examination of this new syllabus will take place in 1999.</P>
      <P>To assist in the implementation of this new syllabus, my Department is providing a comprehensive programme of incareer development for teachers under the guidance of the music inspectorate.  The programme consists of individual school visits by members of a special curriculum support team and cluster meetings of teachers. The incareer development programme includes training in computers and music technology, choral techniques and Irish music.  My Department is providing a comprehensive resource pack for all music teachers.</P>
      <P>The new leaving certificate music syllabus is a continuation of the junior certificate syllabus which was examined for the first time in 1994. Both syllabi integrate the three core activities of performing, listening and composing.</P>
      <P>Approximately 600 choirs and 70 orchestras and bands in second-level schools enter special annual Department examinations for choirs and orchestras.</P>
      <P>My Department is reviewing the operation of the music grants scheme for secondary schools and I will be in a position to report on this by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question is relevant to a specific section within the policy framework document on ICTs which the Department of Education and Science will shortly publish.  This section provides for the establishment of a school integration project whereby approximately 40 schools with varied experience in the use of multimedia computers will engage in pilot projects designed to foster and disseminate good ICT practice across the entire school system.  This initiative, including the selection of schools, will be co-ordinated by the National Centre for Technology Education, NCTE, in consultation with the Department of Education and Science.  I will establish the NCTE in Dublin City University in the near future and this will clear the way for the involvement of schools in the school integration project.  I expect that the fruits of this project will have a very significant impact on the deployment of ICTs within the education system generally.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have precise data on the extent or age of computer equipment, <Col N="1251" /> including software, available to schools providing computer training courses to adults.  I will shortly be publishing a comprehensive policy framework document on information and communication technologies, ICTs, in education reflecting the Government's commitment in the Action Programme for a New Millennium to achieving computer literacy throughout the school system.  This document will set forth the details of a national programme of action to be implemented between now and the end of the year 2001.  At the time of publication of the document, I will simultaneously be announcing a very substantial Government investment to underpin the implementation of the programme.  A key element of the programme will be the provision of assistance to schools in further building up their computer equipment infrastructure.  Schools will be able to use the equipment concerned for adult education purposes, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I will also shortly be establishing the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, in Dublin City University which will carry forward the implementation of the national programme in all 4,000 schools in the State and provide policy advice to my Department.  In implementing the national programme, the NCTE will develop a database which will include information on ICT capacity and utilisation in all first and second-level schools.</P>

      <P>It is true that the essential educative experience consists of the contact of young minds with the wisdom of the centuries, transmitted through textbooks, and not in memorisation of tracts from these books for regurgitation in an examination setting.  However, it is also enriching for our pupils to stock their memories with certain passages from great works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While permitting the use of textbooks in an examination centre might appear at first sight to be a progressive move, it is also possible that the presence of textbooks for reference, in an examination situation where pupils have a limited time in which to marshal their thoughts, could be a distraction.  The whole thrust of teaching in our schools, especially in the teaching of English, is towards creative thinking rather than the unquestioning recall of data.  The assessment modes endeavour to reflect this approach by not having an undue reliance solely on recall of information. <Col N="1252" /></P>

      <P>No specific research is being undertaken at present on the issue of early school leaving, although my Department's strategy to prevent and address this issue is underpinned by a wealth of previous educational research, reports, reviews and pilot programmes.  In addition, programme providers participate actively in exchange programmes overseas and in the dissemination of good practice under such initiatives as CEDEFOP, ARION, Wider Horizons, Youthstart etc.</P>
      <P>Recent research and reports informing policies in this area include the National Economic and Social Forum report on Youth Unemployment and Early School Leaving, the ongoing ESRI annual school leaver surveys, which are partfunded by my Department, the report of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy Working Group on Educational Disadvantage, and &ldquo;Educational Disadvantage in Ireland&rdquo;, a report commissioned by my Department and prepared by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Educational Research Centre, published in 1995.</P>
      <P>I have not undertaken a specific assessment of the Summer Bridge programme in Chicago, but Youthreach centres in Ireland operate exchange programmes with similar initiatives in the USA, and the learning from this is disseminated via inservice fora.  The Chicago Summer Bridge programme is designed to promote the participation of minority groups in education, with a particular focus on science, engineering and maths disciplines.</P>
      <P>I recently announced that, as part of the Mid-Term Review of EU Structural Fund investment, an additional £2.96 million will be provided over 1998 and 1999 for a new initiative focused on structured pilot projects in urban and rural disadvantaged areas which test models for the development of an integrated area-based co-ordination of services to cater for young people aged 8-15 at risk of early school leaving.  A working group has been established to progress the initiative, with a view to implementation at the beginning of 1998. The initiative will include a specific research strand.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the ongoing debate on the balance of fluency versus accuracy in the teaching of all languages in our schools, including English. The ability to express oneself effectively, whether orally or in writing, depends on skills of judgment and analysis as well as on basic literacy.  It is with a view to enhancing these higher-order skills that the revised syllabus for leaving certificate English is placing greater emphasis than in the past on the study of language as a tool of expression while not neglecting the study of literary language.  The revised syllabus will be introduced in September 1999.</P>
      <P>The number of hours devoted to English on the school timetable is a matter for each individual school.  The majority of pupils have an average of between 3 and 3.5 hours per week of instruction in English.  When account is taken of the fact that many other areas of the curriculum, such as history, geography, CSPE, are language-dependent and that each of these subjects is studied for approximately two hours per week by a large number of pupils, it is evident that pupils at second-level do in fact receive considerable instruction in literacy in English.</P>

      <P>There are currently 32 such classes in place nationwide and each has the support of a speech therapy service.  Each class operates at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 7:1.  There are two such classes at present in the Dublin north area.  These classes are located at St. Patrick's primary school, Drumcondra.  Each has been allocated the services of a speech therapist.

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-99 a total of £120 million is being invested in higher education and research projects.  Of this amount some £15 million has been set aside and is being invested exclusively in equipment.

      <P>There is also potential in the changes introduced in the 1997 Finance Act.  These changes will further encourage the private sector to enter into new partnerships.  Section 16 of the Act provides tax relief on donations made by individuals and corporations in relation to research and the acquisition of equipment.  Section 25 provides a mechanism to encourage investment in third level buildings or in machinery or plant.  These measures provide new possibilities for encouraging partnership with the private sector in financing approved capital projects in third level education and I am continuing to keep the issue of the provision of funding for research equipment under review in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 153 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am firmly committed to maximising the opportunities for special needs children to participate in the education system on a fully integrated basis. <Col N="1257" /> The Government's Action Programme for the Millennium gives particular priority to this area through its commitment to equal opportunity and the priority it attaches to the provision of remedial teachers and resources for children with special learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>Where special needs children are concerned, it is necessary to view each case on an individual basis.  For some children, the nature of the special need may be such that the child can function quite successfully in an integrated setting with the support, where necessary, of a remedial teacher, a resource teacher or a visiting teacher.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are approximately 8,000 children with special needs attending primary schools on a fully integrated basis.</P>
    <P>At present, a total of 1,242 remedial teachers, 77 resource teachers and 42 visiting teachers are deployed to assist these children.  This includes a total of 51 remedial teachers, 31 resource teachers and two visiting teachers newly appointed for the current school year.</P>
    <P>However, there will continue to be cases where the nature or severity of the special need is such as to require placement in a special school or special class attached to an ordinary school.  A wide range of such facilities is provided and each receives a special level of staffing and funding which reflects the severity of the needs being catered for.  It is my intention to continue to support these facilities.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that there is room for further improvement in this area.  I assure the Deputy that it is my intention to continue to attach priority to the further development of support services for children with special needs who are integrated into mainstream schools.</P>

      <P>While the number of schools which have gardens is small, it is estimated that more than one third of primary school grounds have trees, shrubs, flowers and areas under grass.  Pupils learn from involvement in planting and in taking care of these plants and areas.  Many teachers involve the children in the cultivation of a variety of plants indoors.  This work entails planting, observing and recording growth and other phenomena and keeping a written account of their activities.</P>
      <P>The study of plant life is part of the environmental studies programme in the primary school curriculum.  Department inspectors evaluate children's learning in this aspect of the programme during school visits.  They encourage teachers to provide children with appropriate learning opportunities in this important area and they comment in their reports on the work being done and on its value.  In-career development courses for teachers in environmental studies and in the particuar area of plant life have been recognised by my Department's In-career Development Unit.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to acknowledge the part played by An Bord Glas through its Gort Project in encouraging the development of school gardens. Through the agency of the Blackrock Education Centre 150 schools were targeted for support and development in 1996.  A further 150 schools are being supported in 1997.  A programme of in-career development was organised in six locations for teachers from these schools.</P>

      <Col N="1260" /> In addition to the above-mentioned staffing, the school will retain the services of a remedial teacher for the 1997-98 school year.  Following consideration of points put to me by other Deputies, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have sanctioned the appointment of a resource teacher to Ballyboughal national school with effect from 1 September 1997.</P>

      <Quest>whether the 18th assistant in Scoil an Phápa Eoin Pól II, Mullach Íde, County Dublin, will be retained in view of the fact that the school has the required number on the roll and a porta-cabin classroom has already been financed to accommodate the appointment.</Quest>

      <P>The staffing of a national school year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of Scoil Eoin Pól II on 30 September 1996 was 522 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and 17 assistant teachers for the 1997-98 school year, an increase of one assistant teacher on the previous year's staffing.</P>
      <P>It appears that the managerial authorities of the school appointed a teacher to the 18th assistant's post in the expectation that the school would qualify for the post under developing school criteria with effect from 1 September 1997. This appointment was made without the prior sanction of my Department.</P>
      <P>I have asked officials of my Department to reexamine this case as a matter of urgency.</P>
