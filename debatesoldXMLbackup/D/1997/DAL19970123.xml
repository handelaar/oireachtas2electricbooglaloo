      <P>It is proposed to take No. 8 &mdash; motion concerning the ministerial rota for parliamentary questions and No. 17 &mdash; Financial Motions, 1997, by the Minister for Finance (resumed).  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 8 shall be decided without debate and the following arrangements shall apply with regard to the resumed debate on No. 17: the speech of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats and the Minister for Social Welfare, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 40 minutes in each case. The speech of each other Member called upon <Col N="1330" /> shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case and Members may share time.</P>

      <P>I understand the Cabinet sub-committee on drugs held its first meeting this week.  Arising from that and the ministerial task force, does the Government intend to introduce legislation and other measures on the drugs crisis?  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the Government intends to implement some of the recommendations of the task force report with the communities concerned?  The Taoiseach will be aware that since the Dáil went into recess this matter has continued unabated.  Will any new legislation be given priority in this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Three items of legislation which touch on the drugs issue are receiving priority from the Government.  The new law on the licensing of dance halls, which would cover discos and other such venues where drugs are being trafficked, will introduce more controls, especially with regard to the sponsoring of what are known as raves.</P>
      <P>Legislation regarding offences against the person is also receiving priority.  For example, the threatening of people with syringes is to become a much more seriously regarded offence in terms of penalties that would apply.  In addition, legislation is being prepared in regard to the ratification of EUROPOL.</P>
      <P>The Government will consider any further legislation that is necessary to deal with the drugs problem.  Legislation is also being prepared by the Minister for the Environment with regard to estate management and the regulation of housing estates, where individual tenants may bring an area into serious disrepute by drug trafficking activities.  More powers are being taken to control such people and, if necessary, to remove them from the area where they cause difficulties for their neighbours.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Cabinet sub-committee on drugs, a major emphasis is being put on treatment of those who are already addicted to drugs, providing another way for them to regulate their lives in a more healthy fashion and providing counselling and alternative treatments of various kinds.  That is the subject of an announcement which will be made shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach if he would give priority to these measures.  What he said is interesting but none of the legislation to which he referred is on the priority lists for this session.  Is he interested in giving this legislation priority?</P>

      <P>The Bill regarding the operation of estates with undesirable tenants is already published and before the House; it is receiving priority.  The other legislation is being drafted with all due speed and I intend to ensure it is passed into law.</P>
      <P>The issue of crime and drugs is receiving maximum priority from the Government, but it is important that we draft legislation with sufficient care to ensure that it works.  Overnight legislation frequently does not work and is counterproductive.</P>

      <P>Given that the Government received the report of the all-party group on international arbitration law, will there be an early translation of that report into law in view of the fact that it has all-party support?

They agreed &mdash; I presume that includes the Deputy &mdash; that this matter would be referred to the individual parties for discussion.

    <P>THAT it is expedient to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including <Col N="1333" /> excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My main concerns about this budget include projected borrowing of 1.5 per cent at a period of peak growth which leaves too little headway to meet European Monetary Union requirements when growth declines and Structural Funds begin to dry up; the national debt under the policies of this Government is scheduled to rise by a further £2.2 billion by 1999; even after yesterday's announcements, tax levied by the rainbow coalition in its three budgets will have risen by over £2 billion, while day to day expenditure is up by £1.764 billion or 21 per cent; for single workers below the average industrial wage &mdash; in most cases where both spouses are at work, even though one may be on a small income &mdash; the marginal rate of tax and PRSI remains at a penal 55 per cent, much heavier than the tax levied on special savings accounts, deposit interest or capital gains.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare is aware that special personal investment and special savings accounts are levied at 10 per cent, deposit interest accounts are levied at 27 per cent and capital gains tax is levied at between 26 and 40 per cent. However, a person in employment who currently earns below the average industrial wage &mdash; approximately £13,600 &mdash; and receives a wage increase or an increase under Programme 2000 will thereby enter the £14,000 wage bracket and their earnings will be levied at the 55 per cent rate.  The Government appears to be providing incentives for people who invest their money or do little or nothing while those in normal employment must pay tax at a rate of 55 per cent.</P>
      <P>My final concern about the budget is that there is little incentive for the long-term unemployed or those involved in small business.  The long-term unemployed seem to have been forgotten in the budget speech, and the documents attaching to it, which we had an opportunity to examine overnight. Small business is again ignored, to the disgust and annoyance of those groups that represent it.</P>
      <P>While many of the items in the budget are welcome, they are no big deal.  While we are glad that people are receiving some overdue tax reliefs which they have, at long last, wrung from the Government, they deserved much more.  I can understand the satisfaction of trade unions and farmers at seeing commitments in the programme coming through.  I do not begrudge my good friend and successor, the Minister for Finance, his day in the sun.  However, I have grave reservations about the economic strategy, or the lack of it as Deputy McCreevy outlined yesterday, in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major opportunity was lost before budget day by not containing expenditure.  The Minister could have doubled what he gave back, or spread it more evenly over this year and the last two <Col N="1334" /> years, had he stuck to his own self-imposed targets for expenditure, instead of exceeding them by £500 million.  He could have been more fiscally responsible at the same time.  As far as the good points are concerned, Fianna Fáil had at least as big an input into this budget as Fine Gael.  This year's budget, at the end of what has been a productive Dáil since 1992, of which we can all be proud, represents a small sample of the fruits of the sustainable boom which the Fianna Fáil-Labour partnership Government created in 1993-94 following the currency crisis, in addition to the revolution in economic management that was begun by Fianna Fáil ten years ago.</P>
    <P>It is our job as an Opposition to point out forcefully the dangers in the present situation, shake Government complacency and, even in these successful times for the economy, point out why we are still falling well short of our potential. We are entitled to be concerned about the poor overall strategy and the lack of financial prudence in regard to public expenditure, which has risen by 20 per cent when inflation has only risen by 6 per cent, shown not just today or yesterday but over the entire lifetime of this Government.  The Government has given proof that, if re-elected, it intends to continue on the same spending course it has followed for the past two years.  It is apparent that the Minister received little co-operation from his colleagues and was driven to the point of resignation, not, I suspect, by one rebuff but by an accumulation of them.  If he has tried, more than we realise, to impose a budgetary discipline that is in the true interests of the country, he has failed.</P>
    <P>This budget, unlike so much that this Government has done, is certainly transparent.  It is in intent a full-blown election budget, but it has failed in its purpose.  It is the rainbow coalition's 1997 manifesto in which it tries to appropriate the credit for all the good things it inherited.  While the voter is being liberally showered with confetti, much of it has little real or lasting substance.  The Government parties make no secret of the fact that they held back over the past two years, particularly last year, from giving much relief to the taxpayer, so that they could make the maximum impact in election year.  The electoral cycle has taken precedence over the economic cycle in the most pronounced and obvious manner. I do not recall such blatant political cynicism during 20 years of service in this House, and the Government clearly hopes to get away with it. We intend that it will not do so.  The Government long ago decided to do it this way, not for the good of taxpayers or for the good of the economy, but principally for its own electoral good. Moreover, while the ratification of Programme 2000 remains in the balance, the Government has decided to frontload the entire promised cumulative personal tax relief over three years into the budget to sway the doubters in the trade union movement.  Our view is that the dividend from the strong but disciplined growth of the past ten years should have been spread more evenly over <Col N="1335" /> last year's budget also, rather than being bunched into one year when it will have disruptive economic consequences in the period immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>The underlying reality is a lot less stirring than the presentation.  Even after the budget the Government will collect almost £1,100 or 28 per cent extra per person in income tax than in 1994. Even after yesterday's much hyped concessions income tax receipts will still rise by £364 million or 8 per cent compared with last year.  That is more than three times the rate of inflation.  The Government will still collect £1 million extra income tax every day.  People may talk about giveaways, concessions and great largesse but the public will not be slow to realise that every day, Saturday and Sunday included, they will pay £1 million extra in 1997.  If that makes people jump up and celebrate, I will be surprised.</P>
    <P>Tax revenue as a whole will rise this year by £743 million, nearly 6 per cent, while the Government will return £223 million in income tax and PRSI, though it will only cost the Minister £180 million net after buoyancy.  Those are the figures in the small print, prepared as always by my old friends in the Department of Finance.  The £180 million, which is all the taxpayer will get back, is less than half the excess revenue collected in 1996 and about one-third of more than £600 million in excess revenue collected in the past two years.</P>
    <P>That it has been possible to have an almost uninterrupted succession of budgets since 1988 containing varying degrees of positive news is down to the sound management of the economy in the past ten years since Fianna Fáil took office in March 1987 and our consistent avoidance of a short-term approach.  We did not take risks with the economy and this budget is the first departure from that since we adopted a new approach with the social partners ten years ago.  While there has been a positive cumulative impact, the pace of tax relief over the past two years was painfully slow, given unprecedented economic growth.  More prudent expenditure proposals would have allowed the same or far greater concessions to have been made this year and in other years, while at the same time reducing borrowing and the consequent £2.5 billion in debt service charges, which would in turn bring us into the virtuous circle of reducing the need to borrow.</P>
    <P>There has been much loose talk in the media about Government generosity or largesse.  It is important to understand this so-called generosity consists of allowing taxpayers a limited rebate on what they would otherwise pay the Government. Income tax will still yield the Government £1 million per day more than last year.  The real generosity and largesse with taxpayers' money continues to be on the spending side, which is to increase £800 million on last year.  In just one year the Government will manage to spend and to find ways of spending £800 million more.  It is amusing &mdash; it would almost make me laugh, if it were not so serious &mdash; that the programme launched last <Col N="1336" /> week announced a 2 per cent increase in real terms during 1997 in supply services and that any excess in the target this year would be minimised. In gross terms the increase is 7 per cent, in net terms it is 4.4 per cent.  Not alone is the ink not dry on the programme, there is no ink on it yet, because no one has signed it.  It was only published a week ago, but the increase announced in the budget is almost 2.4 per cent more than the rate mentioned in it.  If we are to have jokes, they should be called jokes.  The Government should not con the Irish people by asking them to vote for a programme which contains blatant lies &mdash; seven days after its publication, we find there is no attempt to meet its terms.  Even during the last week, while the Minister's spin doctors leaked the budget to <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i>, another 1 per cent was lost.  How much will we lose in a year, given that we lost that much in a week and 2.4 per cent since the programme was negotiated in December?  This is appalling and extremely serious.  Perhaps no one cares any more that we will spend all the money the country can raise but people should know the facts.  An extra £800 million is being spent in good times, when there are fewer people unemployed, fewer people drawing from the Social Insurance Fund, when we are meant to be in boom times with no pressure and everyone should feel happy.  This small country is finding a way to spend an extra 7 per cent in gross terms and take an extra £1 million per day in tax.  It is a sad reflection on what is beginning to happen after ten successful years.</P>
    <P>It looks as though new spending will be announced every day.  This week alone Ministers announced funds for the repair of primary and secondary schools, £12.5 million for the Dublin to Sligo railway and £18 million to fund rural water schemes &mdash; my colleagues who know about these things say the latter will be fraught with difficulty all over the country.  The largesse will be endless and the announcements will soon become a joke. Most of the projects may in themselves be worthy and merit support but the way the Government intends to organise PR classes every few hours to make the next news headlines is fairly sick.  Many of the promises will commit expenditure well beyond the lifetime of this Government.  It took us three to four years in the late 1980s to pay off the vast bills from the house improvement grants introduced by the last Fine Gael/Labour coalition with an eye on an electoral spin in the March 1987 election.  More kudos should be given to the Ministers and civil servants who manage to save public money rather than spend it.</P>
    <P>The Government knew what the right policy was when it was set out in A Government of Renewal.  Day to day net current expenditure will rise by 6.6 per cent in 1997 or 7 per cent in gross terms, which is above the ceiling of 6.1 per cent announced last month.  It should only rise by 4 per cent.  This is the third year the Government has willingly ignored its targets.  In the past two years it has overrun its higher targets by the end of the year.  In 1998 and 1999 it projects expenditure <Col N="1337" /> growth to be closer to 4 per cent but it goes on to provide a large contingency fund, which is an invitation to laxity and shows it has no serious intention of adopting the discipline it recognises as desirable.  If one adds the contingency fund, current spending would continue to grow by as much as 6.2 per cent in 1998 and 6.6 per cent in 1999.  Those projections are a year and two years in advance, and since another projection has increased by 1 per cent in a week, who knows what projections will be when the time comes? Despite a few vague, pious commitments in Partnership 2000 to keeping increases as close as possible to 2 per cent in real terms and reducing the rate of increase in current public spending, this Government had no intention of doing such a thing.  It is effectively already in breach of its programme.</P>
    <P>The public will view with a cold eye the Government's attempts to buy votes with their money.  Those voters will recognise also that the current high growth and the scope for tax relief in this budget is a result of a sustained economic performance since 1987, the first eight years of which were under Fianna Fáil-led Governments, and owes precious little to any tinkering initiatives undertaken by this caretaker Government. This Administration inherited high growth and can reasonably claim credit for having kept it going thus far but in times like this it should budget for surpluses and provide against the inevitable rainy day.  My fear and that of many economic commentators is that, unless we now speedily adopt a more disciplined approach, we are in grave danger of hitting the buffers before too much longer.</P>
    <P>One of the key issues in the coming general election will be which party or parties will be best able to sustain current economic progress and address the real needs of people in the next century. Any policies we put forward will have to be consistent with much tighter budgetary parameters. We deplore the present Government's tendency to squander one of the best opportunities we are ever likely to have to put our economic and social progress on the soundest and most sustainable footing.</P>
    <P>The Government offers the public the spectacle of its apparent political death bed conversion to the necessity of lowering the personal tax burden in the hope of gaining from the electorate a renewed lease of life.  In this optimistic scenario, the Government, once back in office, would revert to habit and increase its various spending programmes for the next four years without having to do more than make an odd token gesture in the direction of further tax relief.</P>
    <P>If people accepted this budget on face value as proof of a newly found commitment to tax reform on the part of the coalition partners and re-elected them on that basis, they would be likely to be sorely disappointed.  They would analyse this budget more closely and find it is by no means the giveaway which might be imagined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> Last night I listened to the spin put on the budget.  After three years of excellent growth rates, with real growth in GDP at 10 per cent in 1995, at 7.2 per cent in 1996 and at an estimated 6.5 per cent in 1997, the Government has managed to cut the standard rate of tax by only 1 per cent.  Some people tried to castigate the former Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats policies when in coalition but in 1992, when times were more difficult and economic growth was lower, with an excellent social welfare package, that Government was able to cut the top rate of tax by 4 per cent, the standard rate by 2 per cent and to increase the bands by 11.5 per cent &mdash; an increase not matched since.  Such changes can be made if the money has not been spent before the budget is drawn up.</P>
    <P>The budgets of 1995 and 1996 and the projections for 1998 and 1999 are a far better guide to the political intentions of any future rainbow coalition Government than this year's misleading so-called &ldquo;election budget&rdquo;.  Therefore, in effect, we can examine five budgets to understand the Government's intentions.  An election budget by its nature is an exceptional event, unlikely to happen more than once every five years.  All the indications are that for the Labour Party and Democratic Left this budget is a heroic once-off exercise, never to be repeated.  The Government would not be able to afford to repeat it because of its ideological commitment to higher public spending and the PAYE workers would once more be forgotten or fobbed off for a few more years.</P>
    <P>This budget, offering headline tax concessions of £393 million in a full year, means that, technically speaking, if the same methods of calculation are used as in the past, the cumulative tax obligations under Partnership 2000 may already have been more than fulfilled.  The Government is under no obligation to provide any further tax reductions over the next two years.  Deputy McCreevy pointed out yesterday that this is so because they have listened to grass roots opinion among the social partners and realised that if it was not paid for up-front the programme would not be agreed.  It is better that is achieved than face a return to the free-for-all of the past.</P>
    <P>Any lightening of the tax burden and proper social welfare increases are welcome to recipients at any time.  However, it is important to put them in context.  Many budgets over the past ten years have also contained substantial and, indeed, greater reductions in tax rates.  In the Fianna Fáil budget of 1989, introduced by Deputy Reynolds, the standard rate of income tax was reduced by 3 per cent &mdash; from 35 per cent to 32 per cent &mdash; the top rate of tax by 2 per cent and the standard rate band was increased by 7 per cent.  In the 1990 budget of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats coalition, the same Minister reduced the standard rate of tax by 2 per cent, reduced the top rate by 3 per cent and increased the standard rate band by 6.5 per cent.  The standard rate of VAT was also reduced by 2 per cent.  In that <Col N="1339" /> budget there were several welfare measures, costing a total of £114 million, with a full year cost of £235 million.  Subtracting the increase in health expenditure and adjusting for the cost of living increase given, there was a bigger social welfare package in 1990 than in 1996, despite the spin attempted yesterday.</P>
    <P>In the 1991 budget, the standard rate and the top rate were each reduced by 1 per cent and there was indexation of bands and allowances. The first budget I introduced, in 1992, reduced the standard rate by 2 per cent, the top rate by 4 per cent and gave a large 11.5 per cent widening of the standard rate band, costing £168 million in that year and well over £200 million in a full year. The Minister's package may, with the passage of time, cost more than those of his predecessors, for obvious reasons, but he has not been able to achieve as much.  The attempt to cast this budget as the greatest giveaway of all time is revealed as a major untruth if one examines the budgets of the early 1990s.</P>
    <P>With many more people at work, especially since the latest boom began in 1993, the cost of each tax concession has become more expensive. The 1993 budget was difficult because it came in the aftermath of the currency crisis.  However, in 1994 I announced an income tax package costing £198 million in that year and £333 million in a full year.  Personal allowances were increased by 8 per cent, the standard tax band was increased by nearly 7 per cent and the 1 per cent temporary levy was removed.  In 1997 personal allowances will increase by 9.4 per cent, which is slightly more by comparison, but the standard rate band has been widened by only 5.3 per cent, which is less.</P>
    <P>The Minister's budget is only of special note when compared with his own previous feeble efforts.  It contains the first small reduction in the standard tax rate since the Labour Party came to office five years ago.  At that time, the previous Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats coalition had pledged to reduce the standard tax rate to 25 per cent and the top rate to 44 per cent.  With higher revenues and reasonable controls on expenditure we would be at those levels today. When I aimed at a 44 per cent rate in 1992 it was in the context of an economic growth rate of 4 per cent yet the rate has been as high as 8 to 10 per cent since then.  Even taking into account the 1 per cent employee PRSI reduction, this budget is a poor enough reward for the public after five years' strong growth.</P>
    <P>If the Government parties were not facing an election it is unlikely that there would have been any reduction in the standard rate, although it is one of the highest in Europe.  There is no reduction in the top rate of tax.  If the Government will not provide such a reduction in an election year, when revenue is strong and growth is high, it certainly will not provide it in any other year.  Those who will vote for the parties in Government should be clear that they will vote <Col N="1340" /> for a 48 per cent higher rate of tax over the next five years which, with PRSI and levies, brings the total marginal tax take for low to middle income earners &mdash; cutting in at £13,600 per annum &mdash; to around 55 per cent.  My colleagues in Opposition, unlike the Government parties, would not be of the view that those earning £13,600 a year, which is below the average industrial wage, are rich. Fine Gael wanted to lower the top rate of tax, as we know from statements made by its backbenchers, but they are politically impotent in budgetary matters.  Tax policy is driven by the Labour Party and Democratic Left, apart from the odd small item in the margins to keep Fine Gael happy.</P>
    <P>Everyone agrees that the main priority is to widen the standard rate band so that people do not reach the higher rate of tax so quickly. However, as that will take some time, there is also a case for lowering the top rate.  No one should be deprived of more than 50 per cent of their marginal earnings when income tax and employee's PRSI are combined.  In some countries the top rate of tax only applies to the really well off and the rich but in Ireland it applies to people who are not well off.  The really wealthy can and do avail of the many investment schemes provided by the Minister and his predecessors to reduce their tax burden, such as special savings accounts and special personal investments.  The 48 per cent rate hits the much less well off with full force &mdash; the factory worker or the other working spouse who have neither the disposable income nor the expertise to engage in imaginative schemes.  We do not want a situation to develop whereby, in the words of a famous New York society hostess, &ldquo;It is only the little people who pay tax&rdquo;.  After this budget, single, low to middle income earners on PAYE will still pay a marginal rate of 55 per cent on income above £13,600 and up to the new PRSI ceiling of £23,200.  Many middle income earners with families get a poor deal from this budget.  In many cases, low to middle income married couples are only 1 to 2 per cent better off while many of the higher earners are 3 to 4 per cent better off.</P>
    <P>It was suggested yesterday that everyone would get an extra £10.  However, only 5 per cent of income earners will get this amount and it is arguable whether they need it.  Would it not have been better to take more people out of the tax net, support the enterprise culture and deal with the poverty trap?  However, the people who need most will get only 1 to 2 per cent and, we should remember, they will get tax relief at the standard rate on their VHI or BUPA contributions and their mortgage interest payments.  We will wait to see what they get in real terms at the beginning of the tax year in April but, having examined the figures, they will be gravely disappointed.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party and Democratic Left like to present themselves as the friend of the PAYE worker but they are not.  Many married couples with children will only benefit to the tune of £4 to £6 a week and in many cases single people will benefit less.  The Government parties collude and <Col N="1341" /> will go on colluding in maintaining one of the most onerous personal tax regimes in western Europe.  Those with a vested interest in high public spending have no wish to see real change.  At every income level, except the lowest, workers will continue to pay far more income tax here than in Britain or most other European countries. Just as one swallow does not make a summer, one budget does not make a tax reforming Government.</P>
    <P>We are in grave danger of falling behind other countries again.  The British Labour Party is promising an introductory tax rate of 10 per cent. Germany wants to slash the top tax rate reached at far higher thresholds than in Ireland, although a rise in VAT to pay for it is being resisted.  The Minister should not talk in a misleading way about our GDP <i>per capita</i> being about to overtake that in the North or Britain.  It is good to know that our productivity per head matches or exceeds that of our neighbours but our personal living standards after tax, or our gross national disposable income <i>per capita</i>, are still at least 15 per cent below that of the UK.  That is almost entirely due to our tax system or, more precisely, to the fact that we need to raise so much more tax to fund basic improvements in services.</P>
    <P>The Minister should encourage realism about our economic situation and the distance we still have to travel before we catch up.  We will need a budget like this for several years to come if we are to make real progress and we will not get that from the Rainbow Coalition.  There is no evidence of political will among the present Government parties to achieve that; they have already signed off.</P>
    <P>An article in <i>Finance</i> magazine, in December 1996 about economic and monetary union and the removal of the exchange rate as an instrument of economic management stated:</P>
    <P>It is an inevitable fact of economic life that if the Irish Governments do not manage to reverse Ireland's basic uncompetitiveness with regard to the UK in taxation, its economic progress <i>vis-á-vis</i> Britain will be progressively dragged down in the new euro environment ... If we do not address the tax inequality that exists between the two economies, it is a fair bet that by 1999, the Irish-UK GDP convergence scenario will be changed, and the gaps begin to widen again to Britain's advantage.</P>
    <P>There is little or no sign of much long-term tax strategy in this year's budget.  In the past two years, this Government collected far more in tax than they had budgeted for.  In 1995, they collected an extra £259 million in income tax; in 1996, another £174 million giving a total of £433 million.  In terms of tax revenue, there was a surplus of £139 million in 1995 and £452 million in 1996.  The VAT owed by corporations which would have made revenue higher still was also transferred to 1997.  Over £600 million more than was budgeted for was available to be collected in tax over the last two years.  Less than half of that <Col N="1342" /> is being given back this year and the other half, of course, has been spent.</P>
    <P>In 1995 and 1996, the Government published Estimates of revenue which bore no relationship to anticipated economic growth plus inflation.  In 1995, despite expected high growth, pre-and post-budget revenue was projected to grow by only 5.6 per cent.  In 1996 this was marginally higher at 6.5 per cent.  In both years, as in 1994, the economy was growing by between 5 and 7 per cent and the outcome was far higher.  This year, in contrast, pre-budget tax revenue is set to rise by 7.7 per cent which bears a much more realistic relationship to the likely level of economic growth plus inflation.  My former colleagues in the Department of Finance would have liked to keep that lower and then see if they could beat it but they were forced by the Government to go to the top end of the figure because it was an election year and they probably had to deal with Ministers who know they would not be around anyway so they agreed to put in the figure.</P>
    <P>However the important point which will not be missed by people in the markets is that it is less likely there will be a significant revenue surplus this year to cover unforeseen additional expenditure. What you see is more likely to be what you get, unlike what happened over the past two years.  There are no hidden reserves or contingency funds for 1997 in the Department of Finance. The Government is using up its limits, and it would be unsafe to assume there will be a revenue surplus to cover unforeseen or additional pre-election expenditure.  This means that overruns will probably push up the EBR.  Any further expenditure commitments not covered in this budget will shake confidence and should not be made.  We will be asking Ministers to make it clear during further announcements whether they have been fully budgeted for this year.</P>
    <P>It would have been difficult to determine the exact fiscal stance of the last two budgets because both the revenue and expenditure outturn bore little relationship to the targets or in the case of revenue growth to the state of the economy. What looked at budget time in 1995 and 1996 like a mildly reflationary budget, adding 0.1 per cent or 0.2 per cent to the EBR, was not in the outturn. At times of high growth, a somewhat deflationary fiscal stance, even <i>de facto</i>, is a useful way of dampening down a runaway boom but it would have helped confidence if the Minister had been more ambitious in his borrowing targets and had opted for a more balanced mix as between expenditure increases and tax relief.</P>
    <P>A great opportunity is being missed to eliminate borrowing by 1999, which has been recommended by the ESRI and every commentator of note, in line with the stability pact which this Government claims credit for negotiating for their European partners but it does not seem obliged to take heed of it?  The Minister's budget strategy is not in keeping with the stability pact agreed in Dublin in December and if we run into difficulties when other European countries are <Col N="1343" /> prospering, we will get little sympathy because we asked them to agree to it.</P>
    <P>There are three good reasons for a balanced budget.  The first is to create room for manoeuvre in any recession.  The headroom is very tight particularly, as cyclically adjusted, our borrowing level is now about 1 per cent above the Maastricht limits.  That is known by the Central Bank and the Department of Finance but it is dangerous in our current position of excellent times of high revenues, creation of jobs, high economic growth, huge transfers of money.  What will it be when the transfers from Brussels are lower, when economic growth is declining and when there is pressure from interest rates and inflation on the budget?  That will happen within the economic cycles of this country.  Anybody who cares about the future of the Irish economy as Fianna Fáil does, having been the architects for putting it right, care about that case.  The second reason is to have the scope to increase capital spending when EU Structural and Cohesion Funds are curtailed after the year 2000.  The third, and most important, reason is to create the basis for sustained tax reductions to make our tax system much more competitive.</P>
    <P>In 1994, I introduced the first current budget surplus in nearly 30 years.  After an unnecessary relapse in 1995, I am glad that is being firmly consolidated. That at least represents some progress.  If the economy is being managed properly, we should see increasingly large current budget surpluses in future years.  That is no longer enough as less progress is being made on the EBR.  In 1995, at budget time, the EBR target was raised from the previous year's outturn of £672 million to £813 million which I still cannot understand.  The 1995 outturn was lower, £627 million, but again in the 1996 budget the target was raised to £729 million.  Last year, the outturn was down much more sharply to £437 million or 1.2 per cent of GNP largely because of the absence of tax concessions in last year's budget as well as continued high economic growth.  If there were serious political will, we would already be on the brink of eliminating the Exchequer borrowing requirement, thus freezing the amount paid on debt interest, in many cases to foreign banks.  Instead, this year the cost of debt servicing is set to rise by £200 million to £2.56 billion, equivalent to roughly 50 per cent of income tax revenue. That is another case where the Government is trying to let on that things are being improved but they are not.</P>
    <P>The opening deficit this year was £334 million or 0.8 per cent of GNP.  I would have been satisfied for this year with an EBR of £500 million or 1.3 per cent.  Instead, the Minister has pushed it up to £637 million or 1.6 per cent of GNP, a disappointingly high figure.  I am appalled at his projections of £856 million for next year and £698 million for 1999.  That means that this Minister and this Government, if re-elected, are proposing to borrow a further £2.2 billion.  This is totally irresponsible and unacceptable.  I would ask people to look closely at that figure of £2.2 billion <Col N="1344" /> in the next two years which is what the Government is putting to the electorate.</P>
    <P>I have argued for a long time that the pot of gold to fund both tax reductions and improved services is to be found in the reduction of debt servicing.  However, we can only start to access it if we stop adding to our national debt of £30 billion.  The Minister has boasted about the first reduction in the national debt last year thanks to exchange rate movements bringing it slightly below £30 billion, having increased it by £1 billion in 1995.  Of course, that was just one of those tricks in the system which will not continue.  The Government should look at the proposals we have made concerning the national debt.</P>
    <P>Before Christmas the Central Bank issued a strong warning against an expansionary budget. It stated:</P>
    <P>It is especially important that fiscal policy should not be expansionary.  The present buoyant disposition of the currency does not warrant an expansionary fiscal stance which could only serve to increase inflation dangers which may be already present.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank repeated that warning no less than three times in its bulletin.  The final one reads:</P>
    <P>In the current context of strong economic growth, however, any tax reductions would have to be made only in conjunction with more stringent control of expenditure.</P>
    <P>This is not being done.  Unfortunately, we now have a position where the Central Bank is out of line with the Government.</P>
    <P>The EBR announced by the Minister makes this by any standards an expansionary budget.  It cannot be read any other way.  The budget is injecting money into the economy which is already fast-growing on all fronts.  Even larger tax reductions would be fine if they were not combined with day to day spending increases up 6.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Despite political pressures from colleagues, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Kenneth Clarke, was determined not to knock the British economy off course just in order to win an election.  Unfortunately, I detect no similar prudence or sense of public responsibility here. The Minister is taking a gamble that inflation will not take off and that the Central Bank will not have to put up interest rates, in a way that would claw back from anyone with a mortgage or substantial bank borrowings most of the benefits from tax reductions.</P>
    <P>Our European Monetary Union membership will be at stake.  The Minister may not be as happy with the situation as he claims in public. He has not been getting the support which all recent Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance got from their leaders since 1987.  In fact, the Minister almost resigned because his party leader, the Tánaiste, went over his head and settled a deal with the public service unions which the Minister <Col N="1345" /> had said publicly he could not afford.  As I understand it, he was not even consulted about these matters until they had been concluded.</P>
    <P>Under Opposition pressure this Government chose a period of steeply rising house prices to abolish the residential property tax and replace it with a once-off up front additional charge on more expensive houses, both to pay for it but also to dampen the effect on demand.  Many people were poised to come into the residential property tax net.  Fianna Fáil pressure has saved them from that fate.  The Government raised the stamp duty on houses over £150,000 from 6 per cent to a penal 9 per cent.  With house prices rising annually by 15 per cent for the last number of years, it will only take three or four years for a house at present worth £100,000 to go over the threshold.</P>
    <P>It means a family buying a house costing £175,000 will have to find over £15,000 on top of the price of the house.  A house of that value in Dublin would not be grandiose.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, has plenty of them in his own constituency.</P>
    <P>Residential property tax has gone, not out of conviction but for reasons of electoral expediency. I am sure those who were affected will not forget that it was political pressure from the Labour Party allied to the taxing zeal of a former Fine Gael leader which brought in RPT, nor that it was the Labour Party who insisted that it should remain for 14 years, hitting more and more house owners, mainly in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Until recently, Labour had ambitions to extend it and turn it into a general property tax.  Having acquired upwardly mobile floating voters in the last election, Labour has at last agreed to its abolition. I am glad of that because the next Government will be spared sanctimonious cant on its abolition from the Opposition benches.  However, they have substituted another tax mainly on the homes of people who they claim are rich but in many parts they are certainly not so.</P>
    <P>In general, the old, lower income groups and the unemployed were given a high level of pre-budget expectation.  Their hopes have not been fulfilled.  What they have got shows they have not received any special consideration other than the welcome increase in the back to work allowance scheme introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1994.  Otherwise, there is little incentive here for the unemployed to join the workforce.  Almost no fall in the numbers unemployed is projected to 1999.</P>
    <P>The tax threshold for a single person has been increased by £100 and a married couple by £200. Is this a serious attempt to encourage and reward work?  The tax gain for the single person or childless married couple on low incomes is absolutely minimal at £1 or £2 a week.</P>
    <P>My main complaint against this budget is its once-off short-term nature.  Even on its own it is nothing remarkable.  Taking the coalition's record as a whole, it has been a story of disappointment and a golden opportunity for fiscal advance and <Col N="1346" /> consolidation missed.  There could have been scope to take most of the low paid out of the tax net altogether.  It was not done but it is not too late, I hope, for the next Government to take the situation firmly in hand.</P>
    <P>If we want and need real tax reductions, incentives for employment, and resources both for investment and to fund a caring social policy, we have to introduce a policy of greater expenditure restraint and of eliminating borrowing.  We need to do many things to make our economy more competitive.  We need to reduce the income tax burden, corporation tax and employers' PRSI, which was virtually ignored this year.  We also need to create the room down the line to replace capital investment funds that may no longer be flowing at the same degree from Brussels.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will be spelling out its strategy in more detail over the coming weeks.  Our aim is for a high growth, low tax economy based on social consensus that can afford to be caring. However, if growth prospects are to be sustained so that the continuing fruits are to be shared out equally, we need a change of Government.  We need that Government to change fairly smartly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that no Minister for Finance or Government could have introduced a budget in more favourable circumstances. It is equally clear from what we heard yesterday that never has so little been done with so much.  Never has such a unique opportunity to transform our society and economy been missed. The way to judge the budget is to look at what it does for social solidarity and how it will deal with unemployment, examine what it will do for workers who are the real reason we have such high growth in the economy, examine what it does in relation to the national debt and the effects it will have on public spending.  That is how I propose to examine the budget.</P>
      <P>By any yardstick yesterday's budget is, as Deputy Michael McDowell described it, a complete damp squib.  I say that because, contrary to the impression given, the ordinary worker earning, for example, £150 per week &mdash; which is very low pay by any standards, and there are many such workers in the economy &mdash; will be better off to the tune of £2.86.  A married man with a dependent spouse and two children earning £250 will be better off to the tune of £3.50, hardly 90p a week each.  After yesterday's budget, a single worker earning £200 per week will pay £43 per week in taxes and levies of one kind or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On tax reform, as Deputy Michael McDowell said, the wealthy can always look after themselves. Some of the owners of Irish industry are tax exiles and do not pay tax in Ireland.  Their factory worker on £200 a week will pay £43 a week even after yesterday's budget.  The record shows that faced with imminent political disaster, all the Labour Party could do for workers was take a penny off the tax rate.  If anything was needed to prove there is no crock of gold at the <Col N="1347" /> end of this rainbow, it is the pittance for the workers who try so hard.</P>
    <P>It is important to change tax rates in the first instance, because this is an open, trading economy and we must export about 70 per cent of what we make if we are to generate wealth, sustain current levels of employment and provide for our people.  We cannot exist without being competitive and even if we do not like changing tax rates, sheer economic necessity requires that we do so.  Nowhere is that more evident than in competition with our nearest trading partner, the British economy.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste recently said he did not agree with 95 per cent of the policies of the Progressive Democrats.  I support 95 per cent of the policies of Tony Blair and the British Labour Party so clearly the Tánaiste does not support those policies either.  In western Europe, the Irish Labour Party is the dinosaur of socialism.  Every other country has realised that when the Berlin Wall came down, it brought with it not only the wall but also the blinkered thinking on economic activity.  Countries of every hue &mdash; Hungary, New Zealand, Germany or Britain &mdash; realise that the way to rejuvenate an economy, order society and give people hope and incentive is to give economic rewards for effort and ensure the economy respects private risk and private enterprise.  With a few exceptions &mdash; Bulgaria, Iraq and Korea &mdash; all countries recognise how to enable their economies to grow and survive in this global economy, which is getting smaller but more competitive. They must give incentives to ordinary people to do things for themselves.</P>
    <P>My passionate desire is to break the cycle of dependency which tells 268,000 people they will get social welfare on the basis that they do nothing for themselves.  Think of what we are doing to so many people in Ireland who are marginalised and isolated, whose dignity and selfworth is being destroyed because this State says they will get welfare on the basis that they do nothing?  They may not take a job which is lowpaying because of bureaucracy and high taxes on work.  Nominal wage increases are of no value if the State confiscates such a large percentage of the earnings of workers.  Taking £5.50 or 55 per cent from the marginal or overtime earnings of the factory worker does not encourage effort and enterprise.</P>
    <P>On public sector pay the probable next British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, says:</P>
    <P>With Labour, all public sector pay agreements must be financed from within the agreed Departmental cash limits.  Just as we will resist any unreasonable demand on the public purse, we will resist unreasonable public sector pay demands.</P>
    <P>On public spending he says: &ldquo;We reject the old Labour litmus test on spending, that increasing the overall level of public spending is proof of our <Col N="1348" /> socialist commitment.&rdquo;  On the need for tax cuts he says: &ldquo;My tax-cutting ambition is to introduce a new lower starting rate of tax in Britain of 10 per cent to encourage people to go back to work and to help all hardworking families.&rdquo;  Lastly, Gordon Brown on the high rate of tax in Britain, which is 40 per cent says:</P>
    <P>It is because we understand the importance of work that there will be no return to penal marginal rates at the top.  As a signal of the importance we attach to rewarding work, I want to make it clear that I will not increase the top rate of tax on return to office.</P>
    <P>Tony Blair will speak in the Netherlands on Friday on social welfare reform.  I do not know what he will say but a few of the socialist sacred cows may bite the dust in that speech.  Perhaps the present Minister for Social Welfare might tune in to it.</P>
    <P>Earlier I said we must judge the budget on what it does for social solidarity.  There are 411,000 pensioners in Ireland.  In the main they live from occupational or State pensions.  Some of them are well-off but the vast bulk are very poor. In Partnership 2000, they will get an extra £20 million in the current year.  We have 200,000 civil servants.  In the same deal they will get an extra £320 million.  I need not ask if that is social justice. Those with guaranteed jobs who are relatively well-paid will get £320 million and pensioners will get £20 million.  That is not social justice.  Pensioners will get a mere £3.20 a week from yesterday's budget.  To give them an extra £5 a week would have cost £32 million according to the Department of Finance estimate sent to me recently.  The over 65s, who are a growing number in our society, built up this State.  They worked hard and in their old age deserve at least to have their contribution to this economy recognised with a decent return.  If £100 million in increased social welfare spending had been targeted at the most needy in the social welfare system &mdash; pensioners, carers and children &mdash; carers would have got an extra £10 a week and children an extra £4 a week.  They are the three main groups within our social welfare system.</P>
    <P>On tax reform, the best way to encourage people to shift from welfare to a job is to make sure they see a decent return when they do so. Week in week out I have constituents who take a job and want to give it up within weeks because it is not worth their while.  Recently a single mother told me once her child was looked after she was £10 a week better off having to get up at 7 a.m. and there was no point in making the effort for the return.  Unless we change our tax system and realise that people at the bottom suffer most through our penal levels of tax we will not see a shift from social welfare into employment no matter how many jobs we generate.  The Government tells us that last year there were 40,000 new jobs yet the number of people unemployed decreased by 1,000, excluding the reduction on <Col N="1349" /> the live register brought about by the social welfare fraud measures which I supported.</P>
    <P>Between 1989 and 1992, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats reduced the standard rate of tax by 5 percentage points and the higher rate of tax by 8 percentage points.  That was at a time when we did not have the boom we have now. The Government taking credit for the boom is like the Meteorological Office taking credit for good weather.  The boom in our economy has virtually nothing to do with the Government and is happening despite them.  The Government is blowing the opportunity that boom provides to transform this society.  This year, even with the boom, we will add an extra £0.5 billion to the national debt.  If, at a time when the economy is growing and we get £2 billion in development aid from the EU, we still have to add £0.5 billion to our national debt, what will happen when we are in the European Monetary Union straitjacket and the funds begin to dry up?  A unique opportunity was missed in this budget in relation to public spending and the national debt.  Public spending, according to the Minister yesterday, will increase by 7 per cent in gross terms which is apparently 8.2 per cent in net terms.  It is worth looking at what has happened to public spending in the three years since the rainbow came into office.</P>
    <P>In that time public spending increased by 20 per cent, almost four times the rate of inflation. That means it cost £40 million more this year to run the country than in 1994, nearly £6 million per day.  Those who believe the answer to every problem is more public spending should realise that over the last five years spending on our health service has doubled.  Can anybody suggest the quality of the health service has improved accordingly?  One has only to look at the hepatitis C tribunal to realise that all is not well in the manner in which our health services are administered. Equally, spending has increased in our prison service &mdash; where the number of prisoners has increased by 7 per cent &mdash; by about 33 per cent and nobody can say the quality of the service has improved accordingly.  In the Department of Justice spending has increased by 60 per cent over the past four years.  One has only to look at the Lynch debacle to realise they could not even open the post properly.  The quality of the service in that Department did not improve.</P>
    <P>We have to be much more vigilant in ensuring we get better value for money, that we apply strict criteria to public spending programmes and to the manner in which we administer our Departments of State and our public service generally. The structures are creaking.  To give more and more money to outmoded structures is not what this country needs.</P>
    <P>The top rate of tax in Ireland was not decreased yesterday, the reason being that the Labour Party seems to be obsessed with the belief the top rate of tax is paid only by the wealthy.  A single person earning below the average industrial wage pays the top rate of tax.  Over 40 per cent of all taxpayers &mdash; more than 500,000 people <Col N="1350" />&mdash; pay the top rate of tax.  They are not wealthy people but ordinary people who work in factories, shops, hotels, restaurants and so on.  There is no incentive for a person in that position to work harder, to accept promotion in some cases or to work overtime because it is not worth their while. In making no move to reduce the top rate of tax we sent out a very bad signal.  Were this not an election year there would have been no move at the bottom rate.  A reduction from 27 per cent to 26 per cent is an absolute pittance given the economic circumstances which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>After the budget a person on £270 per week will be eligible for the higher rate of tax and pay a marginal tax rate of 55 per cent when PRSI is taken into account.  Deputy Bertie Ahern and Deputy Michael McDowell referred to what was happening in Germany &mdash; the home of social consensus &mdash; which is moving to a top rate of tax of 35 per cent.  Ireland, a small economy on the periphery of Europe, will maintain a 48 per cent tax rate, plus levies and so on, making a combined rate of about 55 per cent.  It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>We have heard much from the Labour Party about low paid, high paid and modestly paid jobs, all of which are being taxed out of existence because of the high taxes on work.  There is no doubt about that.  We have only to look at Packard, Semperit, Tambrands and so many other examples where people working in labour intensive industries are losing their jobs because those companies cannot operate competitively in this country.</P>
    <P>I was interested to note from the budget speech and the Principal Features there was no reference to the changes in mortgage interest relief.  The standard rating of that relief will be completed in the next tax year.  I support standard rating.  It is fairer and in the interests of social justice one could not justify giving tax relief on allowances and mortgage interest relief and so on at the higher rate.  Why was it not factored into the tables which the Minister produced?  If I recall correctly, there was no reference to it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in PRSI, although modest, because it is the first acknowledgement from the Government that PRSI is a tax on work.  The Minister for Social Welfare and most members of the Labour Party have long maintained that PRSI is a social insurance which goes into this great fund and is paid back by way of social benefits. That is not correct, it is an unfair tax on work. For example, even after the budget changes yesterday, a person on £250 per week pays 3 per cent of their income in PRSI while a person on £2,500 per week pays 1 per cent of their income in PRSI. It also discriminates against the private sector which pays five times more than the public sector. An average worker in a factory in Ireland will pay £10 per week in PRSI.  The secretary of a Government Department on £75,000 per year pays £4 per week in PRSI.  That is not fair, it is socially unjust and is a tax on work that we have to begin to dismantle.  The levies are another tax <Col N="1351" /> on low income earners.  A person on £300 per week pays £7 per week in health, training and employment levies.</P>
    <P>We need to look at what this budget does in terms of employment.  At a time when the economy is growing by 5 per cent in real terms it is hard to imagine that the Department of Finance, in the budget and in the Estimates, is not budgeting for a decrease in unemployment.  Why is that the case?  A 5 per cent growth rate should produce about 60,000 new jobs.  Allowing for new entrants into the workforce and that we could have 60,000 new jobs it is extraordinary that there will be no dent in unemployment.  Due to the forthcoming election the Minister has gone easy on the fraud measures.  The latest labour force survey for April 1996 shows that 177,000 people are unemployed, and the Government continues to tell us that is the more accurate figure, yet at that time unemployment benefit was paid to 280,000 people, leaving a gap of 104,000.  By no stretch of the imagination can one justify, on statistical grounds, that gap.  We all know the reason for most of it.  I complimented the Minister on the measures adopted in the summer but I detect an easing off in the detection of those who are defrauding our social welfare system.  Some people have said there may be other more serious frauds in this economy.  Those who defraud the social welfare system are defrauding pensioners, the most dependent in our society.</P>
    <P>If we could reduce the numbers unemployed through taking strict measures and managing the Department of Social Welfare well we could probably have an unemployment figure somewhere in the region of 225,000 which would result in a saving of £160 million.  That could do much for pensioners, carers, children and other deserving causes.</P>
    <P>In terms of employer costs, in the Republic it is 50 per cent more expensive to give an employee an extra £1 in take home pay.  Before this budget workers on £300 per week in Dundalk paid £16 more per week in tax than their counterpart in Newry.  A job paying £300 per week, which is roughly in line with the average industrial wage, costs the company £336 per week to have that person on their books.  The individual worker takes home £220, a gap of £120 on a job paying £300.  Effectively, we have a tax of £120 on a job paying £300.  Surely that makes no sense.  It is probably the reason we have such a huge black economy and, despite the high growth in the economy, that there is no dent in unemployment. The reality, particularly in rural Ireland where huge multinational companies are not investing, is that small companies employing a small number of people will create the job opportunities for our young people.  Unless there is an incentive to do so and unless we reduce the tax of £120 on a £300 salary huge efforts will not be made in that regard.</P>
    <P>This year, according to the Department of Finance's pre-budget White Paper, we will raise <Col N="1352" /> an extra £1 billion in taxes.  To herald a budget as pro-tax and pro-jobs when taxes will be increased by an extra £1 billion is not accurate.  The reality is that this budget has been well dressed up.  The PR people have done a great job.  When people get their wage packets on 6 April the reality will set in for most workers when they take into account the increases in petrol costs and the changes in mortgage interest relief.  The average worker on £250 per week, in the case of a married man, will be £4 better off but when some of those changes are taken into account there will be no improvement in take home pay.  Is this fair at a time when we have this boom?  Is it fair that the people who are the backbone of society, those who go out to work and pay our salaries, those who look after our social welfare recipients, those who create the wealth, those who make the national cake should get such a raw deal in such good times?  Despite what the Government thinks, this is not a good election budget because the people will say &ldquo;my vote will not be bought so cheaply&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reality is that after five years of the Labour Party in Government there are more people unemployed and there are higher taxes on work, and this at a time when the economy grew at an unprecedented level.  The Labour Party believes in dependency and control not only in relation to the economy but also in relation to education where we have seen what it is trying to do.  It does not have much faith in members of the public doing things or running things for themselves.  It does not respect enterprise, believe in rewarding risk or encouraging people who want to help themselves.  This is unusual because Ireland was one of the few countries in Europe where socialism did not take root.  Ireland has a free market economy and people have a strong attachment to home and farm ownership.  Yet when it comes to sacred cows such as privatisation we are told it is hands off.  Greencore and Irish Life were privatised by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.  Would anyone suggest that they should be returned to State ownership?  If this State was being established now, would we be running hotels, fertiliser companies and banks? Of course we would not.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at what has been happening during the past few weeks in the rest of the world. Germany is selling its State-owned telecommunications network, Lithuania is selling its State-owned engineering industry, Ghana is selling its State-owned tyre industry, Mozambique is selling its State-owned bank and the Hungarians are privatising their electricity system with the help of the ESB.  It seems to be a case of do as I say rather than do as I do.  The reason these countries are doing this is they know it is a key ingredient in rejuvenating economies, improving competitiveness and providing better services for consumers.</P>
    <P>Privatisation is not a fad.  When it was started 15 years ago by Margaret Thatcher it was a radical political experiment but nowadays many <Col N="1353" /> countries recognise that the State has no business running businesses, that there are better ways of doing this.  At a time when we have a national debt of £30 billion and when so much of our taxes are used to service this debt, does it make sense for us not to even examine privatising companies such as the TSB, the ACC and the ICC?  Is there any real reason these companies have to be in State ownership other than a blinkered, old fashioned ideological one?</P>
    <P>Workers' savings by way of pension funds amount to £17 billion and are growing at a rate of £1 billion per year.  These savings are invested in British Telecom, Asian Telecom and other companies throughout the world but they cannot be invested at home because investment opportunities do not exist here.  Does this make sense for a country like Ireland?  We must get real when it comes to dealing with these issues, recognise that there are better ways of doing things and have the courage to at least examine doing things in a different way so as to reduce the burden of the national debt.</P>
    <P>British Airways was turned around as a result of privatisation and is now one of the most dynamic airways in the world.  One can imagine what would happen in Ireland if some of our companies went to private investors instead of the Government and taxpayers for money.  When Aer Lingus needs money it goes to the Government but when Greencore needs money it goes to the Stock Exchange or the banks.  Over the lifetime of a Government we have to look seriously at the issue of privatisation of certain key State companies. The national debt cannot be sustained at £30 billion, particularly in the context of reduced resources from the EU &mdash; we certainly will not get anything like £2 billion net a year post 1999. We will have to stand more on our own feet and have the courage to run this as a modern, efficient economy in the same way as so many of our trading partners run their economies.</P>
    <P>People will examine the budget in terms of what it means for them, their families and children and the future job prospects for their children, what it means in terms of take home pay for the breadwinner or breadwinners as the case may be and what it does for pensioners and carers. When they realise that the opportunity was there to do so much more the parties who brought the budget before the House will pay a very heavy price whenever the election is called.</P>
    <P>I wonder where Fine Gael was when the budget was being drafted.  During the summer, Deputy Hogan said that we needed a standard rate of tax of 25 per cent and a higher rate of 45 per cent.  He also referred to privatisation.  Fine Gael may have been tied up with recent crises such as the Judge Lynch affair, the hepatitis issue and the Lowry affair, but there is no evidence from yesterday's budget that it had any influence on what was produced.  It may be the largest party in Government but it certainly is not the party in power.  It is a sad reflection on Fine Gael that at a time of unprecedented growth in the economy <Col N="1354" /> it achieved so little for the people it purports to represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third budget to be introduced by the Government.  It is another radical and reforming package designed to consolidate the many positive features of its two predecessors and to continue the process of bringing about innovative and effective change.</P>
      <P>In assembling the social welfare elements of the budget package, the Government was keen to ensure that account was taken of the commitments made in our programme for Government. We also took account of the key findings of the Expert Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare whose report was published last summer, the Strategy Paper on the Labour Market published by the Department of Enterprise and Employment in April 1996 and the interim report of the Commission on the Family published in November 1996.  We were equally conscious of the need to demonstrate the Government's commitment to the new Partnership 2000 by making substantial progress towards meeting the major commitments contained in that programme on tax, social inclusion and poverty.</P>
      <P>We have succeeded in achieving a balanced, innovative and reforming budget package.  It improves the financial position of everyone in need, reinforces the incentives for people to avail of work opportunities and provides improved support for all low income families.  It is prowork, pro-family, well-targeted and cares for the elderly.</P>
      <P>Before describing the social welfare changes in detail, I want to put them in context.  The cost of the social welfare package will be approximately £114 million in 1997 and £214.69 million in a full year.  These are the largest increases ever, despite Deputy Ahern's attempts to distort the facts in regard to 1990.  The reasons for this are simple. There is a clear social consensus in favour of social solidarity, and there is a Government which acts decisively and with equal commitment to fairness.</P>
      <P>In looking at the robust state of the economy under the stewardship of the Government, it is worth reminding ourselves of the facts: we had an expected growth rate of 6 per cent in 1996, well in excess of the average for our EU partners; we created 50,000 net new jobs in 1996 on top of 45,000 net new jobs in 1995; we have achieved a decrease of 15,000 in the live register with last month's figure being the lowest December for five years; inflation averaged 1.9 per cent in 1996, the lowest rate recorded since 1960; there has been an estimated decrease of approximately £300 million in the Exchequer debt, the first decrease in nearly 40 years; we have a growing population and emigration has ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This strong economic performance has laid the foundation for continued growth and prosperity in the coming years.  We can confidently expect our growth rates to remain well ahead of our <Col N="1355" /> European partners, at 5.5 per cent this year and approximately 4.5 per cent annually to the end of the decade.  Inflation should remain low at just over 2 per cent and employment growth is expected to average 38,000 a year over the next three years.</P>
    <P>The public finances and the economy have never been in a healthier state and the prospects for the future are very encouraging.  The Government is determined that the benefits of our current outstanding economic performance will be equitably distributed among all sections of our society, especially among those in greatest need. I am acutely aware that while the strong will, by definition, look after themselves, the weaker and more vulnerable sections of our population need increased protection and support.  Poverty and social exclusion are not naturally eroded by economic growth; the contrary is the case.  In the absence of strong countervailing action they will grow and inequalities will increase.</P>
    <P>Commitment to sharing the benefits of growth is a central element in the new Partnership 2000 which I hope will be agreed by the end of this week.  Partnership 2000 contains a range of commitments built around a renewal of the macroeconomic framework which has underpinned our economic success to date.  It provides for improved living standards and quality of life through a combination of pay, personal taxation and social welfare improvements, as well as more efficient public services.</P>
    <P>The new partnership is about more than just take-home pay and the public finances.  It contains a number of new elements, the most important of which, from my perspective, is the recognition that positive measures to ensure social inclusion are an essential requirement for translating our excellent economic performance into much greater social solidarity, protection and progress for people currently marginalised and excluded from making a full contribution to society.  This budget &mdash; coming just weeks after the new agreement was concluded &mdash; is an earnest of this Government's intention to play its part to the full in meeting our commitments under Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with the financing to the social welfare system.  Contrary to what Deputy Harney said, social insurance plays a crucial role within the overall social welfare system.  Contributory pensions and other benefits are paid to more than 406,000 people and this number is increasing with the ageing of our population. PRSI contributions are made by about 1.35 million workers and this number is also increasing with the increases in employment.  Social insurance contributions will amount to some £1.81 billion and pay for nearly half of all social welfare expenditure.</P>
    <P>Social insurance is based on a long-term social contract between employers, employees the self employed and Government whereby a proportion <Col N="1356" /> of the wealth created by individuals during their years of active participation in the economy is used mainly to provide pensions and other income support for people who previously contributed. Mostly, it reflects inter-generational solidarity.  However, PRSI also finances many benefits for insured workers during their working lives, if the need for unemployment, illness, maternity, dental, optical and other benefits should arise.  Deputies Harney and McDowell and Members on the Fianna Fáil benches should read the discussion document I published last year on the social insurance system.  It explains the social insurance system and why it is important to protect, defend and develop it.</P>
    <P>In its final report in 1993 the National Pensions Board stressed that ongoing financial viability of the social welfare pensions provision is fundamental because that is the basic amount on which most people depend, wholly or partly, in old age. Given the likely volatility in future in the level and structure of the population, it recommended that an actuarial review of the long-term costs of social welfare pensions be carried out every five years.  The first such review is currently under way and will be a useful component of the discussion on the future development of social welfare pensions where, obviously, account must be taken of financing considerations.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the social insurance system are also currently under review.  Last October, I published the discussion document &ldquo;Social Insurance in Ireland&rdquo; and in December 1996, my Department held a seminar on this subject.  Soon I will invite submissions from the public on the issues raised in the document concerning the development of the system.  This is in tune with the commitment in Partnership 2000 to continue &ldquo;the reform and development&rdquo; of the system &ldquo;over the course of the Partnership&rdquo;.  I presume from what Deputy Harney said, she does not support the commitment in Partnership 2000 to develop and maintain our social insurance system. Perhaps Deputy Clohessy will clarify the attitude of the Progressive Democrats to that agreement and the social insurance system.</P>
    <P>This year's budget provides for a reduction in the standard rate of employees' PRSI from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent, to increase the take home pay of the employees concerned.  The tax improvements will also achieve this.  The Partnership 2000 agreement includes a commitment that &ldquo;action on personal taxation will be implemented in an integrated manner with measures to promote social inclusion, to ensure that potential distortion of the labour market is avoided and the impact on work incentives is maintained in the light of current and ongoing labour market conditions&rdquo;. The total value of the tax reform package has been agreed with the social partners and this will be delivered.  However, the scale of tax reforms is not the only consideration.  It is also important that the tax reform package is implemented in a balanced manner that ensures all taxpayers benefit in a significant way from the <Col N="1357" /> measures introduced, but with the emphasis on taking the working poor out of the tax net.</P>
    <P>Low paid workers still bear an unfair proportion of the overall tax burden and many are still caught in the marginal relief trap which arises because of the gap between the tax free allowances and the tax exemption limits.  My priority, in terms of further income tax reform is to increase personal tax allowances sufficiently to close this gap and eliminate that trap.  This will benefit all taxpayers while bringing about a 14 per cent cut in the rate of income tax for low paid employees who still pay income tax at 40 per cent. An approach based on increasing personal allowances also reduces the income tax take from unemployed people who move into low paid employment and thereby encourages employment.</P>
    <P>The public should be aware that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats propose using the resources available for income tax reform to bring about an 8 per cent cut in the 48 per cent rate of income tax, at a cost of £400 million in a full year, giving a bonanza to the best off, while failing to benefit the people on lower incomes who will now pay tax at 26 per cent, or those on even lower earnings who may pay tax at 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>A major focus of attention in this budget is the significant improvements in personal taxation. Equally important is the social welfare dimension of the budget because of its benefits to a wide range of people from insured workers, pensioners and unemployed people to those with a disability, lone parents and families generally.  Social welfare helps every single family, if it includes children for whom child benefit is payable, or elderly people who are entitled to a pension.</P>
    <P>I will describe in some detail the main social welfare improvements in the budget.  They come under seven main headings which encapsulate the strategic objectives of the package: to seriously tackle poverty and social exclusion, to support families and children, to protect pensioners and carers, to improve illness and disability payments, to complete equal treatment in the system, to strengthen social insurance and to encourage employment and the transition from welfare to work.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ways of tackling poverty and social exclusion effectively.  This is a complex issue which goes well beyond ensuring that social welfare payment rates increase each year.  I am proud this Government has initiated a national anti-poverty strategy, in which my Department is playing a central role.  The intensive research, consultation and other work is already bearing considerable fruit.  An essential part of any serious anti-poverty strategy is ensuring that all members of society have adequate incomes which enable them to not merely subsist, but to participate fully in the everyday life of their community.</P>
    <P>Social welfare payments are the baseline income for many members of our society and it is essential that they are adequate to provide the <Col N="1358" /> basis for full social inclusion.  In this budget we are increasing all the personal payments by £3 per week and all adult dependant allowances by £1 .50 per week.  This gives substantial real increases to everyone of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent, about twice the rate of inflation.  It means that the lowest personal weekly rates in the system increase to £65.40 and the highest, the contributory pensions, to £78.00.</P>
    <P>In addition to protecting the real incomes of those dependent on social welfare the Government is committed to implementing the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare ten years ago.  Partnership 2000 contains a further commitment to achieve this by 1999, when the period covered by the agreement ends. Achieving the minimum rates was a key demand of the voluntary and community sector during the negotiations leading to the new partnership.  I am pleased, in this budget, for the third year running, we will make substantial progress towards achieving those rates.  This is the clearest indication that can be given of the Government's commitment in this regard.</P>
    <P>The effect of the 4 per cent to 5 per cent increases in the weekly rates is that more recipients than ever are at the target rate or close to it. Others &mdash; such as contributory pensioners who are at 113 per cent of the rate in 1997 &mdash; continue to be well ahead of it.  Invalidity pensioners will now reach 100 per cent of the target rate for the first time, while most other recipients, who were at 95 per cent of the target rate, will now move up to 98 per cent.  Those on supplementary welfare allowance and short-term unemployment assistance who were at 92 per cent will move up to 95 per cent.  This means all rates except two will be at 98 per cent or more &mdash; a major achievement in its own right, given that the ink is hardly dry on Partnership 2000.  It also means that with increases of a similar order in the next two years, all rates can and should reach that moving target by 1999 as promised.</P>
    <P>The policy direction of concentrating resources for child income support on child benefit, which has been a feature of the last two budgets, is being continued this year.  This approach is in the line with the recommendations of the expert group on the integration of tax and social welfare and the interim report of the Commission on the Family.  It is consistent with the commitment in the Programme for Government and with the thinking in many earlier reports.  The approach involves increasing child benefit as part of a planned strategy of reforming child income support, removing disincentive effects and working towards a basic income for children.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that child benefit is the best mechanism for supporting families and tackling poverty.  It goes to all families with children, but most of it goes to large families who are at greatest risk of poverty.  It is paid mostly to women who spend it mainly on their children and on the household.  The fact that the payment is universal, non-taxable and not affected by taking up <Col N="1359" /> employment means that it has no negative employment effects in terms of unemployment or poverty traps.  The approach I have been taking, and will continue to take, provides real support for families rearing children and at the same time is reforming the system.</P>
    <P>We are giving an increase of £1 per child per month for each of the first two children and £5 per child for the third and subsequent children. The new monthly rates will be £30 each for the first two children and £39 for each child thereafter. This will target greater resources at larger families.  A family of three children will receive £99 per month and a six-child family £216 a month from next September.  Since this Government came to office, a three-child family has received a 52 per cent increase in its child benefit and a five-child family 54 per cent.</P>
    <P>This record stands in stark contrast to that of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  In their last three budgets they increased the twochild benefit rate by a grand total of 72p and £1.15.  In 1991 a four-child family received approximately £70 a month in child benefit.  This year they will receive nearly double that amount, £138 per month.</P>
    <P>Alongside the significant improvements in personal taxation in this budget for low paid workers, I am introducing further improvements in the family income supplement as a means of increasing the return from work to families with children.</P>
    <P>The income thresholds governing entitlement to FIS are being increased by £10 at each point thus ensuring that virtually all current recipients will receive an increase of £6 in their weekly payment. In addition, FIS entitlements will be determined on the basis of gross earnings less any PRSI contributions and levies payable.  Pension contributions are also deductible.</P>
    <P>This is an important first step toward meeting the commitment in Partnership 2000 to move the calculation of FIS onto a net income basis during the lifetime of the partnership.  The effects this year will be to improve the position of all FIS recipients through the increased income thresholds and improved tax-free allowances; to give extra increases to people on FIS who pay PRSI &mdash; that is on earnings over £80 per week &mdash; and the levies &mdash; on earnings over £198 per week &mdash; and to pave the way for completing the move to a net income payment basis next year.</P>
    <P>In addition to the £3 increase in weekly rates, this budget contains ten significant improvements designed specifically to improve the lives of older and retired people, plus two that improve the position of carers.  Some of the measures take account of National Pensions Board proposals, which will also benefit future pensioners; most are aimed specifically at improving the monetary and non-monetary aspects of the &ldquo;pensions package&rdquo; of current pensioners.</P>
    <P>Because of the time constraints on me I will not elaborate on any but the first three of my 12point <Col N="1360" /> plan for improving the position of pensioners and carers.  These dozen improvements &mdash; my alternative to Deputy McCreevy's &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;&mdash; are in Appendix II.  However, I wish to draw Members' attention specifically to the first three.</P>
    <P>First, I am introducing new <i>pro rata</i> pensions so that, in future, people who pay PRSI for a reasonable period of time will receive some contributory pension, as of right.  It may not be the maximum pension but it will be theirs, derived directly from their social insurance contributions.  The present system requires one to have a minimum yearly average of 20 contributions over one's working life in order to qualify for something.  Below 20 contributions one gets nothing and might feel, with some justification, that one's contributions were wasted.  I am providing that a yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions will yield a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 contributions will yield a pension of 50 per cent as long as one has at least 260 paid contributions.</P>
    <P>This measure, which will be introduced in November next, will mean that henceforth people with broken or sporadic contribution records will qualify for a contributory pension.  The reform will be of particular benefit to women who have spent long periods outside the paid workforce, working in the home, and who may not benefit from the 1994 homemakers' provisions as these were not retrospective.  It will also help returned emigrants who may have worked abroad but who had not made contributions that count here; and it will help people who have had spells of selfemployment before the Class S contribution for such workers was introduced in 1988.</P>
    <P>Second, I am rectifying an anomaly affecting self-employed PRSI contributors who entered insurance in 1988 but were already over the age of 56 at that time.  Henceforth they will be eligible to receive a refund of the pensions element of their PRSI provided they do not qualify for a social assistance payment. Heretofore, their earlier contributions precluded them from receiving a refund.</P>
    <P>Third, I am easing the means test for non-contributory old age pensions.  The method of assessing capital and savings held by this group has been the subject of much comment and lobbying. I am now applying to them the new formula I applied to a number of other payments this year.  The same system will apply to carers, non-contributory widows and widowers and people on the pre-retirement allowance.  This measure will represent a significant contribution to achieving the important, long-standing objective of a uniform and consistent treatment of capital and savings for means test purposes across all social assistance schemes.  It is hoped it will lead to a cessation of the criticism that, because we assessed savings of elderly people, they were reluctant to declare their savings or deposit them in building societies, credit unions or other institutions. Henceforth, with the significant increase in the savings allowed before being means-tested, that problem will be largely overcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> The remaining seven improvements for pensioners include further easement of the means test by exempting rental income; the retention of treatment benefits by dependent spouses who currently lose their entitlement by qualifying for independent pensions in their own right; and several important improvements in the free schemes. Finally, in relation to pensioners, I should draw the attention of the House to the fact that the time limit for late claims for certain pensions is being increased from six to 12 months.</P>
    <P>This package for pensioners is an impressive one by any standard targeted specifically at those in greatest need.  The improvements for carers, also shown at Appendix II, are important and build on the special increases given to this group in the last two budgets.</P>
    <P>I want to announce and explain the introduction of a new scheme.  As Members will be aware, disability benefit is the short-term payment for people who are unable to work due to illness or injury and who meet the appropriate social insurance contribution requirements. Its title is confusing and I propose to rename it &ldquo;sickness benefit&rdquo; to divorce it from the idea of permanent disability as opposed to temporary incapacity for work.</P>
    <P>That is on the insurance side of the system.  On the assistance side, we have the disability allowance, formerly the disabled person's maintenance allowance, which is available to people permanently incapacitated who are not entitled to an insurance payment.  However, what is missing is provision for an analogous social assistance payment for people temporarily incapable of work but who do not have sufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for an insurance payment.</P>
    <P>At present, people in that category in need of income support must resort to the supplementary welfare allowance.  During 1995 there were over 12,000 cases where supplementary welfare allowance was paid to people who were unable to work due to illness but who had no entitlement to either disability benefit or disability allowance, then disabled person's maintenance allowance.  In order to meet the specific needs of this group, I am introducing a new social assistance payment to be known as &ldquo;sickness allowance&rdquo;.  Legislative provision for the new payment will be made in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.  I intend the new scheme to come into effect from October next.  At any given time it will provide for the needs of approximately 3,000 people &mdash; 13,500 people in the course of a year &mdash; who are incapable of work and who currently must have recourse to supplementary allowance.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that my Department is now fully responsible for the administration of the new disability allowance which replaced the former disabled person's maintenance allowance operated by the health boards.  Over the past year we have concentrated on ensuring a smoothtransfer of functions.  I am now pleased to be able to introduce a number of improvements <Col N="1362" /> to the allowance, details ofthese changes being shown in Appendix III, in addition to details of two important changes to the occupational injuries benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>The improvements in disability allowance involve paying full personal rates to couples in certain circumstances; introducing part payments for disability allowance recipients who reside in rehabilitative institutions or health care facilities on a part-time basis; and increasing the amount of earnings disregarded when disability allowance recipients take up rehabilitative employment.</P>
    <P>One of the improvements in occupational injuries benefit will protect the survivors of people who may have had an occupational injury or a disease such as pneumoconiosis &mdash; miner's lung &mdash; but who have died from a different or related condition such as heart disease.  The other improvement is to enable the constant attendance allowance to be paid alongside insurance payments, such as invalidity pension and disability benefit, not allowed at present.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in recent years in implementing equal treatment for men and women in all areas of the social welfare code. Various changes have been effected in my Department before and after the relevant European directive so required in order to remove the inequalities that once existed.</P>
    <P>I am proud to say that the Government has not only cleared up the arrears of equal treatment payments owing to 70,000 married women amounting to nearly £300 million which arose from the late and faulty implementation of Directive 79/7 by previous Governments, but we have gone ahead of what the directive requires us to do and have eliminated the last vestiges of sex discrimination even in schemes not covered by the directive.  This is because we are fully committed to the principle of equal treatment, irrespective of whether European law requires us to implement particular changes.</P>
    <P>Last year's budget provided for the introduction of a new one-parent family payment, which came into effect earlier this month and has replaced lone parent's allowance, deserted wife's benefit, deserted wife's allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance.  The new payment covers both men and women equally, irrespective of whether they are married, separated, widowed or divorced or their reasons for being lone parents.  I am particularly pleased to have introduced equal treatment in this area and also to have removed the requirement to prove desertion, as the latter was not only difficult and degrading for many women but tended to perpetuate notions of victimisation and dependency that should belong to a past era.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget I intend to complete once and for all the process of implementing equal treatment for men and women throughout the social welfare code.  This means two changes.  A new widower's non-contributory pension is being introduced from next October for widowers who are not rearing children &mdash; those who are will <Col N="1363" /> continue to qualify for the one parent family payment. The new pension will be subject to a means test and will be available to widowers on the same basis as currently applies to widows, that is, unless and until they cohabit or remarry.  As in the case of the widow's non-contributory pension, a man whose marriage has been dissolved and whose former wife subsequently dies will be entitled to claim the new pension subject to satisfying the means test.</P>
    <P>The more restrictive conditions which apply to the benefits available under the occupational injuries benefit scheme for both widows and widowers are being amended so as to apply on the same basis as currently applies for the schemes for widows and widowers generally.  In short, this involves the alignment of the qualifying conditions applying to the widow's and widower's pension schemes available under the occupational injuries benefit scheme with all other social welfare schemes for widows and widowers.  The consequential changes will take effect from April next.</P>
    <P>I consider it a very major achievement of this Government that in two years and three budgets it has completed an equal treatment programme that all previous Governments funked, fudged and failed to get right.  Moreover, in this budget we are introducing further changes which will specifically benefit women &mdash; in other words, we are going beyond the removal of directly discriminatory provisions and into the area of ensuring that schemes which might be seen as indirectly discriminatory, or just insufficiently advantageous to women, are also amended.</P>
    <P>Changes which I am making in the pensions area and the treatment of adult dependants' earnings come into this category.  The introduction of new <i>pro rata</i> pensions for people with yearly average contributions of between ten and 20 will benefit many women with sporadic employment records.  The introduction of provisions to enable adult dependant's allowances to be retained, in part, when the spouse of a social welfare recipient &mdash; typically the woman &mdash; takes up employment will benefit thousands of families and remove a poverty trap in which thousands of women are currently caught.  The facility for adult dependants to retain treatment benefits after taking up employment while building up their entitlement in their own right will remove another disincentive to work for many women.</P>
    <P>Another major objective of mine is to strengthen the social insurance system by ensuring that workers who pay PRSI, often for decades, get good value for money as well as making their contribution to solidarity between the generations and the different income groups.  I believe it is possible, despite scarce resources and the need to concentrate on raising the lowest rates, to give insured workers better value for their PRSI contributions both in retirement and during their working lives.  I am, therefore, introducing a number of reforms which achieve this and <Col N="1364" /> to also reverse the damage done to the social insurance system by the infamous &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts made by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in early 1992.  I believe that those cuts had a profoundly damaging effect. They shook workers' confidence in what had, until then, been a process of steady improvement in social protection and they undermined people's belief in the solidity of the social contract they thought they had with employers and successive Governments.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, making the following improvements in the social insurance system.  As I mentioned earlier, I am introducing new <i>pro rata</i> pensions for people who have paid PRSI and do not quite qualify for contributory pensions under the present rules.  The minimum rate of maternity and adoptive benefit is being increased to £82.30 per week.  Deputy McCreevy cut maternity benefit from £76 to £60 in 1992 &mdash; a whopping 21 per cent cut &mdash; and I have now effectively restored its value.  I am extending maternity benefit and adoptive benefit to the self-employed as I believe that there should be equal treatment for employed and self-employed women.  This will also mean that class S PRSI is better value for money henceforth.</P>
    <P>Another of Deputy McCreevy's &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts arose from the introduction of an earnings ceiling for treatment benefits &mdash; help towards dental and optical costs.  These benefits are not, in my view, particularly generous or even adequate. They require review and probably some over haul and that is on my agenda.  Nevertheless, they are one of the few tangible benefits insured workers may enjoy during their working and contributing lives.  To deprive any contributors of these benefits on grounds of income was really saying to them in 1992, &ldquo;you get nothing until you get your pension &mdash; but please keep paying in the meantime&rdquo;. I am abolishing the income ceilings on treatment benefits because all PRSI contributors should get a reasonable return and the system, while rightly biased towards people in greatest need, must not neglect its main financiers.  There must be balance.</P>
    <P>Another of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts which has played havoc with some workers lives and incomes was the introduction of a rule which made it more difficult for workers in atypical employment to requalify for unemployment benefit.  The categories of workers affected included seasonal and casual workers such as dockers, firefighters, creamery workers, hotel staff and people in the tourism industry.  Those workers were precluded from requalifying for unemployment benefit until they had a further 13 PRSI contributions paid subsequent to exhausting their unemployment benefit entitlement.  I am now providing that a person can requalify for unemployment benefit by having 13 paid contributions at any stage after the 156th day or six months of unemployment.  This will mean that where the 13 contributions are paid between the 156th and the 390th day, the claimant can requalify <Col N="1365" /> for a further 390 days of unemployment benefit immediately after the first 390 days has been exhausted.  These arrangements will be brought into effect in late March following the enactment of the Social Welfare Bill and I expect that at least 5,000 workers who currently receive reduced rate unemployment assistance will gain on average by £11 a week under this proposal.  It is another change which makes it worthwhile to pay PRSI.</P>
    <P>The introduction of taxation of disability benefit and unemployment benefit was and is widely perceived as part of a general undermining of workers' living standards in the early 1990s and a breach of trust in relation to the PCW.  My objection to the taxation of these benefits, which has been consistent from the start, is not to the principle of taxing all forms of income equally, which I accept and have always promoted, but to the timing, manner and effect of its introduction.</P>
    <P>One of its effects is to reduce the value of social insurance payments to below the level of social assistance payments, which of course undermines the insurance system and the value of people's PRSI contributions.  The solution is threefold: to restore and improve the value of insurance payments; to increase tax-free allowances; and to ameliorate the effects of taxing social welfare payments until such time as there is a larger gap between the level of these payments and the level at which income begins to be taxed.</P>
    <P>This Government has made improvements on each of these three fronts.  We are improving the value of unemployment benefit and disability benefit.  These rates are now at 98 per cent of the agreed target rate and, barring disasters such as a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, should reach the target rate soon.  We have increased tax-free allowances substantially.  We are now providing that disability benefit will not be taxable at all for the first three weeks and next year this will be raised to six weeks.</P>
    <P>Last year's budget was characterised by a coherent, integrated package of measures aimed at tackling unemployment through taxation and PRSI changes, new employment and training initiatives, and reforms in the social welfare system. While new jobs are being created at an unprecedented rate, we are still faced with the challenge of ensuring that those who are currently unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed, are enabled to get access to these new employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's sustained assault on the problem of long-term unemployment, I am introducing a number of measures today.  I have already detailed the significant improvements being made in FIS which will benefit thousands of families who depend on low wages.  The number of places available under the highly successful back to work allowance scheme is being increased by 5,000 from 17,000 to 22,000.  Up to 20 per cent of the new placements &mdash; 1,000 &mdash; are being earmarked for people on the disability allowance.</P>
    <P>Several other very practical supports are being <Col N="1366" /> introduced or extended and the details are in Appendix IV.  Their purpose is to fill gaps, for example, where unemployed people may find it hard to raise small loans or get technical assistance in setting up their own businesses.  They also include important improvements in relation to second chance education and the provision of further resources towards the development of the highly successful European Experience Programme.</P>
    <P>One of my most significant and innovative reforms concerns a change in the way the earnings of very low-paid workers &mdash; most of them women &mdash; are treated in relation to social welfare. I want to describe this in some detail.  The poverty and unemployment trap caused by the withdrawal of the entire adult dependant allowance and half of any child dependant allowances, once the earnings of the spouse of a claimant exceeds £60 per week, has been recognised by myself and others as one of the greatest problems within the social welfare system.  It acts as a huge disincentive to employment and effectively condemns many families to continued long-term dependency on social welfare.</P>
    <P>A few simple examples will demonstrate the extent of the problem.  Where the spouse of a person claiming unemployment benefit earns £60 a week, a £1 increase in the spouse's earnings will lead to a drop of £38.50 in the weekly rate of unemployment payment.  If that same couple had three children, the increase of £1 in the spouse's earnings would lead to a drop of £58.30 in their weekly payment.  The hugely negative effects of this poverty trap have been highlighted by many groups, most notably in the June 1996 report of the Expert Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>My aim was to remove this anomaly as soon as I came into office but, although I included an enabling provision in the Social Welfare Act, 1995, it was not possible to act on it until now.  I have been examining the various options available to resolve this problem and am pleased to announce today that, as a first step, the budget provides for the introduction of a tapered retention of the ADA in the case of recipients of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit disability allowance and pre-retirement allowance.  It is my intention to extend these new measures to the other social welfare payment schemes at an early date, that is, invalidity, retirement, old age and blind pensions, and to further improve the way in which the tapering operates.</P>
    <P>The relevant ADAs will rise to £40 in June. Under the new arrangements, which will be introduced in October, ADAs will be payable at reducing rates, where the spouse's weekly earnings are between £60 and £90, starting at the full £40 and reducing in £6 steps until it tapers off fully.  This very significant change will benefit almost 10,000 families in which the dependent spouse, typically the woman, of a social welfare <Col N="1367" /> recipient is in very low paid employment.  These families will gain on average about £19 per week.</P>
    <P>As a further step towards alleviating the difficulties associated with the withdrawal of the adult dependant allowance when a working spouse earns over £60 per week, any pension contributions will in future be exempted from the assessment of earnings for the purposes of the £60 limit.</P>
    <P>My hope is that this change will not only benefit the few low paid workers who are already members of occupational pension schemes but will also encourage such workers &mdash; and particularly low paid women workers who tend to have very poor or non-existent occupational pension cover &mdash; to become members of pension schemes. As the Minister responsible for the overall development of both public and private pensions provision, I am acutely aware of the need for both tax and social welfare rules to facilitate maximum provision for the most vulnerable and unprotected sections of the workforce.  Otherwise, the &ldquo;working poor&rdquo; of today will be the &ldquo;pension poor&rdquo; of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I want to mention two other changes designed to help social welfare recipients into employment or remove barriers to them doing so.  The first also concerns the dependent spouses of social welfare recipients.  At present, they qualify for dental and optical benefits by virtue of their partner's PRSI contributions but lose eligibility if they earn in excess of £60 per week and then have to wait quite some time until they qualify again in their own right.  This is clearly a disincentive or at least a penalty for taking up work or getting a pay rise so I am enabling them to retain their eligibility in the meantime.  This improvement will be of particular benefit to married women returning to the labour force after a period of homeworking, child care or elder care.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the subject of work friendly welfare, I introduced a measure last year whereby child dependant allowances continue to be paid to people who had been unemployed for 12 months or more when they took up employment.  This has helped in overcoming the disincentive facing unemployed people with families in trying to get back to work.  I am now extending the provision to include other groups, namely, people moving from community employment into employment and people on the live register or in community employment who take up employment under the &ldquo;jobs initiative&rdquo; announced last year.</P>
    <P>The extent to which the Government has revolutionised what used to be a relatively passive social welfare system and has turned it into a work friendly system which encourages and supports people in their attempts to find, create, take up and remain in employment, seems to have escaped the attention of the Opposition and many media commentators.  A Deputy who doubles as a lawyer and journalist is a particular offender in this regard.  I hesitate to mention his name in case he runs to his big sister for protection. <Col N="1368" /> In the past two years, he has &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; poverty traps, disincentives, high replacement ratios and all manner of other evils.  However, while he has been railing about these problems in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and pretending he can solve them while at the same time cutting £2,000 million out of our tax and PRSI, we have been quietly and effectively addressing them.  Could I suggest a little homework to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and, perhaps, to Deputy Harney who again repeated the old canard that social welfare is trapping people in unemployment? Read the last two Social Welfare Acts and the Social Welfare Bill, 1997, which I am publishing today, before making any more uninformed comments.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to the fact that we have provided significant increases in our grants this year, in our support for the National Social Services Board, and are continuing the £2 million grant for security for the elderly which has in the past year provided support to 500 voluntary organisations and resulted in the improvement in the security of 15,000 of our most vulnerable elderly citizens.</P>
    <P>This is the third budget which has been introduced by this Government and it shares many of the characteristics of its two predecessors.  It contains considerable innovation, it provides for further consolidation and reform of the social welfare system and the reforms are well targeted and focused on bringing about greater social inclusion.  The budget brings real improvements in the living standards of people who rely wholly on social welfare for their income, on a combination of social welfare and low pay or occupational pensions.  It provides genuine support for families, whether in work or out of work.  It also aims to provide a bridge for the unemployed to cross into the workplace and for the excluded to play a fuller role in society.  The budget changes also serve to ensure that the fruits of our successfully managed and thriving economy are shared by all.  They provide a reward for those who work and incentives for others to seek employment. They also complete the long &mdash; and, for all previous Governments, the seemingly impossible &mdash; process of removing sex discrimination and ensuring equal treatment for men and women.</P>
    <P>The range and depth of the measures contained in this budget is testimony to this Government's commitment to improving the quality of life for all our citizens.  It also demonstrates the extent of the activities of my Department.  Not alone does it provide crucial income support payments to hundreds of thousands of people every week &mdash; workers, pensioners and families &mdash; but it also provides vital employment support services and supports many voluntary and community groups through the community development programme and the money advice and budgeting service.  We are deeply involved in developing policy and strategies for long-term social and economic development with particular emphasis on tackling poverty in our society.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have to say that it gives me considertegie <Col N="1369" /> able satisfaction to have remedied the damage done to the social welfare system by the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts introduced in early 1992 by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and to have achieved major additional reforms as well.  This is not to say that the system is now perfect. However, the strategic changes of the last two years have made it into a rare combination of a helping hand for those who need it, who cannot work and need protection, and a springboard for those who need help into the paid workforce. More reform is needed, but it is a system which is already highly responsive to varying needs and my hope is that it will be made even more so by this Government in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>One thing is for sure.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are entirely devoid of a coherent strategy in relation to social welfare. One of them wants to slash social welfare payments while the other wants to pay people more. One of them talks about closing gaps and traps while the other was responsible for creating them.</P>
    <P>In office, Deputy McCreevy was a slash and burn Minister who did immense damage to the integrity of the system.  From the safety of opposition, he is virtually silent on the subject while Deputy O'Rourke, in the role of Mrs. Doyle, dispenses metaphorical cups of tea to every interest group.  Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil's minimalist spokesman on social welfare and former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Joe Walsh, who is not here today, does not even know which Department has functional responsibility for butter vouchers. As for the Progressive Democrats, Deputy &ldquo;Hong Kong&rdquo; Harney offers workfare solutions, while Deputy McDowell works on the abolition of what he sees as the social welfare monster &mdash; I am not too sure whether he is referring to the system or the Minister.  It is not a pretty prospect. They are not only divided among themselves, they want to create an even more deeply divided society between the haves and the have nots. However, Democratic Left and our partners in Government will not let that happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now running out of the House and is not prepared to give the projected number of unemployed in 1997, on which these figures are based.  I asked a very simple question, the answer to which was neither given in the budget nor in the Minister's speech.  Why is <Col N="1370" /> the Government running away from that figure? Measures were introduced in the budget which suggest that the Estimates need to be revised and there is a duty on the Government to give the revised figure.  The addition of an extra 5,000 people to the excellent back to work scheme, which I introduced on behalf of Fianna Fáil, will have an effect on the budgetary figures.  Why will the Minister not give the estimated figure for this year?  We need that information to discuss sensibly what is happening.</P>
      <P>The Government wants to spread good news like confetti.  There is no question that this is an election budget.  There is no major improvement for pensioners and widowers.  Some tidying up has been done.  I welcome the improvement in child benefit, which is based on a report completed just before this Government came to office.  The change in <i>pro rata</i> pensions is a very important development and follows on the existing trend.  The Government is throwing money about, a little here and a little there, like confetti, but the confetti is being thrown not at the marriage but at the end of the rainbow coalition, and it is necessary if the Government is to save its neck.</P>
      <P>It took a great deal of very hard work to bring about the present prosperity, which was built on good strategy, good work and a good relationship with the social partnership, set up under a Fianna Fáil Government and continued up to the present Government.  That is the basis for the present low interest rates, cheap mortgages, low inflation and excellent growth.  It has resulted in the prosperity the country is enjoying.  That was not brought about by spreading money around like confetti on a pre-election basis.  If we look at the dates when the various measures will come into operation, the bets in terms of the date of the election are hedged.  The more we consider the thought that went into this budget on the part of the three members of the rainbow coalition the more we realise that this is an election budget.</P>
      <P>The real question is where do we go from here. That is the question the Government should consider. It should take a tight grip on expenditure, keep inflation and interest rates low and reduce the burden of taxation while increasing support for enterprise and employment.  In particular, it should look after those who are sick, suffer disability or are less well off, particularly pensioners and widows who have not been well looked after in the three budgets of this rainbow coalition.  I will return to that matter later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of adopting a sensible, solid approach and building on the gains already made, the Government decided to let loose the reins and perhaps introduce another budget in the autumn to correct the ship's course.  Instead of adopting a safe, careful, prudent approach, which has been adopted for a number of years, the Government put before the House a budget designed specifically for an election.  One thing that struck me &mdash; this is mentioned in one of the papers this morning &mdash; is that the budget is full of sweeteners.  It <Col N="1371" /> is a sweeteners budget, designed to make people feel good about the current circumstances, but that will not work.  The budget is shortsighted and irresponsible.  There is no economic strategy and there are no safeguards for the future.  It is a budget based on a forthcoming election and it will result in a second budget in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Apart from the changes in child benefit, the first steps of which were taken under a Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, and <i>pro rata</i> pensions, I welcome the improvements in the back to work scheme, particularly the allocation of 1,000 places for people on disability allowance.  I also welcome the improvements in FIS, for which net income will be used as a yardstick.  However, one major improvement which could have been made in FIS and would have had a major impact on employment is the extension of the scheme to the self-employed. Even though the money was available that was not done.  When I talk about the self-employed I am talking about the many thousands of carpenters, bricklayers and others who are regarded as self-employed and would previously have been full A class contributors.  I welcome the improvement for carers and the easing of the means test.  We will discuss some of those measures at another stage.</P>
    <P>We are now at a critical stage because EU funding is running out.  We should be preparing to deal with the position when EU funding is diminished.  The theory is that when the present allocation is spent we will receive no more money, but I do not subscribe to that.  If the Government does its homework and negotiates the terms, we will continue to receive some EU funding.  We have a difficulty in that EU funding is based on gross domestic product which, because of the repatriation of profits, is a bad indicator for Ireland.  Our position looks much better in terms of gross domestic product than in terms of gross national product.  We are disadvantaged in the calculation of these funds.  After 1999 we will receive less funding from the European Union.  The Government will have to support some of the major and very beneficial programmes we have currently.  There is a major inflow of funds from the EU which, if not severely reduced before 1999, will taper off after it. We are all enjoying the major development of our roads.  Many wonderful roads have been built under a plan published by Fianna Fáil when it was in office in 1980.  The EU has had a major input into road development but after 1999 we will have to fund the maintenance cost of such roads.</P>
    <P>The national debt is £30 billion and nothing has been done to reduce it.  We must stop that debt growing if we are to provide opportunities for the future.  This is the time to do that while we have an inflow of EU funds.  We must get the national debt, which amounts to £27,000 in terms of every worker, under control.  We cannot allow it to continue to grow, otherwise we will not be able to <Col N="1372" /> avail of opportunities to develop when EU funding tapers off.</P>
    <P>When that happens we will not be able to adjust interest rates and if the economy slows down we will have to rely on fiscal policy.  We must reduce growth in Government expenditure. We should be prudent in what we do now.  We should direct benefits to those who need them most and we should plan for the future because while there is great growth now we will face a big shock after 1999.  We want to be prepared for that and be able to take it in our stride.  We can do so, but we will not do it with this confetti budget.  If an international slump were to coincide with a reduction in the flow of EU funds, there is a danger that we would find ourselves in real difficulties.</P>
    <P>Recently we entered into an EU stability pact under which we cannot run budget deficits greater than 3 per cent of GDP.  If the Government overheats the economy we cannot run a deficit under the budget.  We cannot make up the shortfall in budgetary terms.</P>
    <P>We must also face the fact that the need for pension cover will continue to grow.  We must provide for the demand for pensions which will start to climb early in the new millennium.  We are receiving considerable extra money from the self-employed but instead of building on that to meet future needs, it is being spent.  We are not taking the necessary steps to prepare for the obvious dangers and difficulties that will face us in the future.  The Government sees itself having a mini budget in the autumn and that is the approach it is taking.</P>
    <P>The budget is a particularly poor deal for the 1.4 million people in receipt of social welfare benefits.  The last three budgetary situations were the best we have had in a long time.  The Government is in the happy position that it can spend the benefits that flow from the work done under the social partnership.  It can do that thanks to the initiation of that social partnership by Fianna Fáil and the co-operation of all the social partners, particularly the workers, in making it possible.  It has been good for everybody.  However, during the past three years the less well off have received an average of a 3 per cent increase in their income.  The Minister for Finance pointed out yesterday that an old age pensioner got an increase of £7 during that period made up of yearly increases of £1.80, £2.20, and £3 in this election year, respectively.  It is just as well this is an election year because at least the increase has been stretched to £3.  An increase of £7 over three years does not represent a great participation by the less well off in the share out of the new growth and wealth the country is experiencing.</P>
    <P>During that period, a widow received annual increases of £1.60, £2 and £3 in this election year, respectively, making a total of £6.60 over three years, giving an average annual increase over the period of £2.20 and bringing her income up to £71.10.  Old age pensioners and widows should have been selected by the Government for special <Col N="1373" /> increases and improvements in their income because they are among the most vulnerable groups and their position should be recognised when the growth and benefits of social partnership are being shared out.</P>
    <P>Those on disability allowance who were brought into the social welfare category received increases over that three year period of £1.50, £2 and £3, respectively, a total of £6.50 over that period bringing their weekly income up to the princely sum of £67.50.  There are not so many in that category.  Why did the Government not increase that group's income which would not have involved a large cost?  That group were looking forward to some real improvement now that they are included in the social welfare category, but that improvement was not forthcoming.  A simple solution was taken, an across the board social welfare increase of £3 was given and the differences between groups in receipt of social welfare benefit were ignored.  The position of those who are worse off, more vulnerable, less well able to provide for themselves and in receipt of social welfare benefit was ignored.  The Government adopted the view that a general social welfare increase of £3 would do fine for this year and for election purposes.</P>
    <P>Those in receipt of unemployment benefit of £67.50 per week are in a similar position.  That income will not go very far for the bona fide unemployed who will not consider they are getting much of a share of the new productivity and growth the country is experiencing.  It was mentioned yesterday that 272,000 were unemployed in 1994 and 271,000 were unemployed in December 1996.  Effectively there has been virtually no change in the number unemployed even though many have joined the back to work allowance scheme.  There is a serious and continuing problem particularly in terms of long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government announced a further addition to the valuable and effective back to work scheme.  The number allowed to participate in the scheme will be increased from 17,000 to 22,000 and there is the welcome introduction of a category for those in receipt of disability benefit. The number involved will be 1,000.  Why should a ceiling be set on the number of unemployed who are allowed to return to work?  If more unemployed are seeking to return to work, why not expand this effective scheme?  That would involve a cost, but it would also provide a saving. I asked the Minister earlier the effect of that proposed measure on the number on the live register this year.  We have not been given that figure. Neither the Minister for Finance yesterday nor the Minister for Social Welfare today has given that figure, the average weekly figure expected post-budget which will be in the Revised Estimates and the figure on which they are based. The only conclusion one can come to is that neither wants to be the person to give it.  We will not know where we stand until we have it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> Widows and women working in the home should be allowed to participate in the scheme and assisted in re-entering the workplace.  There are no incentives for them to do so.  Having spent time looking after their children in the home, many women are anxious to return to the workforce but they are debarred from participating in the vast majority of schemes.</P>
    <P>The Government should do for these women what it did for people in receipt of lone parent's allowance, that is, reserve a percentage of places, say 10 per cent, to allow women in the home acquire the skills necessary to avail of job opportunities in areas such as telemarketing.  To recognise their existence &mdash; they are not entitled to unemployment assistance because their spouse's income is too high &mdash; there should be a home to business register which would allow them to qualify for a specified period for State training programmes. Their financial circumstances do not permit them to acquire these new skills in private commercial institutions.  The Government should address this matter without further delay.</P>
    <P>On butter vouchers, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, is annoyed with Deputy Joe Walsh.  People on social assistance are very upset at the severe reduction of 50 per cent in the number of vouchers to which they are entitled.  Instead of receiving two for themselves and for each of their dependants, from now on they will receive only one.  Deputy Walsh drew attention to this.  In 1995, when 22 million vouchers were issued at a cost of £9 million, 855,000 benefited under the scheme.  The reduction will, therefore, result in a saving of £4.5 million.</P>
    <P>Like Pontius Pilate, the Minister for Social Welfare washed his hands of the matter and said it is not his responsibility, that he only issues the vouchers.  Responsibility is shared between the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  During the short period I was Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the European Union proposed to reduce the number of vouchers but I insisted that it be retained.  I do not know whether the blame lies with the Minister for Social Welfare or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry but between them they have made a bags of it with the result that the number of vouchers for the poorest of the poor, those on social assistance, is to be halved.  That should not be allowed to happen and Deputy Walsh was right to draw our attention to it.</P>
    <P>On matters appropriate to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, there is not much to say.  There is no reference to counselling and mediation services for which funding is badly needed.  Neither is there any reference to the Commissioner for Children or the need to equip the courts to deal with divorce and family breakdown cases.  In addition, there are no special incentives for small business to stimulate the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare was very slow to deal with the issue of fraud and abuse and to <Col N="1375" /> mention the savings he hopes to make this year. I am very concerned about this.  It is important to keep a tight grip on unwarranted claiming.</P>
    <P>Child dependant allowances have once again been frozen.  A widow with three children is in receipt of £68.10 plus £51 in child dependant allowances giving a total of £119.10.  She will receive an increase of £3 bringing the total to £122.10.  This amounts to a real increase of 2.5 per cent but the picture will not look as rosy when the payment dockets are issued.  If one takes child benefit into account, the increase is 3.8 per cent approximately.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare said he would like to see the social insurance fund placed on a solid basis.  In 1996 there was a deficit of £82 million. According to the Estimates for 1997 there is a deficit of £56.5 million to which £57.3 million will be added giving a total of £113.8 million.  We struggled hard to achieve a break even balance in the social insurance fund for the reasons the Minister outlined.  It is the workers' fund and we want it to be strong.  The Minister said he wanted to reduce the charges on workers but he had the option of reducing the levy and not the social insurance fund.  Reducing the social insurance fund weakens the position of workers because a future Minister for Social Welfare will have to ask the Minister for Finance for the money to cover the deficit in the fund in the first instance before seeking further money.</P>
    <P>What is taking place in this budget is a weakening of the social insurance fund.  The demands on workers could have been relieved and pensioners would also have benefited if the 1 per cent levy had been removed or substantially reduced. However, the Government chose the soft option of pulling down the social insurance fund.  That is not consistent with the Minister for Social Welfare's remarks today, and his remarks were correct. If the Government does not watch over that fund the consequences for workers in the future will be bad and that concerns me.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I do not have time to speak further on the budget as it contains many items of great interest.  The Government strategy is wrong.  This is a confetti budget which spreads little pieces of benefit everywhere.  It is an election year but it is a pity the people who depend most on the Government did not get more.  The public wants the Government to do that.  People who are generating wealth in our society want the Government to keep expenditure under control by not wasting money but they want pensioners, widows and the genuinely sick to be looked after and they will say as much.  That is what the Government has not done.  It simply allocated a £3 increase across the board.  That was not good strategy and I regret it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the conclusions of Deputy Woods but I acknowledge his expertise in social welfare and I will take note of his contribution.  I <Col N="1376" /> have listened carefully to the speeches of Opposition spokespersons and, so far, they have been the least inspiring I have ever heard.  We are accused by Fianna Fáil of putting forward an election budget in an election year.  It reminds me of the famous remark by Daniel O'Connell, &ldquo;now that I have been praised in the House of Commons, it is time to examine my conscience&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What would Fianna Fáil have done in these circumstances? There will be an election in 1997, but are we to believe that Fianna Fáil, with the track record to which Deputy McCreevy referred yesterday, would have introduced a hairshirt budget this year?  The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern, said this morning that Fianna Fáil &ldquo;never took risks with the economy&rdquo;. It might be true that it never took risks with the Greek or German economies but, as Deputy McCreevy said about four times yesterday, that party took unbelievable risks with the Irish economy in the 1970s.</P>
      <P>It has been a &ldquo;heads I win, tails you lose&rdquo; performance by Fianna Fáil.  On the one hand we are told we are reckless and profligate with the public's money and, on the other, we are told we are not giving away enough.  It is so transparent the only recommendation one can make to Fianna Fáil is that they badly need a new act.</P>
      <P>We know where the Progressive Democrats stand. They published a five year plan which would strip £2.8 billion from the economy and give it to people who are already well off.  That does not make sound economic sense.  They would pay for it by getting rid of nearly 4,000 jobs in the public sector, by reducing unemployment benefits in real terms in order to drive thousands of people off the live register and by embarking on a privatisation spree.  If Deputy Michael McDowell implemented these economic policies and delivered them, it would be like Henry Street on Christmas Eve &mdash;&ldquo;get the last of the public utilities&rdquo; and &ldquo;three State banks for a few million pounds&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One of the funniest aspects of the Progressive Democrats' contribution to this debate so far has been their attempt to compare their approach with that taken by Tony Blair in Britain.  This is the new shroud they have acquired.  They neglect to mention, however, that Tony Blair's approach is dedicated to getting rid of the very policies the Progressive Democrats espouse.</P>
      <P>The Opposition parties and some conservative commentators attempt to portray us as high spenders, especially by comparison with Britain and Germany.  I have yet to meet a Deputy who is not seeking spending in some area of his or her constituency, whether it is on hospitals, school facilities, roads or sanitary services.  Although we are accused of being high spenders, the same parties and commentators never admit that the percentage of GDP used for public spending in Germany is about 50 per cent and in Britain about 42 per cent.  Compare that to the percentage of GDP public spending consumes in Ireland, the third lowest in Europe at about 37 per cent, and it is clear they are just peddling another myth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1377" /> Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats say they yearn for the good old days of 1992 when they were last in Government together and when, they claim, they cut tax rates by more than the Government did yesterday.  They might now remember those days as happy ones, but they were the days of the &ldquo;temporary little arrangement&rdquo; when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats fought for months on end and when budget tax cuts were geared to the highest income earners in the land and, as far as I am concerned, were misdirected.</P>
    <P>What is really annoying the Opposition, as I saw on its Members' faces yesterday, is that we have put together not just a good budget but an exceptional economic track record.  The performance of the economy in recent years under the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, has been extraordinary by any standards.  The growth of output has been several times the EU average and, in recent years, employment growth has outstripped the EU average and unemployment has been falling at the same time.  More that 100,000 jobs were created under Deputy Quinn's stewardship. Compare that to the 47 jobs that were lost every day in 1992 when Deputy O'Malley was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That is a record of under-achievement.</P>
    <P>According to European Commission data, Ireland's GDP per head has risen from 76 per cent of the EU average in 1991 to about 100 per cent in 1996.  At the same time stability has been maintained, inflation has remained moderate, Government borrowing has consistently been below the EU average and the debt burden has fallen steadily.  For the eighth year in a row, Ireland has met the key Maastricht criteria comfortably and the provisions we have made will ensure that we will maintain that record into the future.</P>
    <P>The reasons for this performance are many and varied.  However, no independent and fair minded commentator would deny our success is related to a combination of the following factors: prudent management of the economy which has led to lower interest rates and increased investor and consumer confidence; the consensus approach in successive agreements between the social partners which has resulted in moderate pay increases, industrial peace and broad maintenance of competitiveness; the strong growth in foreign direct investment which has raised capacity, particularly in exporting industries; the contribution of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds which have added to domestic demand but which have improved the infrastructure and productive capacity of the economy and the benefits of substantial investment in education and training over many years which have raised the productive capacity of our labour force.</P>
    <P>The conditions are in place for a continuation of strong, non-inflationary economic growth over the next few years.  A recovery is under way in <Col N="1378" /> continental Europe following a slow down in 1996.  In Ireland GNP is projected to grow by about 5.5 per cent this year and by about 4.5 per cent in 1998 and 1999, with employment growing by about 38,000 jobs per annum on average over the next three years.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness has been negotiated.  The 1997 budget begins the process of implementing that programme through tax reductions and targeted expenditure aimed at promoting social inclusion and equality.  The Partnership 2000 measures are intended to enhance further the economy's capacity for strong, sustainable, non-inflationary employment and output growth over the next three years.</P>
    <P>That is the background.  By any yardstick, our management of the economy has been strong and effective, and Opposition criticism of it is nothing more than hollow sham.  However, that is only half the story.  We have not set out to manage a strong, growing economy just for its own sake. That is not the reason we are in politics.  The role of the State in ensuring that our economy is civilised and inclusive and that necessary redistribution continues to take place is as important today as it ever was.</P>
    <P>That is the reason I am proud that social welfare increases in this budget have been introduced at twice the rate of inflation and that the health package for which we provided funds yesterday will allow a good deal of further progress in areas where it is most urgently needed.  I am proud that we have enabled a permanent, independent and representative Council for the Status of People with Disabilities to be established immediately and to have a budget with which it can make significant changes.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the budget we have made further changes.  The wideranging reform of local government, announced recently by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, including the reform of local government financing, has been widely welcomed.  The roads package and measures we have taken to move rapidly to make every primary school a decent and welcoming environment are important measures and their effects will be felt for many years.  Any Government would like to do more.  Within the constraints of firm control of public finances, a determination to be fair to every sector and the need to plan for the future, no Government could have done more than we did yesterday in the budget.</P>
    <P>In her contribution this morning Deputy Harney described this economy, which has attracted so much admiration around the world, as the product of the involvement of dinosaurs in economic management.  If the economy is the result of the work of dinosaurs I would not like to see the results of the work of the rottweilers she seems to prefer.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's budget, although primarily the work of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, owes much to the involvement of the social partners &mdash; public servants, farmers, workers and <Col N="1379" /> their trade unions, employers and their organisations. A significant role in those negotiations was played too by the so-called &ldquo;Third Strand&rdquo;, who were involved for the first time.  The INOU, CORI, the Combat Poverty Agency and others have all had an input, not just into the budget but into Partnership 2000.  The model of social partnership, of which Partnership 2000 is a superb example, is a model to which I and my party are strongly committed.  We have helped to inform the debates that take place among the social partners by our sponsorship of the independent National Economic and Social Forum.</P>
    <P>The end result is that this country is moving forward as a unit.  There is broad agreement in terms of the analysis of problems and a willingness to face them.  There is broad commitment to the principles of social solidarity and to the need for sustained economic growth.  There is a consensus around the priority that must be attached to job creation and protection.</P>
    <P>Because of the strength of that consensus, it is possible to treat the carping and negative criticism that comes from the other side of the House for what it is.  The strength of that consensus is to be found in that in typical manner both the Opposition parties can attack everything that social partnership produces, yet both commit themselves to sustaining Partnership 2000 in the unlikely event that they are returned to office.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to announce that Ireland is to bid for the Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2003.  The Special Olympics World Summer Games are organised every four years, usually in July.  They create an international stage to demonstrate the abilities of people with a learning difficulty.  Seven thousand athletes from more than 140 countries participate in 19 sports at these games.</P>
    <P>Staging the world games would provide a significant boost to our tourism industry.  It is estimated that at least £11 million would be generated in additional tourism expenditure by visitors from the participating countries in the year of the games.  The reputation of Ireland as a tourism destination and a venue for major sporting events would be significantly enhanced.  Significant social benefits would also flow from the increased awareness of people with a learning disability and the enormous nation-wide community and voluntary input which the games would require.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the bid for the games follows from research by an interdepartmental group, chaired by my office, as to the feasibility of Ireland hosting the event, particularly in the light of the facilities and infrastructure available to meet the challenges arising.  The group found that Ireland could host a world class games in 2003 and reported to Government on the matter late last year.  The Government endorsed the findings of the group and authorised the preparation of a formal bid to be submitted to Special Olympics International in November 1997.  I will publish the report of the group today and copies <Col N="1380" /> will be made available to all Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Many Members will know that Special Olympics was founded by Eunice Kennedy Shriver in 1968.  Today there are more than 140 countries with their own national programmes.  Ireland has been to the forefront in the development of Special Olympics world-wide.  In 1985 the first European Special Olympic Games were held in Dublin when 2,000 athletes from 17 countries participated. Special Olympics Ireland is an excellent organisation covering the 32 counties of Ireland and I have every confidence that the people involved will prepare a first class bid for these games.</P>
    <P>I have seen at first hand how participation in Special Olympics gives people with learning difficulties the opportunity to demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in sharing their gifts, skills and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes and the community. This is an exciting and worthwhile initiative which I commend to the people.  I look forward to support from all political parties and the support of the business community, the voluntary and community sector and the general public in our effort to bring these games to Ireland in 2003.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested the budget brought in yesterday was an election budget.  I will not deny this is an election year, although commentators will be surprised at the amount of work we intend to complete before we go to the country.  I believe when the election is called we will be judged on far more than this budget, important though it is. We will be judged on the extent to which we turned around the disastrous social record left by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in 1992.  We will be judged on the number of jobs we have created, the amount of investment we have attracted and the degree to which we have strengthened our social and economic structure.</P>
    <P>In the election we will offer the people a choice. It will not be a choice of privatisation, social services stripped to the bone and tax cuts only geared towards high income earners.  We will offer a choice of social progress and economic responsibility.  We will offer a vision of strength and social solidarity and a dynamic future for this country.  Yesterday's budget was an important part of the groundwork for that vision and I support the recommendation made by the Minister for Finance yesterday when he commended the budget to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the budget.  I will comment on the system that has developed in recent years whereby Members come into the House to listen to the Budget Statement which does not contain any news because we have heard it all before.  Tuesday's <i>Irish Independent</i> detailed everything the Minister was due to tell us the following day.  Again the budget details have been leaked despite the difficulties such leaks created for the Government when it introduced its first <Col N="1381" /> budget.  It had to sack one of its Ministers of State as a result of his eagerness to spread the news.  It appears no lessons have been learned since then and the only sin now is to be caught.  Ministers have obviously learned how to avoid being caught but it has not prevented them passing on the information which makes a nonsense of the budget.  I realise when there are three parties in Government, particularly in an election year, they would be keen to spread good news but such a practice is not acceptable for a national Parliament. Regardless of the Government in power, as a Parliament we must take a strong stance in this regard in the future.</P>
      <P>Looking back over the past 12 months the Government can claim it has made history in that no other Government managed to score so many own goals in such a short time.  The Government has gone from crisis to crisis.  The crisis in the agriculture industry has created enormous uncertainty among farmers who are facing a bleak future with little hope.  The Dunnes Stores controversy has created enormous problems for politics and left a sour taste in the mouths of many innocent people.  Other issues include the hepatitis C problem, the threatened nurses' strike and the repeated crises in the Department of Justice where nobody, apparently, is in charge.  In that context it is understandable that Ministers were keen to spread the news because, for most of them, it was their first opportunity to give what they considered good news and they made the most of it.</P>
      <P>The budget contains a number of necessary measures which I welcome.  For example, I agree with the social welfare increases.  However, my major concern about the budget is that, overall, money is being spent which we cannot afford. This cannot continue.  If an election had been held last year, the budget would be very different. However, given the nature of politics, I am sure the energy of Members seeking re-election will be put into ensuring their return to the House. The budget lacks a long-term strategy and I hope the next Government, which is not far away, will remedy that position.</P>
      <P>I wish to concentrate on my county and the developments and changes necessary there. Kildare now has two constituencies and, by coincidence, two very different areas.  North Kildare has experienced tremendous growth and population increase while south Kildare, with the exception of the Newbridge area, is static or, in some villages, in decline.  Much of this area suffered severely from the phasing out of employment in Bord na Móna and the ESB.  Perhaps the long promised peat fuelled electricity generating station will take up the slack but it will hardly make up for the great loss the people of Kilberry, Coilldubh and Rathangan have suffered.  I hope the siting of the station will reflect the return to office of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wondrous growth in north Kildare has not yet percolated beyond Naas and Newbridge and <Col N="1382" /> a proper balance must be introduced by the Government.  Given that Kildare County Council has been requested by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, to produce an acceptable strategy in its development plan, I call on the Minister to assist it in carrying out the strategy. It is obvious that development in south Kildare cannot proceed unless infrastructure is put in place to allow it to happen.  If the necessary services are not available, there cannot be growth.  I refer to the crying need for water and sewerage facilities and roads in south Kildare.  If we are to depend on the greater Dublin water supply regional study, south Kildare will be a desert with an oasis, endangered by septic tank effluent and pollution and without a motorway.</P>
    <P>An independent report, &ldquo;Strategic Development in County Kildare&rdquo;, prepared by Jonathan Blackwell &amp; Associates, states:</P>
    <P>Development in south and west Kildare is also restricted by the current supply of water. It is planned to upgrade water supply to rural areas of south Kildare through construction of the south Kildare regional water scheme.  Part of this will involve linking the Kilcullen reservoir to Athy.  Other areas of south Kildare, including Castledermot town, will be served by the north Carlow regional scheme.</P>
    <P>The famous south Kildare regional water scheme has been promised for the past 30 years. However, I doubt it will happen this century.  The motorway was built as far as Kildare town and has succeeded in moving the bottleneck to Rowanville in Kildare town from Newbridge.  It also by-passed Kilcullen and left it in an unlinked cul-de-sac.  It appears the Portlaoise by-pass is planned before the Kildare/Monasterevin by-pass. Surely it does not make sense to leave two bottlenecks in the middle of the biggest and most heavily trafficked motorway in the country.  If I were a surgeon I would recommend a triple by-pass to solve the problem or a psychologist might recommend the National Roads Authority for immediate assessment.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about cherishing the nation equally we must ensure that we do not allow a two speed Ireland to develop.  If a large industrialist wanted to set up shop in south Kildare, that person could not be guaranteed adequate water and sewerage facilities or proper transport facilities. There is much potential for development in the Naas/Newbridge/Kilcullen triangle, as envisaged by the Myles Wright report of many years ago.  This should be urgently reactivated because it is perhaps the best immediate solution. Development has come from Dublin to north Kildare along the motorway as far as Kilcock and leading to Clane, Sallins, Naas and Newbridge. Much as we would wish, we cannot expect it to leapfrog to Monasterevin, Rathangan, Castledermot and Athy immediately but the Myles Wright plan would nudge it in the right direction.  In the long-term, we want the people of south Kildare <Col N="1383" /> to reap the benefit of the booming economy for which &ldquo;Super Quinn&rdquo; has claimed credit.</P>
    <P>Is it too much to ask the area's three representatives who hold ministerial posts to ensure Kildare is not viewed as a dormitory for the greater Dublin area, a place where the capital can extract its water from Ballymore and Leixlip reservoirs, where it can dump its refuse in Kill for the next 25 years and where motorways can be built to provide Dublin commuters and country shoppers with easy access to their destinations?  It is ironic and perhaps to a degree shows how out of touch the Government has become when one notes the great emphasis the Minister for the Environment placed on abolishing water charges.</P>
    <P>The truth is that if it were not for the recent by-election in which Mr. Joe Higgins performed so well, this issue would not be on the agenda.  It is the middle of winter, yet last weekend large areas of south Kildare did not have a proper water supply.  These people would be willing to pay water charges if they had a proper water service. Unfortunately, that basic necessity is still only a dream for many people in Kildare.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter which deserves urgent attention.  The Minister visited south Kildare last weekend and he should be familiar with the problem.  I hope urgent action is taken.</P>
    <P>In the past year a voluntary early retirement scheme was introduced for Army personnel. There were a number of reasons for the scheme and the Minister said on a number of occasions that he was keen to reduce the average age of members of the Defence Forces.  While that is commendable in some respects, it upset some people.  At present the Army is being asked to carry out the same duties, and in some cases more duties, with fewer people.  This cannot continue. Difficult decisions have been postponed.  It was easy to introduce a voluntary early retirement package which facilitated people who had the opportunity to take up employment elsewhere.  It gave them a small golden handshake to thank them for their efforts.  That was an attractive offer for some people which they could not refuse, but for many others it caused more problems than it solved.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Michael Smith and I pointed out previously to the Minister for Defence, as a result of the voluntary early retirement package there are fewer people running many barracks although the same housekeeping duties are necessary.  We have to take the bull by the horns and make the necessary decisions.  Members of the Defence Forces are not fools.  They realise the present situation cannot continue and that difficult decisions will have to be made.  If this Government does not take them, the next Fianna Fáil Government will.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of our Defence Forces is recognised by all as necessary, and members of the Defence Forces know that better than Members of this House.  However, they would <Col N="1384" /> like to see the full picture of where their future lies.  At this moment there is great uncertainty among members of the Defence Forces about their future.  Major changes have been made in their work practices and in their lives, but no commitment has been given to reinvest some of the savings that have been made in new buildings, infrastructure and equipment, all of which are necessary.  There is no long-term strategy for the Defence Forces, and it is an insult to the members of the Defence Forces to allow this situation to continue.  They realise that change is necessary.</P>
    <P>In any organisation where change is being implemented tough decisions have to be made, and there will be good news and bad news.  The members of the Defence Forces are not so foolish that they do not know there has to be pain if the restructuring that is so necessary is to take place. I appeal to the Minister, even at the eleventh hour, to sit down with the representative bodies and explain his plan for the Defence Forces.  For far too long he has taken them for granted.  They have an enormous contribution to make and they have done us proud in the past.  It is important that we get the most out of them, that we have a young, vibrant, energetic Army that will restore our pride in our Defence Forces.  Anyone who visits the accommodation that members of Defence Forces have to put up with will realise that it is not adequate, and that we are asking them to live and operate with facilities that other organisations would not put up with.  We have taken them for granted.  A real commitment must be given.  We should outline exactly what their future will be.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to great lengths in the past to indicate that he wanted members of the Defence Forces to take ownership of the plan for the restructuring of the Defence Forces.  He said that it would not work unless they took ownership of it.  It is difficult to ask any organisation to take ownership of a plan if a full and comprehensive plan is not produced.  That is the difficulty that exists today, and I hope it can be resolved.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments are to blame for lack of continuity in recruitment to the Defence Forces. The fact that we continue to allow recruitment on a stop-start basis has created serious problems over the years.  This year limited recruitment was advertised &mdash; the age limit is now 19 to 22 years &mdash; and it was a couple of years prior to that that recruitment took place.  On that occasion the age limit was 19 to 25 years.  I recognise that the Minister wants to recruit younger soldiers, but this new age limit has prevented many people from applying for membership of our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In Kildare there is a history of generations of families being members of our Defence Forces, but the lack of continuity of recruitment and the new age limits have changed this.  People who had planned a career in the Defence Forces are not now given the opportunity of applying.  This has upset many people and I hope it will be rectified in the future.  It is difficult for people who are not <Col N="1385" /> familiar with Army life and the pride people have in belonging to the Defence Forces to understand the concerns that have been created for a number of families throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the input to the budget of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  Many were critical of him because of the small increases in social welfare last year.  On this occasion he has tried to redeem himself by introducing fairly significant increases, with which I agree.  I accept that a balance must be struck and that we must try to make it as attractive as possible for people to make themselves available for work.  At the same time, those who are unfortunate not to have work should be provided with enough money to allow them to live, because many people on social welfare find it very difficult to live from week to week.  Certain times, for example Christmas, put much pressure on some of these families.  I welcome the increases the Minister has made, but much more could be done.</P>
    <P>We have a free travel scheme which, when it was introduced, was thought to be a marvellous idea.  Unfortunately, many people are not in a position to avail of free travel; in 1995 over 474,000 people availed of it at a cost to the Exchequer of £31.3 million.  On average, for every person who used free travel in 1995, the cost to the Exchequer was £66.  One would not have to be an expert to realise that free travel is availed of infrequently by many people.  I would suggest that changes be made to the Social Welfare Bill, or the Finance Bill, to allow for the issuing of vouchers which could be used to travel by hackney or taxi.</P>
    <P>The changes in the drink driving legislation highlighted the need for taxis and hackneys in towns and villages &mdash; all towns and most villages have such facilities.  A pilot scheme whereby people would be issued with vouchers to allow them to travel by hackney cab or taxi should be introduced.  At present many people cannot avail of free travel because there is no public transport in their area.  I have mentioned this before and have been told of people having to get a taxi to the bus stop.  I am not trying to promote calling taxis regardless of where one wants to go but people might be allowed two to four journeys a week to shop, collect their pensions or worship. In rural Ireland many people are not in a position to avail of free travel as it exists.  The Minister should see what changes could be made.  With a small amount of money a lot of good could be done to improve the quality of life of our older people.  They are often neglected and forgotten. In some cases they are reluctant to let their voices be heard but this could and should be done for them.  The Government would get very good value for a small investment.</P>
    <P>In relation to disability in Ireland, a report was recently published which we all welcomed.  I was unhappy that it was launched so close to Christmas because for that and other reasons there was very little debate on it.  I do not like to <Col N="1386" /> use the word &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; but I cannot think of a better one.  Some years ago when Brian Crowley was appointed Senator this House was one of the most inaccessible buildings.  Some of the steps were removed and the building was made more wheelchair-friendly only when Brian Crowley became a Member.  That opened our eyes not just in the House but when we went back to our constituencies as the difficulties people in wheelchairs encounter daily became more obvious.  In many towns and cities footpaths have been made more wheelchair-friendly but much more needs to be done.  There are still high kerbs in some areas and wheelchair users have great difficulties getting on and off those footpaths.  Local councils will have to be more conscious of that in the future.  Some streets are getting a new look, with bollards erected on footpaths to keep vehicles off. Vehicles can cause problems if they are on footpaths by breaking them up but these bollards create problems for people with poor sight, particularly the elderly.  These people are used to walking safely along footpaths but now encounter bollards.  It is all right for young people and those with full sight but for others it is like an obstacle course.  When local councils are making changes in the streetscape they should not assume they know what people want but should consult more widely, particularly those in wheelchairs, the blind and other disabled people.  They meet these problems daily and know what is best for themselves. It is not up to us to tell them.  There is a financial aspect and we are not trying to create Tír na nÓg, but in a lot of cases these are simple things that are overlooked.  Local councils will have to be more conscious of this in the future.</P>
    <P>There were two inspired appointments to the Seanad.  One was Gordon Wilson and the other was Brian Crowley.  Whoever becomes Taoiseach next should take the same view when appointing people to the Seanad.  There is always great pressure on the Taoiseach to reward some of his own people but they were two people who made tremendous contributions in their time in the Seanad.  We do not have an abundance of them in the country but the next Taoiseach should look for a similar type of Senator when nominating 11 people to the House.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste mentioned that Ireland is to bid for the Special Olympics Summer Games in 2003. I am delighted at this tremendous news and wish the bid well.  However, I am critical of RTÉ in that they did not cover the Paralympics at all. That was a tremendous event and we had participants from throughout the country who won a lot of medals.  Regardless of our winning medals, it was an opportunity missed by RTÉ that would have meant a lot to many people.  There is so much rubbish on the television that I cannot understand why this got no coverage.</P>
    <P>While on a sporting theme, the Dublin City Marathon took place last October.  There was a car for the winner and the wheelchair winner got a voucher for £25.  That is probably the biggest insult any Irish person in a wheelchair could have <Col N="1387" /> got last year.  I appeal to the sponsors to be more sensitive.  If that is the best they can come up with, they can ring me and I will provide a decent prize.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): It gives me great pleasure to outline the details of the 1997 budgetary provisions for the health services.</P>
      <P>The 1997 budget and Health Estimates clearly reflect the continuation of the Government's ongoing commitment to maintain, and where appropriate, develop the health services.  The provisions contained in the 1997 Health Estimates and in this year's budget reflect the Government's emphasis on the provision of a health service which not only seeks to treat and cure, but which also, above all else, cares for people.</P>
      <P>Health expenditure has significantly exceeded inflation in the past two years.  Gross health expenditure in 1997, both capital and revenue, will be almost £2.6 billion and will be approximately one fifth of total public expenditure on supply services.</P>
      <P>Our health services, in common with those in all other European countries, are facing new challenges as we approach the new millennium.  New technology and expensive new drugs, coupled with an insatiable demand for services, are constantly challenging the health care system.  This Government has effectively responded to that challenge.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health I have been conscious of the inevitable conflict between available resources and the competing demands for everincreasing health expenditure.  In deciding on the level of resources to be made available to the health services, the Government is balancing the genuine requirements for increased funding with the need to create those fiscal conditions which are required to ensure our continued economic well-being and facilitate our entry to economic and monetary union under the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
      <P>Despite the fiscal constraints we still have made significant advances in the health services in recent years.  This would not have been realised without the continued commitment, dedication and professionalism of health service workers.  Recent developments in the provision of health services in terms of reduced waiting lists, the cancer strategy and increased funding for the development of mental handicap and child care services, have positively impacted on every family and individual in the State.  I express my appreciation and that of the Government at the efforts and energies of so many health workers throughout the country in bringing about these recent developments which have led to the continued improvement of our health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By international standards we can be proud of the comprehensive nature of our health and personal social services, as well as the reputation for competence and compassion of those who have <Col N="1388" /> made their careers in the health services.  These are substantial achievements on which the Government will continue to build.  I pledge that neither my Department nor I will be found wanting in actively encouraging this partnership approach to the future development of the health services.</P>
    <P>Those who claim that public expenditure is bad and increasing public expenditure is worse should look at the health services.  The Progressive Democrats, has a fiscal, monetary and taxation plan which involves cuts in public expenditure to save approximately £2 billion.  My Department accounts for 20 per cent of public spending.  It is not possible to take £400 million out of the health services without devastating them.  When in Opposition a previous Government said health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped. If £400 million is taken out of the health services, which is implicit in the Progressive Democrats programme announced last year, the health services will be devastated.  Any prospective partners to whom the Progressive Democrats might be looking would be well warned to take that fact into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister for Finance announced yesterday that a further £25 million was being made available to my Department for development in the health services.  As the Minister for Finance indicated, this will allow for significant developments in the area of cancer, £6 million; mental handicap, £10 million; child care, £5 million and the waiting list initiative, £4 million.  In addition to these amounts, I have already included in the 1997 allocations £2 million for mental handicap, £4 million for waiting lists and £2.188 million for the physically disabled.  I will also make available an extra £1.5 million for physical disability, £1 million for physical and psychiatric treatment and £0.75 million for women's health.  There will be a total of £36.438 million available for the development of these services in 1997.</P>
      <P>I propose to set out in detail how this £25 million and the additional amounts already provided for in the Estimates will be spent in the provision of these services.</P>
      <P>Since taking office I set the issue of tackling cancer as one of my top priorities.  Last November I announced a series of integrated initiatives in relation to cancer, including a national cancer strategy, arrangements for national programmes of screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer and expert guidelines on the safe administration of drugs for chemotherapy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>, identified cancer as one of the three major causes of death in those under 65.  Many of these deaths are preventable and the initiatives which I announced late last year are based on this critical fact.  The disease kills about 7,500 people every year in Ireland.  About 18,000 new cases are <Col N="1389" /> recorded annually.  Last year alone cancer accounted for some 50,000 hospital episodes.</P>
    <P>The health strategy sets a medium-term target of reducing the death rate from cancer in the under-65 age group by 15 per cent in the ten year period 1994 to 2004.  While ambitious, the target can be achieved and I am determined to take all possible steps to assist in its realisation.  The target is in line with that set internationally by the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>The national cancer strategy draws together a comprehensive series of initiatives aimed at: reorganising cancer treatment services to promote a strong patient focus, ensure equity of access throughout the country and assist better co-ordi-nation between all elements of the service; devoting resources to screening and early detection programmes of proven value; using health promotion activities to emphasise further the importance of healthy lifestyles; developing specialist palliative care services on a phased basis; and facilitating a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional approach to cancer research.  The first part of a phased implementation of these initiatives will be facilitated in 1997 by the additional £6 million which has been made available.</P>
    <P>The cancer treatment services will be reorganised using an integrated model of primary and hospital care.  To ensure the needs of patients are met in the best possible way, it is proposed that hospital treatment services will be structured around a regional service in each of the eight health board areas.  These will be headed by a regional director of cancer services with responsibility for co-ordinating services and developing a cancer plan for each region.  For the more highly specialised treatments, there will be three super regional services in Cork, Dublin and Galway.  I have indicated in the cancer strategy that cancer services will be co-ordinated at national level through a new national forum which would be multi-disciplinary and representative of all levels of the service, both hospital and community based.  It will also have consumer representation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the important process of reorganisation, I am conscious that we need to devote additional resources to selected areas of treatment services for cancer.  Part of the extra £6 million set aside in the budget for cancer initiatives will be allocated for this purpose.  In particular, the national cancer strategy points to a shortage of specialist oncology services outside the Dublin area.  I am committed to eliminating this deficiency in full.  This will involve providing money for the appointment of additional consultant oncologists and support staff.  I will also strengthen haematology and histopathology services in selected parts of the country with the provision of extra posts at consultant level and support staff.</P>
    <P>There will be a phased further development of specialist palliative care services, including the appointment of additional consultants in palliative care.  I also propose to ask the national <Col N="1390" /> forum to provide detailed advice on the development of palliative care services nationally.</P>
    <P>Another key element of the series of cancer initiatives I announced is the extension of the present pilot programme of breast screening for cancer to a national programme.  Breast cancer accounts for about 650 deaths of women in Ireland each year.  I am committed to taking the steps recommended by experts in the field to ensure we have the most appropriate services for early detection of breast cancer.  I will be proceeding with arrangements for a national programme of screening for breast cancer in order to help combat the disease.  I established a project team earlier last year to advise on the structures necessary for a national programme.</P>
    <P>The next major step is to establish a national screening register so that women in the target age group for breast screening &mdash; 50 to 65 years &mdash; can be contacted and offered screening. However, the legal advice available to me is that there are important data protection issues to be resolved before we can proceed with a screening register.  These issues arise because the register will have to be drawn from existing records that were collected for other purposes, such as social welfare, medical card and health insurance data. We need an amendment to the Data Protection Act to allow the use of information for the purpose of screening for cancer.  I will bring forward appropriate legislation on this issue as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>As part of the package of cancer initiatives I published the report of the working party on cervical screening last November and accepted its recommendations.  Among the major recommendations are that: a national cervical screening programme should be established and screening offered to women in the 25 to 60 age group.  The objective would be to reduce the incidence of, and mortality from, cervical cancer in the target population and an expert advisory committee should be established to oversee the establishment, implementation and monitoring of the cervical screening programme.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the establishment of a national programme of screening for cervical cancer as recommended by the working party.  I propose to establish the expert advisory committee recommended by the working party so that the most appropriate preparatory steps can be taken for a national programme without delay.</P>
    <P>As in the case of screening for breast cancer, it will be necessary to amend the Data Protection Act so that a screening register can be established. I intend to introduce an amendment in respect of both breast screening and cervical screening.</P>
    <P>I am committed also to helping in whatever way is appropriate the achievement of improved co-ordination of cancer research in Ireland.  To this end I am making funds available for the establishment of a cancer research unit within, or in conjunction with, the health research board. The research would be focused on the co-ordination <Col N="1391" /> of clinical trials rather than on sciencebased research alone.  It will be action-oriented and focused on the needs of patients.</P>
    <P>I have set cancer as my top priority in the development of services.  The initiatives I announced represent the culmination of a substantial amount of work over a period in developing proposals and I believe they will make a practical difference to patients.  The package I have put together offers considerable potential for improved services to patients and will aid communication and understanding between health professionals, patients and their families.</P>
    <P>Cancer services must not be seen as purely a treatment issue: cancer spans the whole spectrum of health care from prevention to early detection, treatment services to palliative care.  It is in this light that the full set of initiatives on cancer must be judged.</P>
    <P>The importance the Government attaches to responding to the needs of children is reflected in the appointment of Deputy Austin Currie as Minister of State at the Departments of Education, Health and Justice, with special responsibility for child care.  In addition, the Government has established a Cabinet Committee for Children. The priority the Government attaches to the development of child care services is a reflection of our commitment not only to a more prosperous future but also to a more caring and supportive future.</P>
    <P>Much progress has been made in recent years in the development of child care services, with the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Austin Currie, being of particular significance in this respect.  In December 1996 we commenced implementation of the final Parts of the Child Care Act, 1991, dealing with the registration of children's residential centres operated by voluntary agencies and the supervision and inspection of pre-school services.  This delivered on the commitment to implement the Child Care Act in full by the end of 1996.  An additional £35 million on an annualised basis has been provided since 1993 to develop child care and family support services and to strengthen the capacity of the health boards to meet the demands imposed by the implementation of the Child Care Act.  More than 900 permanent posts have been created in the child care area during the three year period.</P>
    <P>We are determined that all the nation's children are cherished and sheltered from harm and that those in need receive the necessary support and assistance.  While considerable progress has been made in recent years we must ensure that child care services continue to develop and respond to the many increasingly complex and varied needs of children.  We must continue to update care practices in response to the continuously evolving needs of children and families.  We must not lose sight of the central importance of the family in providing support and assistance to children.  It is important that support is provided to families in difficulty to help them to overcome <Col N="1392" /> their problems.  The welfare of children is best ensured by nurturing the well-being of families.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that the initiatives taken in recent years in child care must not be lost and that there is continuing improvement in the range, capacity and quality of child care services. While much has been done to improve child care services much more remains to be done.  The Government is, therefore, making available an additional £5 million in the budget to further develop child care services in 1997.  This funding will allow for initiatives to strengthen arrangements for the reporting of child abuse; improvements in the provision of residential care for vulnerable children; an increase in the foster care allowance for children under 12 years of age and the implementation by health boards of the final two Parts of the Child Care Act, including inspection of pre-school services.  These initiatives will improve the responsiveness of child care services to the needs of children and further develop child protection services.  A sum of £2.5 million has been made available in the 1997 allocations to meet the roll over costs of the Child Care Action Plan, 1996, for this year.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting lists for surgery in the target specialities over the last three years.  When the waiting list initiative commenced in June 1993 when the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government left office there was a total of 40,130 people on waiting lists for hospital treatment.  By the end of June 1996 this figure had been reduced by 9,683 or 24 per cent.  However, when I reviewed progress in reducing waiting lists for hospital treatment in the middle of last year I was concerned that the overall waiting list for in-patient treatment had risen during the preceding 12 months and I recognised that swift action was required to tackle this increase.  Additional funding was provided for this area to ensure that waiting lists did not continue to rise for the remainder of 1996.  I expect the waiting list figures for the end of 1996 to be available for publication shortly.</P>
    <P>I am happy to assure the House that special measures to reduce waiting lists will continue in 1997.  The provision of special funding to reduce waiting times continues to be a priority for the Government and £4 million is being provided in the budget to continue progress in this area.  This provision will bring to £8 million the total funding available in 1997 to address the problem of long waiting times for elective surgery.  The funding provided in 1997 brings to £58 million the total resources committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists since the current initiative commenced in 1993.  My Department will hold detailed discussions with health agencies in the coming weeks on the allocation of this funding.</P>
    <P>While a wide range of areas will benefit from the funding available in 1997, special attention will be paid to cardiac surgery.  There is a further need to expand the current public hospital capacity for cardiac surgery, including the appointment of additional cardiac surgeons on a <Col N="1393" /> permanent basis over the next two to three years. My Department has set up an option appraisal team to look into the requirements for cardiac surgery and this examination of long-term requirements has begun.</P>
    <P>In 1992 work began on the establishment of a national database which would identify the needs of mentally handicapped people and assist my Department, health boards and voluntary mental handicap agencies to plan the development of services to meet those needs.  Through the co-operation of the health boards and service providers in the field of mental handicap, the National Intellectual Disability Database, for the first time, is providing comprehensive information on the population of persons with a mental handicap and their needs.  It is my intention in the near future to request approval from the Government for the publication of my assessment of the need for services for persons with a mental handicap as identified by the database.</P>
    <P>I will provide an additional £12 million in 1997 for the services based on the needs identified by the database.  Of this sum, £2 million is allocated to meet identified needs in existing services and the remaining £10 million will be used to provide additional services. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, will give more detailed information regarding these additional services and the capital investment.</P>
    <P>This funding will be used to address the following priority needs: the provision of residential places; funding for respite care services; the provision of day care services; the continuation of the ongoing programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from inappropriate care settings and meeting the needs of an ageing population. It will not be possible immediately to meet the needs of all those who have been identified as requiring a residential service.  In recognition of the particular demands on families and carers of those awaiting a residential place, I propose to introduce a scheme of financial assistance for this group while they await placement.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide interim assistance to the principal carer of a person with a mental handicap who is currently living at home with the principal carer but who has been identified on the National Intellectual Disability Database as requiring a full time residential place.  The home support grant is an extension of the already successful home support scheme.  Details of this new initiative will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, a substantial investment has been made in recent years in the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  In addition to other support services, more than 1,000 new residential places and 2,300 new day places have been provided to assist persons with a mental handicap and their families. The development of services for persons with a mental handicap is one of the priority issues I have identified within my Department.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian O'Shea, has specific responsibility in this area and <Col N="1394" /> on many occasions he has expressed his strong commitment to the continued development of services.</P>
    <P>My Department has worked closely with the health boards in recent years to implement an ongoing programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements to more suitable care settings.  Two major projects which will come on stream in the near future will provide significant additional facilities for this group and in particular for those who are also behaviourally disturbed. Two purpose built residential and day care facilities are being provided in Killarney and Limerick.  Building work will begin later this year in Killarney, while the planning process is at an advanced stage in respect of the Limerick development.  The two facilities will provide new accommodation for 56 persons with a mental handicap currently accommodated in St. Finan's and St. Joseph's psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>In addition to these two projects, capital funding was provided in 1996 to the Eastern Health Board to provide additional residential facilities on the south side of Dublin.  It will also facilitate the board in the ongoing programme of transferring persons with a mental handicap from St. Ita's, Portrane to more appropriate care settings. Where persons with a mental handicap continue to be cared for in psychiatric hospitals health boards are encouraged to care for them in separate accommodation and to develop programmes of activity suited to their needs.  The reduction in the numbers of persons with a mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals has enabled hospital management to increase the staff-client ratio and to reduce the numbers accommodated in the various units to the benefit of the remaining clients.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the ongoing developments receiving additional funding.  The review group report on health and personal social services was published last December.  I thank the review group members for their work in producing their excellent report, entitled &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;, which is being circulated widely.  The Government has decided that it should be considered, in conjunction with the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, by the interdepartmental task force.  The report contains important recommendations for developing services for people with disabilities and for restructuring the delivery of those services.  Officials of my Department have started discussions with the health boards on the implementation of the report.  The first priority is the establishment in each health board area of co-ordinating committees which will give the voluntary agencies working on the ground a new say in the development of local services.  Work will also be initiated on developing the recommended database on physical and sensory disability.</P>
    <P>The report also includes a strong recommendation that funding deficits for existing services should be addressed in the first instance.  I am pleased an additional £2.188 million was built into <Col N="1395" /> the health board allocations in 1997 to help put the services on a more secure financial footing. Organisations such as the Central Remedial Clinic, Cerebral Palsy Ireland and The Cheshire Foundation in Ireland will benefit from the additional funding.  This investment will also enable some services initiated in 1996 to be further developed.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the particular need for the provision of respite care.  I am pleased the Irish Wheelchair Association's Donamon House Respite and Day Activation Centre in County Roscommon is among the service to benefit from this additional funding.  The move to independent living is also crucial and is a central theme of the report of the review group.  I have provided £200,000 from this additional funding for the existing personal assistance service to enable more people to benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the continued improvement in services for people with a disability.  I am pleased to announce that I will provide a further £1 million revenue in 1997 for priority developments mentioned in the report.  In addition to the broad range of services provided for people with disabilities, I will ask health boards to examine ways of developing personal assistance services when preparing their local priority developments.</P>
    <P>A number of major new initiatives in the training and employment of people with disabilities will be introduced in 1997.  A review of training policy is currently under way in my Department involving widespread consultation, and a new policy statement can be expected later this year. Training requirements must be more closely related to employment opportunities.  I am aware of the need to develop more imaginative approaches to employment backed by the necessary training measures.  I am therefore proceeding with a number of actions to enable and empower people with disabilities to develop and use their capacities more fully in vocational training and work.</P>
    <P>In the course of providing additional places, it is intended, through the NRB, to pilot new models of sheltered work and to develop minimum standards for all forms of sheltered work.  To that end, in 1997 I will make available the sum of £500,000 for work places for people with a physical or sensory disability.  Additional sheltered work places for people with a mental handicap will be provided from the development money allocated for mental handicap services to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>Supported employment is another form of work activity, particularly for those with more severe disabilities.  As in the case of sheltered work, it is important that certain minimum standards apply and to that end an independent evaluation of current models of supported employment in Ireland will be undertaken and new initiatives developed.  In this regard, £100,000 from the additional funds has been provided for <Col N="1396" /> the successful employment support scheme.  I am hopeful these developments will lead to a better working life for many people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In the past two years I provided an additional £3 million revenue funding for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  This has allowed the development of additional community based support services, such as paramedical services, day care places, respite care facilities, home support services, personal assistance services, training workshops and residential places.  This year I will provide an additional £3.688 million in funding for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, which represents a clear statement of this Government's commitment to meeting the needs of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Last year was an important year for people with a disability.  The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities reported to Government. An interdepartmental task force, on which every Department is represented, has been established by my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, to act on the agenda put forward in the report.  The commitment to develop services for people with disabilities has been reinforced in Partnership 2000 which contains major commitments to develop services for people with a mental handicap and physical and sensory disabilities and to develop a range of employment opportunities for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach stated last week, the threatened nurses strike due to start on 10 February can and must be settled.  At my meeting with the nursing unions on Tuesday neither side was optimistic about the likelihood of averting the strike given the dimensions and complexity of the issues involved.  However, I will continue to maintain contacts with the unions to ensure that every possible avenue which might offer a solution is fully explored.</P>
    <P>I was pleased with the constructive nature of the discussions on Tuesday about the contingency arrangements currently being put in place which are designed to maintain essential nursing services as well as assist the continuation of a full accident and emergency service.  I also welcome the unions agreement to give sympathetic consideration to my request that nurses in certain sensitive areas, such as services to mental handicap, hospice care and services to expectant mothers in maternity hospitals, be exempted from participation in strike action.  At the same time, the strength of feeling expressed by nurses on a range of issues leads me to believe that there may well be no quick fix solution which would address all the issues in accordance with their aspirations.</P>
    <P>I am firmly committed to enhancing nurse education and training and to providing the necessary resources for that purpose.  We are pledged to continue expanding the education and training programmes for student nurses to degree level. The Government also recognises the importance of continuing education to the professional <Col N="1397" /> development of registered nurses.  Almost £6 million has been invested in this area since 1994 and I am anxious that further measures be taken this year to augment the knowledge and skills of practising nurses and to advance professional competence.</P>
    <P>The health services gave much attention to women's health issues in the past two years.  Following the analysis of women's health problems that has taken place and the extensive process of consultation with women about their health needs, I am pleased to announce that I will shortly launch a Plan for women's Health.  The plan will commit the health services to do more to protect the health of women, to develop better health services for women, to create a more woman friendly health service and to increase the representation of women in the health services.</P>
    <P>The cancer initiative, of which I have already spoken, will have major health benefits for women, principally through the extension of breast cancer screening and the development of screening for cervical cancer.  Women will also benefit from the expansion of services for people with disabilities as women tend to be the principal carers of those who are most disabled.  I am confident that we can make considerable progress this year in co-ordinating the statutory response to women who are the victims of violence, either in the home or at the hands of strangers.  A working group representing all the agencies with responsibilities in this area, chaired by the Minister of State at the Office of the Tánaiste, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, will shortly publish its report.  As evidence of my support for the work of the group, I will make available £0.5 million to implement its recommendations as far as the health and personal social services are concerned.  I also hope to contribute £0.25 million capital moneys in this area.</P>
    <P>Legislation will be introduced to establish the Food and Safety Board on a statutory basis.  It will be given full legal powers by means of new primary legislation which is being given priority in my Department.</P>
    <P>As my time is almost exhausted, I will refer on another occasion to the capital programme for 1997 and to the proposed initiatives for the Tallaght Hospital.  I will provide £ 1 million this year for service developments, in particular for the development of psychiatric services associated with that hospital.</P>
    <P>This year's budget for the health services will be approximately £2.6 billion and more than 66,000 dedicated professionals will be employed in providing those services, but the community is receiving good value.  Wealth is not much good if one does not have good health.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>if the training of motor apprentices at Davis College, Mallow, County Cork will continue and if its status as a senior centre for motor apprentices education will be retained; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The County Cork Vocational Education Committee has been providing very effective day release courses for motor car engineering apprentices in its second level school, Davis College, in Mallow for many years.  In any year a total of 50 motor apprentices attend classes on a day release basis.</P>
      <P>Under the new &ldquo;standards-based&rdquo; apprenticeship system, being implemented on a phased basis, all day release courses will be discontinued and will be replaced by block release courses.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, under PESP and the Programme for a Partnership Government, 1993-97, it was agreed that the statutory apprenticeship scheme would be improved by developing a &ldquo;standards-based&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;time-served&rdquo; approach.  A new apprenticeship training model, comprised of four on-the-job training modules and three off-the-job training modules, was developed by FÁS in consultation with the social partners.</P>
      <P>When the new system is fully operational and the traditional day and block release courses are fully phased out, some regional technical colleges and vocational schools which have been involved in the delivery of day release motor apprentice programmes will no longer be required to be providers of such programmes.  The management authorities of these colleges and schools, including that of Davis College, have been notified of this situation.</P>
      <P>However, as a result of representations made to me by the college management and members of the motor industry in the Mallow area, I have arranged that the situation will be kept under review in the light of recruitment patterns in the motor apprenticeship area.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response has been extremely disappointing, especially in the case of this college/centre which has been providing excellent apprentice education since 1967 and which has achieved high standards of excellence. Given the needs of industry in the north Cork/Limerick area, would the Minister reconsider the position and give a commitment to retain this college as a senior centre for motor apprentices?  Does she agree that, in line with the request of the board of management, she should designate that college as one of the national centres for the delivery of phases 2-4 of the new standard-based apprenticeship scheme?  Despite this welcome new scheme, in itself, that is insufficient <Col N="1399" /> justification for dismissing the position at Mallow or for bringing to an end a historic commitment on the part of County Cork vocational education committee and the college in Mallow in providing this very valuable apprentice training. The introduction of a new based system should not in any way necessitate the demise of training at Mallow.  I ask the Minister to urgently reconsider the matter and meet the cross-party consensus which has emerged from the north Cork area in terms of the retention of Davis College as a national motor apprentice college.</P>

      <P>I would not want any criticism of the excellent day release courses that have been, and continue to be, conducted at Davis College ascribed to me.  While pleased that Deputy Martin has welcomed the change of emphasis and the arrangements for apprenticeship now in place, the phasing out of the day courses will result in a different, one-day-a-week approach, very different from arranging a block release.  On the basis of the analysis undertaken by FÁS and my Department it was estimated that eight colleges would be required to meet the training demand for motor apprentices &mdash; the Dublin Institute of Technology in Bolton Street, the regional technical colleges in Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Dundalk and Athlone.  These were the courses and areas designated on the basis of the suggested recruitment patterns for motor apprentices, which areas would be required to cater for a one block release course per term.  While there had been a number of other colleges and schools delivering this facility, following representations made to me by local public representatives and interests, led by Deputy Mulvihill, we are reviewing the position this year.  In the event of the existing designated centres being unable to cater for the training needs of motor apprentices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the matter of designating Davis College as a block release centre will be considered.  When we note the success of the motor scrappage scheme introduced by the Minister for Finance, the number of new cars, the maintenance and testing of cars, perhaps the numbers forecast at the time were somewhat low. In line with the combined lobbying of local public representatives, this excellent college and the motor industry, I have already said the matter will be reviewed this year.</P>

      <P>The only merit of the Minister's reply to the effect that she will keep the matter under review was merely to offer hope.  I do not <Col N="1400" /> really believe there are any long-term implications. I would much prefer had the Minister said she would retain Davis College in Mallow as a centre for motor apprentice training.  In the course of the consideration undertaken, Davis College in Mallow should be included in the list of colleges given its record, standard of excellence and partnership.  Will the Minister meet a delegation from the Mallow area to discuss this issue since representatives of the TUI, the college concerned and local interests have sought a meeting with her since August last but none has yet taken place?  Surely they deserve that much because of the long tradition and standard of excellence there.  Indeed, if we are committed to rural development, why is it constantly proposed to centralise valuable resources like these in highly populated areas?</P>

      <P>Prior to the tabling of this question, we had already given a commitment to review the training needs of the actual number of motor apprentices in the course of this year.  We are reforming the apprenticeship system, which has served us well, in line with the express wishes of the social partners, my Department, trainees and those in the motor industry who have agreed that apprenticeship for the motor industry be developed and delivered in a new way.  FÁS has been given the responsibility of developing a new system and an apprenticeship committee established by FÁS and representatives of all the social partners are overseeing its implementation.  I have given them the task of reviewing the number of places and have designated eight specific colleges within the Dublin Institute of Technology/RTC sector but, given the boom in the motor industry and the success of the scrappage scheme, if the existing designated centres are unable to cater for the relevant training needs, this matter will be kept under constant review. Perhaps the number of places advocated at that stage was lower than may be required.  The expert group, comprised of all relevant interests, will complete their review in the course of this year and submit their recommendations.</P>

      <Quest>the national statistics, if any, which are available to her Department in relation to attrition rates in third level institutions; and if not, if she will undertake a national study to establish the true attrition rate in all third level colleges; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics are not collected on a national basis in relation to attrition rates in third level institutions.  The Higher Education Authority carried out a study in 1994 indicating a high completion rate by international standards in the universities.  The completion rate for those entering in the academic year 1989-90 was about 81 per cent.</P>
      <P>In the regional technical college sector a number of initiatives have been taken in relation to the monitoring of uncertified departures.  A system has been developed for a statistical monitoring of uncertified departures from certificate and diploma programmes and has been applied on a pilot basis in some colleges.  Other studies, in both individual colleges and in groups of colleges, have also been carried out with a view to developing actions to minimise uncertified departures.  A comprehensive study on the guidance services in Regional Technical Colleges was carried out with assistance from the National Centre for Guidance in Education.</P>
      <P>A further study was initiated in October 1996 aimed at providing a comprehensive examination of the reasons underlying uncertified departures. The study will extend over the 1996-7 session and will encompass background research, case studies, surveys and questionnaires.  In December 1996 the National Council for Educational Awards initiated a study into admission requirements, academic standards for transfer from national certificate to national diploma to degree and into attrition rates within courses in NCEA designated institutions.  An interim report from the study is scheduled to be presented to the council's academic committee in April of this year.  A final report will be presented before the commencement of the 1997-8 academic year.  In view of the work that is under way at present, I do not consider the separate study referred to by the Deputy to be necessary at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer is unsatisfactory. Do I take it that no national data are available annually on attrition rates in regional technical colleges or universities?  We have no idea from year to year how many proceed from first to second year and how many complete certificate, diploma and degree courses.  Does the Minister not believe there is a need for a national data collecting system to be put in place which would have these figures annually so that they could inform policy in a given area and determine the type of career guidance approach which should be taken for students entering third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information the Deputy seeks is not available at present.  I have already outlined a number of initiatives in this area which will ensure we have the management systems to gather the information.  We must build a data <Col N="1402" /> bank.  The attrition or dropout rate is quite complex and a number of reasons spring to mind, for example, students do not have control over failure in examinations which reflects on many factors, including the ability of students, attendance, resources, etc.  Motivation is often related to the course preference secured by the student. Students often depart to another institution shortly after registration to repeat the leaving certificate or to take up paid employment, which increasingly happens in a buoyant labour market. Poor course choice means expectation does not marry with course experience.  There are a number of reasons for these attrition rates.</P>
      <P>The pilot application programme in place will combine computer based and manual methods which will be incorporated into management information systems.  The NCEA's project will be carried out this year.  This is important information which will be useful for students who are choosing their careers, but it has not so far been available.  The 1996-7 study will encompass background research, case studies, surveys and questionnaires. Information from that initial study will be available for the beginning of the 1997-8 academic year and we should then move forward.</P>
      <P>While universities do not gather information on attrition rates, they do on transfer rates. Transfer rates measure the number of students who pass from first to second year.  We perform very well in this regard.  The figures suggest an 87.2 per cent transfer rate but that does not include repeat year students so the overall figure of 82 per cent is generally accepted.  That figure compares well with international standards where such information is available.  However, 20 per cent of students, who for many of the reasons I listed, do not go on to benefit.  The Deputy is right in that the more information available, the sounder the guidance and choices we have to offer the increasing number of students who are availing of places in third level institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is scandalous that we do not have a national data base for these figures given that many of the courses concerned are funded by the EU.  One would have thought there would have been an annual data collecting system to monitor and evaluate transfer rates from first to second year and completion rates in our third level institutions, particularly for courses funded by the European Commission.  I tabled this question following a review of a regional technical college which was published recently.  It indicated low transfer rates from first to second year. Transfer rates from first to second year in some courses were as low as 39, 37, 35 and 32 per cent. Those figures are cause for concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons advanced by the Minister to explain poor transfer rates demonstrate the scale of the problem revealed in that report.  It is refreshing that tabling a priority question can be the catalyst for the introduction of a plethora of initiatives in this area.  Hopefully, the NCEA initiative will bear fruit.  The absence of a national <Col N="1403" /> data base on transfer rates of students from first to second year and on completion rates highlights significant shortcomings on the part of the Minister and the Department.  How does one plan for the future or make decisions on educational matters if one does not have such data?  It beggars belief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to tell the Deputy that the studies to which I referred were initiated before he tabled this question.  These initiatives were put in place at the beginning of the 1996-97 academic year.  I was disappointed at the limited survey results which were the subject of an article confirming the necessity to gather information.  That information process has already begun.  If we gather statistics by only taking a same sample and if some of the information is leaked in isolation, people may worry that the situation is not being noticed by the authorities.  I assure students, especially those in their last year in school who are making their career choices, that, with ongoing monitoring of the quality of courses, the choices available and the extra guidance which I have been able to make available, they can have confidence that it is an expanding system whose quality is being monitored.  I have no doubt we will all learn much from the results of this work and it will allow us to develop college management systems which will permit ongoing updating of information.  I only gave indicative reasons but my mind is not closed.</P>

      <P>I intend to introduce education legislation which is one of the important steps in establishing the boards.  That legislation will contain the necessary statutory provisions to meet the Government's commitment to deliver education regionally.  In response to many years of discussion, consultation and criticism of the centralised nature of the Department of Education I am setting up the boards on a phased basis in the context of the education Estimates reflecting the scale of Exchequer funding.  I remind the Deputy that I increased the education budget by more than £500 million since yesterday. The boards will be established within the overall context of the budgetary parameters and the Government's investment in education has not been found wanting.</P>
      <P>We have discussed the gradual transfer of functions which will involve extensive negotiations with the unions.

      <P>It is timely that the consultants be brought in to assist in planning for this transfer of functions because it requires a review of the current organisational structure of the Department.  They have been asked to make recommendations and to ensure there will be no unnecessary expenditure.  The administrative costs of the regional boards will represent significant value for money benefits to regions.  The structure for the delivery of education will change and that has the potential for cost savings.</P>
      <P>The education boards will involve changing and refocusing the administrative framework of the Department of Education.  There will not be more expenditure but a reallocation of funding and of responsibilities within the system.  All these matters are subject to the consultants' work and I have asked that the results be available in April or May of this year.</P>

The one which spearheaded a commitment by a Fianna Fáil Administration to devolve the work of the Department of Education to the regions was the OECD report.  I have not got the relevant part of the resulting Green Paper with me &mdash; I thought Deputy Martin carried it around with him &mdash; but it referred to the regional delivery of education&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and taking on board criticism of the centralised nature of the delivery of education to enable us to respond to the needs of those who benefit from the education system, especially at regional level.  Arising from that OECD report came commitments from many Administrations to decentralise and reorganise the delivery of education.</P>
      <P>This was also the subject of discussion at the convention.  There are many interested parties involved in education.  It was decided that the partnership model which had developed well in Dublin Castle would be reflected in the delivery of education at regional level and that can be seen in the proposed composition of the boards.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to increasing investment in education to improve its delivery by decentralising work and regionalising the delivery of services. Consultants have been asked to make recommendations on staffing levels, structures, the implementation of operational plans and new administrative structures for the Department as well as the ten education boards.  They must have regard to the provision set out in the White Paper for the phased development of the boards.  In the area of education there are few surprises, the changes have been signalled.  There is a commitment that the proposal be implemented on a phased basis when the studies are completed and the education legislation is enacted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">

      <P>I do not believe that partnership requires quangos.  There is no need to set up ten <Col N="1406" /> educational boards with all the administrative backup that requires.  That will be a nightmare of bureaucracy.  The Minister gave a hint as to when the boards will be set up, but has she a date in mind and how gradual will be the process?  She did not answer my earlier question on dismantling bureaucracy in the Department of Education while at the same time setting up ten boards.  Has she plans in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the Deputy thinks she has convinced me that I am creating quangos, I do not see the ten regional education boards as quangos.  In response to the needs of the education system I am introducing legislation that will put education on a statutory basis.  The roles, rights and responsibilities of the partners in education, who have constitutional entitlements, will be spelled out in the legislation which will provide for the setting up of the regional boards.  This is part of the modernisation of the delivery of education, now that education is no longer the privilege of the few but the entitlement of all.  There are partners involved who were not previously recognised in the planning of the education provision, which is the constitutional entitlement of our young people.</P>
      <P>The setting up of boards is a careful plan to respond to the modernisation needs of the education system.  The Deputy speaks of enormous bureaucracy as if it were a dirty word.  I am proposing the administration of a system regionally. It is better to set up ten regional boards than 30 talking shops with no responsibilities and no budget, as the Deputy's party is planning.  The regional boards are a reasonable response to the needs of the education system.  The first function of the boards will be to use funding within the classroom.  They will not be seen as quangos but as a modern response to the needs of a modern education system.  It is the right way to chart and plan for the future.</P>

      <Quest>when the relationships and sexuality programme will be introduced into primary and post-primary schools; if copies of the programmes for both primary and post-primary will be made available to local parents' organisations to enable a proper consultative process to take place; and the procedures which will be used at local level to ensure a meaningful input into the programme from all the partners in education at local level.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Many primary and post-primary schools already provide programmes of relationships and sexuality education in their curricula. I expect that all schools will have finalised their agreed school policies for relationships and sexuality education during the school year 1996-97 and that the majority of schools will have introduced programmes from the beginning of the next school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> In the case of the primary sector, copies of the programme guidelines are being distributed at the training days being held for all primary teachers, which will be completed by the end of the school year.  Programme guidelines for post-primary schools have been circulated at information seminars for post-primary principals and are being distributed to post-primary teachers at their training days.  Further copies of the guidelines will be included in a special pack which will be distributed to all schools shortly.  Schools will be expected to make copies of these available to parents and parent associations in the context of policy development in individual schools.</P>
    <P>The procedures used at local level to ensure meaningful input into the development of a school's policy and programme for relationships and sexuality education involve the entire school community including parents, teachers and the board of management.  This consultation at local level follows on from an extensive process of consultation at national level, involving all the partners in education, through their membership of a special implementation group which I established and which continues to meet regularly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Given all the talk and hype about partnership and equality for parents in education and the primacy of the parent in regard to this programme and the need for parents to be consulted at an early stage in the development of the programme, I find it extraordinary that copies of the primary and secondary programmes on relationships and sexuality have not been distributed to parents.  Will the Minister confirm that she expects school authorities to photocopy the programmes and distribute them to every parent? Has she advised school authorities that that is their responsibility and that they should do so immediately?  Otherwise the timetable set last year for the programme to be introduced in all schools by the end of this year will not be met.  I suspected the timetable would not be met and I now doubt whether the programme will be introduced for the beginning of the next academic year as the consultative process at local level has not taken place and parents have not received copies of the programmes in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Each school will develop its policy on relationships and sexuality.  In delivering the programme a co-ordinated approach will be adopted.  There are two areas of particular note.  Under this policy, each school will make provision for the rights of parents who have conscientious or moral objections to the inclusion of the programme on the curriculum and they will be asked how they propose to address that issue.  The values inherent in the school policy will be consistent with the core value and ethos of the school.  The proposal will be implemented, not at principal officer level but with the co-operation of the whole school.  There is a proactive role for parents in this regard and <Col N="1408" /> each school will evolve its own policy.  This programme is not only starting now, it was established in some schools when the commitment was given by me to introduce it.  Some schools have traditionally rejected the need for relationships and sexuality education.  Some consider their staff do not have the necessary training or the necessary support to contribute to the holistic education of the children in their care.  Some schools and teachers are apprehensive about this type of education.  We are concentrating on the second group.</P>
      <P>The implementation group is chaired by a senior inspector in the Department of Education and members meet regularly and make recommendations. I will read into the record the organisations represented and working together in this regard.</P>

The organisations represented include the CPMSA, the ASTI, the INTO, the IVEA, the TUI, the Department of Health, the Parents Council Primary, the Parents Council Posts Primary, the NCCA, the Curriculum Board, the JMB, the Managerial Body for Secondary Schools, the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, the Educate Together Group, the Church of Ireland Board of Education and two representatives from the Department of Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a broad committee representing the different interests concerned, but the involvement of parents is central.  Their involvement is within their school communities. In 1996 through the cost and training support programme we spent £1.8 million to finance training and we intend to spend £1.5 million in 1997.  That will complete the programme which allowed us set up information centres for management authorities, parents and teachers, participation by members of school communities in the process of consultation, the formulation of school policy on relationships and sexuality education and the attendance of teachers at training sessions.  That is a large investment in this area.  The delivery of the relationships and sexuality education programme will not take place unless the parent body in each of the school communities is fully involved in training, the preparation of the policy pack and voicing its views.  If Deputy Martin contacts the National Parents Council at national level, he will learn that, as an organisation which represents parents, it is satisfied it is fully involved in the implementation of this programme.</P>

    <Col N="1409" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The emphasis in my question was on the local implementation of this programme. The Minister confirmed that by the end of 1997 more than £3 million will have been spent on this programme establishing the central body, the training programmes, in-service training for teachers and so on.  The fundamental issue I am raising is that, despite the costings, there is a great danger that the programme will not be implemented in many schools.  I have received correspondence from parents and teachers at local level who have articulated real concerns about this programme.  The Minister should have been more proactive in addressing those concerns by meeting parents at local level and providing them with the national programme and guidelines completed by the national implementation group.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that at this late stage parents throughout the country have not seen those programmes. The national body may have seen them, but it does not have the necessary resources to distribute copies to parents in all schools, some of which do not even have a parents association.  The crunch will come when teachers call in parents or parents are made aware that this programme is about to be introduced and they may say no one told them about it.  That is a real possibility.</P>
      <P>Copies of the programmes should be made available to parents on request.  There has been a reluctance to disseminate the programmes; I do not believe Members have formally received them.  They should have copies of the primary and post-primary programmes when parents call at their clinics or constituency advice centres. The programmes have been confined to the national groups the Minister listed.  Real local democracy is not at work here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy said the crunch will come when it comes to the delivery of these programmes in schools.  That will not happen because we have made this investment to guard against that.  The delivery of the programmes will be the responsibility of each school and their development and delivery will follow a number of processes.  It will not be a case of an instruction being given that the programme will be introduced immediately. It will take the form of information sessions for management authorities, parents and teachers, particularly teachers involved in relationships and sexuality education; the participation by members of the school community in a process of consultation <Col N="1410" /> leading to the formulation of a school policy on relationships and sexuality education and the attendance of teachers at training seminars, which are ongoing.  That process will take place in each school community.  The policy pack is being finalised on the recommendation of the information group because feedback was sought before the pack was finalised.  It will include a booklet on policy formulation; a short guide to the development of a school policy, including the setting up in each school of a special policy group or committee representing the parents, teachers and management; a step by step guide to the development of the policy and further copies of the curriculum guidelines distributed to teachers in training sessions.  If the Deputy would like a copy of the guidelines available to teachers, I will make it available to him.  The parents' information booklet is being finalised and will be distributed to all parents.  The booklet will include practical information for parents on aspects of the programme and will give guidance to parents on how to work with their school in developing the programme.</P>

      <P>What will be the uptake of the relationships and sexuality programmes in schools during the forthcoming academic year? What action does the Minister propose to take if schools are unwilling or unable to participate in those programmes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is planned to introduce the programmes in every school that is delivering the curriculum of the Department of Education. Before we commenced these programmes some schools were involved in developing this area. The work undertaken in some schools and in the health boards played an important part in establishing the basic material we used.</P>
      <P>The schools chosen were a mix of large and small urban and rural primary and post-primary schools.  Progress reports on the first phase of training were valuable and the feedback was interesting.  It was used to plan the second phase of training.  All aspects of the training, as delivered, were evaluated.  Those who attended a training day were asked to complete a detailed evaluation form which was analysed by the RSE co-ordinator.  An external evaluation was also carried out on the programme and we will appoint an external evaluator shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the feedback was interesting.  Some positive comments were received by those who supported the concept of RSE in the context of the holistic development of their child.  The involvement of parents was particularly welcome and the expertise of trainers was lauded.  That is an acknowledgement of the funds I made available to teachers, without imposing on them an expectation to deliver a programme for which they did not have appropriate training.  There were negative comments.  There was apprehension about the teaching of a sexuality programme particularly in multi-grade rural schools.  The <Col N="1411" /> implementation group was asked to look at each of the areas highlighted and, come up with suggestions to allay concerns.</P>
    <P>Across the schools community there was a difficulty in finding time for the RSE programme in the curriculum.  The same was true of policy development.  Teachers were handed the programme in the classroom.  The programme also provides for the involvement of parents and boards of management.  Issues such as staff relations, parental consensus and the influence of the clergy on boards of management emerged as possible obstacles in developing policy.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, there are individuals who believe they do not have the necessary skills to teach a relationships and sexuality programme. It is important to minimise their apprehension. The first stage of the investment process included assisting teachers to acquire the necessary skills, knowledge and understanding to teach the RSE programme and to collaborate with parents and others in implementing it.  Every opportunity was taken to allay the concerns.</P>
    <P>I would like to be able to say to Deputy Keogh that the programme will be implemented in all schools but I cannot give such a commitment.  We have made haste slowly and with care.  We will continue to move forward until such time as the programme is implemented in every primary and second level school under the auspices of the Department of Education.  The response to date has been good.  Not only is the education system dealing with the intellectual needs of our young people but it is also dealing, in the context of their holistic development, with their need for relationships education which has been missing from the curriculum.</P>

      <P>I understand £3 million is being spent on training programmes.  The Minister mentioned that an external evaluator is to be appointed.  Will the appointment be made prior to the commencement of the new academic year in September when the programme is to be introduced? Have any contingency plans been made in the event of a greater number of schools than anticipated deciding not to implement the programme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put the Deputy's suggestion to the implementation group whose advice I have steadily accepted throughout the process.  It recommended that an evaluator be appointed to evaluate the programme as it is being delivered.  A job description is being prepared. If it agrees with the Deputy's suggestion that the evaluator should be in place before the commencement of the new academic year, I will have no difficulty in accepting it.  It was the co-ordinator who devised the training programme. The transition year programme provided a good model.  Following the provision of training and implementation there was ongoing evaluation by an evaluation team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> The Deputy asked if contingency plans have been made should schools decide not to implement the programme.  The programme will form part of the primary school curriculum and, in theory, it should be easy to teach but certain innate skills are required.  One has to be sensitive to the needs of parents as well as pupils.  Because of this I have been prepared to move forward slowly.  I am satisfied that more than half of the schools will implement the programme.  Teachers were asked to express their concerns, which will be allayed.  I am not committing myself to a timescale but the programme will be delivered.  Some school communities will require more help than others.  This will be forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria used to allocate capital funding to primary school projects are set out in the &ldquo;National School Capital Programme&rdquo; publication which was published in 1994 and issued to all schools at the time.  The categories outlined in the booklet were as follows: category 1 &mdash; essential and very urgent; category 2 &mdash; desirable and urgent; category 3 &mdash; desirable but not urgent.  I will send a copy of the publication to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, the Government has allocated over £97 million in capital funding to primary schools. Major projects have been completed at over 100 schools while capital grants have been paid in respect of over 7,000 applications for assistance. Notwithstanding the progress that has been made in the past four years, there is still a significant number of schools requiring attention.  The Deputy will be aware that there were substantial cuts in capital funding for primary schools in the 1988-92 period and these cuts caused a large backlog in projects which will take time to address.  The Deputy will be aware also that I am devolving £11 million of the capital budget directly to schools to enable them to undertake improvement works to their buildings, services and furnishings without reference to my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I challenge the Minister's assertion <Col N="1414" /> regarding the period 1988-92.  From 1987 significant funding was spent on the primary school capital programme despite the economic and fiscal policies of the time which were essential for the wellbeing of the economy and which have produced the extra revenue which is now spent on this programme.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not adhered to the categories or criteria in allocating funding to primary schools.  Often the presence of a Labour Party Deputy in a constituency is of more importance with regard to whether a school will receive capital funding.  If £97 million was available since 1993, Urbleshanny in County Monaghan should not be in its current state nor should the school in Kilglass, County Galway and other rat infested, damp schools which we have seen on television over the last two months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is trying to shout me down because I am putting on record the track record of the Opposition Party in Government. In 1990 the figure was £16.7 million.  Those figures damaged progress in eliminating substandard buildings.  With regard to Urbleshanny, which the Deputy mentioned, that school was given the go ahead but it was taken off the list because only half of the funding was secured.  In 1996 there was not a shortage of capital but a long backlog of sheer, criminal neglect.  I spent £30.9 million last year and we are completing two capital building programmes a week.  However, although there has been extraordinary input and commitment by the Government, the neglect in the years I mentioned have made it difficult to eliminate the backlog as quickly as should be the case.</P>
      <P>I do not take all the glory.  I recognise the responsibility of other people.  I also admit a significant number of schools still require attention. However, in the case of schools that have benefited from the recent injection of funding, the school communities will take responsibility for those schools and for maintaining the standard of the buildings.  I would like to be able to say that the investment made available to me by the Government was such that I had eliminated the backlog of problems.  Nevertheless, the improvement has been enormous and the Deputy will see from the booklet that there is an order in which projects are dealt with.  Equally, the boards of management have the responsibility of coming to the Department of Education for funding.</P>

      <P>The Minister said £20.7 million was provided for the capital programme in 1988. The country was almost bankrupt that year.  What was provided in 1996 and what is being provided in 1997?  Is it correct that only £15,000 more than last year's provision is being provided this year? With regard to the categories, why does the Minister not publish the list of schools in each category so people will know where their school <Col N="1416" /> stands in the list?  That would avoid much of the innuendo that other criteria are used.  Having received her allocation in November, why is it necessary to publish at this stage the list of schools that will be grant-aided?  I am referring to Urbleshanny where there was a public protest two weeks ago.  That could have been avoided if the Minister had allocated funding to that school after she received her allocation.</P>

      <P>The output was £30.9 million. The allocation for this year was published in the Estimates in November and the Minister for Finance allocated a further £6.5 million yesterday. The Deputy suggested that the names of the schools be published.  The Department is examining the option of establishing a point based system for prioritising capital projects.  When I took over in the Department of Education every project was included in category 1.  The Deputy talked about the funds being halved but the schools condemned as unsuitable in 1985 continued to deteriorate over the next ten years. Money was not available for maintenance.  I visited the school in Ballymun which was used in the film &ldquo;The Commitments&rdquo;, and <i>The Star</i> and others in the media were happy to take pictures of the school and highlight the appalling state of school buildings in Ireland.  A building programme was needed for that school and if memory serves me correctly it was allocated approximately £1.2 million.  It was during my visit to that school that I came up with the idea of formulating a policy whereby once schools were completed, we would give the community the wherewithal to maintain them.  In the past, large investments were made in schools to help them deal with the problems of neglect but we did not give them the wherewithal to carry out their responsibilities in regard to maintaining the buildings.</P>

      <P>The Department has a list of approximately 38 schools which would be categorised as essential and very urgent.  They are not yet at the stage where they can be categorised as desirable and not urgent because I am continuing to eliminate the substandard buildings.  The Deputy and the public know that.  The Deputy made an important point and it is an issue on which we are beginning to move.  I want to retain confidence.  I want communities to identify the worst schools in their areas and those that are a priority, regardless of whether they have an organised voice of protest.  In regard to Kilglass, I do not think the Labour Party has a Deputy in Kilglass.  There are areas that do not have Labour <Col N="1417" /> Deputies representing them, but every area seems to have schools that have been neglected and are experiencing difficulties.  It would be far better if there were common agreement on the schools listed for priority because there would be no need for political games or protests.</P>

      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General has already recommended that we carry out value for money exercises on second level buildings.  Priority points based systems operate in other EU countries and that is a method of prioritising capital projects.  It removes the idea of political patronage from the picture. We are in contact with other EU countries who are using this system and we are examining the possibility of establishing a points based system.</P>

I do not want to be in a position where I am constantly making promises. I have been accused by deputations who have met me of being the fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh Minister to make promises.  I have never promised any deputation that I will make money available.  I have said we will list and prioritise schools and that I will find the funding.  I ask for the support of Deputies in finding additional funding so that we can totally eliminate the schools on that list.</P>

I hope in the next few days the management will see progress in that regard but there are also schools in Carrickroe, Ballyocean, Scotshouse, Corcaghan and, more recently, Rackwallace, which has been named by the INTO.  That is an indication of the serious problems that area is facing.  I appreciate the Minister has met many delegations from these areas and that she has listed most of the schools concerned but it is important that they be given a clear indication that their projects will be reached as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I do not know about a list but I assure the Deputy that such a list did not originate in my Department.  Over many years Deputies representing different parishes have called on various Ministers to meet the needs of individual schools.  I am giving a commitment that I will keep the level of investment as high as it has been and that we will begin to put in place &mdash; and we must all agree on this &mdash; a points based system that will list the national and regional priorities of each area.  Given the funding that has been made available in the past four years I have every confidence that the areas listed are facing a future that will see schools being built for the education of their children and where the communities will be empowered, through funding, to maintain those buildings.  I ask Deputies to remember the new schools that have been established in their areas, the high standards that are applied in those schools and the excitement generated by their establishment.  That can happen in other parishes which can then take on the responsibility of maintaining the wonderful buildings that have been erected at the rate of two per week around the country.</P>

      <P>That list was brought to my attention by the INTO.  There were 47 schools on the list, two of which had not brought their needs to the attention of the Department of Education; that goes back to the role of the boards of management. Eleven of the schools were not in any of the planning processes but that question is being examined bearing in mind that there are different stages in that process.  We have named some schools that entered the planning process in 1995 and we are looking at the culmination of that process. In regard to the way in which primary school projects are announced and funded, every stage is part of a process.  The second level comes with a more complete package when the money is available.  In regard to the specific schools <Col N="1419" /> referred to by the Deputy, I am confident that the schools on the list that urgently require funding will be informed of the position on the completion of my work and the work of the officials in the Department.  Once we have dealt with the needs of those schools I have no doubt they will be replaced by a number of other schools seeking urgent funding on the basis that they, too, have suffered years of neglect.  Those years of neglect in the school building programme resulted in the awful pictures I saw in recent weeks.  However, even in the Deputy's area there have been successful conclusions of building programmes. When that occurs, local Deputies have a role to play in encouraging boards of management to take on the responsibility of maintaining the buildings.  I am sure I will have more information for the Deputy next week.</P>

The chairman and committee purchased an expensive site and produced proposals for a new school.  They had a good committee and the contributions were provided.  I ask the Minister to recognise the work of the committee when she is making her decision because it would be an injustice not to include the school on the list of 17 schools mentioned earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance spoke for in excess of one hour yesterday but he did not make any detailed announcements which had not already been flagged in the media.  I tried to recall this morning whether the media flagged major announcements which did not appear in the budget but I cannot recall any.  Perhaps the brouhaha which attends the presentation of a budget is no longer justified as all the detail is available several weeks in advance.  I am not sure that is bad but it is interesting in the context of the difficulties which the former Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, experienced a couple of years ago.  It appears to indicate that the leeway available <Col N="1422" /> to a Minister is perhaps no longer limited in terms of budget preparation.</P>
      <P>It is also sad that the Minister for Finance had the largest amount of money ever available to spend but the events of the previous weeks substantially undermined his position.  His public disagreement with his party leader coloured his presentation of the budget and perhaps the budget experience in the House.  We are all relieved by the existence of the Maastricht Treaty guidelines, and perhaps none more so than the Minister, because they appeared to help him keep within certain parameters.  Given the economic state of the country, many people would prefer the Minister to stay within tighter financial parameters than those laid down in the Maastricht Treaty and in the other requirements which arise from our intention to become part of economic and monetary union in two years.</P>
      <P>The Minister had a huge amount of money at his disposal but seems to have come under some very unreasonable pressure not just, as one might have expected, from the other two parties who are in Government with his own, but also from within his own party.  Perhaps in an election year that is not surprising, but it is sad for the Minister.</P>
      <P>There are other worrying factors in the underlying arithmetic of the budget and in the assumptions that underlie its targets.  They depend on a number of factors which are outside the control of the Minister and of the Government.  The new agreement is a key factor.  The Minister believes that the taxation cuts and other measures he announced yesterday will go some way towards ensuring the budget is acceptable to all the partners.  I very much hope that turns out to be the case, because while it might be a political embarrassment for the Minister and the Government were the agreement to come off the rails, it would not be in the national interest.  It would be damaging to the State and would undermine much of the economic philosophy which underpins the general budget strategy.</P>
      <P>I would question whether the Minister's projected growth rate can be achieved, even in 1997. Given the economic background to the budget and that growth rate projections have decreased from those achieved in 1996, further projections to 1998 and 1999 might still err on the side of being generous; if they do it will undoubtedly have the effect of undermining our economic situation and have the effect of rendering this a very poor budget indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other requirement for the budget figures to come in according to plan is that inflation be held at about 2 per cent.  Following a period of great difficulty in the area of inflation through the 1980s, and since 1987 when many people said that we could never get it under control, we have as a nation succeeded in getting inflation very much under control to the extent that we are the envy of many of our more wealthy European neighbours. Future economic growth and development depends to a huge extent on the country's ability <Col N="1423" /> to maintain this low level of inflation, and there are aspects of this budget which put undue pressure on the continuation of that level of inflation. It would be a great tragedy for everybody, and particularly for those of us involved at a political level, if elements of this budget were to signal an end to control of inflation and to the very encouraging growth rates we have enjoyed.</P>
    <P>Everybody involved in the business community acknowledges that the most important factor in the country's economic well-being is the control of inflation which has been achieved with great difficulty and no little pain, and which has set the groundwork for the growth rates that have been achieved.  In pointing out the dangers, none of us on this side of the House want to see our worst predictions come to pass.  We do want to point out to the Minister that in some of what he has attempted to do he has, to a worrying extent, undermined the bedrock of that control of inflation which has contributed so handsomely to economic well-being over the past four or five years.</P>
    <P>It continues to amaze me that between 1994 and 1996 we have experienced growth in the number of people working without a corresponding decline in the numbers on the live register.  The Minister predicts the creation of a large number of new jobs, which will mean that 45,000 extra people will be in total employment, but he expects a drop of only 7,000 in the live register numbers.  That could be partly accounted for by the numbers leaving school, although a good deal of that would be matched by people leaving employment and natural wastage of one kind or another.  It is extraordinary that any Government would project an increase of the order of 45,000 in employment and simultaneously concede that only 7,000 fewer people will be on the live register.</P>
    <P>There is much disappointment in the area of tourism at what is proposed in the budget.  Statements issued by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the Irish Hotels Federation welcome specific aspects of the budget, particularly the reduction in corporation tax which is clearly of benefit to them, but were also clearly displeased that tourism was not adverted to, that the extraordinary role tourism has played in the growth of employment and in the general improvement of the economy was not recognised and that there was no indication of a policy for the future which would ensure continued growth in that area.</P>
    <P>Another question that is closely associated with tourism is that of low pay.  Perhaps the most frequent complaint I encounter from people in the industry is that they are in very low-paid employment, sometimes in appallingly bad conditions.  The figures the Minister distributed yesterday, not in the Financial Statement but in the Principal Features of the Budget, were very interesting.  For a single person earning £80 a week on the full rate of PRSI, the annual increase in income is only £40, which is 79p a <Col N="1424" /> week.  I have met many of the people working in the services and hotel sectors, some of whom are married women but many of whom are young single girls, and they are in this category.  A single person who is fortunate enough to be earning £1,000 a week would get an increase of £10 a week, which is much better than the 79p that the person on £80 a week gets. Interestingly, a person on social welfare of £64.50 a week will get an increase of £3.  I am not for a moment claiming that is a generous increase, but it is £3 as against 79p for somebody who is working and earning £80 a week, and there are many expenses involved in being part of the workforce.</P>
    <P>Generally, there is a failure in the budget to advert to the difficulties which single people in particular at the lower end of the scale encounter. A married couple with two children on £250 a week get an increase when everything is taken into account, including family income supplement, of just £3.60 a week.  If they were fortunate enough to be earning £1,000 a week, their increase would be £16 a week.  It comes down to the fundamental Government decision on how to go about applying the increases that are possible to apply when the kind of money that was available to the Minister is available.  I suppose the fact that it is an election year prompted the Minister to give a little to everybody and to ensure that nobody was entirely left out.</P>
    <P>However, from my standpoint the people on £80 a week might as well be left out for all the advantage they have, and the extra £3.60 a week that the married couple on £250 a week will get, some of which will not come into effect until September when the additional child allowances come into play, is derisory.  A married couple with four children on £300 a week will receive an increase of £5.20 a week.  If they were on £1,000 a week the increase would be £18 a week.  There does not seem to be a strong move in the direction of those in low-paid employment compared to those on social welfare.  People in low-paid employment frequently incur such expenses getting to and from employment and being presentable for work that they are in a worse poverty trap than if they were receiving unemployment assistance.  It has been a great failure of the body politic in this House over a number of budgets, but particularly the last three, that no progress has been made in moving forward the position of such a person.</P>
    <P>In marketing, the same advantage applies in relation to corporation tax for companies as applies in tourism.  There is a lot of disappointment over the consistent, long-term failure of the Government to address the difficulties which beset the indigenous sector in trading generally and marketing in particular.  The indigenous sector depends on Britain to a far greater extent than on any other element in Irish trade.  While the percentage of the indigenous sector looks small at about one quarter, it is very large in terms of employment.  It is generally lo-tech with a high rate of employment compared to hi-tech industries which have lower levels of employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> Some of the great worries of the indigenous sector have been dispelled as there is now virtually no disparity between the punt and sterling. However, over the last year there have been enormous difficulties for firms exporting to Britain and they continue to be in crisis.  The indigenous sector needs to spread its export net wider.  The current dependence on the UK market is worrying and the fact that we are facing into economic and monetary union without knowing if Britain is joining is worse.  The people in this sector of the export market are deeply worried about the consequences of economic and monetary union for them.  They are even more worried that the Government is adopting such a laid back approach and is giving no leadership. Leadership is urgently required and those who need it have neither the resources not the time to provide it themselves.</P>
    <P>Those involved in trade are disappointed, as they are with almost every budget, with the increase in excise duties on petrol and diesel, which has a huge bearing on their transport costs. They will feel they have borne the brunt of the Minister's need to garner additional resources for the State and that it is from that area that money to keep the wheels of the economy oiled is sought.  It seems extremely unfair and attacks the viability of the sector.  The Minister projects growth of 11.75 per cent in exports in 1997, which would be an increase on 10.5 per cent in 1996.  In the context of some of the assumptions made in the budget arithmetic to which I referred earlier, it seems extremely optimistic to push for this level of growth in 1997.  He also expects a visible trade surplus of about £8 billion.  This would be healthy but depends on many factors which do not appear to have been adequately addressed in the opportunity presented to him by this budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health spoke before me and brought some matters to mind of which we are all aware.  He mentioned an extra allocation for the waiting list initiative.  The length of the waiting list in the midwest is absolutely disgraceful. There are people awaiting cataract surgery, hip replacements and even eye tests for very long periods.  There seems to be no attempt at national or Department of Health level to put a policy in place to deal with these problems.  The extra allocation will go only a tiny way towards addressing this problem.  It has become an embarrassment. People on the waiting list for a year for hip replacements are dropped from it and put on a new list and, effectively, the length of time they are on the waiting list is dated from that new date. Alternatively, a letter couched in vague terms is sent to them asking if they still wish to be considered. Many old people do not understand what is involved.  Some think they are being called immediately and are delighted.  Some neglect to respond stating that they are still interested in being called and are taken off the list.  When the pain becomes unbearable six or 12 months afterwards <Col N="1426" /> and they make inquiries, they are put back on the list in a new position that leaves them with an apparently shorter span on the list.  The reason for this is administrative in that older people are likely to die or be in such bad health they will be unable to have surgery.  It gives the impression that health authorities want to artificially minimise the waiting list.</P>
    <P>The same problem applies to dental services generally and orthodontic services particularly where very little progress is being made.  A worrying factor is that each Minister appears to throw an extra £3 million or £4 million at the problem but we never see a corresponding improvement in the level of service.  That is deeply worrying.  It seems to point up an underlying malaise in the health services as do many recent events, not least the hepatitis C scandal.  Perhaps it is time to overhaul the health services in such a way as to pinpoint these difficulties and enable the provision of extra finances such as the Minister announced, small as it is, to have the impact one would reasonably expect.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased allocation for services for the mentally handicapped.  These people and those who look after them have been abandoned for so long that even the amount the Minister announced is unlikely to have an impact.  It is an area that is a disgrace to all of us in the body politic and there is a need to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Our care of elderly people is also appallingly poor.  There is an acute shortage of places in institutions run by health boards and while there are many new privately run hospitals and centres being built, there are huge difficulties with the payment of subventions towards the cost of keeping geriatric patients in these homes.  It is causing huge difficulties for the families and patients involved.  They have made an enormous contribution to the life of the country and have been through far more difficult times than any of us in the Chamber.  At the end of their days they deserve more recognition from the State and a better level of service.</P>
    <P>The other group of people who deal with handicapped people and geriatric patients are carers in the home.  There is a substantial increase for those caring for one or more people in the home.  This is to be welcomed but it does not address the problems they have or recognise them in a meaningful financial way.</P>
    <P>Farmers are mentioned in this year's budget which is an improvement on at least a previous one.  The scheme for the control of farmyard pollution which was dropped by the Minister some time ago has not been restored, which is disappointing. There is an improvement of 50 per cent &mdash; in place of the existing 15 per cent &mdash; in the capital allowance for taxpaying farmers who undertake works of this nature.  Unfortunately it will benefit only the farmer who can afford to undertake such works, pay for them in the first instance and wait until the following tax year to recoup the taxation gain.  It will not benefit those farmers who are in the tax net and cannot afford <Col N="1427" /> to undertake that work.  Certainly it will not benefit the substantial number of small farmers in the midlands and west who are not in the tax net and for whom the announcement by the Minister yesterday is meaningless in that it conveys the message that the long-term intention of the State is to drive them out of farming, with no help towards making their farms more viable and no help in the fight against pollution to which everybody in the State appears committed.</P>
    <P>In the economic background to the budget the Minister mentioned the failure to increase exports in the agricultural sector.  That no growth in that area is expected in 1997 must be a worry for farmers, much of which is accounted for by difficulties related to the BSE crisis.  There are many other problems in farming, none of which is insurmountable and none of which is addressed in the budget or was addressed by the Minister and his Department over several months.  An area which comes to mind immediately is that of the super levy where an extraordinary level of mismanagement and a <i>laissez faire</i> approach over a number of years has left a relatively small number of farmers in dire financial difficulties from which they fear they will never recover.</P>
    <P>Before Christmas the Minister for the Environment announced the removal of domestic charges for water and sewage.  This has an impact on the budget and has been welcomed by most sides of the House.  However a difficulty arises in the case of local authority financing and group water schemes.  The Minister was in Galway on Tuesday to meet local authority members and made an announcement which I heard on the radio, and misunderstood.  The announcement appeared to indicate that domestic subscribers to group water schemes would benefit in the same way as subscribers to a local authority scheme.</P>
    <P>I and other colleagues from western constituencies had tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister yesterday, the reply to which indicates that no such thing is intended.  Some group water schemes get their supply from a local authority source and, through some extraordinary scheme which has not yet been worked out in detail, will not be charged for the water consumed by their domestic consumers.  The Minister has not yet announced what magic formula will be put in place to calculate how many gallons of water will be allowed to local authorities free of charge to look after their domestic consumers.  However, a huge number of subscribers to group water schemes get their water from lakes or private sources in their community and will not benefit from this announcement.</P>
    <P>The difficulty for trustees and organisers of group water schemes is that a substantial number of domestic subscribers are indicating they will not pay since nobody else has to pay.  They say, I think reasonably, they are caught for all the extra charges in terms of motor tax and so on and escape nothing.  One of the positive aspects of group water schemes is that they provided water <Col N="1428" /> to many rural households who would never have had it.  As one who was involved as a trustee and organiser in a group water scheme, I realise that an even greater strength is that it encourages and enables members of a local community to come together and operate a service for their own benefit and that of their neighbours.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not address this problem adequately by extending the same benefit to these people as to subscribers of local authority schemes he will have struck a blow against the self-sufficiency which the setting up of group water schemes encouraged in rural communities and will have created for himself, and members of the Government who represent rural constituencies, a political problem that will not go away but will grow with time.  That this is an election year will ensure growth is more than might otherwise have been the case.  I urge the Minister to re-examine this issue with a view to ensuring that rural communities involved in self-help schemes of this nature are not discriminated against further.</P>
    <P>There are implications for the local authorities involved in that they will come under increasing pressure to take over group water schemes.  The Minister announced a provision of £5 million to enable them take over such schemes.  My reckoning is that £5 million would not be nearly enough to enable Clare County Council to take over all the group water schemes in that county, not to mention the other local authorities who will face the same problem.</P>
    <P>In his response yesterday, the Minister said the existing tax allowance will remain.  That will benefit PAYE taxpayers who are members of group water schemes but will be of no benefit to social welfare recipients or others and its effect on local authority finances could be damaging.  Since we do not yet have a list of the amounts of money which will be available in place of local charges, it is difficult to make an assessment.</P>
    <P>In 1977 the then Fianna Fáil Government abolished rates and put in place a 100 per cent rate support grant which worked well until 1982 or 1983 when Deputy Spring was Minister for the Environment.  There was a good deal of economic pressure and the State finances were not as good as they might have been, and local authority finances were reduced substantially.  Those of us who have been members of local authorities are aware of the difficulties this created when, having lost the local rate base, local authorities had a much reduced grant from State funds.  While it seems the car tax replacement for charges cannot be interfered with by Government, there are a number of grant aiding systems under the control of the Minister which could be put in place.  The obvious one is in the area of road grants, and there are others.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced a new form of grants, including a grant towards the cost of small water and sewage schemes but my greatest fear is that the system of financing, over which local authorities had some control, is being replaced by <Col N="1429" /> a system where they are entirely dependent on State funding and could be left short by a future Government when there is a turn in the economic tide.</P>
    <P>Had time permitted I would like to have referred at some length to education but I may have a further opportunity to do so.  The Minister was in an excellent position to do more in terms of what was available to him &mdash; I have no doubt he did his best &mdash; but I am deeply worried about the outcome in some of the areas I mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague the Minister for Finance on an extremely innovative, well balanced and progressive budget.  Last year the Minister succeeded in bringing in a budget which was designed to help create employment particularly among those who are long-term unemployed.  The record shows that the last 12 months were the best period of job creation here since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>This year's budget builds on the economic success of recent years.  It manages to combine good housekeeping and sound fiscal management with initiatives which will have a practical and beneficial bearing on the lives of everyone in this country.  It will increase the spending power in real terms of every Irish working person.</P>
      <P>It represents the biggest tax reduction in the history of the State and it provides Irish working people with more spending power than they ever had in the past.  The effectiveness of this strategy and the economic success which Ireland has enjoyed in recent years is proof, if it were needed, that social partnership works.  It represents a vote of confidence in the new agreement between the social partners, Partnership 2000.  Social partnership and social solidarity, as operated in Ireland, mean taking care of the weakest and marginalised in the community as well as providing the conditions for those in employment and business to thrive.  The budget provided for those without work as well as for those in employment.  It increased social welfare payments, child benefit and the PRSI ceiling and reduced the level of taxation. It ensured that all citizens, irrespective of their place in the community, will share in the economic benefits Ireland is enjoying.</P>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for equality, I am very pleased with a number of specific proposals which will have the effect of helping a large number of families.  For example, the level of increase in child benefit is such that it will have a real and beneficial effect on the income of families with children, particularly large families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Family Law Divorce Bill, 1996, will come into operation on 27 February next.  People seeking a divorce are now able to obtain one and they <Col N="1430" /> will for the first time have the freedom to remarry should they wish to do so.  In recognising the increasing levels of marital breakdown in our society the Government has been careful to put in place the necessary supports for families in difficulty. We have been determined to ensure that families in trouble receive every assistance from the services provided by the State.  I wish to outline some of the provisions my Department will make in support of the family and its members during the coming year and some of the services being funded out of its 1997 Estimate.</P>
    <P>Funding of the services of the Legal Aid Board, which provides access to justice for people who otherwise could not afford it, is being increased again this year to £8.3 million.  This represents an increase of approximately 28 per cent over the 1996 figure.  The funding has increased almost threefold since 1992.  The level of funding over the past few years has facilitated a significant expansion of the service, involving the employment of more solicitors and support staff and an increase to 30 in the number of full time law centres as against 16 in 1993.</P>
    <P>The State Family Mediation Service, which helps couples who have decided to separate to do so on an amicable basis, has been allocated £300,000 this year.  This funding will enable the service to continue its expansion programme. This includes the appointment of area co-ordinators for the Dublin and Limerick offices and a scheme whereby the Family Mediation Service may provide for the use of private mediators on a fee basis.  This scheme will help make mediation more widely available throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The organisations providing voluntary marriage counselling services to couples have a long and distinguished track record.  My Department, by providing them with grant aid, has played a significant role in recent years in actively encouraging those voluntary organisations in this area to develop and expand their services.  My Department provided £750,000 in support of these services in 1994 and 1995.  Large sums were invested in the upgrading of premises and facilities and for the provision of advanced training for counsellors and supervisors.</P>
    <P>Last year the scheme was extended to include voluntary organisations which provide child counselling to children whose parents have separated. For this reason the allocation was increased to £900,000.  This amount has again been made available this year, reflecting the extra demands being made on marriage and child counselling services and my commitment to support these organisations.</P>
    <P>FLAC is a voluntary organisation which operates free legal advice centres in Dublin and Cork and occasionally provides free legal representation at courts and tribunals.  Since 1994 my Department has been responsible for the allocation of ongoing funding, which was increased from its original level of £40,000 to £45,000.  A similar amount is being made available in 1997.</P>
    <P>The National Women's Council of Ireland <Col N="1431" /> receives the bulk of its funding from my Department. The allocation for this year is £170,000.  The council is completely independent of the Government and is funded as a positive action measure to promote equality between women and men.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to pursue its objectives in relation to the implementation of actions agreed at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women in September 1995.  Last December we published a report on the progress made in implementing the Beijing Platform for Action.  The initiatives currently under way in my Department include the following.  My Department is continuing its work in implementing the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women which have been accepted by the Government.  The second progress report, published in June 1996, recorded substantial progress in implementing the recommendations.  The Registration of Births Act, 1996, which was enacted in late 1996, provides for a new format of birth certificate which is gender neutral and thereby gives effect to one of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  The Act will come into force later this year.</P>
    <P>The Equal Status Bill, which will outlaw discrimination on a wide range of grounds outside the field of employment, will be published shortly.  Its enactment will give protection against discrimination to people who have hitherto had no legal redress against discrimination and will facilitate Ireland's ratification of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance announced the allocation of £500,000 in respect of disability.  This funding will be warmly welcomed by everyone interested in the promotion of equality for people with disabilities. This significant initiative by the Government follows the publication last November of the ground breaking report of the Commission for the Status of People with Disabilities.  I recently established an interdepartmental task force to follow up on the commission's report.  The task force, which is chaired by an assistant secretary in my Department, held its first meeting during the past week. This allocation will be used to kick start a number of innovative projects to promote equality for people with disabilities.  People with disabilities, their families and carers can be assured that this very welcome funding will ensure that the rights of people with disabilities take centre stage in our public policies.  Part of the money will also be used to finance the monitoring committee on the implementation of the recommendations of the commission which will be established shortly.</P>
    <P>The newly established and permanent Council for the Status of People with Disabilities will soon be up and running and I am happy to announce that I will make available to the council £200,000 of yesterday's allocation.  This is in addition to the £100,000 already provided in the Estimates for <Col N="1432" /> my Department.  This will ensure that the council has sufficient funding during its first year of operation. The Government has recognised the need for a permanent independent voice which would highlight issues of concern in relation to disability.</P>
    <P>People with disabilities have long been the neglected citizens.  They want nothing more than equality, to move from a reliance on charity towards the establishment of basic rights.  This is also the Government's aim, and I regard the money allocated in the budget as an indication of our commitment to a process of radical change in terms of the way society treats disability.</P>
    <P>Great strides were made last year in improving the position of people with disabilities, their families and carers.  I launched the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities at a European Union Presidency conference on equal opportunities for people with disabilities which was hosted by me in Cork on 18 and 19 November.  This was the first time an EU Presidency had hosted such a conference.  The commission report contains 402 innovative recommendations geared towards ensuring that people with disabilities can participate in all aspects of the life of the community to the fullest extent of their potential.  The families and carers of people with disabilities will also benefit greatly as a result of the commission's report.</P>
    <P>During my chairmanship of the Council of Labour and Social Affairs Ministers a resolution on equality of opportunity and freedom from discrimination for people with disabilities was adopted by the Council.  This resolution will benefit not only people with disabilities in Ireland but also people throughout the European Union. The plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities to be drawn up by the interdepartmental task force is also intended to have a profound effect on the lives of people with disabilities and their families and I look forward to presenting the plan to my colleagues in Government when it has been finalised.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's budget was the third budget presented by my colleague, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, and it follows the pattern developed in his previous two budgets.  It has sought to reward those at work while ensuring those who are unemployed or marginalised are adequately catered for.  As with previous budgets, he has also made sure the economic conditions for entry into economic and monetary union and the creation of a single European currency are maintained.  This Government is in a happy position to be in office at a time when our economic fortunes have never been greater.  This is no accident.  Since the end of 1994 employment has increased by more than 100,000, child benefit has increased by 35 per cent and 40 per cent, tuition at third level colleges is now free, exports have increased by more than 25 per cent and GNP has expanded in real terms by more than 14 per cent.  These are just some of the positive indicators which illustrate the success of <Col N="1433" /> this coalition Government and the strategy we have adopted over the past two years.</P>
    <P>However, we have not forgotten that economies tend to operate on a cyclical basis.  We may not always have it so good and my colleague the Minister for Finance has been careful to make provision for a time when factors outside of our control may contribute to a downturn here.  The budget announced yesterday is an excellent example of prudence and innovation.  Understandably, the Opposition parties and economic observers have had difficulty in finding fault with it.  I strongly commend it to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform suggested that economic observers and members of Opposition parties are having difficulty finding fault with the budget.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  A serious political difference has developed since this Administration took office.  One must go back to 1987 to establish the source of the low inflation and high economic performance.  There was a revolution in our economic management when Fianna Fáil institutionalised the social partnership model as a way to deal with the serious difficulties that had developed under the previous Fine Gael-led Administration, when indebtedness increased from £12 billion to £24 billion in a five year period.  That Fine GaelLabour Administration was a high tax, high spend Government and its members have learned very little since, particularly when one considers the level of spending in which this Government has engaged since taking office.  No more cynical political exercise could have been perpetrated on the people than the Government stating openly from the outset that it would withhold prospects of relief from taxpayers in the last two budgets to enable it to concentrate on the benefits to which they are entitled in a budget in an election year.</P>

      <P>I understand matters have progressed somewhat since I tabled this matter yesterday. Earlier this week staff in the Eastern Health Board unit in Charles Street who care for homeless people walked out because of a risk to the health and safety of staff and clients.  I understand a staff member was injured in an incident at the unit.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the good work carried out by the homeless person section of the health board who each week care for approximately 600 people who are in need of bed and breakfast accommodation and supplementary allowances to survive.  I hope all homeless people were able to secure accommodation in the past couple of nights, as ground temperatures in some places last night were minus 10º.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work in the Charles Street unit has increased significantly recently because of the increase in <Col N="1434" /> the number of asylum seekers.  A member of the Refugee Agency stated on radio yesterday that up to 30 asylum seekers arrive on our shores each day, many of whom end up in the homeless unit in Charles Street.  While I am sure the Minister will outline the short and long-term measures proposed for the unit, it reflects badly on industrial relations if staff have to walk out before new offices and five or six additional staff are provided.</P>
    <P>I accept the difficulties associated with asylum seekers is being examined under the homeless initiative introduced by the Minister.  Refugees and homeless people must be segregated and I hope long-term measures can be introduced to deal with this problem.  The building in Charles Street is not suitable for clients or staff.  I congratulate whoever was involved in getting the matter resolved speedily and hope the Minister will spell out details of the short-term and long-term measures proposed for the unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The withdrawal by staff of the service provided at the homeless persons' unit at Charles Street arose as a result of staff concerns regarding the working conditions at the unit. These have been exacerbated in the past six months, in particular, due to the large increase in the number of asylum seekers seeking a service.</P>
      <P>The staff withdrew their services last Tuesday morning following a rejection on Monday night of proposals put forward by the Eastern Health Board.  The board instituted an emergency referral service immediately and established a free phone help line on Tuesday afternoon, thus ensuring the needs of service users would continue to be met.  I am pleased to announce that proposals for a resolution of the dispute put forward by the Eastern Health Board last night to the workers have been accepted and that services resumed at Charles Street at 2 o'clock today.  I am confident that the settlement proposals agreed between the Eastern Health Board and the staff will provide an enhanced level of service at the unit.</P>
      <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to inform the House of my Department's commitment to the provision of the full range of medical services to asylum seekers and refugees through the health boards.  The Eastern Health Board has been providing a counselling service to Bosnian refugees since 1992.  This has highlighted the need to develop a more specialised service for persons living here who may be suffering from the effects of trauma, warfare or torture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this reason it is proposed during 1997 to establish in the Southern Health Board area a new service for the victims of torture who are refugees in this country.  The service will cater for the needs of this client group on a national basis. Funding to establish the service has been allocated in the current year.  The Southern Health Board is involved in continuous discussions with my Department to agree the protocol and <Col N="1435" /> detailed operational arrangements to apply to this new service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed at the failure of the Minister for Education to be present to take this debate.  She was in the House throughout Question Time and left not more than 30 minutes ago.  The fact that she cannot be here to take this important debate will send very clear signals to the people of Cork which will be interpreted in a manner that will not please the Minister. At the very least I should have expected the Minister of State at her Department, Deputy Bernard Allen, to be present to hear the facts presented by Deputy Martin and me.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Currie, to take the clear message to the Minister for Education that she move immediately to designate Cork Regional Technical College as an institute of technology.  It is imperative that this designation be made in respect of Cork regional technical college in advance of the closing date for the completion of CAO application forms.  Cork regional technical college is the largest, most advanced and diverse of all of the ten regional colleges nationwide, incorporating the Crawford College of Art and the Cork School of Music.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education has come into the House and I welcome her.  The college offers 14 degree courses, a number much greater than the other nine regional colleges.  In addition, there are 23 diploma courses, certificate and professional accountancy courses.  I appeal to the Minister to meet the director of Cork regional technical college immediately and to take urgent steps to designate it as a regional college of technology. It is already that type of institution; all it now needs is to be given the grant-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>With my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party and Deputy Quill I raise this matter to convey to the Minister and the House the depths of anger and resentment felt in the city of Cork, particularly among the staff and students of Cork regional technical college, resulting from the Minister's failure to respond in any way to a submission by the college seeking an upgrading of its status to an institute of technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constituent colleges of Cork regional technical college have a long tradition of excellence <Col N="1436" /> in science, engineering, technology, business, arts and music dating back to the 19th century.  The college offers programmes at certificate, diploma, degree, masters and doctorate levels within all of these disciplines.</P>
    <P>Given its record of achievement it is difficult to understand why the Minister has ignored its submission to date and why she has failed to meet a delegation of the governing body of the college to discuss their request for such an upgrading.  It is rather pathetic that the Minister cannot meet the people concerned directly.  We welcome the decision to upgrade Waterford regional technical college to an institute of technology.  However, we contend that Cork Regional Technical College is entitled to such upgrading given its track record, its outstanding achievements in the past and its visionary plans for the future.</P>
    <P>I visited the college on Tuesday last, when it was heartrending to see the disappointment and disillusionment written on the faces of a dedicated staff and student body.  The students contend that the quality of their work has been undermined, that their qualifications will be devalued ultimately because of the Minister's inaction and that, on the international stage, their degrees will not have the same currency as has been the case to date.</P>
    <P>In reaching any decisions in respect of this sector the Minister should have established and published set minimum criteria to which all other regional technical colleges could aspire to achieve a similar upgrading of status.  Only through the creation of a proper national framework can a rational and planned approach be adopted.</P>
    <P>The reason there is such anger in Cork, that people genuinely feel that Cork regional technical college deserves an upgrading in status, is simple. By any external criterion the college is more than entitled to such status.  I invite anybody from outside the college to assess the position independently and I have no doubt they would reach the same conclusion.  Cork is one of the regional technical colleges which has developed a very extensive post-graduate research base.  Four national technology centres, providing specialised services to industry, are located within the campus; over 10,000 students are involved and within the CAO/CAS system the college has the highest points for entry of all the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>The students themselves are extremely concerned about the status of their qualifications. The Minister cannot adopt an <i>á la carte</i> approach and must take on board the students' deep concerns. They deserve the best and to have their qualifications recognised internationally.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to give the House a commitment that she will travel to Cork over the next few days, that she will meet the student bodies who have been protesting outside of the City Hall in Cork for the past few days.  I want the Minister to meet them and their leaders directly.  She talks much about partnership in education, about consultation. Why not go to Cork, meet the students <Col N="1437" /> involved, the director of the college and take the decision which is their due as urgently as possible?</P>

      <P>I should like to place on record that the order in which I was led to believe the Adjournment Debate would take place was the reason for my not being present for the beginning of this debate and that not alone am I present but I am joined by my Minister of State, Deputy Allen, and Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to both Deputies for raising this matter and glad of the opportunity to advise the House of the up-to-date position.</P>
      <P>The report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education, approved in principle by Government, recommended the upgrading and expansion of Waterford Regional Technical College as the most appropriate response to the higher education needs of the south east region.  The committee noted the high level of potential demand for degree level places, combined with a level of participation at that level below the national average. In the absence of a university in the region, the committee recommended that it would be appropriate that a major element of the expansion of the regional technical college would be at degree level while maintaining the thrust of its activities at technician level.  My recent announcement on the future plans for Waterford regional technical college is based on the recommendations of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education.</P>
      <P>My announcement has drawn a reaction from Cork Regional Technical College.  Clearly staff, students and graduates are proud of their college. I am concerned that the announcement about Waterford has been interpreted as in some way diminishing the status of Cork regional technical college.  This is not the case.  On the contrary, I have congratulated Cork regional technical college on its highly significant achievements on a number of occasions and on the fact that its standards of excellence are internationally recognised and valued.  My announcement does not change that.</P>
      <P>This week the Government arranged for the publication of proposals from TEASTAS &mdash; the Irish National Certification Authority &mdash; for a national qualifications framework.  The TEASTAS report, which I welcome, sets out proposals which will facilitate the growth and evolution of Cork Regional Technical College and the other colleges in the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked my departmental officials to meet the authorities of Cork Regional Technical College. I see this meeting as an important step in a process which will respond to the aspirations of Cork regional technical college.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;process&rdquo;&mdash; education cannot be based on knee-jerk reactions, on opportunistic decisions or short-term responses.  The decision on Waterford is based on the Steering Committee report, buttressed <Col N="1438" /> by its Technical Working Group report which was published more than one and a half years ago.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Aire Stait atá anseo agus tá súil agam go bhfuil deáscéal tugtha ag an Aire Chomhshaoil dí mar tá géarchéim uisce in Inis Mór.</P>
      <P>Is í Inis Mór an t-oileán is mó daonra de na h-oileaín mara ar fad nach bhfuil ceangailte leis an mór-thír.  Tá os cionn 800 duine ina gcomhnaí go buan ar an oileán ach sa samhradh tagann idir míle agus 2,000 duine ar chuairt go dtí an t-oileán gach lá.  Is fada fadhbanna uisce an oileáin agus le cúpla bliain tá an chomhairle chontae ag réiteach pleananna leis an bhfadhb seo a shárú.  Go dtí an bhliain seo ní bhíodh aon fhadhb uisce sa gheimhreadh ach i láthair na huaire tá géarcheim uisce ann de dheasca an triomaigh.  Má tá an t-uisce gann ar an oileán ag an am seo den bhliain agus ag glacadh leis nach bhfuil ach 800 duine agus beag cuairteoirí ar an oileán faoi láthair is féidir leis an Aire Stáit a shamhlú cé chomh dona is a bheidh an scéal i lár an tsamhraidh.</P>
      <P>Má tharlaíonn sé go bhfuil ganntanas uisce arís i lár an tsamhraidh d'fhéadfadh sé dochar ollmhór a dhéanamh do shaol sóisialta agus eacnamaíochta an oileáin.  Má théann an scéal amach i measc turasóirí nach bhfuil uisce in Inis Mór is beag duine a bheidh sásta cuairt a thabhairt ar an oiléan.  Níl oileán ar nós an mór-thír.  Ní féidir dul síos an bóthar agus tancanna uisce a thabhairt isteach.  Bhí orainn cupla bliain ó shin an t-uisce a thabhairt isteach ar thaincéirí móra ach ní réiteach ar bith é sin i lár an tsamhraidh.</P>
      <P>Tá an oiread ceart ag na h-oileánaigh do bhunsheirbhísí is atá ag duine ar bith eile sa tír.  Nuair a bhí Micheal Smith ina Aire chas sé le toscaireacht ón oileán, chir sé proíséas ar bun agus ceadaíodh airgead le hobair a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>I mí Márta na bliana seo caite, sin 10 mí ó shin, chuir an chomhairle chontae doiciméidí conradh le haghaidh breis stórais ar aghaidh go dtí an Roinn Chomhshaoil chomh maith le tuairisc ar an tolladh a rinneadh agus maidir leis an foinse uisce agus toradh na tástáileacha.

Agus mé ag eisteacht leis an Teachta Ó Cuív chuimhnigh me go raibh a phairtí i gcumhacht le fada an lá agus gan an obair seo a dhéanamh ar an oileán.  Tá an scéim curtha faoi bhráidh an Choimisiúin agus táimid ag feithimh le focal ar ais.</P>
      <P>Braitheann na trí oileán Árainn ar chúlchiste uisce áitiúil ar an uachtar agus faoin íochtar.  Tá srian ag baint le roinnt de na foinsí seo, go mór mhór ar Inis Oírr agus ar Inis Meán.  Tá an t-ádh ag Inis Meán sa chaoi go bhfuil foinse nua anmhaith uisce faoin íochtar faighte ag An Turloch Mór.  Tá sí seo á húsáid chun cur leis an soláthar seo nuair a bhíonn an t-éileamh ag an uasphointe.</P>
      <P>Le déanaí, chun na fadhbanna a bhaineann le soláthair uisce géara a mhaolú ar Inis Oírr, cheadaigh an tAire deontas de trí chéad caoga míle punt, £350,000, chun taiscumar de leath mhilliún galún, 500,000 galún, agus oibreacha riachtanacha eile a thógaint.  Tugtar le fios dom go dtosnóidh an obair seo go luath agus go mbeidh an scéim i bhfeidhm roimh an tséasúir turasóireachta.</P>

      <P>Tagann an soláthar uisce do Inis Mór ón Turloch Mór.  Tagann laghdú suntasach ar an leibhéal uisce sa Turloch Mór i rith tréimhsí tirime.  Tarlaíonn sé seo de ghnáth nuair atá an t-éileamh is mó ar an soláthar uisce, sé sin ó Mheitheamh go Meán Fómhair.  I rith an dá bhlian seo caite, úsáideadh an t-uisce faoin íochtar chun cur le soláthar uisce an oileáin agus bhíothas in ann ganntanais uisce a sheachaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tuigim go bhfuil titim suntasach tagtha sna míonna seo caite ar thitim bháistí in Inis Mór.  Dá bharr, thit leibhéal an uisce go mór sa Turloch Mór.  Ba ghá gearrú siar ar an soláthar san oíche <Col N="1440" /> go dtí gur tugadh na caidéail uisce i láthair agus gur tógadh an fhoinse uisce ar ais in úsáid arís.</P>
    <P>Tá sé beartaithe ag Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe scéim nua sholáthair uisce a fhorbairt in Inis Mór bunaithe ar an bhfoinse uisce ag an Turloch Mór.  Go nuige seo, d'íoc an Roinn deontais de tuairim is dá chéad míle punt, £200,000, do phleanáil agus do dhruileáil thobair thrialacha don scéim seo.  Mar a dúirt mé roimhe seo, bhíothas in ann cur go mór leis an soláthar uisce i rith an tsamhraidh leis na tobair thrialacha seo. Sa scéim nua, tá i gceist taiscumair nua, caidéail agus fearais chóireála a thógáil, maraon le píopaí dáiliúcháin nua.</P>
    <P>Tá iarratas ar mhaoiniú ón gCiste Comhuaineach do scéim uisce Inis Mhóir curtha faoi bhráid an Choimisiúin Eorpaigh ag an Roinn Comhshaoil. Nil cinneadh faighte ar seo go fóill.

Idir an dá linn, beidh an Roinn Comhshaoil i mbun cainte le Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe chun a dheimhniú go mbeidh na tobair thrialacha i bhfeidhm agus go mbeifear in ann soláthair uisce sásúil a choinneáil ar an oileán.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter, which is most urgent, and the Minister of State for attending to hear what we have to say.  It is unfortunate that in the past year we have had to deal with the BSE crisis.  Last week's inclusion of County Donegal, and other counties, in the beef ban on the Russian market is another blow to the economy, particularly the agriculture industry which is perhaps the main one in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State is acutely aware that small farmers &mdash; those who can least afford to take the knock &mdash; are the main type of farmer in County Donegal.  We have a great tradition of rearing good weanlings for sale to the larger farmers in the midlands and in the south east. From speaking to farmers in my constituency, I know that many have lost at least £120 per beast in 1996 compared to 1995 in the sale of their weanlings.  If the Minister or I had to take a reduction of that size in our incomes, we would certainly say we were struggling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree with pushing to reopen the Russian and Egyptian markets it must be done diplomatically. I hope something innovative is done within the Department to ensure those markets are reopened. The small farmer cannot afford to take such a severe loss in income although we have subsidies to help us in many ways.  Will the Minister consider making available a special package for County Donegal farmers and all those included in the beef ban to <Col N="1441" /> compensate for their loss?  It is most serious when one considers that the price of beef has been reduced by factories.  If Donegal is to be included in the ban, we will lose good customers and a good market which we have valued and built up in recent years. Animal husbandry is important and we have developed in agricultural practices.  There is a need for compensation and I hope the Minister will persuade his European partners to provide a proper package to compensate for the loss of income, for the reduction in the green pound and the loss to small farmers who I am sure are close to the Minister's heart since he is from County Kerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Coughlan for giving me the opportunity to express my concerns and that of my constituents about the ongoing difficulties facing the beef sector.</P>
      <P>The news of the departure today of a delegation of Egyptian vets from Ireland without any definite move to reopen that vital market to Irish beef is disappointing.  Farmers rightly want to see action to support the previously stated optimism for the outcome of this visit.  Fianna Fáil supported the Government's move to mount a diplomatic initiative to tackle the growing crisis. I and others on this side of the House repeatedly called from March 1996 for such an initiative.  We can only hope that, in waiting nine months to acknowledge the need for a political campaign to achieve progress, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, did not leave it too late to send out an SOS.</P>
      <P>Farmers still await the grand plan for the beef industry which was to be the result of a high powered committee of departmental Secretaries.  This promised response to the extension of the Russian ban as well as the Egyptian one was to be prepared within one week.  Two weeks have now passed.  The problems facing the beef industry are as urgent as they are serious.  I want the Minister, Deputy Yates, and this Government to close the gap between reality and their rhetoric.  As a TD for Cavan-Monaghan, counties which have had to bear the brunt of this crisis, I can say this matter is one of survival for farm families.  A second succeeding winter with serious losses will undermine the viability of many farms.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the rate of export refunds, the closure of the Egyptian market to live cattle exports and the extension of the Russian ban to five more counties have been serious blows for the beef sector in the recent past.  I repeat the call of my party for a national forum of all interest groups involved in the beef industry.  The rapid evolution of a national strategy is ever more necessary.  The Minister, Deputy Yates, has already found that he cannot handle the crisis in isolation from other Departments and Ministers. Equally, he can no longer afford to deal with this issue over the heads of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Counties Cavan, Monaghan and, as Deputy Coughlan said, her county of Donegal are highly <Col N="1442" /> dependent on agriculture.  Our local economies will not be able to sustain further blows to farm incomes.  I fully support the specific proposals outlined earlier by Deputy coughlan and I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, is here to respond.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Coughlan and Brendan Smith for raising this important matter on the Adjournment this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the concerns of beef producers in general, particularly those in the eight counties affected by the Russian ban, regarding the ongoing difficulties in the beef industry.  Apart from the difficulties resulting from the market problems created by the incidence of BSE disease, beef producers have also to contend with the recent 10 per cent cut in export refunds and the revaluation of the Irish agricultural conversation rate.</P>
      <P>The consumption of beef in the European Union fell substantially following the announcement in the House of Commons last March of a possible link between BSE and a new variant of CJD.  While there was a welcome recovery in consumption in the EU in the course of 1996, consumption remained significantly below pre-March 1996 levels in the bigger beef consuming countries such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom, for most of the year.  This decline in consumption led to reduced demand for Irish beef in these countries and, at the same time, has increased the availability of beef in these countries for export to third countries in competition with Irish exports.  The inevitable outcome of this increased competition was lower prices both on the EU market and in third countries.  The difficult situation on the EU market arising from the BSE problems was also reflected in the fact that some 420,000 tonnes of beef was sold into intervention in 1996, of which some 55,000 tonnes came from Ireland.</P>
      <P>Due to the dependence of the Irish beef industry on third country markets which accounted for more than 60 per cent of our beef and cattle exports in 1996, it is vital that all these markets remain open.  In the aftermath of the crisis last year a number of key markets which closed were quickly reopened through the Government's efforts with the exception of Libya and Iran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the increase in BSE cases in the latter part of last year, Russian veterinary authorities imposed restrictions on our beef exports by banning beef from three counties.  I am glad these restrictions had no adverse impact on cattle prices as the Russian contracts were more than adequately filled from the other counties while <Col N="1443" /> beef and cattle from the counties affected by the ban were disposed of on other markets.  It should be noted that prices actually rose substantially towards the end of the year in response to fairly buoyant export markets and the further recovery in consumer confidence within the EU.</P>
    <P>However, I acknowledge the closure of the Egyptian trade for live cattle and the extension of the Russian restrictions to a further five counties with effect from the 15 February are causes of concern for producers.  I assure the House and producers concerned that everything possible is being done to maintain access for Irish cattle and beef to all third country markets.  On invitation from the Tánaiste, an independent team of Egyptian veterinarians are in Ireland this week to examine the BSE situation here in order to enable the Egyptian authorities to review the ban on imports of live cattle from Ireland.  While I am happy with the progress of the visit, a final decision on the future of the ban will not be taken for some weeks.</P>
    <P>As far as Russia is concerned, a delegation from the Department headed by the chief veterinary officer visited Russia last week to outline the BSE situation here and the control measures enforced by my Department to control the disease and to safeguard consumers.  While the delegation was unable to dissuade the Russian authorities from extending the ban to five additional counties in line with the veterinary Protocol concluded between the Irish and Russian veterinary authorities in October 1996, the delegation succeeded in persuading the Russian authorities to agree to a formula for lifting the restrictions.  In the cases of Limerick and Cavan, both of which had four cases of BSE in 1996, the restriction will be lifted if no new case emerges between now and 1 May.  More generally, it has been agreed that normal trading arrangements will be restored if there is evidence that the level of BSE has reached a peak in Ireland and the number of cases has declined.</P>
    <P>While the extension of the restrictions is regrettable, nevertheless I am confident that the full Russian demand for Irish beef in 1997, which will be significant, will be met by counties not involved in the restrictions and that there should not be any undue impact on producer prices.  The Russian authorities have indicated that they are fully committed to the continuation of the beef trade with Ireland and it is important that this very critical market remains open to Irish beef. Donegal beef producers, or indeed producers in Cavan and any of the restricted counties, will not be affected by this ban as all the remaining markets which account for more than 70 per cent of our exports remain open to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> With regard to the difficulties caused by the 10 per cent cut in export refunds, my Department has made it clear to the Commission that the cut is unjustified and unnecessary at a time when the income of beef producers is still under severe strain.  The Minister, Deputy Yates, has made proposals to the Commission for an alternative approach to controlling the demand for export licences in a fairer and more effective manner, thereby allowing the refunds to support market prices at reasonable levels.  This issue was raised at this week's Council of Ministers meeting and support was forthcoming from a number of member states for a quick reversal of the decision.  The Taoiseach has raised the matter directly with Commission President, Mr. Santer, and he has also written to him seeking an immediate increase in the refunds.  Commissioner Fischler has undertaken to examine the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>My Department is finalising the details of the £30 million BSE compensation package which was agreed last October by the Council of Ministers. This package, on top of the £70 million package which was agreed earlier in 1996, will go a long way towards meeting the losses incurred by beef producers due to the BSE crisis.  In addition, we secured the continuation of the £16 million deseasonalisation winter slaughter premium, which is now being paid to winter finishers, as part of the BSE compensation package last June.  This is a very important income support for beef producers at this time &mdash; it is worth 7p per pound.  The improvements in the extensification premium, which we negotiated as part of the reform of the beef regime last October, are also worth £16 million to Irish producers in a full year.</P>
    <P>Compensation for the 4.3 per cent Irish pound revaluation will be forthcoming later this year and I am anxious that the details of this package can be agreed in the Council of Ministers as soon as possible in order that beef producers, who represent the most vulnerable sector in the agriculture economy, will receive an early payout. The revaluation will have no effect on the value of the various cattle premia as they remain unchanged until 1 January 1999.  I am conscious of the difficulties facing beef producers, but I am confident the measures we have succeeded in putting in place will maintain order in the market and underpin the income of producers.</P>
    <P>I thank the two Deputies for raising this matter and recognise the presence of Deputy Crawford who, representing Cavan-Monaghan, has an interest in this matter.  The fall in incomes and the decrease in exports of beef and cattle is directly related to the incidence of BSE, but I am confident that we can overcome the problem.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 28 January 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has a requirement that a new gaelscoil should have at least 20 junior infants who had not attended school previously, before recognition can be granted.</P>
      <P>It will be apparent that if a school is unable to provide such an enrolment on opening its viability in the future must be in doubt.  Before a new school is given recognition I must be sure that it will be viable.  This is particularly relevant, at this time, as a significant demographic decline is projected in primary school enrolments over the next few years.  The current rate of decline is of the order of 11,000 pupils per annum.</P>
      <P>Responding to the developing pluralism of the school system against a background of demographic decline and consequent implications for the viability of schools is a major challenge.  I have established the Commission on School Accommodation Needs.  One of the tasks of the commission, on which gaelscoileanna has a representative, is to draw up detailed criteria for the recognition of new primary schools.  I will consider how the current criteria applicable to gaelscoileanna should be developed or altered in the light of the commission's recommendations.</P>

    <P>I included a building project for Kilglass <Col N="1446" /> National School in my Department's 1995 primary school capital programme.  The inclusion of the project enabled it to proceed through architectural planning to the tender stage.  The school was made aware when the project was announced that the timing of the tender process would be decided in the light of financial resources available.</P>
    <P>The planning work is now complete and the project is ready to proceed to tender stage.  It is one of a number of priority projects I am considering for funding in the 1997 financial allocation in the context of the budget 1997 and I will make a decision in the matter very shortly.  I have already stated publicly that I regard Kilglass national school as a priority school.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1995, students who were residing more than 15 miles from college and who could reasonably be expected to travel to college from home each day having regard to the journey and available public transport, were only entitled to the adjacent rate of maintenance grant.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 20, 26, 31, 42, 47, 48, 54, 56, 60, 67, 71 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to devolving education to the regions is set out in the White Paper, Charting our Education Future.  Government policy in this area has been developed as a result of greater awareness of and sensitivity to the needs of regional communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the education boards will involve radically changing the administrative framework for education and a major refocussing of the Department of Education, including the gradual transfer of some functions from the Department to the boards and the rationalisation of the vocational education committees.  This will <Col N="1449" /> require detailed consultations with the trade unions and staff associations concerned.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to be precise about the cost implications of the establishment of education boards at this time.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the boards will not result in a completely new area of expenditure.  Rather, they will involve the re-allocation of funding and administrative responsibilities within the education system.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the education boards will take place on a phased basis, with a gradual transfer of functions to the boards, within a costed and approved plan, prepared by each board and approved by the Minister.  This will facilitate careful appraisal of the incremental costs of the boards, in the context of the education estimates for the year in question, and within the overall context of the budgetary parameters approved by Government, an education budget which has increased from £1.645 billion to an estimated £2.3 billion since 1992.</P>
    <P>To ensure the smooth transfer of functions to the education boards and to prepare for the new role of the Department, management consultants have been contracted to review the present organisational structure of the Department and make recommendations regarding the future structure of the Department and the education boards.  This will ensure that no unnecessary expenditure is incurred in the transfer of functions.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance has participated in the process of finalising the White Paper on Education and in considering in a general way the cost implications of education reform measures including the establishment of the education boards.  The Minister for Finance, in his reply to Deputy O'Donnell on 24 May 1995, indicated that all initiatives in the White Paper will have to be considered by the Government within the framework of the budgetary parameters.  Costings relating to the establishment of the education boards will be considered in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since taking office, I have made considerable progress in the integration of children with learning disabilities in mainstream schools, both through the development of policy and through the commitment of substantial additional resources to this area.</P>
      <P>A fundamental principle outlined in the White Paper, Charting our Education Future, and encompassed in the Education Bill, 1997, is that all students, regardless of their personal circumstances, have a right of access to and participation in the education system, according to their potential and ability.  Following their establishment, the education boards will co-ordinate educational provision for children with special needs in their regions.</P>
      <P>The objective is to ensure, to the maximum possible extent, that all children with special educational needs will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own areas and within the ordinary school system.  The degree to which integration can be achieved will depend on the specific and evolving capacities of each individual child.</P>
      <P>In many cases, children with special needs can be catered for in the ordinary school setting with the help, if necessary, of remedial teachers, resource teachers or visiting teachers.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have targeted substantial additional resources to all of these areas.  During this period, I have appointed an additional 241 remedial teachers, bringing the total number of remedial teachers in the primary system to 1,188.  This means that a remedial service is now available to 87 per cent of primary pupils.  During the same period, I appointed an additional 39 resource teachers to primary schools, bringing the total number of such teachers to 46.</P>
      <P>In November 1996, I appointed two additional visiting teachers for children with disabilities, bringing the total in this service to 40, and benefitting substantial numbers of children.</P>
      <P>I have also substantially increased the range of grants available to ordinary schools for the purchase of special materials/equipment for children with disabilities from a total of £275,000 in 1992 to £470,000 in 1996, an increase of over 70 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures which I have outlined provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the educational integration of <Col N="1451" /> children with learning disabilities in mainstream schools.</P>

Planning permission is also being sought for the development. When architectural planning has been completed, tenders will be invited immediately.</P>
      <P>The project at Kilrush is being treated as a priority by my Department and every effort is being made to expedite the architectural planning so that construction of the new building may start at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this question.  The first is the recognition of teaching qualifications obtained in Northern Ireland by the Minister for Education, as the designated authority under the EU General System Directive, for all teachers except registered secondary school teachers where the designated authority is the Secondary Teachers Registration Council, acting with the approval of the Minister.  The second is the recognition given by third level institutions here of diplomas and other qualifications obtained in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In relation to the recognition of teaching qualifications the position is that under the first EU General System Directive (89/48/EEC) persons who are fully qualified as teachers in any member state of the EU are entitled to practise their profession in any other member state.  This entitlement is subject generally to the terms of the directive which includes compensatory mechanisms where there are substantial differences in the scope and/or content of training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1 September 1996 teachers from any member state, subject to their qualifications being in order, are entitled to take up positions on a temporary basis for two years in primary schools in order to give them time to attain the necessary <Col N="1454" /> Irish language qualification.  The requirement to successfully complete the Scrúdú Cáilíochta na Gaeilge is not a barrier to mobility but a reflection of the constitutional position of Irish in the integrated primary curriculum.  Arrangements have been made to help teachers obtain the required qualification.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of this question concerns the recognition or credit given by third level institutions here of qualifications obtained in Northern Ireland.  All third level institutions in the Republic are autonomous in academic matters.  It is a matter for college authorities to decide what recognition, if any, they will give to a qualification granted in another institution, whether that institution is within the State or not.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has any specific concern in this area which he would like to convey to me I will arrange to have the matter investigated.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>her policy regarding the provision of adequate classrooms and other accommodation for amalgamating schools; and the longest delay in providing such accommodation.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1613/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Policy towards the amalgamation of schools is set firmly in the context of the overall policy as regards school provision which takes account of considerations such as educational quality and providing for an appropriate choice of level and type of education.  Rationalisation or amalgamations arise where there is a need to create schools of adequate size to offer a balanced programme of academic and practical subjects and to meet the needs arising from the different aspirations and abilities of pupils in an area.  Account is taken of a variety of factors, including demographic trends, curricular policies and local community needs and the availability of resources for the school capital programme.  Amalgamation of schools is dependent on the agreement of the patrons, trustees, school managements, parents and teachers involved.</P>
      <P>A policy of amalgamating smaller schools into larger school units has been pursued by my Department since the late 1960s.  Additional classroom accommodation, if required to facilitate the amalgamation of two or more schools, may be provided either by extending one of the existing school buildings or by providing a new school on a new site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The timescale for the provision of suitable accommodation can vary significantly depending on the circumstances of individual cases.  In general, however, the process takes a number of years, from initial examination of amalgamation possibilities and enrolment projection to site acquisition, project design, construction and completion. Where an agreement to amalgamate schools has been put in place, there are a number of factors which may delay the progress of a particular <Col N="1455" /> project, such as site difficulties and budgetary constraints.</P>
    <P>Because of the declining demographic trends, rationalisation of small schools will continue to be a major issue in the future.  In this connection, I have established a Commission on School Accommodation Needs, arising from a commitment given in the White Paper on Education, Charting Our Education Future.  As part of its remit, the commission will examine and make recommendations regarding appropriate criteria for the recognition of new schools and the rationalisation of existing schools.  The commission's recommendations in this regard will form the basis of a comprehensive policy review in this area.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, which has been made towards fulfilling the recommendation in the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education that the proportion of mature students be progressively increased to 2,200 full-time students by the year 2000; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Preliminary data from colleges indicate that the intake of mature students in the 1996-97 academic year is at least in the order of 1,500. This represents significant progress towards meeting the recommendation in the steering committee report.</P>
      <P>In this connection the Higher Education Authority allocated £240,000 in 1996 for initiatives being taken by the universities to assist mature students.  These initiatives include programmes for the training of tutors, evaluation of foundation and training courses, orientation activities and tutor/advisor networks.</P>
      <P>In addition, mature students could also benefit under initiatives being taken by the universities in the area of continuing education and training. The Higher Education Authority provided £210,000 in respect of these initiatives in 1996.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, over 6,200 additional university places will be created by the year 2000 by the joint private sector-exchequer £60 million capital initiative.  Over the same period, a further 1,000 places will be created in the regional technical college/DIT sector with the establishment of the first phases of Dún Laoghaire regional technical college and Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute with funding from the 1994-99 European Regional Development Fund programme.  The creation of these additional third level places by the end of the century will enable mature student intake to third level to increase further.</P>

    <P>A fundamental objective in the White Paper: Charting our Education Future is to increase <Col N="1458" /> retention rates in education to completion of senior cycle to 90 per cent by the end of the decade. Progress in the achievement of this target is being made, and rates of retention have increased from 70 per cent in 1986 to 82 per cent in 1993-94.</P>
    <P>My Department has a range of strategies in place to help prevent early school leaving.  These include: the development of early start centres; the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas; the new Breaking the Cycle initiative; the home/school/community/ liaison scheme; curricular reforms to allow students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes; improvements in the quality of teaching and certification systems; the expansion of psychological and guidance services; support for junior and senior centres for travellers; the free book scheme, and alleviation of examination fees, for necessitous pupils; and the development of second chance education and training options through Youthreach and the Vocational Training Opportunity Scheme.</P>

      <P>It is not clear from the Deputy's question whether he has a specific issue which he wishes to have addressed in regard to the participation of pupils/ students in the workforce.  The Deputy will be aware that the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1995, which came into force this month sets out the principal conditions governing the participation of young persons under 18 years in the workforce.</P>
      <P>The Government decided in the context of the White Paper &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo; to raise the school leaving age from 15 to 16 years or the completion of three years of junior cycle education, which ever is later.  In line with this the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, raises the minimum legal working age from 15 to 16 and lays down rules governing work hours, rest breaks and the duties of employers. My Department was consulted in the process leading to the preparation of this Act.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald who has responsibility for the implementation of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, has recently launched an information campaign to ensure that young persons under 18 are aware of their rights when they go to work.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Deputy's question may relate to recognition of work experience for purposes of the award of qualifications, TEASTAS, the Irish National Certification Authority, has been requested to address the recognition of experiential learning in the context of its work in the development of a national qualifications framework.</P>

      <P>The latest report to my Department from the Child Abuse Prevention Programme (CAPP) team regarding participation in the Stay Safe programme indicates that 85 per cent of schools have held information meetings for parents; 72 per cent of schools are already teaching the programme and 99.7 per cent of schools have availed of in-service training for teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, 79 schools have held parent meetings since September 1996 with a view to introducing <Col N="1462" /> the programme.  This is an encouraging and significant factor as the experience has been that the number of schools which have held parent meetings will closely mirror the number of schools that eventually teach the programme.  As can be appreciated there is often an interval between the holding of a parent meeting and the introduction of the programme into a school.</P>
    <P>A nationwide network of 40 teachers, capable of supporting the programme on a part-time basis, remains in place.  The network is targeting, in particular, those schools which currently are not teaching the programme.</P>

      <P>A number of reports, both national and international, indicate that the educational attainment level of young males is generally lower than that of females.  Participation rates of males in second level education is also less than that of females.  I consider these trends to be matters of concern.  I have introduced a range of measures at both primary and second level over the past few years to help redress the situation.</P>
      <P>Educational disadvantage is being addressed through the introduction of a new targeted initiative &mdash; Breaking the Cycle.  I have also expanded remedial and special education services at both primary and second level.  In Ireland as in most western countries young male learners form a majority of those with special learning needs.  At second level, increased participation, particularly of young males, will be facilitated by the expanded curricular provision at senior cycle.  I also introduced the junior certificate elementary programme to cater for a small but significant minority of students whose needs are not adequately catered for in the present broadly based junior certificate.</P>
      <P>My Department's gender equality committee has initiated a project in a number of schools which addresses factors in the &ldquo;hidden curriculum&rdquo; which may affect boys' achievements in school.</P>

Ina leith seo tagraíodh go bhfuil an scéim faoi mhí-bhuntáiste ag freastal faoi láthair ar 17 faoin gcéad de dhaltaí na tíre.

      <P>As I pointed out to the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 47 of 14 November 1996, in the case of the 13 exclusively multi-denominational schools established since 1978, no minimum level of overall enrolment, or of junior infant enrolment, was required for the granting of official recognition. Rather, the growth potential of the applicant schools was determined by my Department on the basis of a detailed examination of each application. The question of granting permanent recognition was considered in the light of each school's development after a number of years of operation, at which stage it would have been possible to project ultimate size and, consequently, the amount of State aided accommodation to be provided.</P>
      <P>I have established the Commission on School Accommodation Needs.  One of the tasks which I have entrusted to the commission is to draw up detailed criteria for the recognition of new primary schools.  The commission has begun work on this task.  I will consider how the criteria applicable to new multi-denominational schools should be developed or altered in the light of the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment as Minister, I have given priority to addressing the issue of disadvantage in education and a range of strategies are in place. These include the development of Early Start centres; the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas; the expansion of the home school community liaision scheme; curricular reforms to allow students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes &mdash; the junior certificate, the junior certificate elementary programme, the transition year programme, the leaving certificate applied and the expansion of the leaving certificate vocational programme &mdash; improvements in the quality of teaching and certification systems; the expansion of psychological and guidance services; support for junior and senior centres for travellers; the free book scheme, and alleviation of examination fees, for necessitious pupils; the development of links between second level disadvantaged schools and third level institutions; the development of second chance education and training options through Youthreach and the vocational training opportunity scheme and a range of adult and community education programmes.  In particular, a new targeted initiative aimed at Breaking the Cycle of educational disadvantage was launched in 1996.  Under this initiative, a number of selected primary schools in urban and rural areas have been targeted for an intensive package of additional supports, including additional staffing and reduced class sizes in large urban schools, special additional funding for materials and equipment and a special programme of in-career development.</P>
      <P>I will continue to give priority to the area of disadvantage in the context of available resources.</P>

      <P>A sum of £20.85 million has been included in the 1997 Capital Estimates provision for the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  It will ensure the continuation of the ongoing rolling capital investment programme for the sector.  In particular in so far as the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology are concerned it will allow for a further major step to be taken in the implementation of the £73.5 million European Regional Development Fund programme.  This initiative which I first announced in January 1994 is geared towards the construction of new facilities and upgrading of existing infrastructure to facilitate a much needed expansion of the third level system; <Col N="1468" /> the development of a supply of highly skilled manpower, with a view to meeting the skill needs of existing industry and to attract foreign investment; providing support for indigenous industry by generating the research capacity to introduce and dissemination of state-of-the-art technology, the development of new products and the upgrading of existing products; strengthening the links between educational institutions and researchers and industry in various fields; and improving remedial action to combat social and regional inequalities in participation at third level.</P>
      <P>Consideration is at present being given by my Department to the report presented by the regional technical colleges in November 1996.</P>

      <P>Tá sé de churpóir agam gach iarratas ar aitheantas mar scoil a phróiseáil agus cinneadh a thabhairt dos na h-iarrathóirí chomh tapaidh agus is féidir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I 1995, deineadh socrú leis an eagraíocht, Gaelscoileanna, go gcuirfí iarratais ar aitheantas faoi bhráid na Roinne roimh dheireadh mí Márta ó 1996 amach.  Bhí mar bhunús leis an socrú sin go <Col N="1469" /> go mbeadh dóthain ama ar fáil chun gach iarratas a mheas go cúramach agus cinneadh tráthiúil a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Caithfear a rá, áfach, gur beag iarratas nach bhfuil deacracht nó castacht éigin ag baint leis. 'Siad na deacrachtaí is coitianta ná: nach mbíonn dóthain daltaí ar fáil nuair a seoltar an t-iarratas, go mbíonn an cóiríocht míshásúil, nó go gcuireann scoileanna sean-bhunaithe i gcoinne an iarratais. Is minic a bhíonn na deacrachtaí seo go léir ag gabháil le h-iarratas amháin agus caithfear gach ceann acu a chíoradh go cúramach.</P>
    <P>I gcás uimhir na ndaltaí, is minic a bhíonn breis ama á lorg ag na h-iarrathóirí féin, toisc nach bhfuil an íos-uimhir de pháistí cláraithe acu ó thosach.  I gcásanna eile, tuairiscíonn cigirí na Roinne nach bhfuil an cóiríocht atá molta ag na h-iarrathóirí sásúil ó thaobh sábháltachta, spáis nó áiseanna de.  I gcásanna eile fós, cuireann scoileanna eile i gcoinne an iarratais ar an mbonn nach bhfuil gá, dar leo, le scoil breise sa cheantar agus go n-ísleofar a rollacháin féin.  Chun a bheith cothrom, agus chun deimhin a dhéanamh de go bhfuil iarratas ar scoil nua in ord i ngach slí, caithfear gach gné de a chíoradh go cúramach.  Cuireann na coinsí seo go léir moill ar an bpróiséas, áfach.</P>
    <P>Is fiú gné tabhachtach eile a lua.  Más rud go dteipeann ar iarratas, caithfear deis a thabhairt dos na h-iarrathóirí achainí a dhéanamh sa chás, más mian leo.  Anuraidh, bhí ceithre iarratas déag ar aitheantas mar ghaelscoileanna agus theip ar sé chinn i dtosach.  Tar éis dos na h-iarrathóirí sin go léir achainí a dhéanamh agus eolas breise a sholáthar, d'éirigh le trí chinn eile aitheantas a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>In ainneoin na ndeachrachtaí go léir a bhaineann leis na h-iarratais seo, ba mhaith liom go mór dá bhféadfaí cinneadh deireannach a dhéanamh níos luaithe i ngach cás.  Anuraidh, bhunaigh mé an Coimisiún um Riachtanais Chóiríochta Scoileanna agus beidh mar chéad cúram eile ar an gCoimisiún moltaí a chur faoi mo bhráid maidir le coinníollacha aitheantais do bhunscoileanna nua. Rachaidh an coimisiún i mbun na h-oibre sin go luath agus tá súil agam go ndéanfar an deacracht a luaigh an Teachta a phlé agus moltaí a dhéanamh ina thaobh.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, states that the establishment of education boards and the transfer of functions to the boards will take place on a phased basis, within a costed plan, prepared by each board, and approved by the Minister, following the enactment of the necessary legislation.  This strategy is reflected in the Education Bill, 1997, which was published earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The gradual transfer of functions to the boards will facilitate careful appraisal of the incremental costs, in the context of the education estimates for the year in question, within the overall context of the budgetary parameters approved by Government.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Bill provides for the composition of education boards to include a core board, comprising nominess of patrons, parent nominees, teacher nominees, local elected representatives and ministerial nominees.  This core board will then put forward additional agreed nominees for appointment by the Minister to the education board.  These nominees, from the wider community, will represent minorities and disadvantaged groups, as well as people with special expertise.  Following the enactment of the legislation, an appropriate period of time will be required to make arrangements for the selection and appointment of nominees in each of the categories, before the boards can become operational.</P>
      <P>To ensure the smooth transfer of functions to the education boards, and to prepare for the new role of the Department, management consultants have been contracted to review the present organisational structure of the Department and make recommendations regarding the future structure of the Department and the education boards.  At this stage, any timetable for the setting up of the boards would be highly speculative and therefore not very useful.  It is, however, my intention that the boards will be established with the minimum of delay.</P>

      <P>Section 55 of the Education Bill, 1997, provides that each appeals committee will consist of the director of the education board, an inspector <Col N="1472" /> seconded to the education board and a barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years' standing. This will provide a forum independent of the original decision-makers which can adjudicate on serious complaints when necessary.  The inspector will have previously been a teacher and indeed it is possible that the director will have had teaching experience.</P>
      <P>Schools are complex organisations, dealing with matters of the most fundamental interest to students and their parents.  From time to time difficulties or disagreements may arise between the various parties involved.  At present, the vast majority of difficulties are capable of resolution within the individual school, by reference to the board of management, if necessary.</P>
      <P>The appeals procedure set out in the Education Bill, 1997, will not replace existing procedures in schools for the resolution of problems.  Where decisions cannot be resolved within the school, recourse to an independent appeals procedure may be necessary.  For this purpose, each education board will be obliged to establish an appeals procedure in accordance with the directions of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that appeals must first be dealt with by the board of management of the school.  The appeals committee will be the final forum for appeals of decisions.  The appeals procedure will include safeguards against frivolous and mischievous appeals and it will deal with very serious grievances with speed and finality.</P>

      <P>The FORFÁS Report <i>Shaping our Future</i>&mdash;<i>A Strategy for Enterprise in Ireland in the 21st Century</i> was published in May 1996.  The findings in the report were informed by a number of consultancy studies on a variety of themes, including a study by Mclver Consulting entitled <i>Vision 2010</i>&mdash;<i>Education and Training Study.</i> Both reports focused on the development of a long-term strategy to promote the central role of enterprise in supporting economic and social progress in the period up to 2010.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has a range of measures in place to address the changing needs of the economy in the years ahead.  At primary level, the proposals in the Education White Paper, Charting our Education Future, provide for the enhancement of the science programme as an integral part of the curricular review now under way by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. At post-primary level a range of reforms have been introduced in senior cycle, focused on broadening the range of programmes on offer, <Col N="1473" /> and strengthening the enterprise, language, vocational and technological dimensions of courses.  I have also established a steering group to develop proposals on the integration of information and communication technologies into first and second level education.</P>
    <P>My Department, with the Higher Education Authority, works closely with the Department of Enterprise and Employment, FORFÁS and the IDA to ensure that changing skill needs are monitored and the education system is adapted to meet them.  For example, additional places in computer software training have been approved in the university sector, a range of new courses have been introduced in regional technical college/DIT colleges in the computer, electronics and multi-media fields, and foreign language modules have been introduced in a range of business, engineering, technology, and tourism programmes. At post-leaving certificate level, new courses in teleservices have been provided.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in campus company activity, post-graduate industrial research, campus incubation facilities and participation in schemes such as Forbairt's applied research programme, and heads of development have been appointed in regional technical college/DIT colleges to enhance their capacity to support industry. Under the operational programme for industrial development specific funding has been made available for some of the recommendations proposed by the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council.</P>
    <P>A range of part-time courses have been developed in the third level sector to meet the needs of lifelong learning, with opportunities for the accumulation of credits towards awards. TEASTAS, the Irish National Certification Authority has been established to provide a forum for the active involvement of industry, with education and training interests, in programme design and certification for all extra-university vocational training in the education and training sectors.  TEASTAS has been given a specific remit to develop a national qualifications framework, to provide for the accumulation of credits towards awards which are suitable for full-time or part-time courses, and to make arrangements for the accreditation of work-based and experiential learning.</P>
    <P>These developments are being accompanied by intensive measures to address educational disadvantage at every level of the system, and an expansion of second chance education and training programmes such as Youthreach and the vocational training opportunity scheme.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether republican prisoners who are on temporary transfer from British jails to Northern Ireland jails should be granted the status of permanent transferred prisoners in order to bring these prisoners under the control of the Northern Ireland Office as opposed to the Home Office in London; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has consistently emphasised to the British authorities through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and through the Irish Embassy in London our support for the principle that, wherever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families.  Since July 1994, 19 republican prisoners have been transferred from Britain to Northern Ireland, ten on a permanent and nine on a temporary basis. We have welcomed these transfers and will continue to seek further transfers in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> As indicated in my reply to a question by Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív on 5 November 1996, we have also pressed for transfers to Northern Ireland to be permanent rather than temporary, since temporary transfers create uncertainty and impose certain difficulties for prisoners and their families which would be avoided if the transfers were permanent.  On my instructions, attention was again drawn to the humanitarian difficulties which exist for temporary transfer prisoners and their families at a recent meeting held between officials of the Irish Embassy in London and officials from the British Home Office and Prison Service.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Deputy and some of his party colleagues recently visited a number of prisoners on temporary transfer to Northern Ireland who are currently held in Maghaberry Prison in County Antrim.  I have read the delegation's report of their visit with interest and at my request, a copy has been forwarded to the Embassy in London to inform their future contacts with the British authorities on this matter.</P>
    <P>More generally, we have stressed the importance of addressing prison issues in a positive and forward looking manner to the British authorities on numerous occasions.  We have also repeatedly made clear that we stand ready to receive republican prisoners who have applied for a transfer to prison in this jurisdiction under the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.</P>

      <P>The Government is extremely concerned at the plight of the Marsh Arabs of southern Iraq, who are under threat because of the draining of the marshes on which their unique lifestyle depends, and the repeated bombardments and incursions by Iraqi forces into the marshes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iraq has not complied with the UN sanctions imposed on it following the Gulf War when we closed our Embassy in Baghdad.  In common with our EU partners, we have limited contacts with Iraq.  However, I wrote to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Tariq Aziz, on 8 February 1996 to raise a number of concerns to the Irish Government including the plight of the Marsh Arabs.  In my letter, I called on Iraq to halt its attacks on the Marsh Arab population and to comply fully with the terms of the 1995 Resolution of the UN Commission on Human Rights (CHR) on the human rights situation on Iraq, which was co-sponsored by Ireland and its EU partners, and which called on Iraq to halt and <Col N="1476" /> reverse the draining of the marshes.  I regret that Iraq has not given any indication that it intends to implement these measures to protect the Marsh Arab population.</P>
    <P>In view of Iraq's continuing failure to respond to the concerns of the international community, all EU member states co-sponsored a further CHR Resolution in April 1996, and called on Iraq to co-operate with UN and other aid agencies to provide humanitarian assistance to the population of southern Iraq.  Ireland, as Presidency of the EU, made a firm statement on the plight of the Marsh Arabs at the 51st Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 18 November 1996, condemning Iraq's continuing denial of its population's civil and political rights and expressing the EU's dismay at the plight of the community of the southern marsh areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>Economic and monetary union (EMU) will begin on 1 January 1999 and the single currency, the euro, will come into being on that date. National notes and coins will continue in circulation: euro notes and coins will be introduced by 1 January 2002 at the latest and, with their introduction, national notes and coins will begin to be withdrawn, with the changeover being completed within six months at most.</P>
      <P>As regards public information, in December last I launched a national information programme on economic and monetary union and the changeover to the euro with the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Tourism and Trade.  The programme will be in phases, designed to correspond with the phases of the changeover and to provide information in a timely way.  The first phase will run to the end of this year and will focus mainly on provision of information to help businesses prepare themselves for the changeover.  Forfás, the policy and advisory board for industrial development, is running a business awareness campaign to this end. The national information programme will be reviewed in the second half of 1997, when the question of broadening its focus will be considered.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the first phase of the programme will cost £300,000.  The European Commission has indicated that it is willing to fund half this figure, i.e. £150,000.  A sum of £70,000 has been included in my Department's 1997 estimates towards the cost of the national information programme in 1997, and the remainder of the cost ie £80,000, will be borne by Forfás.</P>

    <P>As regards dual pricing, the Deputy may recall that around the time of the Dublin European Council, Euro Week was organised on my behalf by EAN Ireland, the organisation which sets the <Col N="1478" /> standards for article numbering, bar coding etc, and the Licensed Vintners Association.  As part of Euro Week, up to 10,000 posters featuring prices in euro and in Irish pounds (at a notional rate of one euro equal to 80 pence, an illustrative rate chosen for ease of calculation), were distributed to groceries, supermarkets etc, nationwide; also, some 250 publicans in Dublin were invited to display prices in euro and Irish pounds at the same notional rate.  The costs of Euro Week were borne by EAN Ireland and the Licensed Vintners Association.</P>
    <P>The Deputy presumably has in mind, however, the display of dual prices during the changeover to the euro.  Given the timescale I have outlined, the Deputy will appreciate that dual pricing in euro and Irish pounds could not become a reality for some time.  I understand that the issue of dual pricing is being considered by the European Commission but that no proposals have emerged to date.  Of course, if it is decided that dual prices are required to be displayed, it will be a matter for retailers to comply with this requirement.  In such circumstances, appropriate public information will be made available in good time to all relevant parties.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board submitted a report on the tenders for the interim works at University College Hospital, Galway, to my Department in September 1996, following the completion of the detailed planning process for this project.  The Department completed its assessment of the report during that month, and a submission seeking the sanction of the Minister for Finance to the acceptance of the recommended tenders was sent to the Department of Finance in late September, in accordance with the procedures specified for projects of this size.  This submission is currently the subject of correspondence and discussions between the two Departments.</P>
      <P>The capital funding required for this project will depend on several factors that are difficult to assess accurately in advance, and it is not possible to give a precise figure at this stage.  Adequate provision for the project will be made in the capital programme for 1997 and subsequent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> I fully accept the need for this development and I can assure the Deputy that my Department will approve the acceptance of the tenders as soon as the sanction of the Minister for Finance has been conveyed for the development.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have stated publicly on many previous occasions that I am committed to putting the resources in place to support the development of enhanced maternity services in Cork.  I am happy to say that during 1996 the agencies in Cork reached a consensus about the amalgamation of maternity services on the Cork University Hospital site.</P>
      <P>Once agreement has been reached, I immediately gave the go-ahead to the establishment of a project team, representing medical, nursing, managerial and Department of Health interests. Work is well advanced on the development of a brief for the new obstetric service.  I expect that the brief will be finalised during 1997 and this will form the basis for the development of the amalgamated maternity unit on the grounds of Cork University Hospital.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware, a working group on the reorganisation of accident and emergency services in Cork was established by the Southern Health Board in May 1995 to review the organisation and delivery of accident and emergency services in Cork.  The group met on a number of occasions under the chairmanship of Mr. Stephen Cusack, accident and emergency consultant at Cork University Hospital.  The group completed its report in March 1996 and I understand that its recommendations have been endorsed by the Southern Health Board, subject to a small number of modifications.  A copy of the report was forwarded for consideration within my Department at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>Preliminary discussions have already taken place between officials of my Department and the Southern Health Board, to clarify the resource implications, priorities and time scale involved.  I am anxious to discuss these issues further with the board in the context of its 1997 budget and service plan.  These meetings will be taking place over the coming weeks.</P>

The effect of section 32 is that unless special exemption has been obtained in accordance with the Act a marriage shall not be valid unless the parties have met the notice requirement.</P>
      <P>Administration of the registration system for marriages is primarily a matter for the RegistrarGeneral of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.  I have been advised by my colleague, the Minister for Health, who has responsibility in relation to the office of the Registrar General, of some difficulties which have arisen in relation to certain aspects of the notification requirement under section 32.  Consultations are taking place between my Department and the Department of Health with a view to finding an early and satisfactory solution to the problem involved.  All avenues of approach, including amending legislation, are being considered and decisions in the matter will be announced as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The objective is to ensure, to the maximum possible extent, that all children with special educational needs will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own areas and within the ordinary school system.  The degree to which integration can be achieved will depend on the specific and evolving capacities of each individual child.</P>
      <P>In many cases, children with special needs can be catered for in the ordinary school setting with the help, if necessary, of remedial teachers, resource teachers or visiting teachers.  Since my appointment as Minister for Education I have targeted increased resources in all of these areas.</P>
      <P>Where more serious disabilities are involved, children can be placed in a special class or a special school.  Each such facility is dedicated to meeting the needs of particular groups and has a special reduced pupil teacher ratio and special rates of capitation funding.</P>

      <P>A list of the educational institutions providing courses in tourism is attached, showing the number of students expected to graduate from each programme this year, and the certification being provided for the programmes.</P>
      <P>There are 60 institutions offering post-leaving certificate courses for 2,052 students, and eight institutions providing programmes for an expected output of 934 students in the regional technical college/DIT sector.  A range of these programmes is funded by my Department but provided in co-operation with CERT, the State agency for tourism training, which plays a major role in course design, quality assurance and certification.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach.  I launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intenton to continue this process.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in 1995, I allocated a sum of £150,000 for the introduction of a pilot scheme of grant-aid towards the provision of escorts on certain school transport services.  Similar levels of funding have been made available in 1996 and 1997.</P>
      <P>All applications for support under this scheme were carefully considered by my Department.  It was decided that the pilot phase of the scheme should concentrate on facilitating the appointment of escorts on services to special schools and special classes for children with a physical handicap; and providing assistance towards the cost of escorts for pupils attending the special schools for hearing-impaired and visually-impaired children who travel long distances by bus and train at weekends.</P>
      <P>The question of the future provision of escorts on special transport services is one of the issues being considered by the school transport review committee which was established last year.  I expect to receive that committee's report in the near future.</P>

      <P>I do not consider that there is any unreasonable discrimination involved in this case.  The large majority of posts in organisations have requirements in regard to qualifications and experience.</P>
      <P>Education centres (formerly teachers' centres) are an important strategic resource for teachers and the wider school community.  Since the establishment of the first centres in 1972 the appointment of directors to full-time and part-time centres has been on the basis of seconding teachers from existing teaching posts.  The new posts recently advertised are being filled on similar basis.</P>
      <P>Given the role and functions of education centres, particularly in the area of providing training and support in regard to the major curricular reforms and new programmes in schools, directors are required to have appropriate experience in the Irish education system and to have a good up-to-date knowledge of the education system at first and second levels.  In this context, directors also have a role as trainers and designers of relevant inservice provision.  Further, a key objective is to build up expertise which will continue to be available within the system when directors, who will be appointed on contract basis, return to their schools.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied with the condition of the heating system at Scoil Fhursa and Scoil Ide.  I am aware of the heating problems and that the schools closed earlier than expected before Christmas.  I am aware also that repairs were carried out to the system over the Christmas period.</P>
      <P>The long-term solution to the problem is the complete replacement of the systems at an estimated cost of £250,000.  The project, which will have to be carried out during a summer holiday period, is one of a number of urgent projects being considered for funding in 1997.  The Deputy will be aware that there were major cuts in the capital funding of primary schools in the 1988-92 period.  These cuts have caused a significant backlog of urgent projects.  I am determined to continue the progress made since 1993 in addressing this backlog.</P>
      <P>My Department's records of school closures are maintained on a school roll number basis. Hence it would be difficult to identify closures on a geographical basis.  The Deputy will appreciate that as there are some 4,000 schools at primary and post-primary level, I could not justify assigning scarce staff resources to compilation of the information on a geographical basis.  Apart from Scoil Ide and Scoil Fhursa, I am aware that Greendale Community School closed recently for a number of days for urgent repairs to its heating system.  I understand this work is now completed. Finally, the issue of maintenance is a matter for individual school boards of management.</P>

      <P>My Department will provide over £39 million this year towards the running costs of such courses, and I have abolished fees for PLC courses with effect from 1995-96.  To provide a maintenance grants scheme for PLC students along the lines of the third level scheme would cost in excess of £11 million per annum.  I am sure the House will appreciate that a balance has to be struck between competing demands for resources in the education sector &mdash; between funding for the different levels of the system, between initial and <Col N="1502" /> second chance education, between student supports, investment in quality assurance, and special measures to combat disadvantage and underachievement.</P>
      <P>In the case of PLC courses I consider it more important to concentrate on improving the quality of the system, through investment in national certification and assessment arrangements, in programme developments, in inservice training, and in ensuring provision in a wide range of disciplines for as many students as possible.  Due to overall resources constraints I am unable to provide maintenance grants for PLC students.  I will, of course, keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals to downgrade Garda stations in Dromod and Rooskey.  It may be that the Deputy's question relates to the rural community policing scheme which has been operating in 14 Garda districts throughout the country since 1991.  It was intended that the schemes, once operational for a reasonable period, would be extended to other districts.  The Garda authorities are currently evaluating experience of the existing rural community policing schemes and reviewing their 1994 proposals for its extension.  This involves a consultative process taking in consultations with local Garda management, the Garda representative associations and, most critically, local community interests.</P>
      <P>This process, by its nature, will take some time to complete.  However, I am particularly anxious to ensure that there will be sufficient consultations with local interest groups before any decision is made to extend the scheme.  It is only after the detailed consultative process has been completed that the Garda Commissioner will be in a position to submit to me proposals as to whether rural policing should be extended or not, or modified as the case may be.</P>
      <P>There has been some misunderstanding over the years in the media and by members of the public about the scheme which was not designed to close rural Garda stations.  It is actually aimed at allowing the gardaí to spend more time on active operational duties in their districts including, in particular, visits to the elderly, while at the same time providing for station opening hours which actually suit local community needs.  It is precisely these objectives which are being examined to see how well they have been met in the existing rural policing areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 148 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935 responsibility for the day to day maintenance of the courthouse at Anglesea Street, Cork rests with Cork Corporation. The refurbishment of Anglesea Street courthouse, Cork was recently undertaken by the Office of Public Works on behalf of my Department.</P>
      <P>This courthouse is fully accessible for people with mobility difficulties, with the exception of part of the court office and the legal representatives rooms.  However, provision have been made to enable persons with disabilities to conduct all their business at ground floor level, where sufficient suitable facilities have been provided.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that following recent discussions between the Office of Public Works and local interested groups, my Department has approved some further minor works to the building to make it more user-friendly, particularly for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>At present, all recipients of the widow'swidower's contributory pension, widow's non-contributory pension and one-parent family payment who are aged 66 or over are entitled to free travel, and may qualify (subject to satisfying certain living alone conditions) for free electricity and or natural gas or bottled gas refill allowance, free telephone allowance and television licence.</P>
      <P>The estimated annual cost of extending free travel to all recipients of the schemes in question would be over £6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1515" /> Bearing in mind that qualification is subject to certain conditions, it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of extending free electricity and/or natural gas or bottled gas refill allowance, free telephone rental allowance and television licence to all recipients of the schemes referred to. However, it is estimated that the additional annual cost could be up to £49 million.</P>

      <P>European business information centres (Euro-Info-Centres) are provided for under the multinational programme for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union.  Their primary purpose is to make community information available to SMEs. Within the context of the third Multiannual Programme for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (1997-2000), agreed during the Irish Presidency, it is proposed to develop Euro-Info-Centres as &ldquo;first-stop-shops&rdquo; for Community information and improve the quality of services which they provide to SMEs throughout the European Union.</P>
      <P>There are six Euro-Info-Centres operating in Ireland.  These are located in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Sligo and Waterford.  Each centre is established on the premises of a &ldquo;parent&rdquo; organisation.  The six Irish EICs are located within the Cork, Galway, Sligo and Waterford Chambers of Commerce, Shannon Development in Limerick and the Irish Trade Board in Dublin. The operational costs of each EIC are funded by the European Commission and the &ldquo;parent&rdquo; organisation.</P>
      <P>When analysed on the basis of the number of enterprises or the general population of each member state, it is clear that Ireland, in the interests of geographical cohesion within the Eurpean Union, has been allocated proportionately more EICs than larger member states of the Union.  In fact, Ireland has secured over double the number of EICs which the proportion of enterprises in Ireland would dicate.</P>
      <P>It is not envisaged that there will be an opportunity to further increase the number of EICs in Ireland in the near future.  Should such an opportunity arise, I will make every effort to ensure that the maximum possible number of EICs are located in Ireland.</P>

      <P>This measure is fully funded by the European Union without any Exchequer contribution. Following a recent review of the future of the scheme by the European Commission, the conclusion was reached that it should be extended for a further two years, but that the monthly entitlement should be halved to reflect the general decline in butter consumption in Ireland.  Since 1980, <i>per capita</i> butter consumption in Ireland has fallen from 2lbs per month to under 1lb.</P>

      <P>Foods and food ingredients which have been subject to bioengineering of the kind generally referred to as genetic engineering would come within the scope of the recently adopted regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients.  My colleague, the Minister for Health will shortly assume responsibility for the implementation in Ireland of this regulation.</P>
      <P>The regulation provides for an assessment and an approval system for novel foods and food ingredients including labelling requirements of such foods where this is desirable to inform the consumer of any characteristic or food property such as composition, nutritional value or nutritional effects and intended use of the food which renders the food no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient.</P>
      <P>There are specific labelling requirements to ensure that the final consumer is informed of the presence of an organism genetically modified by techniques of genetic modification generally referred to as genetic engineering.</P>
      <P>Novel foods and novel food ingredients produced from but not containing genetically modified organisms will have to be labelled if they are no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no existing specific requirements to label hybridised seeds and foods and food <Col N="1518" /> ingredients which have been irradiated unless they also come within the definition of novel foods.

There are no current proposals to bring forward national legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>The requirements of Council Directive No. 79/112, as amended, relating to the laws on the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer apply also to bioengineered and irradiated foods.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 172 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything possible is being done to get the recent cut in export refunds for beef reversed. The decision to cut refunds was taken by the EU Commission in order to reduce the demand for export licences because they believed that the level of applications was excessive relative to the quantity allowed under the GATT agreement. <Col N="1520" /> Licences totalling 60,000 tonnes had been sought on the day prior to the decision.  My Department has made it clear to the Commission that these cuts are unjustified and unnecessary at a time when the income of beef producers is still under severe strain.</P>
    <P>I have proposed an alternative approach to the Commission for controlling the demand for export licences in a fairer and more effective manner, thereby allowing the refunds to support market prices at reasonable levels.  This issue was raised at this week's Council of Ministers meeting and support was forthcoming from a number of member states for a quick reversal of the decision.  The Taoiseach has raised the matter directly with Commission President, Mr. Santer, and he has also written to him seeking an immediate increase in the refunds.  Commissioner Fischler has undertaken to examine my suggestions.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to estimate the cost to the agriculture industry of the difficulties created by the cut in refunds because the decision should be mitigated somewhat by the improvements in EU markets and through the intervention support measures which are in place.  The strengthening EU markets now provide a more attractive outlet for greater quantities of Irish beef at improved prices.  In addition, the higher prices on EU markets, combined with the cut in refunds, should lead to higher prices in third country markets, thereby offsetting some of the effects of the reduction in refunds.  Furthermore, the fact also that third country markets for beef remain undiminished will ensure that substantial market outlets remain for Irish beef and therefore prices should be maintained close to current levels.</P>

      <P>The Directive concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity was adopted by Council on 19 December 1996.  This Directive provides for a progressive opening of the European electricity market while also providing for implementation of necessary public service obligations.  Ireland has three years in which to bring into force the legislation necessary to comply with the Directive.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the implementation of the Directive and the development of the internal market which is designed to promote efficiency and choice in electricity production and supply, thus improving competitiveness in member states.</P>
      <P>There is also a draft EU Directive concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas.  The main provisions of this from the point of view of deregulation are that vertically integrated gas undertakings must unbundle their accounts for transmission and distribution activities and that transmission companies must provide third party access to their networks in respect of large industrial consumers are distribution companies on the basis of voluntary agreements.  Large industrial consumers are defined as those consuming in excess of 25 million cubic metres of gas per annum.  Ireland basically supports the Directive but seeks to limit customers eligible for third party access to large industrial customers consuming at least 25 million cubic metres of gas per annum at a single site.  The total consumption by customers above that threshold in Ireland comes to 75 per cent of Bord Gáis Éireann's total gas deliveries.  Ireland feels that with 75 per cent of the market open to third party access, it is already one of the most liberal in Europe.</P>

      <P>The measures which remain to be adopted by Council and Parliament and their current status is as follows:</P>
      <P>Licensing of telecommunications services</P>
      <P>Political agreement was reached at the September Council on a common position on the draft Directive on a common framework for general authorisations and individual licences in the field of telecommunications services.  The purpose of this Directive is to ensure a harmonised approach to licensing throughout the European Union and in particular to preclude the use of licensing procedures as a barrier to market entry.</P>
      <P>Satellite Personal Communications Services</P>
      <P>Political agreement was reached at the September Council on a common position on the draft Decision on action at Union level in the field of satellite personal communications services in the European Union.  This draft decision concerns the licensing of systems based on emerging technologies to enable the provision of handheld, mobile satellite telephone services.  The objective is to ensure that the same systems are licensed throughout the European Union in order to enable pan-European operability for individual users of such telephones.</P>
      <P>Open Network Provision &mdash; Framework and Leased Lines Directives</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A common position was formalised in relation to the draft Directive amending the Council Directives 90/387/EEC and 92/44/EEC for the purpose of adaptation to a competitive environment in telecommunications.  Political agreement <Col N="1523" /> on the substance of the common position was achieved by the Italian Presidency in early 1996.  The purpose of this Directive is to update the provisions of Directives adopted in the early stages of liberalisation of telecommunications which imposed obligations in relation to the provision by monopoly telecommunications operators of network access by competing service providers. The main provisions concern the imposition of obligations on dominant rather than monopoly operators and the establishment of measures to ensure the independence of national regulatory authorities.</P>
    <P>Interconnection Directive</P>
    <P>The draft Directive on interconnection in telecommunications with regard to ensuring universal service and interoperability through application of the principles of open network provision contains measures to ensure the interconnection of networks and services of competing operators in a liberalised environment.  It also contains provisions in relation to the financing on an equitable basis of the costs of universal service formerly carried by monopoly operators.  Progress was achieved on preparation for conciliation with the European Parliament in order to facilitate final adoption of the Directive at an early stage during the Dutch Presidency.</P>
    <P>Directive on voice telephony and universal service</P>
    <P>Progress was achieved on the initial readings of the draft Directive on the application of open network provision to voice telephony and on universal service for telecommunications in a competitive environment giving rise to political agreement at council on a number of key issues arising in the Directive.  The Directive aims to ensure the availability throughout the European Union of high quality telephone services and to ensure that all users, including consumers, have access to a defined set of telephone services at affordable prices.  The progress achieved should facilitate the adoption of a common position at the first Council during the Dutch Presidency.</P>
    <P>Trans-European Networks in Telecommunications</P>
    <P>Substantial progress was made in informal discussions with the European Parliament by way of preparation for conciliation on the draft Decision on a series of guidelines for trans-European telecommunications networks.  The decision should now be adopted at an early stage during the Dutch Presidency.</P>
    <P>Ireland has no major difficulties with the main principles underpinning the various instruments. Indeed we fully support the Commission's various initiatives as essential measures to ensure that a genuinely competitive market develops following the removal of the remaining barriers to market entry.  The Government's primary concern is to ensure the maximum clarity and competitive balance between existing and new operators in the emerging regulatory framework.</P>

      <P>Political agreement was achieved during Ireland's Presidency of the EU on a draft Directive entitled Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for the development of Community postal services and the improvement of quality of service.</P>
      <P>The draft Directive represents a first modest phase in the liberalisation of the postal sector in the EU, is substantially less ambitious than the original proposal made by the Commission and presents no particular problems in so far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
      <P>In addition to a modest degree of liberalisation, the Directive contains rules on quality of service, cost accounting and the designation of a national regulatory authority legally separate from and operationally independent of the postal authority. The provisions of the directive define the minimum universal service as the permenent provision of a postal service of specified quality at all points in the territory at affordable prices for all users including door-to-door deliveries five days per week as well as ensuring that the density of contact points is adequate for the needs of users and this is a welcome development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178, 179, 180 and 181 together.</P>
      <P>All passenger vessels operating ferry services between offshore islands and the mainland are statutorily required to hold a valid passenger vessel safety certificate, which certifies that the vessel is fit to operate, subject to any conditions that may be imposed upon it.  These are issued annually on foot of surveys, conducted by a marine surveyor of my Department, which involve thorough inspection of the vessel and its equipment, as well as the operation of safety standards on board.</P>
      <P>Apart from these annual surveys, my Department from time to time reviews the safety regime of individual passenger vessels to ensure that safety standards are maintained.  In addition, all reports of incidents involving passenger vessels, including alleged breaches of safety regulations, are investigated thoroughly by my Department. Where there is sufficient evidence, ferry operators who are in breach of safety regulations are liable to be prosecuted, and can face fines, or even imprisonment, if convicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> In keeping with this policy, and following a number of reported incidents involving the vessel referred to by the Deputy, my Department recently carried out a review of the safety management operation of this vessel.</P>
    <P>As a result of this review, it was decided that the master's permit should be terminated.</P>
    <P>I understand that following discussions with the Department, the operator proposed an alternative master for the vessel.  I am advised that this individual successfully underwent examination by the marine survey office on 17 January 1997 and has been approved by my Department to act as master of the vessel on and from that date.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the correct course of action was taken in this matter, particularly in the interests of passenger safety; and I can assure the Deputy that it remains a priority of my Department to ensure that the highest standards of safety are set and enforced on all passenger ferry services operating between the mainland and offshore islands around our coast.</P>
    <P>I have asked my Department to review the adequacy of the present monitoring arrangements in relation to passenger ferries generally.</P>

      <P>The PESCA Community initiative, 1994-1999, is intended to realise almost £11 million investment in fishing communities around the coast, attracting some £5.87 million in EU aid.</P>
      <P>Seventy-two projects have been approved to date representing total investment of £4.378 million, including £2.295 million in EU aid.  This commits nearly 40 per cent of the total EU budget for the PESCA programme over the period.</P>
      <P>A further tranche of projects will be approved in the near future.  I fully expect that the satisfactory level of Irish projects being generated, and approved, will be maintained over the lifetime of the initiative, thus ensuring maximum take-up of available funding under PESCA.</P>

      <P>As indicated in reply to the Deputy on 10 December last, a new national policy on fishing vessel safety is being developed following intensive analysis of <Col N="1527" /> the report of the review group.  Government approval will be sought shortly to initiate this new strategy which takes account of the recommendations and objectives of the review group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As also indicated previously, action is already being taken on a number of specific recommendations of the review group, notably in the areas of training, on-shore radiocommunications and safety awareness.  With reference to safety training in particular, I recently launched a newly refurbished BIM coastal training unit which will bring training in the safe operation of fishing vessels directly to fishermen in ports around the coast.  The review group identified a mobile training unit as having a key role in meeting training <Col N="1528" /> requirements and in attracting fishermen to training courses.  The Department and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are currently examining other options to increase the level of safety training available to fishermen.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware of my recent decision to locate a medium load carrying helicopter on the east coast as and from late this year. The current all weather night flying search and rescue helicopter, based in Baldonnel, will then be relocated to the south-south-east coast.  The exact location will be decided in the light of areas of relative activity and risk, and will, of course, take into account fishing activity in that regard. These two measures, while not addressed in the review group report, will add considerably to the safety of fishermen on the east and south coasts.</P>
