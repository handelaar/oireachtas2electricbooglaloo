      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with profound regret that we learned of the death of Mother Teresa last Friday evening.  She was a shining light to all the world in her remarkable lifetime's work of reaching out to the poorest of the poor, the weakest of the weak, and the loneliest of the lonely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From her earliest days Mother Teresa was determined to spend her life working in God's service, and in 1928 she first came to Ireland to join the Loreto Sisters in Rathfarnham.  Having left the convent to work in the slums of Calcutta, she received Vatican approval for her Society of the Missionaries of Charity in 1950, and became an Indian citizen.  In 1952 she established a home for the dying, destitute of Calcutta, called Pure Heart and since then her band of committed Sisters and Brothers has gained national and international <Col N="578" /> recognition and appreciation for their work.  No one doubts the evident saintliness of Mother Teresa.  In word and deed, in her public and private dealings with people, she demonstrated that deep respect for others which expresses the central core of Christian belief.</P>
    <P>The Society now has more than 4,000 members worldwide, working in 450 locations in over 115 countries, including Ireland.  Hospices for AIDS victims, shelters for the homeless, homes for drug addicts, refuge for lepers, orphanages, schools and clinics form a network of caring and personal contact for all those pushed to the edge and the margins, where they hide in loneliness.</P>
    <P>I am glad that among all her very distinguished world honours, we in Ireland were privileged to have bestowed on her the freedom of our capital city, back in 1993.  The Irish people spontaneously reached out to embrace her and her work and we can be proud of the practical assistance, the lay volunteers, and the society members which Ireland gave to her.  The visit of Uachtar·n na h…ireann, Mary Robinson, in that same year gave further national and international profile to the miracles of kindness and love which Mother Teresa worked among the destitute on the streets of Calcutta.</P>
    <P>We express our deep gratitude to the Society for Mother Teresa's work on behalf of peace in Ireland and we believe that her generosity of spirit will be an example to us all.  We were privileged to live in her time, and learn from her life the lessons of selfless devotion and total giving.</P>
    <P>Few events in the history of our times has had such a powerful impact on our consciousness as the tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the genuine outpouring of emotion all over the world in its wake.  Sunday morning, 31 August, will be remembered forever by millions of people as the day Diana died.</P>
    <P>All across the world the shock was instantaneous and brutal, and the deep feelings of regret and sorrow for her and for her sons was universal.  A deep nerve of human emotion was touched which has expressed itself in unprecedented public displays of mourning, in Ireland and, particularly, in Great Britain.  None of us knows the magic hidden in people's hearts until some totally unforeseen event sparks off a unique reaction.  Then we know and wonder why we did not see and understand it long ago.</P>
    <P>From the time she first came to public notice, but particularly from the time of her wedding in 1981, Diana's face and smile have dominated news stands and television screens and she became one of the foremost icons of our time.  In the words of Patrick Kavanagh: &ldquo;She took her cloak of gold and strolled across the world&rdquo;.  Her vulnerability, warm humanity, espousal of AIDS victims and decisive intervention in the antilandmine campaign were deeply etched on our consciousness.</P>
    <P>We saw that her style would not be cramped by rigid structures, that her spirit would not be <Col N="579" /> crushed by painful adversity, that her charisma would not be dimmed by changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>She saw the dangers</P>
    <P>Yet she walked</P>
    <P>Along the enchanted way.</P>
    <P>The poor, the sick, the afflicted, the common man, woman and child saw that she had a special way with her, an honesty, a willingness to give and to please others.  In the words of the Prophet:</P>
    <P>The aggrieved and the injured said:</P>
    <P>Beauty is kind and gentle,</P>
    <P>Like a young mother,</P>
    <P>Half-shy of her own glory,</P>
    <P>She walks among us.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Irish nation, I speak these words of tribute in her honour today.  She was indeed the &ldquo;People's Princess&rdquo;, not confined by land or sea, not tied to one class, age group or cause, who understood the power she could wield for good causes.  The mountains of flowers everywhere were striking testament to the wellspring of public affection which overflowed.</P>
    <P>Our thoughts and prayers are especially with her two children and her family, who have to bear this almost intolerable burden of grief.  Her memory will endure many lifetimes and her legacy will be most positive and fruitful for the causes she espoused.  Now she is at rest.</P>
    <P>Diana has joined that special group of people, of whom Kavanagh said:</P>
    <P>Count them the beautiful unbroken.</P>
    <P>May she rest in peace.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael party, I join in expressing our deep regret at the death of Mother Teresa.  Mother Teresa's belief in God and her humility that derived from a sense that God was greater than her, made her do all the things she did in the service of others.  Without the humility that came from her religious faith she would not have sacrificed herself in that way.  In this world which materialises everything, it is important to realise that it was Mother Teresa's faith in something which transcended materialism that made her such an inspiring and self-sacrificing figure.</P>
      <P>She had the courage to challenge politically fashionable ideas.  Let us not forget her eloquent and firm condemnation of taking the life of an unborn child.  She opposed abortion fearlessly and we should not forget the moral values she espoused in that matter are relevant and must inspire those who make decisions in this area. Obviously, there is a question as to whether law should enforce morality.  Clearly, however, morality must be present either in the voluntary actions of people or in the way the law is framed, otherwise we would have an amoral society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mother Teresa stood for a moral society in an increasingly amoral world.  It is important to <Col N="580" /> reflect on why she did so.  Her father was a prosperous Albanian nationalist who lived in Skopje, Macedonia.  In 1919 he was murdered in prison. As a widow with the means to look after her family well, Mother Teresa's mother insisted that a member of a poor family in the area should be invited to share every meal with them.  It was that example of bringing the experience of poverty into an otherwise prosperous home that inspired Mother Teresa to the life she subsequently led. In celebrating her life we should not forget the example set by her widowed mother.</P>
    <P>As someone who has a personal association with the Loreto Order, I am pleased to recall that Mother Teresa first entered religion at the Loreto Convent in Rathfarnham, Dublin in 1925.</P>
    <P>I also join the Taoiseach in expressing a great sense of loss following the sudden, tragic and appalling death of Diana, Princess of Wales.  We must recall that the greatest loss was not suffered by those who may have known her slightly or only through the media, but by her two sons.  I hope the Princess of Wales will be remembered above all as a mother.  Everything must be done to ensure that her sons are assisted in coping with this dreadful loss.</P>
    <P>The Princess of Wales was a person of great status, beauty, prestige and financial security.  She could have used those tremendous assets for her benefit alone.  The important thing about her, however, was that she chose to use those assets for the benefit of others.  In particular she was seen to visit and touch sufferers of AIDS and leprosy. She used her great prestige to remove the stigma that applied to those two dreadful diseases.</P>
    <P>It has been said by some, with accuracy, that the Princess of Wales became an icon.  We should reflect on what is an icon.  An icon is not a human being but an object or a thing.  Unfortunately, the public and the media made her into a thing when they made her an icon.  In making a human being into a thing and using him or her to promote a cause, to sell newspapers or to achieve some other purpose, we diminish the humanity of that person.  It is not a good thing to say she was an icon.  Unfortunately, it is a sad commentary on the way in which our society reduces the human to the level of material in a base way.</P>

      <P>Today we have the sad duty of remembering two remarkable women who died within a week of each other.  Diana, Princess of Wales, and Mother Teresa of Calcutta were born and lived in two totally different worlds.  That their paths crossed at all says much about their values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The death of Princess Diana in such tragic and senseless circumstances came as a great shock to us all.  Many people of an older generation remember where they were when President Kennedy was shot.  Some of us will always remember that horrible moment when news came through of the bombing of Canary Wharf.  The news of the <Col N="581" /> death of Diana, Princess of Wales, is of similar proportion.</P>
    <P>Through her work and deeds, Princess Diana showed great compassion and kindness to many people, particularly to children and to those who experienced disadvantage.  Hers was a natural compassion, evident in her ease in situations in which many would have felt less comfortable.  She was capable of sending to the world signals which challenged our perceptions of people who found themselves in difficult circumstances.  Her work with AIDS patients was ground breaking at the time and helped to prompt a reluctant world to come to terms with a frightening disease.  The grief evident among the gay community is a testament to how important her work was at an extremely painful time for them.  Her work with leprosy, that horrible debilitating disease which historically cast people out from society, was of a similar vein.  Her work on the landmines issue cannot be purely ascribed to charitable instincts. Her concern, which this House deeply shares, challenged the vested interests of those who produced those horrible instruments of destruction.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I take this opportunity to extend our sympathies to her family and friends, particularly to her young sons, William and Harry.  The death of a young mother, regardless of her status and position in society, is always a particularly tragic affair.</P>
    <P>I learned of the death of Mother Teresa with great sadness, coming so soon as it did after Diana's tragic death.  Through her work in the community with the sick and disadvantaged, Mother Teresa will be remembered as a truly kind and caring person.  Her death will be keenly felt by many people of Ireland because of her close association with this country, an association recognised by the city of Dublin when she was granted the freedom of the city.  She enjoyed a special relationship with the Irish people which will not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>Many of Mother Teresa's opinions about society and family life were controversial in the west and because of them she drew ire from many quarters.  However, no one can doubt they were generated by genuine concern for people, a concern which became the focal point of Mother Teresa's life.  I send our condolences to her family and all her colleagues in the Missionaries of Charity at this sad time.</P>
    <P>Both these heroic women, Princess Diana and Mother Teresa, used their positions to work with the excluded, the disadvantaged and those on the margins of society.  They were two very different women separated by background and age who transcended such boundaries to reach out to people.  There is a strange irony that they have now been united in death.</P>

      <P>I join the Taoiseach and other party leaders in expressing my regret at the passing of two of the world's most celebrated and respected women in the space of <Col N="582" /> six days.  Mother Teresa of Calcutta was an inspiration to us all through her work for the under-privileged and for the millions of people in the world who live in appalling circumstances.  She founded the Missionaries of Charity and tried by providing education to give the world's poorest people a passport away from their misery.  In that, she had all our support.  She touched us in a very special way and raised public awareness generally around the world for the world's most deprived and vulnerable citizens.</P>
      <P>Princess Diana came from a very different background, but in many ways she and Mother Teresa were similar.  She too cared about sick children and vulnerable people, the victims of AIDS, leprosy and landmines.  Although she was privileged and had fame and fortune, she had her share of misery.  Her death was all the more tragic because it seemed to come at a time when she had at last found personal happiness.</P>
      <P>The public reaction to her death is encouraging and in death she will bring about remarkable changes.  I hope many people learn lessons from the way she was treated.  I suppose she was loved all the more in Ireland because she was a royal rebel.  I agree it is her children we must remember. Our concern must be for them and them alone.  Two young boys have been left without a mother, a woman who died at the age of 36.</P>
      <P>In expressing my regret I say that in different ways two remarkable women, during a very long life in the case of Mother Teresa and a very short one in the case of Princess Diana, helped to make the world a better place for all of us.  I hope those of us who are in public life can be inspired by the work of these two remarkable women.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left, I express my sympathy and join my colleagues in extending condolences on the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Mother Teresa of Calcutta.</P>
      <P>These were two very different women, but two of the best known women in the world.  One was young; one was old.  One was born into British aristocracy; the other into an Albanian peasant family.  One enjoyed a life of great wealth; the other chose a life of poverty and simplicity.  Yet both of them touched the lives of millions of people all over the world.</P>
      <P>One does not have to be a monarchist to admire the work Diana undertook to rid the world of the scourge of landmines and to ensure a more compassionate approach to those suffering from the AIDS virus just as one does not have to approve of all of Mother Teresa's quasi-political views to admire her absolute commitment to the poor and disadvantaged throughout the world and the exceptional determination and energy she showed right up to the end of her long life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many other people I was struck by the extent of the outpourings of public grief shown by British people in the aftermath of the death of Diana.  There was a genuine sense of shock and grief here too, no doubt fed by the recognition of <Col N="583" /> her genuine humanity.  It was, as somebody pointed out, like the death of a neighbour's child. We might have had differences and argued with a neighbour in the past but when neighbours lose a child in tragic circumstances such as these, they deserve our compassion, sympathy and support.</P>
    <P>I express my sympathy and extend condolences to the families and community of the two women, and also the families of Dodi al Fayed and Henri Paul, who also died in the Paris crash and whose deaths are no doubt as deeply felt by people close to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend the sympathy of the Green Party to the families, colleagues and friends of both Princess Diana and Mother Teresa.</P>
      <P>Mother Teresa was a woman who did not just preach compassion; she lived it every day, caring for the most destitute people in the world, the outcasts, the homeless, the sick, the dying, the old and the lonely.  Although we do not live in Calcutta where Mother Teresa lived and worked nor do we experience the absolute poverty and destitution she worked amidst every day, she showed us the importance of compassion and love, and that compassion is sadly missing from our modern world where materialism and wealth seem to rule.</P>
      <P>We are lucky we had such strong connections with Mother Teresa and that she took the time to take an interest in our development.  Even if her views did not fit in with our view of our modernising country, it is a connection we should cherish and remember in the future development of this country, particularly when it comes to including people with whom Mother Teresa would have liked to have spent her time.</P>
      <P>It is tragic and uncanny that two women of widely differing lifestyles who were inextricably linked in the media and in people's minds should die in the same week.  However, it is inevitable that they were linked in this way because, despite the differences in their lifestyles, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Mother Teresa had much in common. Both were loving, energetic and compassionate women who, spontaneously and without prejudice, reached out to the poor, the sick and the dying.  As her brother Earl Spencer said on Saturday last, Diana, Princess of Wales, &ldquo;needed no royal title to continue to generate her particular brand of magic&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through her tireless charity Diana, Princess of Wales, repeatedly showed that, regardless of accidents of birth, everyone must be treated equally. I refer to her work to highlight the tragedy of landmines.  Although she was constantly berated by members of the media for being involved in areas they assumed she should not be involved in, Diana persevered in her attempts to raise people's awareness of the suffering caused by landmines in countries already ravaged by senseless wars.  This required great courage and the tide of public opinion was beginning to turn.  I hope the awareness she had begun to generate <Col N="584" /> will not disappear.  Although Diana is no longer here to champion the cause, the death fields have not disappeared.  We owe it to this remarkable woman to continue the work she so bravely started.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That D·il …ireann approves the terms of the Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom Establishing the International Commission on Decommissioning, signed by Ireland in Belfast on 26 August, 1997, a copy of which was laid before D·il Eireann on the 28th day of August, 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I anticipated that the leaders of the parties in Opposition would wish to take this opportunity <Col N="590" /> to make some remarks on the wider peace and political processes that provided the context for the international agreement for which the Government is today seeking the approval of D·il …ireann.  We have taken advantage of the recall of the D·il today to move this motion, in order to fulfil the commitment contained in the Joint CommuniquÈ issued following the meeting between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 29 July, the commitment to ensure that the mechanisms for decommissioning would be capable of being launched simultaneously with substantive negotiations on 15 September.  With the approval of this motion and the other steps already taken and being taken by the two Governments, we will be able to deliver on that commitment.  I thank the parties in the House for agreeing to deal with this matter today.</P>
    <P>I shall speak to the motion and then say something about the wider context.  Before I do so, let me welcome in the House the unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire that took effect on 20 July.  In practice, it has proved to be of markedly better quality than the first ceasefire which ended with the bombing at Canary Wharf.  There is an apparent absence of surveillance or targeting and punishment beatings in Republican areas have ceased.  The absence of military operations or associated activity has enabled the Secretary of State, Dr. Mowlam, to conclude that the ceasefire is being observed both in word and in deed and, in the light of this, has paved the way for the two Governments to issue an invitation to Sinn FÈin to participate in the negotiations in Belfast.</P>
    <P>Pursuant to this Sinn FÈin yesterday in open plenary session at the talks confirmed its acceptance of the exacting Mitchell principles of democracy and non-violence.  I greatly welcome that declaration which has the potential to represent a watershed in the history and politics of Ireland. I am glad the Government was able to play a constructive part in getting the IRA ceasefire restored and I acknowledge the very substantial groundwork towards that end by the previous Government and by Deputies Bruton and Spring in particular.  We have the great blessing of peace now and thus a calm atmosphere and a level playing field for all who are eligible to take part in the talks.  The guns have fallen silent, but we look forward impatiently to the time when, on a mutual basis and following substantive negotiations on a comprehensive agenda, the gun and the bomb are removed completely and permanently from the political equation in Ireland and throughout these islands.  That is the objective of the agreement we ask the D·il to approve today.</P>
    <P>Deputies have copies of the agreement.  It was signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Government at a meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in Belfast on 26 August 1997.  Approval of today's motion will enable the requirement of Article 29, sub article 5.2 of the Constitution, to be met.  That provides that the State shall not be bound by an <Col N="591" /> international agreement involving a charge on public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by D·il …ireann.  A charge on public funds will arise by virtue of the agreement as a result of the establishment of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning.  Under Article 7 of the agreement, the commission is to be funded jointly by the Irish and British Governments.</P>
    <P>The agreement was framed to reflect the joint proposals which the Irish and British Governments put to the participants in the Northern Ireland negotiations on 25 June, as clarified in a statement &mdash; on behalf of the two Governments &mdash; by Minister of State Murphy at the talks on 16 July.  The agreement also reflects the legislation already enacted in both jurisdictions, our Decommissioning Act, 1997 and the UK Arms Decommissioning Act.</P>
    <P>The joint Government proposals did not attract consensus on the part of the talks participants in July.  The two Governments believe that the proposals continue to represent the best way forward consistent with the report of the International Body chaired by Senator George Mitchell.</P>
    <P>The agreement, therefore, provides that the commission will be independent in the performance of its functions and will have the legal capacity of a body corporate.  Its objective will be to facilitate the decommissioning of arms in accordance with the report of the International Body and any regulations or schemes made in accordance with the Acts to which I have referred.  It is, for the purpose of fulfilling that objective, being given the following specific functions: to consult the participants in political negotiations in Northern Ireland, including both Governments, and others whom it deems relevant on the type of scheme or schemes for decommissioning, including the role it might play in respect of each scheme; to present to the two Governments proposals for schemes for decommissioning having due regard to the views expressed by those it has consulted; to undertake in accordance with regulations or schemes enacted in accordance with the legislation enacted in each jurisdiction such tasks as may be required of it to facilitate the decommissioning of arms, including observing, monitoring and verifying decommissioning and receiving and auditing arms; and to report periodically to the two Governments and, through whatever mechanism they may establish for that purpose, the other participants in political negotiations in Northern Ireland.  I commend the agreement and the motion to the House.</P>
    <P>The other arrangements necessary to ensure the mechanisms for decommissioning are launched simultaneously with substantive negotiations on 15 September are well in hand.  Offices are available for the commission in Dublin and Belfast.  The Governments of Finland, Canada and the United States, in response to requests from the Irish and British Governments, have <Col N="592" /> proposed well qualified persons for nomination as members of the commission.  I thank them for that.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are in hand for commission members designate to visit Dublin for briefing very shortly.  Members designate will be briefed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, on behalf of the British Government, by the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office.  Security experts in both jurisdictions have made preparations to meet the commission members designate.  Thus, any suggestions that the Irish Government has failed to deliver on commitments or held up progress in this area are completely wide of the mark.  On the contrary, the Irish Government, with that in London, sees the resolution of the decommissioning issues as an indispensable part and outcome of the negotiations, and our actions bear this out.  However, decommissioning, or any attempt to make it a precondition for participation in the talks, cannot be allowed to block the entire process.</P>
    <P>That is why the two Governments have made it absolutely clear that substantive political negotiations must, and will, be launched on Monday next, 15 September.  All Members will, I am sure, share my disappointment that the basis for doing this is not on an inclusive round table basis, as we hoped.  I hope there will be a move forward in that regard.  Consequent on the death and funeral of Princess Diana, it was understandably necessary for the Ulster Unionist Party to defer for one week its meeting scheduled for last Saturday.  The UUP decision on participation in the move to substantive negotiations is now likely to be taken on that day.  I hope it will decide in favour of participation and that it will be possible to bring all the eligible parties around the table together from Monday next.  Be that as it may, the negotiations will be launched on that day with the objective of completing them on time to enable proposals to be put before the people, North and South, for their approval in referenda by the middle of next year.</P>
    <P>The Government here wants the representatives of the Unionist and loyalist people to take part so that the voice and concerns of that community will be heard and fully taken into account during the winter.  I stress that the process of dialogue offers no threat to the Unionist community or to anybody else.  It should scarcely be necessary to say so, but in view of some recent concerns among that community, I reaffirm that the Irish Government &mdash; indeed both Governments &mdash; remains fully committed to the consent principle as set out in the Downing Street Declaration under which any change in the status of Northern Ireland would come about only with the consent of the majority of the people.  This will be a guiding principle for us, and no doubt for the British Government, in the negotiations for which, of course, no outcome is excluded or predetermined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> That well established position of the Irish Government's consent will not change.  Its essence is that change in constitutional status cannot be imposed against the wishes of the majority. We hold to that, but consent also has a broader significance.  As the Downing Street Declaration states, &ldquo;stability and well being will not be found under any political system which is refused allegiance or rejected on grounds of identity by a significant minority of those governed by it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Nationalist community has never given its consent to Northern Ireland as it was or even as it stands now.  Without prejudice to the absolute need for consent to a change in sovereignty, the achievement of mutual or two-way cross-community consent or acceptance of the arrangements to emerge from negotiations is also necessary and desirable.  It is in the interest of all communities that the essential basis for stable and effective government be achieved and all parties should co-operate to this end.  In dealing with the decommissioning issue, the Irish Government has always demonstrated its good faith.  We do so again today in bringing this motion before the House.  In thanking Members for taking the motion, I urge them to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for giving us an opportunity to express our sentiments not only about this agreement but about what we hope and pray to be an unequivocal and lasting ceasefire. At a time when our political system is under much scrutiny and criticism, it is a sign of its maturity that Northern Ireland has not often led to division in this House.  All parties want peace to be restored in Northern Ireland and an end to death, violence and the threat of violence.  All parties, whether in Government or in Opposition, will strive to see that achieved.  That is why I, on behalf of Fine Gael, welcome the agreement reached between the Irish and UK Governments to establish the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning.</P>
      <P>The decommissioning of illegal weapons is not only a political issue, it is also a matter of public safety.  There is an extreme risk that weapons have already found and will continue to find their way into what are referred to as &ldquo;ordinary criminal activities&rdquo;.  I commend our security forces, the Garda SÌoch·na and the Army, for their diligence and commitment in seeking out, discovering and destroying weapons.  With every weapon they destroy decommissioning is taking place, as those weapons can no longer be used for violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement signed by the two Governments has its origins in the Joint CommuniquÈ agreed by Deputy John Bruton as Taoiseach and Mr. John Major as Prime Minister on 28 November 1995.  It was decided to launch a twin track process to make progress on decommissioning in parallel with all-party negotiations.  Following that process, the International Body was established under the chairmanship of Senator George Mitchell, General John de Chastelain and former Prime Minister Harry Holkeri.  As someone who <Col N="594" /> worked with those gentlemen for a full year on the all-party talks, I pay tribute to them.  They are not Irish people but they gave unstintingly of their time and exercised great generosity and wisdom to help this country and Northern Ireland to solve our problems.  That spirit is to be commended.</P>
    <P>The body was specifically asked to report on the arrangements necessary for the removal from the political equation of illegally held arms and, to that end, to identify and advise on a suitable and acceptable method for full and verifiable decommissioning.  The body was also asked to report on whether there was a clear commitment on the part of those in possession of such arms to work constructively to achieve the removal of such weapons from life in Northern Ireland.  The report was presented to the two Governments on 22 January 1996 and it was unequivocal in its recommendation that participants in all-party negotiations would have to confirm their commitment to the fundamental principles of democracy and non-violence.  It outlined six principles which must be adhered to by any participant in all-party negotiations.</P>
    <P>I welcome yesterday's affirmation by the Sinn FÈin delegation to the talks of its total and absolute commitment to the six principles as outlined in paragraph 20 of the International Body's report.  It is regrettable that the Unionists did not find it possible to attend that meeting but I urge them to reconsider their position before 15 September. The present and previous Irish and British Governments have maintained the position that the only realistic way forward is through the implementation of all aspects of the International Body's report.  The real hope of progress in reaching agreement on a political solution to the problems in Northern Ireland rests with both communities being represented at the talks and engaging in the talks process with energy, generosity and, in the words of Senator Mitchell, &ldquo;a decommissioning of mindsets&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I urge the Unionist parties to recognise that participants in all-party negotiations who have accepted the six Mitchell principles can be held to account during the talks if at any time they renege on any of those principles.  I sat through talks from June 1996 to June 1997 at which certain parties had to account for breaches of the principles.  That protection is built into the talks process which is why I believe there is no reason to suspect a trap.</P>
    <P>Sinn FÈin in making public its commitment to those principles has adopted all the responsibility which goes with accepting them.  Sinn FÈin leaders must now ensure none of their supporters engage in any acts of violence or threaten the use of violence.  They must show they accept the principle of consent in any settlement which might be arrived at.  This is a major undertaking for Sinn FÈin which must by its actions and words convince its supporters that the war is definitely over and that violence can no longer be used as a means to achieve political aims.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> Having participated in the talks from 6 June 1996 until the change of Government in June 1997, I recognise that decommissioning remains the main obstacle to the launch of the three stranded approach.  I am reminded of the words of Seamus Mallon in September 1996 when he outlined clearly the situation in regard to decommissioning. He said:</P>
    <P>The decommissioning issue is so potent because it touches such a deadly serious issue: illegal weapons and the havoc they have wrought.  To question the decommissioning issue or even the way it has been tactically manipulated is to lay oneself open to attack as somehow making light of all the human suffering due to these guns.</P>
    <P>I wish to make clear that any questioning of efforts to ensure decommissioning would not stall the all-party talks is in no way trying to make light of the extreme importance of decommissioning weapons and ensuring new stocks are not built up to kill or maim anybody else on this island or elsewhere.  However, it is necessary for us to be reminded that this is a twin track process and that we need to make progress on the three stranded negotiations.</P>
    <P>It was necessary to find a way around the impasse created by the decommissioning issue if progress was to be made.  My colleague, Deputy Spring, and I and other participants in the talks sat for many frustrating hours in Stormont listening to the debate about decommissioning and were fearful we might not be able to find a way around that impasse.  However, I am satisfied that, frustrating as that year was, it was necessary in order to bring people together.  The progress which is now being made is partly as a result of that year and the work done by many of us in the former Government and the British Government. Although that year was slow and frustrating it was not a waste as it has led to a situation where we have the prospect of all parties participating in the talks.</P>
    <P>In order to find a way around the impasse I moved the Decommissioning Bill in this House in December 1996, which became law in February 1997.  A number of key considerations determined the nature of the approach adopted in that Act.  There was a need for the legislative framework intended to facilitate the decommissioning &mdash; in the sense of the use of the word in the International Body's report &mdash; to be realistic by recognising the basic and inescapable reality that decommissioning can only be effected by those with something to decommission and in circumstances where they are prepared to decommission. The International Body also recommended the process of decommissioning should be neither a victory nor a defeat for anyone, it should take place to the satisfaction of an independent commission and result in the complete destruction of armaments in a manner which was verifiable and safe.  It also recommended that the <Col N="596" /> decommissioning process should not expose individuals to prosecution.</P>
    <P>Unionists should remember what Mr. David Trimble said to the Ulster Young Unionist Conference on Saturday, 5 October 1996.  Speaking about the paper on decommissioning the party had submitted, he said:</P>
    <P>What we have done on our paper is to refine and define the issue of decommissioning and identify precisely what needs to be done at the present stage &mdash; the enactment of the enabling legislation, the Verification Commission, the Decommissioning Scheme &mdash; and what needs to be done later &mdash; in terms of the procedures to be followed if and when Sinn FÈin enter the process.</P>
    <P>Unionists should note that the legislation and the verification commission are now in place.  I am not sure if the House will be told the names of the members of that commission today but it is now possible for it to discuss the mechanisms and modalities.  The matters Unionists wanted addressed to ensure that decommissioning would not be dropped from the agenda are now in place. The talks on 15 September provide them with an opportunity to challenge Sinn FÈin and to ensure their point of view, and that of the people they represent, is put forward.</P>
    <P>The terms of the legislation I introduced sought to follow closely the recommendations of Senator Mitchell's body.  However, it was also necessary to ensure that it was enabling in character.  At that time, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, criticised the legislation.  He said it contained nothing and was only enabling.  Now that he is the Minister and must deliver on the legislation, I hope he recognises the wisdom of its enabling provisions.</P>

      <P>The Minister will recognise now that without the enabling features of the legislation it would not have been possible for the two Governments to reach agreement on the commission because there would have been too much inflexibility.  The legislation allowed maximum flexibility to give effect to any arrangements which may have been agreed on how decommissioning would take place.  It was a wise step to take and I hope the Minister will recognise that point.  Similar legislation was passed by the House of Commons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> There are high expectations, following the agreement signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Ray Burke, and the Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam, that progress can be made on the launch of three strand negotiations without the threat of the issue of decommissioning causing another breakdown in the process.  I hope the Minister will not be subjected, as I was when Minister for Justice, to seven hours of continuous questioning by Unionists about decommissioning.  I hope he does not face that because it was a horrendous ordeal, although I survived to live another day.</P>
    <P>Useful work was done by the Irish and British sides in the papers they submitted some months ago.  It is now up to the talks participants and the two Governments to ensure that the decommissioning issue is not allowed to frustrate or thwart progress in the negotiations.  The two Governments and the participants have a shared and equal interest in the satisfactory resolution of the problem of decommissioning.  This agreement and the legislation provide the possibility of moving forward and ending forever violence and the threat of violence in the Northern Ireland context.</P>
    <P>The progress made is a tribute to all involved, including successive Governments and individuals over the past ten years.  It also involved the huge commitment of a small number of civil servants to the process.  They are people of the highest integrity and we should not forget the work done by officials in this jurisdiction and in Britain. The progress made allows us to hope that the ceasefire is unequivocal and lasting and that we can begin again to talk about the peace dividend.  We saw the advantages for a brief period during the last ceasefire.  We saw the progress that could be made and what co-operation could achieve in the absence of violence in Northern Ireland.  We are now on the threshold of massive change based on co-operation and worthwhile all-Ireland initiatives. The potential for co-operation between North and South is immense.  An all-Ireland electricity grid and gas interconnector, which promise liberalisation in our energy policy, are exciting ideas on which we can now work.  There are practical and social reasons further co-operation between North and South is essential.  That co-operation can be expanded and become lasting now that we have a ceasefire.  There are major changes ahead for the people of Northern Ireland as they examine the implications of peace.  The massive spending on security during the last 27 years can be redirected into more productive areas and new institutions will have a chance to thrive.</P>
    <P>In commending the Government on reaching this agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom, I, on behalf of Fine Gael, wish the talks process well on 15 September and continue to offer the support of Fine Gael to progress in those all-party talks.  We received such support from the parties now in Government.  I hope 1997 <Col N="598" /> will be remembered as the year that lasting peace came to Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support this motion.  We are at a very important juncture in Anglo-Irish relations.  In five days' time, all-party talks will begin.  It is regrettable that yesterday did not see the conclusion of the agreements necessary for everybody to be at the talks in a round table fashion, but I hope, as the Taoiseach said, that the Ulster Unionist Party will make the right decision next Saturday.  It can still happen and I hope it does.  Ironically, if the Unionists exclude themselves, the only people excluded from the talks will be those who do so by their own deeds.  The only section of the community which will be disenfranchised in those negotiations will be those people whose political representatives have chosen not to represent them.  There is still time for all parties to get around the table and, to use a clichÈ, there is an historic opportunity.  I hope all parties will have the leadership and courage to be at the table next Monday to start on the next phase of reconciliation on this island.</P>
      <P>It is a remarkable development and one that many in this House had begun to despair of ever seeing.  For nearly ten years we have witnessed and participated in many moments when hopes were raised and then dashed.  Ever since the first faltering steps toward talks were initiated by Peter Brooke and others, there have been moments when it seemed we were about to make the breakthrough only to arrive at the brick wall of intransigence.  We have had communiquÈs, tests, agreements and declarations, walkouts and lockouts, day after day of endless negotiations, as described by Deputy Owen, parsing and analysing sacred texts in terms of art, obscure language and sometimes crystal clear language, progress and setbacks, generosity and churlishness on occasion.  It has all been designed to one end, that of getting all representatives of a community around a table, or at least under one roof.</P>
      <P>In that ten years, sadly, many have died, some in horrible circumstances which will leave scars forever.  Many still grieve and find it impossible to forgive.  There have been atrocities which have shamed us as a people and which have attached resonances which will never be forgotten to names like Enniskillen, Greysteel and Shankill. We have seen people come and go &mdash; men like Gordon Wilson, for instance, who died without knowing that his ambition, to see the laying down of guns and the depravity of violence replaced by talk, might soon be realised.</P>
      <P>Now we are on the brink of a day when the talking starts.  It must not be another false dawn. Those who signed up yesterday to the Mitchell principles must mean it.  We must hope and believe that they signed with their hearts and not just with their hands.  Too many have suffered and died to allow this golden opportunity to be wasted now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> All those who will go to the table on Monday must know that they are not going there to win. They are going to seek agreement, and that means they are going to compromise.  I hope, as does every Member of this House, that within that process the specific issue of disarmament and decommissioning can and will be addressed, but more important by far are the other issues around which an agreement can be built.</P>
    <P>We all know what those issues are.  How is Northern Ireland to be governed for the future in a way that guarantees the loyalty and allegiance of every one of its citizens?  How is that loyalty to be willingly given and never coerced?  What are the relationships between North and South of this island that will underpin a dynamic and mutually benefiting relationship and guarantee rights for everyone?  What new strands can we derive from the relationship between the two islands?</P>
    <P>In many ways these are simple issues, yet they are ones which have divided us, led to the killing of thousands of people and erected barriers of distrust and suspicion over many generations.  It would be naive to think that they can be dealt with easily or that the talks about to begin will conclude with ready agreement in a couple of months.</P>
    <P>The key is generosity.  In 1992, having observed from a distance, when Unionist leaders had the courage to come to Dublin they were treated shabbily.  There have been too many instances when they have reacted in a petty and vindictive way to events.  Every time that happens, it sets the process back.  All too often, process rather than form seems to matter most.  It has always been easy to erect an artificial barrier to progress, to impose some new test of the bona fides of one group or another or to give offence at a delicate moment.  That is why these talks will require more than resolve to reach an agreement, more than willingness to compromise.  They will require endless patience, considerable diplomacy and a great deal of courage on all sides.</P>
    <P>The talks begin with the full support of two newly elected Governments and have the full backing of an American Administration which is strong and knowledgeable on these events.  They have the support of the European Union which has already expressed itself in tangible ways in Northern Ireland and in the Border counties. They will be chaired by a person of immense skill and stature, George Mitchell, ably assisted by his colleagues, John de Chastelain and Harry Holkeri. They have already displayed both courage and patience to help us get to this point.</P>
    <P>Yet we all know how easy it is for the talks to go wrong.  It is for that reason there is a particular onus on the Government to play the fullest possible part to ensure that generosity and openness are the key ingredients.  The parameters of that generosity are to be found in the Joint Framework Document, particularly paragraph 21.</P>
    <P>It is important also to recall that the Joint Framework Document was not only supported by <Col N="600" /> this House but was negotiated in part by a Fianna F·il-Labour Government and in part by a Fine Gael-Labour-Democractic Left Government. Uniquely, the negotiation of this document and its key paragraph has spanned the life of those Governments and involved the work and input of many of the key personnel in the development of the peace process.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 21 commits the Government to introduce and support proposals for change in the Constitution to implement the commitments in the Downing Street Declaration.  We are committed in those changes to fully reflect the principles of consent in Northern Ireland.  The changes will demonstrably be such that no territorial claim of right to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland contrary to the will of a majority of its people is asserted, while maintaining the existing birthright of everyone born in either jurisdiction in Ireland to be part, as of right, of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>The constitutional changes to which we are committed will enable a new agreement &mdash; the agreement about which negotiations are about to begin &mdash; to be ratified.  That agreement will include, as part of a new and equitable dispensation for Northern Ireland, recognition by both Governments of the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland as regards its constitutional status, whether they prefer to continue to support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are key words: a new and equitable dispensation, the legitimacy of a free choice by the people of Northern Ireland, and the demonstrable removal of a territorial claim of right to jurisdiction.  These key words underpin a commitment already negotiated and entered into by five political parties in this House, and fully supported by the Progressive Democrats, to amend the Constitution as part of the process now beginning.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to be generous in this aspect.  There is no point delaying the deployment of this commitment until the last minute, begrudging any risk and seeking to secure concessions from everyone else.  The timing of a Government initiative in relation to the Constitution could play a vital role in shaping the atmosphere, and ultimately the outcome, of these negotiations.</P>
    <P>Generosity must come from others as well. There will be a particular responsibility on the Unionist leadership to display all the courage and foresight of which it is capable, to put aside any temptation for posturing or point-scoring and to get stuck in in the interests of their people.  There have been times when the leadership of Unionism in Northern Ireland has been willing to reach out and seek an accommodation whereby all could live as neighbours.  Now more than ever they must be prepared to invest in the future.  The British Government, especially the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, have shown courage and resolution in reaching this point.  I urge the taking of further steps on issues such as the loyalist prisoners, a <Col N="601" /> section of the community which, rightly or wrongly, has been left with the impression that confidence-building measures have not always been advanced in the most even-handed manner.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record my party's support for the process now beginning.  We will play our part to help further the process.  In this connection a role could be played by reconvening the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  The atmosphere of the Forum which developed under the superb chairmanship of Judge Catherine McGuinness played no small part in enabling people to begin the tentative process of working together.  It enabled the development of many of the concepts that now play a key role.  I ask the Taoiseach and his colleagues to consider the possibility of a meeting of the Forum that would allow commitment to be refreshed.</P>
    <P>There is an extent of opportunity and hope unprecedented in our lifetime.  I wish all participants well and we will give any constructive assistance possible to the process.</P>

      <P>This debate gives the House an opportunity to look in detail at decommissioning, a problem which has been and is likely to remain one of the most difficult to overcome in the peace process.  However, it also provides an opportunity to review developments in Northern Ireland since the last sitting of the House.</P>
      <P>When the D·il met on 10 July there was a general sense of gloom as Northern Ireland appeared once more to be on the edge of a sectarian abyss. Ten days earlier two community policemen had been murdered in Lurgan and there was no sign of a resumption of the IRA ceasefire.  The annual cycle of provocative marches and counter demonstrations had resumed.  There were ugly and violent clashes on the Garvaghy Road as an Orange parade was forced through and sectarian confrontations were a nightly feature of life in many areas.</P>
      <P>As on many occasions over the past 27 years, when things seemed irredeemably bleak, sufficient common sense prevailed to pull Northern Ireland back from the brink.  The first positive development was the decision of the Orange Order to transfer or cancel four controversial parades scheduled for 12 July.  This was a crucial decision and the leadership of the Orange Order is entitled to considerable credit for the courage and leadership it displayed in placing the needs and safety of the entire community above sectional interests.  A week later the resumption of the IRA ceasefire was announced, a development that was as welcome as it was unexpected.  All those who exerted pressure and influence on the leadership of the IRA to secure the resumption of the ceasefire are entitled to considerable credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combined impact of these two decisions meant Northern Ireland was saved from a summer of sectarian conflict which seemed inevitable days earlier, thus saving many lives.  Nothing in Northern Ireland, no sense of grievance about <Col N="602" /> what happened in the past, no feeling of frustration at the slow pace of political change, no unfulfilled political aspiration, no flag or symbol, can justify the use of violence or murder.</P>
    <P>The wish of everybody is that the IRA ceasefire is genuine, permanent and irreversible.  Preliminary indications appear to be positive with the security forces reporting that, unlike on the last occasion, the IRA seems to have ceased training and the targeting of potential victims.  On the other hand, the discovery in County Cavan last month of the biggest and most sophisticated IRA bomb factory ever found indicates the dangers that still exist and the extent of the challenge to find a solution to the problem of decommissioning.</P>
    <P>Given the resumption of the IRA ceasefire and the assessment of the security forces in Northern Ireland that it is genuine, it was proper that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mo Mowlam, issued an invitation to Sinn FÈin to join the all-party talks.  The previous Government, of which I was a member, put an enormous amount of effort into securing the agreement of the British Government to the opening of the talks in Stormont in June 1996.  We made it clear to Sinn FÈin that what was required to facilitate that party's entry into the talks process was an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire and a commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence set out in the Mitchell report.  The IRA's decision to end the ceasefire in February 1996 was totally and utterly unjustified.  Whatever frustration was felt at the slow pace of political developments in the aftermath of the August 1994 declaration, nothing justified that decision. Its futility is now clear; all that was achieved was the further unnecessary loss of life and the delaying, by more than a year, of Sinn FÈin's entry into talks.</P>
    <P>The circumstances of the Canary Wharf bombing represented a betrayal of the hand of friendship which had been extended to the republican movement following the 1994 ceasefire and made it more difficult for Unionists and many Nationalists in Northern Ireland, as well as citizens of the Republic, to believe the movement could be trusted.  It is now clear that when Mr. Gerry Adams was shaking Bill Clinton's hand in Belfast, the Canary Wharf bombing was being planned. When Sinn FÈin met Government Ministers, myself included, during the week ending February 9, the lethal bomb was already on its way to Canary Wharf.  The murder of Garda Jerry McCabe in June 1996 was proof that the IRA had no qualms about using lethal violence on either side of the Border.</P>
    <P>If the talks are to have any prospect of success, the republican movement must acknowledge that a major effort is now required on its part to overcome the legacy of suspicion and distrust left by the Canary Wharf bombing, its aftermath and the murder of Garda Jerry McCabe.  The restoration of the ceasefire was necessitated by the failure, yet again, of violence in advancing the republican <Col N="603" /> cause and by the resolve of the British and Irish Governments to stand firm against blackmail. Most important was the refusal by the people of Northern Ireland to give in to coercion.  However, the restoration was a crucial development without which the prospects for progress were bleak and in many respects it was the least difficult decision for the republican movement to make. The real challenge now facing the republican movement is to find an accommodation with its political opponents which will recognise and respect all of the traditions and national allegiances in Northern Ireland and guarantee its people the peace and security they crave.  This is the challenge facing all of the parties at the plenary session of the talks which will reopen next week.  It is difficult to see what alternative options exist or where Northern Ireland can go if the talks do not succeed.  Notwithstanding the suspicions and fears of the Unionist community, it would be a great tragedy if its political representatives were to absent themselves from the negotiating table at this crucial time.  Even if it finds it cannot initially participate in plenary sessions, I urge the Ulster Unionist Party to find a formula which would allow it to participate in a more general way in the talks, leading ultimately to its full involvement in the process.  The DUP and the UK Unionists should also be present at the talks to argue their case.  It would be ironic indeed if, after bringing Sinn FÈin in from decades of abstentionism, the Unionists were now to revert to this discredited and arid type of politics.</P>
    <P>If the Unionists opt out of the process and continue to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to virtually everything there will be an increasing clamour for the two governments to impose a solution over the heads of the people of Northern Ireland.  That would be a great mistake.  What have the Unionists to fear from full involvement in the process?  They have a capable and articulate leadership to defend their interests and they also have the commitments in the Downing Street Declaration and the joint framework documents, which are unequivocally endorsed by the two governments and supported by every party in this House, with the exception so far of Sinn FÈin, that there can be no change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland without the support of a majority there.  That provides a bulwark against any fears they have of being bounced into a united Ireland.  The talks will only succeed if all sides enter into them with a realistic expectation of what can be achieved. The British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, in his Balmoral speech shortly after the British election, was only being realistic when he said he did not envisage a united Ireland in the lifetime of the youngest person in his audience.</P>
    <P>If Sinn FÈin enters these talks claiming that it can achieve in this process the United Ireland the republican movement has been unable to secure by force of arms over the past 27 years, it is incredibly naive or deliberately misleading its supporters.  Either way, Sinn FÈin will disappoint <Col N="604" /> its supporters and it would be better to be up front as to what is feasible now rather than have this disappointment and the backlash it will engender when it occurs.</P>
    <P>What is achievable in these talks is a new democratic accommodation that will recognise and respect the conflicting national allegiances at the heart of the Northern Ireland problem, provide stable and acceptable governance that will guarantee justice and fair play for all sectors of society there and, most importantly, rid Northern Ireland for all time of the scourge of political violence.</P>
    <P>The agreement before the House deals with one of the most difficult problems to be overcome in the talks process.  In the D·il debate on the original ceasefire in August 1994 I identified it as a problem that would be difficult to overcome. The last Government put enormous efforts into trying to find a solution to the problem and countless hours were put in by the then Taoiseach, T·naiste and other Ministers and officials in trying to find a way forward.</P>
    <P>The agreement in November 1995 to establish the International Body was on the initiative of our Government.  I always acknowledged that decommissioning was a serious problem that would have to be overcome, but I expressed the view on a number of occasions that it should not be built into such a matter of principle that it created further obstacles to the primary objective, that of a political settlement and a lasting peace.</P>
    <P>There was much criticism in the aftermath of the ceasefire about the position of the then British Government on decommissioning.  Republican propagandists would have us believe that decommissioning was a roadblock erected solely by the British Government and the Unionists to obstruct the peace process.  They point in particular to the alleged rejection of the Mitchell report by the British Government in early 1996.  The fact, however, is that from early 1994 the president of Sinn FÈin, Mr. Gerry Adams, knew that decommissioning would be a requirement for Sinn FÈin's participation in talks.  This is evident from several speeches and interviews he gave at the time, particularly an interview in <i>The Irish Times</i> in January 1994.  We were later told by Mr. Martin McGuinness that the August 1994 ceasefire &ldquo;does mean a complete cessation of military operations under all circumstances&rdquo;.  Note the words &ldquo;under all circumstances&rdquo;.  These echo the Downing Street Declaration of December 1993 which stated in the clearest possible terms that &ldquo;the achievement of peace must involve a permanent end to the use of or support for paramilitary violence&rdquo;.  It is worth noting the use of the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; in the light of the Sinn FÈin-IRA objections to it subsequently.</P>
    <P>The then T·naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, left no doubt as to what was required.  He stated: &ldquo;We are talking about the handing up of arms and are insisting that it would not be simply a temporary cessation of violence to see what the political process offers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> The T·naiste subsequently reiterated this point in the D·il on 1 June 1994 when he said:</P>
    <P>There will have to be verification of the handing over of arms.  As I said publicly on many occasions, there is little point in attempting to bring people into political dialogue if they are doing so on the basis of giving it a try and if it does not work returning to the bomb and the bullet.  It has to be permanent and there must be evidence of it.</P>
    <P>The then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, did not dissent from these remarks although he has changed his tune since his return to the back benches.</P>
    <P>It was a tactical mistake to let what was called the Washington Three requirement develop into a matter of principle.  On the other hand, we must acknowledge the need to establish confidence in those communities that had suffered so terribly at the hands of paramilitary violence that the ceasefires were genuine and that there would be no return to violence.</P>
    <P>The Mitchell report identified the core of the problem when it stated that one side had insisted some decommissioning of arms must take place before all-party negotiations could begin; the other side had insisted that no decommissioning could take place until the end of the process after an agreed settlement had been reached.  Mitchell recommended an approach under which decommissioning would take place during the process of all-party negotiations.  He said this approach was a compromise but it offered the parties an opportunity to use the process of decommissioning to build confidence one step at a time during negotiations. The report noted that as progress is made on political issues even modest mutual steps on decommissioning could help create the atmosphere needed for further steps in a progressive pattern of mounting trust and confidence.</P>
    <P>The agreement signed by the two Governments in Belfast on 26 August last, and which we are now being asked to ratify, builds on the legislation passed in both jurisdictions and puts in place the technical procedures for a commission to supervise the decommissioning of arms.  Of course the commission can only act if political agreement on decommissioning is reached at the talks.  It is a challenge for all parties but particularly for those associated with paramilitary groups, Sinn FÈin, the Ulster Democratic Party and the Progressive Unionist Party.  The recommendation of Mitchell that there be some decommissioning during the talks must be the guiding principle.  The reality is that there will be no agreement without progress on decommissioning.</P>
    <P>The State cannot afford to remain passive in relation to illegally held weapons.  I congratulate the Garda on its continuing good work in ridding our country of lethal weapons held for the purpose of killing our neighbours.  There cannot be any question of equating the legitimately held weapons of the police and the security forces <Col N="606" /> backed up by the force of law with arms held illegally by paramilitaries.</P>
    <P>The Republican movement must take heed of the democratic demand of the overwhelming majority of the people on this island, expressed through all parties in this House other than Sinn FÈin and confirmed in opinion poll after opinion poll, who want to see progress on this issue.  Having taken so long to get to the opening of these talks I believe the public will show little tolerance of any refusal by Sinn FÈin or others to seriously address the decommissioning problem.  The purpose of arms decommissioning is to remove the threat of violence from the political equation. Progress on the issue is also essential to establish trust and confidence so that all-party talks can proceed in the best possible climate.</P>
    <P>So long as the paramilitaries hold on to their weapons many people will retain doubts as to the true intentions of these organisations.  Decommissioning should be a declaration of confidence in the political process, a statement of commitment to use peaceful and democratic methods exclusively to deliver political objectives and a willingness to accept the expression of will by the people at the ballot box.</P>
    <P>Implicit in the public acceptance by Sinn FÈin of the Mitchell principles yesterday must be the abandonment by it of the boast that not a single bullet will be surrendered in advance of a settlement. Republicans should take note of the words of the Reverend Martin Smyth who said last week: &ldquo;I believe if people are going down the road of peace they do not need Semtex, they certainly do not need ground to air missiles.  Those are weapons of offence and it would be an act of real belief and trust if they brought them forward now&rdquo;.  Sinn FÈin has long demanded confidence-building measures of others and by acting on Reverend Smyth's proposals it could create confidence among those with whom it wishes to engage in dialogue.  The path to a settlement lies in exclusively peaceful and democratic means.  As President Clinton said during his visit to Northern Ireland in l995: &ldquo;Violence has no place at the table of democracy&rdquo;.  Political violence in Ireland must be consigned to history once and for all.  The talks and international commission can achieve this and we must do everything in our power to ensure that this historic objective can be achieved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this very important issue. The Taoiseach has already spoken about the important contribution the decommissioning of illegally held arms can make to the successful outcome of the substantive negotiations on a political settlement in Northern Ireland which are due to commence on 15 September.  The agreement to establish the independent international commission on decommissioning which we are debating today is an important step in this process.  The commission was initially recommended in the report of the International Body chaired by Senator George Mitchell which was submitted in January l996.  The International Body conducted its business in Dublin and Belfast and the new commission will also have facilities in the two cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first tasks which faced me when I became Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works was to arrange for the provision of accommodation for the decommissioning <Col N="608" /> commission.  I was glad of the opportunity to play a role in the decommissioning process and I am happy to report to the House that, within a matter of weeks, my office completed the major refurbishment of Block M in Dublin Castle for this purpose.  The putting in place of these facilities demonstrates in a tangible way the Government's total commitment to this process.</P>
    <P>Selective tendering was adopted for reasons of urgency and security.  Because of the tight timescale the successful tenderer was required to work through the builders' holidays and week-ends to achieve the target completion date.  The contract was completed on schedule and within budget and the building was handed over to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 9 September last.  Great credit is due to all concerned for the speedy and efficient manner in which this project was carried out in what was an extremely tight timescale.</P>
    <P>As is standard practice, the Office of Public Works contracted the services of the private sector for the construction works.  The completion of this project in such a tight timescale is a fine example of the level of co-operation between the public and private sectors.  It should be noted that the building was ready for occupation 11 weeks after the date of receipt of confirmation that the accommodation was required.  I welcome the opportunity to put this information on the record of the House.  The completion of this project will facilitate discussion on important matters in the weeks and months ahead.</P>

      <P>The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, welcomes and supports the agreement to establish the independent international commission on decommissioning and the motion before the House.  During a week when our thoughts have turned to India following the death of Mother Teresa whose life was an inspiration to people everywhere it is perhaps fitting that we should remind ourselves of the life and work of Mahatma Ghandi when considering the proposals on the decommissioning of weapons.  It is also fitting that we do this the day after Sinn FÈin signed up to the Mitchell principles which include a commitment to &ldquo;non-violence&rdquo;.  Non-violence as a political ideology is a gift to the world from India. We should keep its precepts to the forefront of our minds as we consider the role of the independent commission and the wider aspects of the peace process in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decommissioning issue has dogged the peace process during the past three years and Comhaontas Glas welcomes the long overdue agreement between the two Governments to establish the commission.  We wish it well and look forward to the day when it can dissolve itself, its work complete and the gun taken out of Irish politics forever.  The independent commission offers development of the role of neutral facilitation of the conflict resolution process in Northern Ireland which is very welcome.  Since its foundation the Green Party has called for such <Col N="609" /> an international dimension to be introduced to Northern Ireland.  While this is but a small step in that direction, it is an important one.</P>
    <P>There are many parallel lessons to be learned regarding decommissioning and post-conflict situations worldwide.  We remember the Truth Commission in South Africa.  We should also remember the wider implications of the end of the Cold War, one of the largest decommissioning scenarios ever seen in the world.  It was supposed to herald nuclear disarmament.  Those involved with CND down through the years will recall at that time that the nuclear disarmament campaign was at a crossroads.  Membership of groups, such as CND, tumbled because of a perception that decommissioning of arms had been achieved.  In hindsight it is important to remember that what also happened is that arms had shifted from land based areas to submarines in the sea.  In that process there was decommissioning, but there was also a decoy that was called decommissioning.  It is worth remembering what Senator Mitchell said about the need to talk about the decommissioning of a mindset as well as the hardware of militarism, which is not the full picture and can be a decoy in the process of achieving peace.</P>
    <P>It is important that the commission should consist of international personnel and not exclusively of individuals with a military background.  It is also important that the commission should not seem to reflect in its membership any particular military alliance.  For that reason I ask the Government to consider the appointment of a member to it from one of the non-aligned nations.</P>
    <P>I am sure everyone in this House would like to see the complete demilitarising of Northern Ireland society immediately, but it remains a long way off.  It seems strange that organisations committed to the principle of non-violence and the long haul of democratic dialogue and conflict resolution cannot openly call for the immediate decommissioning of all offensive weaponry.  If there are difficulties related to the unilateral nature of such a gesture, should we not consider whether there is a role for the independent commission in brokering a multilateral gesture of some kind?  There is no doubt that building trust towards peace takes considerable courage.  It is appropriate and important to commend measures that have been taken.  I also commend measures taken in the British Army.  On visits to the North I have spoken to soldiers who no longer wear helmets. That is a gesture and a symbolic step towards demilitarisation.</P>
    <P>The wider economic ramifications of the peace process and decommissioning should be remembered. My farming colleagues in north County Dublin need a licence to buy fertiliser, otherwise they are suspected of terrorism.  If we could take immediate steps in that area throughout the island it would go a long way towards normalising society.</P>
    <P>Article 4(a) of the agreement states that the commission is to consult with all the parties, <Col N="610" /> including the two Governments in regard to its brief and that it would be important that it be free to explore possibilities for confidence building measures in the security area as a form of <i>quid pro quo</i> for the start of decommissioning.  It is not credible to separate the issue of State military disengagement from the issue of decommissioning. I would like to be assured that such a role will be possible.  The commission falls a long way short of the level of international and neutral involvement in the security area that I would like to see.  At the very least it must be authorised to make recommendations, in private if need be, to the British Government in relation to security and policing, which might advance the day of decommissioning.</P>
    <P>The militaristic nature of northern society was brought home forcefully to me when I was an observer on the Garvaghy Road in Portadown last July.  Observers who were members of the Canadian Parliament were asked by an international television crew what they thought of the situation.  In an almost flippant, but very telling way one said that he did not think the Canadian Army had as many troops as he saw before him on the Garvaghy Road.  That shows how abnormal is the situation with which we are dealing.</P>
    <P>The absence of the UDP from yesterday's meeting in Belfast is a matter of regret.  Non-violent conflict resolution requires even-handedness all round.  It would be useful if the commission could make recommendations on other confidence building measures, such as the prisoners issue, which is a matter of concern to loyalists and a contributing factor to their current unwillingness to decommission.</P>
    <P>I wish the talks well on 15 September.  I offer the efforts and <i>modus operandi</i> of the Green Party to help bring about lasting peace, to ensure we do not talk only of an absence of guns from Irish politics but of a consensus towards living at peace with one another on this island into the future.</P>

      <P>Next Monday, 15 September, substantive negotiations are due to begin in Belfast.  If the air of anticipation is somewhat muted, it is because the path to this point has been wearying and tortuous.  No one should understate the significance of the point we have reached.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I had the honour to represent my party at the first plenary session of the talks at Stormont.  We were there on the basis of our electoral mandate, an all-Ireland mandate.  That democratic mandate, the voice of Sinn FÈin voters, constitutes our credentials for the talks ahead.  It is vital that the leaders of the Unionist section of the Irish nation realise the critical importance of what lies before us all.  For the first time since partition there is an opportunity for national reconciliation to become a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This misnamed issue of decommissioning was responsible for the destruction of the first peace process.  It was the weapon which, in the hands of <Col N="611" /> the last British Government and at the urging of the Unionists, was used to hold up progress until all efforts to bring about substantive negotiations came to a standstill.  It was a diversion, a road block erected not to achieve the aim of removing all the guns from Irish politics but to postpone the start of negotiations, to keep Sinn FÈin outside talks and to stall talks indefinitely once they began.  Through determined work by my party and others, this road block was finally removed and the way was cleared for the substantive all-party peace negotiations which have been so long in the making.</P>
    <P>I will not support the ratification of the agreement on the international commission as constituted on the grounds that the remit of the proposed commission is too narrow.  Sinn FÈin has a much broader view of the need for demilitarisation in the Six Counties.  All armed groups must be included, most especially the largest and most heavily armed section, the British Crown forces. There is also the neglected issue of the huge number of legally held firearms in the Unionist community, estimated to be around 140,000.  All the guns need to be removed from Irish politics and that includes the plastic bullet guns which were used against Nationalists across the Six Counties during the summer.  Yesterday along the Border in south Armagh near the road from Castleblayney to Dundalk, a British army spy post, hidden under a derelict house, was discovered by workmen. It is only the most recent example of continuing British military activity, both overt and covert, along the Border and across the Six Counties. This includes the reinforcement of the monstrous hilltop post overlooking the main Dublin-Belfast road north of the Border.</P>
    <P>All these issues must be addressed under the heading of demilitarisation.  They must be dealt with in the context of real peace negotiations where agreement and trust will form the basis for forward movement.  However, I affirm that Sinn FÈin will work with this or any commission established in the interest of the peace process.  We look forward to progress on every aspect of the historic negotiations now before us.</P>

      <P>The agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom establishing the independent international commission on decommissioning was signed in Belfast on 26 August 1997 on behalf of both Governments.  The legal basis for the agreement is contained in the Decommissioning Act, 1997, and the terms of the agreement reflect the provisions of that Act, which have already been approved by D·il …ireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 4 of the agreement sets out in more detail the functions of the commission, including its relationship with the political negotiations in Northern Ireland.  I will return to the question of the functions of the commission under Article 4 of the agreement later.  The agreement was laid <Col N="612" /> before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 28 August 1997.</P>
    <P>The signature of the agreement is a key stage in preparing for the establishment of the independent international commission on decommissioning. The establishment of this commission was recommended originally in the report of the International Body, the Mitchell report, presented to both Governments in January 1996. The Mitchell report recommended that the decommissioning process of illegal arms should take place to the satisfaction of an independent commission acceptable to all parties.  It further recommended that the commission would be appointed by the Irish and British Governments on the basis of consultations with the other parties to the negotiation process.  Arising from developments in the Northern Ireland talks, both Governments gave a commitment that the commission would be in a position to commence work on a fully operational basis along with the start of substantive negotiations which are due to commence on 15 September next.</P>
    <P>In accordance with its terms, the agreement will not enter into force until both Governments exchange notification of their acceptance of it.  It is intended this should take place on the date of the commencement of the substantive negotiations in the Northern Ireland talks.  I will make a number of further legal instruments under the provisions of the Decommissioning Act, 1997 on that day to ensure all the legal formalities required to enable the independent international commission to operate from 15 September are completed.</P>
    <P>Among these formalities is the granting of those privileges and immunities to the commission, its members, staff and agents, which will be necessary to enable the commission to perform its duties effectively.  Article 8 of the agreement imposes on these persons the obligation not to disclose any information obtained in the performance of their functions unless such disclosure is authorised by the commission.</P>
    <P>Article 12 of the agreement provides that it shall continue in force until terminated by the mutual agreement of both Governments.  In addition to the legal formalities required, a range of practical matters also arise in connection with the establishment of the commission, including issues of accommodation, support staffing, an IT system, transport arrangements and funding.  All of these matters are being handled by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>In conformity with the precedent established by the International Body, the international commission will have offices in Dublin and Belfast.  It is too early at this stage to say how the commission will distribute its time and activities between these locations.  This may depend on, and vary with, the different stages of the commission's work under the various headings of its responsibilities, set out in Article 4 of the agreement. Suitable office accommodation for the commission has been provided in Dublin Castle, <Col N="613" /> as was outlined by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Cullen.  I compliment him and the Office of Public Works on the priority given to the preparation of these facilities.</P>
    <P>Article 2 of the agreement provides, as does the legislation, that the commission will be independent in the performance of its duties.  The commission's independence is underlined by the inclusion of the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in its formal title.  Article 7 of the agreement provides, in accordance with the basic legislative provision in the Decommissioning Act, 1997, that both Governments will provide necessary funding for the proper functioning of the commission.  In line with the arrangement which applied for the International Body, the ongoing costs will be shared equally by both Governments.  Any capital costs arising will be incurred where they fall.  The overall cost of the International Body was approximately £200,000 which was in respect of a ten week period in 1995-6.</P>
    <P>On that basis, it is possible that the operation of the commission, which will be for a much longer period, could cost approximately £1.2 million for a 12 month period, 50 per cent of which would be borne by this Government.  Provision will be included in next year's Estimates for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on that basis by way of a grant-in-aid payable to the commission.  Expenditure in 1997 can be borne from the existing provisions in the Vote for my Department.</P>
    <P>Article 9 of the agreement places an obligation on the commission to keep proper accounts and to appoint, at the request of both Governments, auditors whose reports will be submitted to the Governments.  The first task of the commission in accordance with its mandate under Article 4 of the agreement, will be to consult the participants in the Northern Ireland negotiations, including both Governments, on the type of schemes for decommissioning, including the role it might play in respect of each scheme.  The consultation phase of the commission's work is not limited by time in any way.  When it has been completed, the commission will be expected, in accordance with its mandate under Article 4, to present to both Governments proposals for schemes for decommissioning which will have regard to the views expressed to it by those it has consulted.  This will include the considered views of both Governments and also those of participants who are likely to have most influence with the different paramilitary groups who hold the illegal arms involved.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this stage to emphasise the intrinsically voluntary nature of decommissioning, which is the subject of the Mitchell report's recommendations.  This has obvious implications for the <i>modus operandi</i> of the commission and for the terms and details of schemes of decommissioning that may be prepared by it.</P>
    <P>The search for illegal arms by the security forces, <Col N="614" /> or pre-emptory decommissioning continues unabated.  The Garda have had notable successes in this regard, including a recent major seizure of bomb-making components in County Cavan, for which it deserves great credit and our congratulations.</P>
    <P>The work of the commission will fall into two broad phases.  I have already covered the first phase, involving consultations with other parties and the drafting and presentation of proposals for schemes of decommissioning.  In the second phase, the commission will be involved in the implementation of agreed schemes, including the observation, monitoring and verification of the ultimate destruction of decommissioned arms, along the lines recommended by the International Body.  This is the third of the functions given to the commission in the agreement.  Before any such schemes of decommissioning can be implemented it will be necessary for me to make further regulations under the Decommissioning Act, 1997 in relation to the logistics of decommissioning.</P>
    <P>The operational stage of the commission's work will also involve considerable demands for technical advice and field resources by the commission as well as independent legal advice.  The International Body anticipated this in its recommendations and suggestions that the commission should be able to call upon the resources of the relevant technical expertise of the Irish and British security forces when and as appropriate.  I expect that these issues will require considerable teasing out with the commission at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>The final element in the menu of functions which the commission will have under this agreement is a duty to report periodically to both Governments and, through whatever mechanism they may establish for that purpose, the other participants in the political negotiations in Northern Ireland.  This reinforces the connection that already exists and is accepted by both Governments between the decommissioning issue and the political negotiations in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The need to build trust and confidence is a major requisite for progress in the political negotiations. The process of decommissioning can act as a catalyst in building confidence within the negotiations and can be advanced itself as a result of progress in those negotiations.  In this way a dynamic can be created lending momentum towards an eventual political agreement in the way visualised in the Mitchell report.  The commission will have a vital role to play in this process and I wish it every success in discharging its important and challenging mandate.</P>
    <P>I thank all the participants in this extremely important debate.  I acknowledge in particular the work of my predecessor in dealing with the decommissioning issue for which I thank and congratulate her.  I commend this motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to make this personal explanation.  The purpose of doing so is to address the reference in the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Dunnes Stores Payments) to the statement which I made to this House on 19 December last.  On that occasion I sought the opportunity to make a statement to this House so that I could address the innuendoes that arose following the disclosure that Dunnes Stores had paid for works to my house in Holycross.</P>
      <P>It was being widely suggested that Dunnes Stores paid for the works to my house in return for political favours.  The purpose of making my statement was to categorically refute that false charge.  Speculation about the Price Waterhouse report was rife at that time as extracts had been leaked to the media.  I told this House, correctly, on 19 December that I had not seen the Price Waterhouse report nor have I seen it since.  I attempted to deal with the elements of that report which I understood referred to my business.</P>
      <P>During the course of my address to the D·il I made the following statements:</P>
      <P>I did not make any secret of the fact that Dunnes Stores paid me for professional services by way of assistance towards my house.  If someone were trying to hide income, would he or she not be more likely to put it in an offshore account?  The last thing such a person would do would be to spend it on a very obvious structure of bricks and mortar for all the world to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This statement was intended merely to address the fact that Dunnes Stores had paid for construction work to my house, that this was well known to a significant number of people, and that I made no effort whatsoever to conceal it.  My reference to offshore accounts in this context, therefore, was intended only to illustrate this point.  With <Col N="616" /> the benefit of hindsight I now accept that the words I used and the example I gave were most unfortunate and conveyed a misleading impression.  I fully accept responsibility for that. However, I categorically assure this House that it was not my intention to mislead.  I offer my full and sincere apologies to the Ceann Comhairle and to all Members of the House then and now for having misled them in any way.</P>
    <P>During the course of my D·il statement I also referred to some payments made to me by Dunnes Stores.  These were the payments which I understood had been referred to in the Price Waterhouse report.  The tribunal report notes that I made no mention whatever of other sums, including large payments paid to me by Dunnes Stores.  I now accept that for completeness I should have done so.  I offer my full and sincere apologies also for this omission.  Again, it was not my intention to mislead.  I was, in fact, confining myself to what I understood to be references in the Price Waterhouse report.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to understand that I am constrained about addressing here the corporate and tax aspects of my affairs as these are currently the subject of review by the relevant authorities. Overall the difficulties I now face are substantial. I have contributed to my own misfortune.  I have not managed my affairs as well as I should have and I have admitted making mistakes.  They relate not to my actions as a holder of public office but to my personal and financial affairs.  I have already paid, and continue to pay, a very high price as a consequence.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I apologise again to this House for any inadvertent misleading impression that my statement of 19 December may have conveyed. I ask for its acceptance of that apology and for its understanding in what are for me very difficult times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come here today to defend my personal integrity, the integrity of my party, of this Government and the honour of this House.  I have also come here to reassure the public and in particular my constituents that I have done nothing wrong.  The experience of my 24 years' membership of this House has seasoned me in the way parliamentary politics operate.  The dynamics of democratic politics operating at parliamentary level dictate that Governments are opposed by Oppositions who in accordance with their function will avail of every opportunity to make life uncomfortable for the Government of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say this without rancour.  I have been in Opposition myself many times.  That is the way our system operates.  I accept that.  If I did not I would have no business being here.  Furthermore, I do not expect that the facts I will present here today will in all cases satisfy everybody.  I am, however, making this statement out of respect for <Col N="617" /> the House and for those Members of the House who have sought this statement in good faith.</P>
    <P>The circumstances which have given rise to the position in which I find myself occurred during the 1989 general election campaign and have already been described in a statement issued by me on 7 August this year.  With your leave, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to read this statement into the record of the House:</P>
    <P>During the last two years I have been the target of a vicious campaign of rumour and innuendo.  Since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs this campaign has intensified. The stories which have appeared in the media in recent weeks are, as one prominent journalist acknowledged in a letter to me last week, the culmination of a lengthy series of smears about me.  The story still keeps resurfacing in different shapes and forms, and the repeated articles and comments of recent weeks have placed an unacceptable burden on my family and myself.  While I resent having to dignify these allegations by responding to them at all, I believe that I must now do so.  The facts of the matter are that during the 1989 general election campaign I was visited in my home by Mr. Michael Bailey of Bovale Developments Ltd., and a Mr. James Gogarty.</P>
    <P>Mr. Bailey was well known to me as he was a resident of north County Dublin and a long-time supporter of Fianna F·il.  I had not met Mr. Gogarty previously but he was introduced by Mr. Bailey as an executive of Joseph Murphy Structural Engineers &mdash; JMSE.  Mr. Gogarty told me JMSE wished to make a political contribution to me and I received from him in good faith a sum of £30,000 as a totally unsolicited political contribution.  At no time during our meeting were any favours sought or given.  I did not do any favours for or make any representations to anyone on behalf of JMSE, Mr. Michael Bailey, Bovale Developments Limited or Mr. James Gogarty either before or since 1989.</P>
    <P>From what I have read and heard it seems the source of the allegations in the media may be Mr. James Gogarty.  I do not know what motive, if any, Mr. Gogarty would have for pursuing such a vendetta against me.  I believe, however, that he and his former employers, JMSE, parted in acrimonious circumstances.  If Mr. Gogarty is the source of these allegations, then he is the author of a campaign of lies against me.  I have also been the recipient of a number of anonymous threatening letters relating to these allegations.  I have turned this correspondence over to the Garda.</P>
    <P>As regards the most recent newspaper reports, I received an unsolicited political contribution of £30,000, not £80,000 as reported. The allegation that I received £40,000 from Mr. Bailey or Bovale Developments Limited on that or any other occasion is false.  There were three persons present when I received the contribution from Mr. Gogarty &mdash; Mr. Gogarty, <Col N="618" /> Mr. Bailey and myself &mdash; and not five as reported.  There was one JMSE executive present, Mr. Gogarty, and not two or three as variously reported.</P>
    <P>I am taking the opportunity to state unequivocally that I have done nothing illegal, unethical or improper.  I find myself the victim of a campaign of calumny and abuse.  It is totally unacceptable that this matter should be allowed to continue to fulfil an agenda which has nothing to do with election contributions or any other aspect of reasonable or reasoned political debate in public life.  If any further untruths are published about me, I will take all necessary steps to vindicate my good name and reputation.</P>
    <P>I wish to elaborate on aspects of that statement. My understanding is that the making of this contribution came about as follows.  Mr. Gogarty indicated to Mr. Bailey that JMSE wished to make a contribution to my election fund.  Mr. Bailey brought Mr. Gogarty to my home and, during a brief meeting, Mr. Gogarty confirmed that JMSE wished to make a political contribution to me.  The contribution was entirely in cash.  Prior to leaving with Mr. Bailey, Mr. Gogarty wished me well in the election.  I did not receive £40,000 from Mr. Bailey or Bovale Developments Limited on that or any other occasion.  I did not receive any personal contributions from Mr. Bailey either before, during or after the 1989 general election, although I have established that over the years Mr. Bailey made a number of contributions to the Fianna F·il organisation in my constituency on such occasions as race nights and so on.</P>
    <P>In light of allegations made subsequent to my statement of 7 August last, I confirm that Mr. Joseph Murphy junior of JMSE was not present at my meeting with Mr. Gogarty and Mr. Bailey. I did not meet Mr. Joseph Murphy junior during or in connection with the 1989 general election campaign.  Mr. Gogarty, who was the managing director of JMSE, was the only executive of that company present.</P>
    <P>I confirm that I contributed £10,000 to the Fianna F·il national organisation during that election campaign.  In addition, l handed over moneys totalling approximately £7,000 to my local constituency organisation during the general election campaign in 1989.  The remainder of the political contributions received by me, including the contribution Mr. Gogarty gave me during our meeting in my home, were used to cover my personal election campaign and subsequent political expenses.  I did not and do not have separate accounts as regards either the election campaign in question or my subsequent political expenditure.</P>
    <P>As regards the contribution, £30,000 is the largest contribution I have received during any election campaign either before or since 1989.  On the other hand, in 1989 there had not been any legal limitations since 1963 on the amount a parliamentary candidate could expend on his or her election campaign.  Furthermore, political expenditure <Col N="619" /> does not begin or end during election campaigns. As all Members of this House will be aware, the last 25 years have seen a fundamental change in the operation of politics with public representatives or prospective public representatives having to operate ongoing and expensive constituency campaigns and services between and not merely during elections, such as newspaper advertisements, race nights, community contributions, leaflet drops, clinics and so on.</P>
    <P>For as long as I have been a Member of this House, political parties and individual politicians have actively solicited and accepted political contributions. Soliciting or accepting such contributions was not outlawed or discouraged through legislation or the Standing Orders or rules of this House.  For any candidate or representative to have accepted a political contribution with strings attached would have been unethical if not down-right illegal.  In the context of this contribution there was no attempt to attach any strings or to ask for any favours.</P>
    <P>We now come to the nub of this matter.  The stories that circulated were not that a politician had been given a contribution, albeit a generous one.  Until recently, the mere making of a political contribution during an election campaign would not have been news at all.  The core of this affair, the issue that has led to the Garda investigation and the primary issue that the Taoiseach felt it necessary to investigate prior to nominating me to serve in this Government is that Mr. Gogarty has apparently alleged not only that a political contribution was made to me, but that it was made for some improper purpose.</P>
    <P>Any allegation that I have done anything wrong is completely untrue.  No favours were done for JMSE, Bovale Developments Limited, Mr. Bailey, Mr. Murphy junior or Mr. Gogarty. Furthermore, notwithstanding what the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> journalist, Mr Frank Connolly, described as &ldquo;a number of meetings, about fifteen hours of discussions&rdquo; between Mr. Gogarty and the investigating Garda Superintendent and the fact that Mr. Gogarty was offered immunity from prosecution almost three months ago, I understand Mr. Gogarty has not signed any statement which would finally clarify what precisely he is or is not alleging.  If favours have been done for Bovale Developments Limited or JMSE, I had nothing to do with them.  I assume that if any Members of this House are aware of any such decision, they will declare their knowledge to this House and any involvement they might have had in any such decision.  For my part, I have had no involvement, direct or indirect, in any such decisions.</P>
    <P>I ceased to be a member of Dublin County Council in 1987.  While a member of Dublin County Council between 1985 and 1987, the only proposal I made with regard to any planning matter related to one private residence which was supported unanimously by all members of the council in attendance at the meeting in question. <Col N="620" /> This matter arose in April 1986 when I was chairman of the council.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House, l refer to a question put to the manager of Dublin County Council by my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, in which he asked for the lists of all section 4 and material contravention motions together with the names of the councillors who proposed and seconded them which were brought before the council from 1985 until 1989.  The reply was given on 11 December 1989.  The answer to Deputy Gilmore's question shows that for the relevant part of that period during which I was a member of the council, I neither proposed nor supported any motions involving Bovale Developments Limited, JMSE, Mr. Michael Bailey, Mr. Joseph Murphy junior or Mr. James Gogarty.  Since I ceased to be a member of Dublin County Council in 1987, I have not asked for or urged support for any of these companies or individuals in the context of planning or material contravention motions or in any other matter.  The first review of the County Dublin Development Plan, which took place after the 1989 general election, was in 1991-3.  In relation to that plan, I actively campaigned against the rezoning proposals being made by the councillors. On foot of reasonable and valid complaints from constituents and residents' groups, I actively opposed the decisions that were being made and sought a reconsideration of them by the Fianna F·il group on Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>I want to quote a letter to Ms Betty Coffey, the then chairperson of the Fianna F·il group, Dublin County Council, 46-49 O'Connell Street, Dublin 1, dated 4 August 1993, from my home on D·il notepaper:</P>
    <P>Dear Betty,</P>
    <P>I write to you as chairperson of the Fianna F·il group on the council and I enclose a copy of a letter which I received from [a particular constituent] regarding the rezoning in Dona-bate. As you are aware, there is considerable annoyance in the north county area concerning the recent rezoning decisions and I believe it is in the interests of the party in the area that the group discuss the situation and alter the decision at the next stage of the review process. It would be impossible for me to specify each area of controversy but I would give you as examples the decisions in the Rivervalley area, the Christian Brothers' lands in Swords &mdash; there are many others.</P>
    <P>Kindest personal regards,</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Ray Burke.</P>
    <P>These matters were the subject of many discussions within the Fianna F·il organisation in my constituency at various levels, during which I expressed my opposition to various proposals. Furthermore, I led a delegation of Fianna F·il cumann members to meet the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, in November 1993 to express opposition to the rezoning <Col N="621" /> proposals of Dublin County Council as illustrated in the revised development plan and requested him not to sanction the revised plan.</P>
    <P>With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that in accepting this contribution, even in good faith, I exposed myself to the risk of being the subject of malicious allegations of the type now being made. Any Member who contests elections and depends on contributions to finance his or her campaign &mdash; unless he or she belongs to the fortunate few who inherit wealth &mdash; could find himself or herself where I am now had his or her path crossed that of a person who was prepared to make false charges against him or her, even if that person refused to honour those charges with a signature.</P>
    <P>If anything seems clear from the conflicting news stories relating to this affair, it is that Mr. Gogarty's allegations against me form merely a small part of allegations being thrown by him against his former employers, from whom he parted in acrimonious circumstances.  I can only assume that he made these allegations in an attempt to bring pressure to bear on his former employers in the context of his dispute with them.</P>
    <P>In this context Mr. Connolly of the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>, to whom I referred earlier, confirmed in a radio interview that &ldquo;from the very outset Mr. Gogarty has been mostly concerned with his unresolved differences with his former employers, JMSE&rdquo; and, indeed, Mr. Connolly acknowledged that he had pursued the allegations against me &ldquo;more actively than perhaps [Mr Gogarty] wished&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In my letter to the Ceann Comhairle asking for permission to make this statement, I made the point that I was going to make a personal statement on a 1989 election contribution.  I also indicated that I was willing to take a question and answer session on my statement.  This is unprecedented in the House.  I will be as forthcoming as I can in any matter relating to the contribution which has been the subject of controversy.</P>
    <P>In February, I will be a Member of the House for 25 years.  I have no intention of subjecting myself to a show trial to satisfy anyone's political agenda or set a very undesirable precedent for this House.  I do not believe that the people who elected me to this House or the decent fair-minded people of this country want or expect me to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister ask Mr. Gogarty the reason for his generosity and why the sum of £30,000 was being delivered to him in cash?  The Minister might indicate in what denomination that money was received.  It is quite an extraordinary sum to receive in cash.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the general question of contributions, and I will come back at a later stage undoubtedly to Mr. Gogarty and his allegations, I am much taken with the view as expressed by Fine Gael in the press statement in response to my statement on 7 August: &ldquo;Fine Gael accepts that solicited and unsolicited contributions to the election expenses of parties and of individual candidates are a normal, healthy, unexceptional part of the Irish democratic process&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It was not just Fine Gael which had that view about unsolicited contributions.  When asked a similar question, another distinguished Member of this House said that the bulk of his election expenses were his personal responsibility, that they had increased significantly in recent years, that assistance from supporters was welcome but that the Member was honour bound to observe the confidentiality under which contributions were made.  He said that the donations received have been mainly of the order of £200 and any donations over £500 would have been very much an exception.  He said that he fully supported disclosure elements in the Electoral Bill and that he would comply with all its provisions when it came into effect.  Incidentally, I also support the Electoral Act.</P>
      <P>That distinguished Member was responding to what I think was an impertinent question from <i>The Kerryman</i> of Friday, 20 December 1996, when all six Kerry Members were asked questions about donations.  They were asked three specific questions: to disclose donations received by them as election candidates in the past ten years &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to be fair to the answerer.  For reasons I do not understand, the Minister seems to be evading answering both questions by delivering a form of soliloquy on a Kerry newspaper article.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am trying to answer in a <Col N="623" /> fair and simple way.  There is a view in relation to contributions in this House and I am making the point that it is not just my view.  As I have already outlined, it is the view of the Fine Gael Party, with which I know the Deputy will not disagree. I am trying to be fair and reasonable.  I want to make the point also in relation to the Labour Party and, similarly, I am sure I will get the opportunity to quote Deputy Rabbitte in relation to The Workers' Party and a contribution of £28,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order and in case the Minister forgets, I repeat my questions.  Did the Minister ask Mr. Gogarty why he was a recipient of such largesse, and second, did he address the issue of why he was receiving this money in cash?  Was that something of a surprise to the Minister?  Will the Minister indicate in what notes the money was received, as I previously requested?  Perhaps the Minister would just reply to the questions asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I already said, Mr. Gogarty wished me well in the election campaign and had indicated to Mr. Bailey that he wanted to support the election campaign.  Why did he come to me? The Deputy would have to ask Mr. Gogarty that question.  This matter occurred in 1989 and in attempting to recall and collect details of particular allocations of funds, cheques or otherwise, during recent months in respect of this controversy and in the interests of being as frank as possible with the House, I must inform the Deputy that I have no recollection of the denominations of the moneys I received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the contribution in question formed part of moneys he received and that he had never previously received such a large sum.  I am not criticising any Member of this House for raising funds because all politicians raise funds for election purposes. However, the sum of money in question is extraordinary. Did it not occur to the Minister to ask Mr. Gogarty why he was giving him £30,000 in cash?  In that context, will the Minister indicate the nature of the other funds he received in 1989, of which this sum formed a part, and whether those funds were received in cash or otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the funding was concerned, I did not ask Mr. Bailey the questions to which the Deputy referred.  As far as other funding is concerned, I am here to answer questions in respect of a donation of £30,000.  I never received a larger contribution but I have no intention of dealing with other subscriptions I received before or since the period under discussion.  I have already given the reasons for my receipt of the £30,000 and referred to quotations by other Members in respect of it.  That has been the tradition of this House in relation to confidentiality <Col N="624" /> regarding contributions and I do not intend to comment further on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement, the Minister introduced the issue of other contributions by indicating that out of these and other moneys received by him he gave the Fianna F·il Party £10,000, his constituency organisation £7,000 and the remainder was spent on his political campaign and other political expenditures.  Is he saying that the £7,000 given to his constituency organisation and the £10,000 given to Fianna F·il derived from the £30,000 in addition to a further unspecified sum?  Will the Minister indicate the dates on which Fianna F·il Party headquarters was given £10,000 and his constituency organisation was given £7,000?  Was the current Leader of Fianna F·il or his predecessor informed that the Minister had received £30,000 preceding the 1989 election?</P>

    <P>Dear Mr. Burke,</P>
    <P>This is to confirm that on your instruction this branch issued a bank draft No. 340804 in favour of Fianna F·il for the sum of £10,000.  This draft was duly lodged and paid by the bank on 16/6/1989.</P>

    <P>The sum of money I gave to my constituency organisation was confirmed as having been received in two drafts amounting to £2,000 and £5,000.  I have never denied that the £30,000 was the only contribution I received during that election campaign because that would be a false statement. I am sure most Deputies receive contributions during election campaigns.</P>
    <P>Lest Deputy Shatter suggest &mdash; perhaps I am anticipating the Deputy in this regard &mdash; that there was a massive surplus of funds following the 1989 general election, I am reluctant to inform him, not on the basis of not wishing to provide information to the House but because I believe I am setting appalling precedents for those who make personal statements to the House in the future, about a letter I received from my bank dated 4 August 1989.  I find it offensive to do this <Col N="625" /> from the point of view of my family but, in the interests of clarity, I wish to place on record the text of the letter from the Ulster Bank, Dublin Airport Branch, Swords Road, Cloughran, County Dublin which states:</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Burke,</P>
    <P>I refer to recent discussions and I am pleased to confirm that subject to the terms and conditions outlined below the following facility has been sanctioned for you.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;facility&rdquo; referred to involved an overdraft of £35,000 which I required at that time and it was to be reviewed on 4 August 1990.  Does that sound like someone who, as has been suggested, was awash with cash?</P>

      <P>Re: Ray Burke and James Gogarty.</P>
      <P>Dear Ray,</P>
      <P>In the course of my preparation of the statement of claim in the defamation proceedings issued in the High Court against Mr. James Gogarty, I have corresponded with Messrs. Fitzsimons Redmond Solicitors who represent Mr. Joseph Murphy and I have spoken with Mr. Kevin Smith of T.K. Smith Foy Solicitors who represent Mr. Michael Bailey.  I enclose herewith a copy of the correspondence I have sent to Mr. Michael Fitzsimons, solicitor, of Messrs.  Fitzsimons Redmond and the reply dated 8 September.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I have spoken with Mr. Kevin Smith of T.K. Smith Foy who confirmed to me that Mr. Bailey's evidence in your High Court action against Mr. Gogarty will be as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  At the meeting in your house in June 1989 there were only three people present &mdash; Mr. Bailey, Mr. Gogarty and yourself.</P>
      <P>2.  Mr. Bailey was present throughout the meeting.</P>
      <P>3.  Mr. James Gogarty told Mr. Michael Bailey that he wanted to make a contribution to your election fund.</P>
      <P>4.  Mr. Michael Bailey witnessed the handing over of the contribution to you by Mr. James Gogarty.</P>
      <P>5.  At this meeting no favours were requested either by Mr. Bailey or Mr. James Gogarty and none were offered by you.</P>

    <P>To be helpful to the House and to clarify the matter, I will read a letter from my solicitor to Mr. Fitzsimons of Messrs.  Fitzsimons Redmond dated 4 September 1997:</P>
    <P>re. our client Ray Burke T.D.</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>We refer to our telephone conversation with Mr. Fitzsimons in connection with the above matter.  We are in the process of preparing our client's statement of claim and putting together the statement of evidence that will be necessary in our client's case against Mr. James Gogarty arising from a defamation of our client by him. We understand that you act on behalf of Joseph Murphy who has been mentioned by Mr. Gogarty in his statement to the newspapers. To enable us to prepare a statement of evidence in our client's case and a statement of claim we wonder if you would be in a position to let us know the answers to the following questions:</P>
    <P>1.  Whether Mr. Joseph Murphy was present in our client's house at the time Mr. Gogarty handed a political contribution of £30,000 to our client.</P>
    <P>2.  Whether Mr. Joseph Murphy has ever met with our client and, if so, when, where and on what basis?</P>
    <P>3.  We would be very much obliged if you would let us know whether your client has been able to identify the source of the payments to our client and whether there are records of these payments and, if so, you might be good enough to let us have a breakdown of the records of the payments.</P>
    <P>That was important in light of some of the newspaper articles that had been written.</P>
    <P>I refer Deputies to the reply that was received from Fitzsimons Redmond.</P>
    <P>re. your client Ray Burke, our client Joseph Murphy Structural Engineers Ltd.  and Joseph Murphy Jnr.</P>
    <P>Dear Sirs,</P>
    <P>We refer to the above and recent correspondence, the contents of which have been noted. The position and our reply is as follows: Our client was not present in your client's home when your client met with Mr. James Gogarty.  The answer to the second question is no.  [ I remind the House of that question &mdash; whether Mr. Joseph Murphy has ever met with our client and, if so, when, where and on what basis?  The answer was no.] On the third question, on 3 June 1989 two consecutive cheques <Col N="628" /> were drawn on the JMSE account in the AIB Talbot Street branch &mdash; one cheque for £20,000 and a second for £10,000.  The cheque stubs in relation to both cheques say cash.  We presume these cheques relate to the £30,000 at issue. However, following inquiries with the AIB, they have been unable to provide any details in relation to same and do not have a record of paid cheques.</P>
    <P>That is for the information of the House.  I have been asked about records which go as far back as 1989.  I have striven very hard to find and trace records.  Fortunately, for the £10,000 that went to Fianna F·il headquarters I had a bank draft and had evidence of it.  In regard to other records, I have since discovered something of which I was not aware, that is, banks do not keep records dating back eight or nine years.  All records are stopped and it is practically impossible to find records.  I have found as much as I possibly can and I am trying to be as frank as possible.</P>

      <P>I begin to wonder if the Minister and I live in different worlds completely.  Did the Minister have any sense of something remotely odd about two gentlemen arriving with £30,000 in cash?  Did they say it was £30,000 in cash or did they just hand him a wad of money?  Did he for one moment think of the implications?  I do not know if other Members have had an experience where somebody during an election campaign doles out to them £30,000 in cash.  Did the Minister consider this was not the norm in the context of an election which had become expensive?</P>
      <P>Can I take it from the correspondence the Minister has read that a summons has issued in his case against Mr. Gogarty?</P>
      <P>It may be helpful to the Minister to take this opportunity to clarify to the House whether he received any other sizeable contributions during election campaigns from similar companies or the building industry.</P>

      <P>The summons has issued and is the basis of preparation for the next phase of the legal proceedings.  In the course of my preparation of the statement of claim in the defamation proceedings issued in the High Court against Mr. James Gogarty, this correspondence has been received with the indication from the two people that they are prepared to give evidence in the High Court in regard to it.  Many of the allegations made in the newspapers that result in me being here answering questions arose from comments about sums of £80,000 and £40,000.  I have striven to obtain maximum information and have put it before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I already indicated it was an exceptional sum to receive and probably in hindsight I left myself open to the type of allegations that have been made.  It should not have happened but there were no rules in place in 1989 in regard to subscriptions. My recollection is that the money was in two envelopes which were given to me.  It was only after the people had left that the money was <Col N="629" /> counted.  I was not aware at the time of the sum I was receiving.  As far as other contributions are concerned I have already answered that in the context of other subscriptions.  I am here to answer questions on the £30,000 contribution.  I have never received a larger contribution and will not get into the question of other contributions which I received.</P>

      <P>I will give Deputy Rabbitte an idea.  Members will recall the 1989 campaign was particularly long.  Apart from the campaign, there was the phoney war.  There was a lead in of almost six weeks after the then Taoiseach had returned from Japan and there was controversy in regard to haemophiliacs.  During the campaign I organised and paid all the expenses of operating several canvass teams.  Throughout the campaign I arranged and paid for two crews to be posted to the constituency on an ongoing basis.  I had literature printed, financed leaflets and carried out a vigorous personal campaign.  As Members are aware a candidate's progress in a campaign is marked by ongoing levels of expenditure.  I staged several meetings of party workers and supported and covered the cost.  I caused billboards to be placed throughout the constituency.  I utilised an extensive level of transport especially on polling day.  I placed numerous advertisements and had additional secretarial backup.  After the campaign I had functions to thank workers and supporters <Col N="630" /> and paid the costs involved.  All in all the 1989 campaign was long and expensive.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to furnish details or documents to support what I am saying and I doubt if any other Member could do so in relation to an election held over eight years ago. However, the bottom line is that the money given to me by Mr. Gogarty was applied by me to my personal expenses and to Fianna F·il at a national and local level.  None of it went towards doing favours for JMSE, Bovale or anyone else and neither did anything else I received in that election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that in 1993 Fianna F·il agreed with the Labour Party to put a ceiling on the amount of expenditure on three, four and five seat constituencies &mdash; £17,000, if I recall correctly, in a five seat constituency and obviously a lesser amount in a three seat constituency?  Will the Minister give us an idea of the expenditure? Clearly, £7,000 was spent by the constituency organisation and £13,000 by himself.  I do not know if the other Fianna F·il candidates were expected to bear some of the cost.  As a senior politician in the constituency, would it not be the case that he would have a donor base that went significantly outside the single contributor and can we have an indication of what that would have realised?  This was the election where Fianna F·il lost a seat.  It seems a very large expenditure for that result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes we did lose a seat at that time despite the expenditure incurred and the efforts made but thankfully we regained the seat in the recent election.  Deputy Rabbitte asked me about contributions, confidentiality and so on.  An article in <i>The Examiner</i>, Irish News, 24 July 1997, under the heading De Rossa Libel Trial states:</P>
      <P>Mr. McDowell [who was representing the Independent newspaper group in that case] said that in an item in the draft, [the draft accounts of The Workers' Party Ard Comhairle accounts] it was stated there was a subscription for £28,000 with the comment &ldquo;verbal explanation from Mr. Sean Garland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Did he know why it was not put in writing?</P>
      <P>Mr. Rabbitte said he did not but in his time and up to now, there would always have been subscriptions, some corporate and some by individuals, who did not want their identity to be known.  There was nothing unusual in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> I agree fully with Deputy Rabbitte's view on subscriptions which come in.</P>
    <P>So far as the overall expenditure of the campaign is concerned I received subscriptions which were spent on my campaign.  I have already outlined the financial position I was in one month later as evidenced by my bank records.  I ask the Deputy to accept that my bank manager is not telling lies and that the letter I received on 4 August 1989 outlined my financial straits after that campaign.  I ask the Deputy, in decency, to accept what I am saying.  It was an expensive campaign and the money received was expended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to give the identity of his donors but to give an approximate figure for the 1989 campaign.  If he will not answer that question, I put one last question to him.  He is no stranger to controversy in the planning area and, for that reason, did the size of the donation not cause alarm bells to ring in his head when he counted it subsequent to the departure of Mr. Gogarty?  Did he make any subsequent contact with Mr. Gogarty?  Will the Minister say why is it likely that somebody who was unknown to him would consider that exposing his donation would somehow help him in his battle with his company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume he did not have a battle with his company when he came to me.  He was an executive of the company.  As I understand it from reports I have read it was after that he had a battle with his company.  I have been involved in controversy before.  I have been the subject of allegations and innuendo.  I have been accused of everything in recent weeks other than starting the Chicago fire and being involved in the shooting of Michael Collins.  So far as the 1989 situation is concerned there could have been some concern if I was a member of a local authority and in a position to influence any decision.  As he was a member of the local authority and served with me the Deputy will recall I had left that local authority in March 1987.  I have already outlined the circumstances and have indicated it was an enormous sum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want clarification on two points.  Why was the donation in cash?  Will the Minister agree with the summing up of Denis McCullagh, SC in the payments to politicians tribunal that the mere acceptance of such a gift compromises the recipient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better ask Mr. Gogarty why it was in cash, I cannot give the answer.  The two cheques for £20,000 and £10,000 were made out to cash by his company and went through their bank.  In regard to Mr. McCullagh's summing up, the Deputy could also read the rest of the report of the McCracken tribunal on political contributions and what is said about them.  I <Col N="632" /> do not have a copy of the report with me but it states that the system of political contributions should be continued within the new rules that have been laid down.  I fully support them and if they are to be altered in forthcoming elections I will adhere to those as well.  What is happening, and I am deeply affected by it, is I am being judged under the rules for 1997, which are right and proper and which I support, where amounts in excess of the maximum figure of £500 for individuals and £4,000 for parties must be declared, although the contribution was received in 1989 when there were no rules in place.  It is also ironic that I am being asked about records of what I have and what I did and did not do.</P>
      <P>I am reminded of the response given by Mr. Se·n Murray at the beef tribunal to a question about subscriptions.  He said he had a list of subscriptions given by persons or companies connected with the beef processing industry between 1987 and 1990.  He was asked the position in relation to previous years, to which he replied that the records had been destroyed and that prior to 1987 there were no records.  That relates to Fine Gael, an organisation I know to be effective and efficient, having fought it all my political life.  I, as a single Deputy, am being asked to produce records back to 1989.  I have made valiant efforts to get those records, and I have tried to be as frank as I can in relation to what I got and what I did.  I can give the House no more information than I already have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that after the election of 1989 he borrowed £35,000.  The implication is that this was money he required to borrow because of his personal election campaign. He then told us he received cash amounting to £30,000.  Apparently, he retained £13,000 of that which he also spent on his personal election campaign.  That brings the amount that the Minister spent on his personal election campaign to £48,000.  On top of that he got other unspecified donations.  I want the Minister to clarify that.  Is he saying that in 1989 he spent in excess of £48,000 on his personal election campaign, separate from the money the Fianna F·il organisation spent in his constituency?</P>
      <P>The Minister has told the House that he received this money in cash, that he subsequently discovered that the person who brought him the money had encashed two cheques.  Apparently the Minister did not know that it was £30,000 he had received but he subsequently counted the money he got.  Perhaps he might indicate to the House how much he thought it was.  After he discovered how much it was, did he write to anyone to thank them and, if so, to whom?  Why was Mr. Bailey acting as an intermediary to bring Mr. Gogarty to him in these circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that at that time he was not a member of a local authority and therefore was not exercising poor judgment.  Let me suggest &mdash; and I take no pleasure in making this suggestion <Col N="633" />&mdash; that he and I shared membership of Dublin County Council together for a period of two to two and a half years until he resumed his position in Cabinet, and that it was poor judgment for a former member of a county council, someone who had been so recently involved in making decisions and voting on issues in the council, some of which were controversial, to have received this level of money personally in cash?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this offensive.  There may be a bit of blood lust today for my neck, but we are setting a precedent that we will all regret in the future.  I will come back to Deputy Shatter's point in a moment.  I listened carefully to the point made by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, and I was taken by some of the comments he made about people being chased.  I do not mind answering questions.  I volunteered to answer questions in the House because I have nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of. However, we are creating a precedent.  If for any reason any other Member of this House ever wants to make a personal statement this precedent will be thrown across the House and he or she will be asked why they will not answer questions. This will affect not just the present Members of the House but future Members, people who have not even indicated an interest in becoming Deputies.</P>
      <P>As to the money, it was not to pay off election expenses; it was an overdraft facility to assist with financing house refurbishment, the building of a tennis court for my two daughters and the changing of my wife's car which she has had since 1989 and has not changed since.  I have no pleasure in having to reveal details of my personal finances to any Member of this House or to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the period from 1985 to 1987, I was a member of the county council, and I chaired it and tried to ensure that there was a minimum of controversial decisions.  I have already indicated the one I put my name to relating to one house at the Rath in Swords for a decent young couple who have been living there happily ever since.  As to Mr. Bailey bringing Mr. Gogarty to see me, I never met Mr. Gogarty before that occasion or, to my knowledge, since that occasion.  He never had occasion to come back to me.  I did not write <Col N="634" /> a letter.  Mr. Gogarty wished me well as he went out and I thanked him for the subscription. Everybody has a different way of running a campaign. I did not write to say thanks.  Perhaps I should have, but I did not.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I have two simple questions.  Did the Minister ever canvass any elected member of the former Dublin County Council to vote for land rezonings or material contraventions which would redound to the benefit of JMSE, Bovale, or the principals of those companies or people close to them?</P>
      <P>When the Minister found that the amount donated was £30,000, which at the time would have been roughly three years' wages for an ordinary worker, did he not feel that he could be heavily compromised and heavily indebted to that company which might subsequently come to him for a favour in securing planning permission or something that would be of monetary or other value to them and which his position as a senior politician might allow him to obtain on their behalf?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the first point, the answer is no.  Not only did I not canvass in relation to it, I have already outlined in my opening statement my position in relation to it &mdash; that all members of local authorities have onerous duties and have to make decisions in relation to development plans and other planning matters, some of which will be controversial.  However, I was not a member of the council.  I did not lobby. Not only did I not lobby, I actively opposed what it was doing, publicly at meetings, privately within our party organisation and in leading a delegation to the Minister for the Environment at the time asking him not to approve a plan that had been approved by the council.  As to being compromised by the £30,000, I was not compromised.  I did not feel in any way compromised and I do not now feel compromised in relation to it.</P>

      <P>Why did the Minister not refer to the £10,000 bank draft to Fianna F·il headquarters in his initial statement?  Since this matter has been the subject of rumours for more than two years, why did he not make a comment before now, particularly when the good name of another Member of the House was being vilified as a result of a rumour that originated in the environs of the House, but not by a Member of it?  For two or three months of the summer of 1995 another Member of the House was commonly believed to be the person associated with the Neary business from Newry.  As the Minister firmly believes there is nothing improper about this matter, did it not occur to the him to make a statement at any stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer to the £10,000 contribution to Fianna F·il headquarters in my original statement because it was referred to one month earlier by the Taoiseach in response to a question on the matter.  As he had already dealt with the matter I felt it would be impertinent to refer to it again.</P>
      <P>As another long-term Member of the House, Deputy Rabbitte should be well aware of the political arena and the media circus that can take place.  When the Neary controversy arose it did not dawn on me that I was the person involved because I was not a member of the council at that time.  It was only later as stories continued to run that I realised I was at the centre of a storm.  As to why I chose not to respond, in the terminology to which we are all familiar, I did not want to give oxygen to the story.  However, it continued to run and after the general election my name was dragged into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed at some of the appalling things that were being said about me and my father.  I appeal to Members to bear with me so that I can clarify a matter that deserves clarification.  My father was a Member of the House from 1944 until 1973.  He served the House loyally for 29 <Col N="637" /> years.  I still meet people all over the country who admired, respected and had great affection for him.  He served in this House with many current Members or their fathers.  In Cork last Sunday, at the Liam Lynch memorial, I met many people who spoke kindly of him.  On 18 February 1996 the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> featured an article about me, written by Mr. Frank Connolly in his usual complimentary terms.  I mention this article because I was asked why I did not go back to the media.  Mr. Connolly wrote:</P>
    <P>The land on which his house is built was originally purchased by Burke's father Paddy, who bought it from an inmate of the mental hospital in Portrane, Co. Dublin.</P>
    <P>My father worked as a nurse in the hospital in Portrane until the mid-1950s.  He had come from a humble background in the west of Ireland &mdash; I am proud of his background as I am proud of mine.  The assertion in that article was a complete and utter lie.  I did not take an action against the newspaper because I have never taken one since I entered this House despite the things they have said about me.  I have with me the Land Registry documentation relating to my home which clearly shows that, far from being bought from a hospital patient under his care, the house and site was transferred to me and I bought it in a normal commercial transaction from Oldpark Developments Limited.  The house was built in the normal commercial manner.  I was doing business with that company.  That transaction, along with others, was the subject of a Garda investigation in 1974.  I did not so much resent the attacks on myself &mdash; in this business one learns to live with them although they do not get easier.  However, I am glad to have the opportunity on behalf of my family and my father, who died in 1985, to clarify the record in that regard.</P>
    <P>As to why I felt I should not make statements, I shall give another example of the type of journalism which, thankfully, is followed only by a minute number among that profession.  I ask the House to bear with me and if Members want another five or ten minutes I do not mind, because I wish to give another example of what I have endured in recent times.  I received a letter from <i>The Sunday Times</i> on Thursday, 31 July 1997, which read:</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Burke,</P>
    <P>As you are aware there have been a number of stories in the media in recent weeks about your relationship with Bovale Developments and other matters.  These stories, in turn, seem to be the culmination of a lengthy series of smears about you, but not by name.  We are interested in setting out clearly and unambiguously the position in relation to all this as there seems to be considerable confusion at this stage.  We propose talking to you off the record about this.  You can be absolutely assured that any conversation will be treated as being in the <Col N="638" /> strictest confidence.  [There followed some phone numbers.]</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Rory Godson,</P>
    <P>Ireland Editor</P>
    <P>There was no suggestion in that letter that there would be a major article about me on the following Sunday.  That article was headlined &ldquo;Firms gave £80,000 to Burke'&rdquo; and stated: &ldquo;Burke was not available for comment yesterday&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In that first letter I was addressed as &ldquo;Mr. Burke&rdquo;.  Last week, on Wednesday, 3 September, I received a personal letter from Mr. Godson. Despite claiming in his article that I received £80,000, which was a total fabrication, I was addressed as his good friend &ldquo;Ray&rdquo;.  The letter reads:</P>
    <P>Dear Ray,</P>
    <P>I would like to talk to you for a few minutes about James Gogarty, etc.  As you know I missed you on the week you went on holidays, despite valiant attempts by you to get back to me.  We could meet on a private basis for a confidential chat, which would enable <i>The Sunday Times</i> to print an informed assessment of the current situation ahead of next week's D·il debate.  [He proceeded to give me his home phone number among others and out of respect for his family I will not read them.]</P>
    <P>Best wishes,</P>
    <P>Rory Godson</P>

    <P>The article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> stated that I &ldquo;was not available for comment&rdquo; while the letter of 3 September mentions &ldquo;valiant attempts by you to get back to me&rdquo;.  This is, at the least, unethical journalism.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been restored to the Order Paper <Col N="639" /> having been prepared by the last Government and presented to the House on l May.  I compliment my predecessor, Deputy John Bruton, and the former Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, SC, for the very careful and detailed consideration they gave to the preparation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Fianna F·il general election manifesto gave a commitment to consider the holding of a referendum on Cabinet confidentiality in conjunction with this year's presidential election.  The Progressive Democrats' manifesto gave a commitment to ensure that the absolute ban on disclosure of Cabinet discussions can be lifted where disclosure is clearly in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I am glad, on behalf of the Government, to propose this Bill to the House.  The text of the proposed constitutional amendment set out in the Bill provides that the absolute confidentiality which applies to Government discussions will be relaxed in particular and exceptional circumstances. It proposes that a new provision should be inserted into the Constitution after Article 28.4.2∫.  This Article provides for collective Cabinet responsibility.  The new provision will ensure that the confidentiality of Cabinet discussions will continue to have constitutional protection except where the High Court determines that disclosure should be made in the interest of the administration of justice as decided by a court, or by virtue of an overriding public interest pursuant to an application in that behalf by a tribunal appointed to inquire into a matter of public importance.  This may be a necessary prelude to any investigation by a tribunal which is mandated in respect of issues on which it is necessary to seek evidence in relation to discussions at Government meetings.  The Government is proposing the immediate passage of the Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas so as to facilitate the proposal being put to the people by way of a referendum on 30 October next, the date envisaged for the presidential election.</P>
    <P>The tribunal of inquiry into the beef processing industry, conducted over an extended period, brought to notice a shortcoming in the existing constitutional framework.  The desire of the tribunal to inquire into the proceedings of Government meetings was precluded by a majority ruling of the Supreme Court.  The variety of judicial rulings delivered at that time illustrates the complexity of the issue and the sensitivity of the balance to be achieved.  The need for confidentiality in general affairs is fundamental to Government and will not be disputed.  Nonetheless, there is a simultaneous consensus on the need to permit a focused and structured inquiry, as necessary, in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I will give Deputies some of the background to this Bill.  At an early stage in the conduct of the tribunal of inquiry into the beef processing industry the chairman indicated an intention to ask questions concerning the details of discussions which took place at Government meetings in <Col N="640" /> June 1988 relating to decisions on export credit insurance for beef exported to Iraq.  Counsel on behalf of the Attorney General objected to the asking of those questions on constitutional grounds.  The chairman then deferred asking any questions, although he made a ruling that he was entitled to ask them in order to give the Attorney General an opportunity of applying to the High Court by way of judicial review for resolution of the issues.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that witnesses at the tribunal did not refuse to answer questions relating to Government decisions.  Rather, it was not permissible for them to so do as they could be held to be acting contrary to the constitutional position.</P>
    <P>Following an earlier High Court case, the Supreme Court in its judgment of 21 August 1992 upheld, by a three to two majority, the Attorney General's contention in relation to the absolute confidentiality of Cabinet discussions.  Leading the majority, Chief Justice Finlay stated:</P>
    <P>Confidentiality of the contents and details of discussions at meetings of the Government is a constitutional right which, in my view, goes to the fundamental machinery of Government and is, therefore, not capable of being waived by any individual member of the Government nor, in my view, are the details and contents of discussions at meetings of the Government capable of being made public, for the purpose of this inquiry, by a decision of any succeeding Government.</P>
    <P>Deputies may recall that the courts had previously established in the Ambiorix case in July 1991 that no Government or Cabinet documents were privileged from disclosure in court merely on account of their origin.  Documents which the Government wanted to protect on grounds of Executive privilege would have to be inspected by the judge who would balance the need for secrecy against the interests of the litigant and the public in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Supreme Court ruling, the report of the tribunal noted that it was limited in its inquiries to decisions made by the Government and documentation in regard to such decisions and was precluded from inquiring into &ldquo;the contents and details of discussions at meetings of the Government&rdquo;.  The report stated that the ruling created difficulties for the tribunal because documentation relating to discussions at Government had been received by the tribunal, some of which was referred to in evidence, prior to the judgment of the Supreme Court and the tribunal was precluded from having regard to it.</P>
    <P>The Constitution Review Group, chaired by Dr. T.K. Whitaker, dealt briefly with the matter in its report published in May 1996.  The group concluded there were strong grounds for extreme caution in any approach to relaxation of the Cabinet confidentiality rule.  It noted:</P>
    <P>.that such confidentiality is an almost universal feature of Government and the essential underpinning for the doctrine of collective <Col N="641" /> responsibility enshrined in Article 28.4.2.  Collective responsibility is, in turn, essential to a Government's ability to plan and act cohesively. The possibility that Cabinet confidentiality might in some circumstances be lifted could in itself, obviously, inhibit discussion and, therefore, the effectiveness of Government.</P>
    <P>The group considered two approaches:</P>
    <P>1.  any relaxation should be subject to the most stringent test of public interest, as judged by the High Court or Supreme Court, and should be confined to the context of a criminal prosecution against a Member, or former Member, of the Government (as is the case in the United States and Australia)</P>
    <P>2.  the context, specified at 1, could be unduly restrictive and it might be better to express any constitutional relaxation in less specific terms while still applying the test of overriding public interest as determined by the High Court or Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The group also stressed that the rule of Cabinet confidentiality does not apply to Government decisions which are formally recorded &mdash; their communication to those concerned establishes them as items of public knowledge.  That is the legal history attaching to this issue.</P>
    <P>The previous Government undertook an extensive examination of the complex issues involved in proposing a constitutional amendment to change the position defined by the Supreme Court.  It must be acknowledged that some of these issues were not easy to resolve.  The doctrine of collective responsibility is underpinned in an important way by preserving the confidentiality of Cabinet discussions.  The potential disclosure by an individual member of the Government of these discussions in a particular case at some future time could have an inhibiting effect on free discussion at Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Collective responsibility of Government, and thereby the requirement for confidentiality in respect of Government discussions, is a common feature throughout Europe.  It is important that we do not lose sight of the need for that standard to continue as we move to consider some specific circumstances in which it might be altered.  Such confidentiality has been an element in the political stability we have enjoyed over many years.</P>
    <P>I believe that the proposals agreed by the last Government are reasonable, given the complexities involved.  They are, in many ways, an advance on the manner in which the Cabinet confidentiality issue is dealt with in other jurisdictions. Many EU states operate a much more restrictive arrangement on access to Cabinet discussions than what is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the courts established as far back as 1991 that no Government documents were privileged from disclosure in court just because of their origin.  Any documents which the Government seeks to protect have to be inspected by a judge of the High Court.  With <Col N="642" /> the limited exception, therefore, of some documents which the Government might seek to protect on grounds, say, of national security, Government decisions which are formally recorded and the memoranda on which they are based are made available for court proceedings where there is <i>bona fide</i> application for their discovery.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise this as there may be some misconception about it.  The Bill before the House relates solely to discussions at Cabinet. Documents prepared for Cabinet and Cabinet decisions are already discoverable and made available under the current constitutional provisions. The draft constitutional amendment before the House provides that, while Cabinet discussions will continue to have constitutional protection, the High Court will have the power to determine disclosure in certain instances by virtue of an overriding public interest.  I am confident that the people, in a referendum, will respond positively to the proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>The all-party committee on the Constitution published two excellent progress reports last April.  Neither dealt with the Cabinet confidentiality issue as the committee had been informed on its establishment that it was the subject of consideration by the then Government.  I compliment the members of the committee and the members of the Constitution Review Group on their excellent work.  I also compliment the secretariat provided to the committee by the Institute of Public Administration.  Having regard to the all-party consensus on the re-establishment of the committee, immediately on assuming office I retained the services of the secretariat to continue necessary research work.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is now 60 years in operation. It has stood the test of time very well but, as we move into the next millennium, it is timely that it should be reviewed.  I propose to consult the Opposition leaders very shortly about the early re-establishment of the all-party committee and I look forward to its reports.  I assure Deputies that the Government will give careful consideration to the recommendations in the first two progress reports from that committee and decisions in that regard will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  I have already thanked my predecessor and the Attorney General for their work on this Bill. They struck a balance and I am prepared to work on the basis of what they put forward.  I have not reopened the entire debate on this matter but I am taking the Bill based on the considered work which has already been done on the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides a constitutional bridge between two major principles. The first principle is Cabinet confidentiality and the second is the proper administration of justice. Article 28 of the Constitution provides that the Government shall meet and act as a collective authority and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government.  It is obvious and <Col N="643" /> accepted that Cabinet confidentiality essentially underpins the doctrine of Cabinet responsibility. The second major principle is that justice must be done, and be seen to be done, properly and fairly and that tribunals of inquiry can carry out their work fully and effectively.</P>
      <P>It is correct that these principles came into conflict during the beef tribunal.  The majority decision of the Supreme Court at the time resulted in the chairman of the tribunal indicating that, as a consequence, it was limited in its inquiries. The decision created difficulties for the tribunal because documents relating to Government discussions which were before it could not be referred to thereafter.  There is a need to preserve as far as possible Cabinet confidentiality but there is also a need for the proper administration of justice before the courts and during tribunals of inquiry.  It is obvious that a consequence of the Supreme Court decision, which provided for absolute confidentiality, was that the work of the courts and tribunals of inquiry could in certain circumstances be affected and limited.</P>
      <P>This position gave rise to the Bill, which I support. It is a balanced response to the conflict between two major principles and values and it conforms to a large degree to the views of the Constitution Review Group.  It was not considered in detail by the group but it was touched on.  The import of its recommendations was that any relaxation of the rule of Cabinet confidentiality must be carried out with great caution.  The Bill is sensible given the experience of other countries where a position close to absolute confidentiality is the norm.  In the main, governments work on the basis of collective responsibility underpinned by Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
      <P>Another tribunal of inquiry is likely and all Members want to ensure that it can do its job as fully, properly and effectively as possible.  We want to ensure that whatever judge is charged with responsibility for the tribunal is not inhibited or limited in terms of the scope of his or her inquiries in producing a full and proper report to the House.  This is another reason I favour the Bill.  I am happy it is before the House and that there is agreement regarding its passage.</P>
      <P>One could strain at the edges and say that perhaps one should lean a little more in favour of greater disclosure.  However, the more one leans to one side, the more the principle on the other side is damaged.  There are different views on this aspect but I am cautious in terms of the Constitution which in the main has served us well for 60 years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> Given my experience as chairman of the all-party committee, we should work on the basis of what currently exists.  We should build on it and reform it.  We should not in any circumstances throw out the baby with the bath water.  A programme of constitutional reform is needed but it should be cautious.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a balanced and cautious response to the 1992 Supreme Court decision and I support it.  It could be dangerous to go beyond the terms of the Bill.  It was the collective wisdom of the last Government, endorsed by the collective wisdom of this Government &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should be a little careful about making such a comment.  I accept the detailed considerations of the previous Government and Attorney General have been followed up promptly by the current Government and the new Attorney General.  I endorse the Bill and support its passage through the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill will go before the Seanad before it is put before the people in conjunction with the presidential election.  I approve of this approach. The Taoiseach referred in kind terms to the work of the Constitution Review Group.  One of its proposals was that a programme of constitutional reform should be established and that a series of measures should be put before the people from time to time in conjunction with local or European elections to reduce expense.  The approach to this legislation fits in with that philosophy given that the Taoiseach has proposed that the Bill should be put before the people in conjunction with the presidential election, thus saving the expense of a separate referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach will continue that approach.  I am glad to note his undertaking that he will follow up the two reports of the all-party committee.  It is important to note that the committee worked almost on the basis of consensus and many of its recommendations have the support of all parties.  When the committee last met before the election, it decided that the next item to be considered was the Presidency and the procedures for nominations, etc.  Obviously, that work has been left in abeyance.  It is in the public interest that the committee be reformed quickly and further work should get under way.  There is a strong case for accepting the Bill as a reasoned, balanced response to the situation and it is important that it pass quickly.  The judge charged with the next tribunal should have powers to <Col N="645" /> obtain the necessary order to open up Cabinet discussions if required in the public interest.  We are trying to achieve what is best for the public interest and on that basis I am happy to endorse this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill amends the Constitution, which is fundamental and bears upon every citizen. On 29 August, Deputy Dick Spring issued the following statement:</P>
      <P>It appears that the Government is contemplating passing motions about a tribunal next week but they have said absolutely nothing about Cabinet confidentiality.  A failure to act in relation to Cabinet confidentiality will almost certainly tie the hands of any future tribunal inquiring into recent Government decisions.  It is shameful if the Government has chosen to ignore this issue, especially as there is plenty of time to pass the necessary legislation to enable a referendum to take place on the same day as the proposed Presidential election. The wording has already been largely drafted and the Labour Party will be insisting in the D·il that it is passed before any new tribunal is set up.</P>
      <P>I am happy the Government has responded to that request and has today retabled the Bill first published on 1 May.</P>
      <P>Enactment of this Bill as well as a referendum to endorse it and amend the Constitution is urgently required in the aftermath of the McCracken Tribunal and in advance of the new tribunal getting down to the important task the House will set it.  This issue has to be addressed in a focused and balanced way.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe talked at some length about the requirement for balance in this type of amendment. The Constitution Review Group recognised that the doctrine of collective responsibility which is the basis of our form of Government requires some measure of confidentiality in the matter of Cabinet discussion.  That is acknowledged, appreciated and supported by every parliamentarian in the House.  However, our society and democracy requires as much openness and transparency for the operation of Government as can be obtained.  Our purpose in advocating this amendment to the Constitution is to try, to the best of our abilities, to meet both requirements, which apparently conflict, and to get the balance right.</P>
      <P>I remember the debate on this matter, though obviously I am not at liberty to share it with the House.  I have reflected further since the publication of the Bill.  It is my party's objective to push the barrier as far as we can on the side of disclosure and openness.  Perhaps I have a different perspective because I do not come from a legal background, but there is growing frustration among the general public that issues of Government are not visible and are somehow hidden behind a veil of secrecy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last portfolio I held in Government, I <Col N="646" /> freed up access to information on the environment, planning reports and studies.  There was a great deal of concern that would have an impact on the content of reports, if those reports were subsequently to be in the public domain, but it was done and nothing changed.  We must change the way we look at administration because secrecy does not help our democracy.  We must be as open as possible unless there is an overwhelming and compelling reason that information should not be available.</P>
    <P>That is the perspective from which I now look, afresh, at this Bill.  For that reason the Labour Party has tabled amendments to the Schedule, which contains the substance of the change to be made to the Constitution.  The objective of those amendments is to allow for a slight extension of the cases of disclosure of Cabinet discussion beyond that envisaged by the Bill as published.  I will deal with these amendments on Committee Stage and hope the Taoiseach will be open to the arguments I will put forward.  It is a matter of judgment, of getting the balance right between giving as much access and openness as is possible to all citizens and ensuring that the Government is allowed to function.  A situation might arise where people might be circumscribed in what they say if they felt that all the discussion material would be open.</P>
    <P>I will argue the specific amendments when we get to them but they strike a reasonable balance and will allow us to proceed further down the road to openness.  In my experience of the Taoiseach I know he will be well disposed to at least listen to the arguments and I hope he will be convinced by them.</P>
    <P>This is an important amendment to the Constitution in an extensive process of work to be done. As leader of the Government, the Taoiseach has a responsibility to deal with the general negative feeling toward politics and politicians that is evident in recent opinion polls.  We must collectively restore confidence in our profession, in this House and in its membership.  We will do that by shining as many lights as we can into all the crevices and recesses that people want to look into.</P>
    <P>We are in special session for two days.  Virtually the entire text of all the measures coming before the House in these two days resonates with the same principle: the need, demand and requirement to restore confidence in public administration.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the Bill.  I acknowledge the swiftness of the response of the Government to the call from the leader of the Labour Party.  The Government retabled the Bill drafted by its predecessor and I look forward to supporting it with slight amendments, if I can convince the Taoiseach to accept them.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Government on introducing this legislation. The precise text before the House was submitted to us shortly before the dissolution of the last D·il.  Although I raised the matter on the <Col N="647" /> Order of Business with the then Taoiseach on a number of occasions, there seemed to be a delay in bringing forward the measure.  When the previous Administration took office, it was determined to address the question of Cabinet confidentiality. That Administration was uniformly critical of the decision of the Supreme Court in the decision involving the beef tribunal, the Attorney General and Mr. Justice Hamilton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not, but when the matter was considered in some detail it became clear that this was not a simple issue and that it raises deep questions about the proper relationship between the Executive and the Legislature under our Constitution.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said, the principle, as elaborated by the Supreme Court, related to Cabinet discussions, not Cabinet documentation.  It is always open to the Government to make an announcement and to make clear its recorded decisions but it is not open to it or its members to &ldquo;leak&rdquo;, to use the old fashioned phrase.</P>
      <P>Many of the understandings about Cabinet Government which grew up under the British experience were formalised as legal rules in our Constitution.  That made a difference because British practice rested on convention and precedent and whether it was in order for a Minister to make a statement.  When we put this into the Constitution in 1937 it elevated the principle in legal terms.  While all the Constitution says in express terms is that the Government should be collectively responsible to this House, the Supreme Court read into it, as a matter of legal principle, the important implication of Cabinet confidentiality in the case involving the beef tribunal.</P>
      <P>At the time the Supreme Court left open the question of whether that principle would apply in an ordinary civil or criminal case.  In fact, the Supreme Court never ruled on that issue.  By this amendment, we are leaving it to the courts to determine, in an appropriate circumstance, whether the veil of Cabinet confidentiality can be ripped aside in a case where criminal culpability or civil liability would be an issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the relationship between this House and the Government, the key issue is the tribunals of inquiry which we have become fond of establishing in recent years.  The amendment is a necessary preparation for the next tribunal in that it allows it and presumably future tribunals to lift the veil of Cabinet confidentiality.  We hear calls to establish tribunals and, when we bring forward this amendment, it will mean that in future we must be careful about establishing a tribunal which might look at Cabinet discussions.  An allegation should not give rise to a tribunal because we are about to change the Constitution in a manner which would allow a tribunal of inquiry established by this House to look at Cabinet discussions. <Col N="648" /> There must be some element of Cabinet confidentiality attaching to Cabinet discussions.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I will not table an amendment but I ask the Taoiseach to look at the question of memoirs, the position of a Minister who resigns from Government and the 20 year rule and whether those issues arise in relation to this measure.  I appreciate he may have to take constitutional advice from the Attorney General on this point and he may prefer to address it in another House, but the issue should be looked at.</P>
    <P>In 1951 a few months before the first interparty Government collapsed, Dr. Browne had a disagreement with his colleagues and decided to publish the correspondence and bring his dispute to the nation and not have it limited to the Cabinet room.  It was always recognised in the history, practice and conventions attaching to Cabinet confidentiality that a Minister who wished to resign from a Government had the right to make his appeal on his resignation.</P>
    <P>It has always been the view that a retired politician is entitled to publish his memoirs, although there was an attempt in England by the then Attorney General to restrain the publication of the Crossland diaries.  It is a question which arises.  One can argue that a person who has served in Government, such as Deputy Howlin, is entitled to publish his memoirs without any form of censorship in relation to Cabinet discussions so that he can vindicate his reputation for posterity.</P>
    <P>The other position relates to the release of information about the Cabinet after a period of time which may be of value to scholars, although they suggest that sometimes Cabinet minutes are a bit terse.  It is an issue which may arise.  If any of these issues is to be addressed, I suggest it would be best to leave this matter to the Oireachtas to determine at a future date rather than try to amend this Bill amending the Constitution. We should stick to first principles as far as the Constitution is concerned.</P>
    <P>This amendment conforms in concise terms to first principles and deals with the essential issue, balancing the need to protect the confidentiality of the Government with the need to ensure proper investigations can take place if authorised by the House and that the courts are not impeded in their investigations by this principle.  It is a balanced amendment but I would like the Taoiseach to look at the issues I mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left, I welcome the decision to hold a referendum and the fact that this Bill is being taken today.  We were partners in the last Government which published the Bill and due recognition should be given to that by Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I am thankful this Government has decided to adopt the course of action we set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to address the outcome of what was an extraordinary intervention by the then Attorney General in the work of the beef tribunal.  The Attorney General sought and obtained from the Supreme Court a ruling that it <Col N="649" /> was unconstitutional for the tribunal to inquire into Cabinet discussions.  We would do well to remember that this action was taken at a time when Fianna F·il was also in Government and when that Government made a public commitment to co-operate fully with Mr. Justice Hamilton in his investigations.  The Attorney General's action, however, ensured that full co-operation would not be possible.  In fact, the Supreme Court decision was a serious blow to the effectiveness of the tribunal.  In its report Mr. Justice Hamilton pointed out that he was precluded from inquiring into and reporting on the factors which influenced the Government in reaching decisions on Iraq.</P>
    <P>This decision overruled a High Court decision of Mr. Justice Rory O'Hanlon.  It is worth recalling his approach on this.  He rejected the Attorney General's argument and pointed out that it was not unknown for totally corrupt administrations to come to power and for their members to enrich themselves at the expense of the public purse.  Had he known what we now know, he might have also included a reference to enrichment from private sources.  Justice O'Hanlon clearly considered the result of accepting the Attorney General's arguments would be to prevent any tribunal of inquiry from obtaining the information needed to establish guilt or innocence. That is history and the Supreme Court overruled him.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court's decision had fundamental implications for the public's right to know. The public has a right to know in the public good how and why decisions which affect their lives are being made.  That is a fundamental right which must be protected.  Clearly, an absolute ban on disclosure of information undermines that right. It is vital that we redress this failing in our Constitution and that we offer the people the opportunity to do so at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>In doing so, we should not forget the genesis of this Bill.  Historically, the practice was not to exert an absolute ban in all cases and at all times and it was legal action that was clearly taken with the tacit agreement of the Government in 1992 which ensured this ruling was made &mdash; the effect of that was to significantly restrict the right of protection to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Fianna F·il is again in Government and another tribunal is being established.  The lesson is that we must always be vigilant.  I listened with interest to Deputy Howlin's proposals regarding improvements to the Bill.  We need to ensure that it is not too restrictive and that it is not leaning too far on the side of caution.  I expect the Government will consider the amendments if they can improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe said we should be cautious when looking at the Constitution and ensure we do not throw out the baby with the bath water. However, I have a different approach.  The Constitution is no longer able to meet the requirements of modern Ireland.  Perhaps the baby has <Col N="650" /> become an adult and it is time to take the adult out of the bath.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Five minutes to speak on a significant amendment to the Constitution is scarcely adequate.  I am disturbed by this Bill and the manner of its passage.  It is far too restrictive and will cause at least as many problems as it purports to solve.  We may see a repeat of the 1983 situation where a second and third referendum were necessary to undo the damage done by the initial amendment.  Hasty passage of a constitutional amendment Bill seems undesirable in principle.</P>
      <P>The majority decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the Attorney General <i>v.</i> Hamilton has been widely criticised and makes little sense.  It is significant that four of the seven superior court judges who dealt with this matter came to the opposite conclusion.  Mr. Justice O'Hanlon and Mr. Justice McCarthy expressed their views in a far more trenchant and convincing manner than the arguments used in the majority decision.</P>
      <P>Only two occasions are provided for in this amendment where it will not be possible to invoke absolute Cabinet confidentiality.  Both are on the direction of the High Court and relate to court proceedings or tribunals of inquiry.  It is totally undesirable that every other instance is excluded, such as a Minister talking to his civil servants, including the Secretary of his Department. This is ridiculous.  I was a Minister for 13 years and I know it is usual to speak with the Secretary.  Will this now be illegal?  Frequently it is necessary to speak with a number of civil servants about matters discussed at Cabinet.  This is perfectly proper but the current proposal will make it illegal.</P>
      <P>I am in the unusual position of having resigned, for good reason, on two occasions from Government. I know the procedure and the trauma occasioned by this.  At present there is an absolute right for a Minister to explain to the House why he resigned from Cabinet.  However, what is now proposed will preclude him from doing so. This is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a tradition in Britain and less so here that former Ministers write their memoirs.  Two were written here in recent years by former Deputies Garret FitzGerald and Gemma Hussey.  Both quote extensively from what was said and done at Cabinet meetings.  In Britain, almost every former Minister writes his or her memoirs, quoting extensively from Cabinet discussions.  Bona fide students of history need to know what discussions take place in Cabinet but now they will not be able to find out.  The National Archives should, but does not, contain all documents relating to Cabinet decisions more than 30 years old. However, in December 1992 the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, overruled the National Archives when it announced that it would have to exclude all papers relating to Cabinet discussions. It was overruled because it was ridiculous. There is no time limit on the current proposal. In 100 years' time historians will be unable <Col N="651" /> to access Cabinet discussions if this measure stands as part of the Constitution.  If passed the measure will presumably apply to all Cabinet discussions since 1921.  Documents already in the public arena will have to be withdrawn.  The measure does not make sense and it should be thought through more fully.</P>
    <P>The Bill would be immeasurably improved by acceptance of the Labour Party amendments which I have seen in draft.  If not, the gist of the amendments will have to be enacted in the future by means of another referendum.  I know there is a perceived hurry about this because of the desire to have the referendum on the same day as the presidential election.  Why not delay the referendum until the referendum on the Amsterdam treaty to be held in 1998?  A few months will not make a great difference.  It would be better to get it right.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by citing the late Mr. Justice McCarthy in the conclusion to his judgment.  He said:</P>
    <P>There is no absolute confidentiality attached to discussions of Government meetings.  Such absolute confidentiality would be inconsistent with the decisions of this court in the Murphy and Ambiorix cases.  Such absolute confidentiality would prevent or impede inquiry into allegations of corruption or crime.  The correct test is that applied by O'Hanlon, J. in balancing the requirements of a parliamentary inquiry with the requirements of confidential communications at Government level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It represents a cross-party consensus with some modifications and qualifications such as those expressed by Deputy O'Malley.  It is clear that there is good and sufficient reason for inserting into our Constitution the collective responsibility of Government.  The Government acts as a unit and it is important, therefore, that any disclosure of Government discussions by an individual be contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, which clearly defines the separation of powers.  I realise we have reservations on occasion, but because of their important role under Bunreacht na h…ireann it is important we vindicate the independent function of the courts, particularly in relation to interpretation of the Constitution and whether laws passed by the Oireachtas are in accordance with it.  I have no reservations about the legislation before the House.  However, there appears to be a degree of confusion &mdash; not on the part of the current or previous Governments &mdash; about the circumstances of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in his speech, said that as a result of the Supreme Court ruling the report of the tribunal noted it was limited in its inquiries to decisions made by the Government and documentation on such decisions and it was precluded from inquiring into the contents and details of discussions at Government meetings.  That terminology <Col N="652" /> did not preclude the tribunal from commenting on decisions which were not made by the Government.  It cannot be a breach of Cabinet confidentiality to say that decisions were not made by the Government on a particular issue. That would simply be to record a matter of fact.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand Mr. Justice Hamilton's finding that he felt precluded from indicating there was no evidence before the tribunal of a decision having been taken.  Apparently what was at issue was whether the Government of the day had ever decided to give specific and special preference to one or two companies in respect of the export credit insurance scheme. Without breaching Cabinet confidentiality I feel entirely free to say that no such decision was ever taken by the Government.  To say that a decision to do something was not taken by the Government is not a breach of Cabinet confidentiality.  It was open to Mr. Justice Hamilton to say that in so far as the records of Government decisions were made available to him, he found no evidence of any decision having been taken by that Government to give special preference to one or two companies in the application of the Export Credit Insurance Bill.  Even before the introduction of this Bill, no Member of the House was precluded from saying that a decision was not taken.  There are so many issues on which a Government does not decide it is evident that one should be free to say the Government did not decide an issue.  For that reason, I find it regrettable the Supreme Court did not make it very clear that members of the Government who made themselves available to the tribunal were not precluded from saying whether a decision was taken.  I regret we were not given that opportunity and the implications of that did nothing to clarify the position.  I totally agree with the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have been privileged to serve in a number of Governments.  The purpose of Government is effective, collective solidarity, underpinned by confidentiality.  A regrettable pattern has arisen over the years since the early days of the Governments which succeeded the adoption of Bunreacht na h…ireann.  Sources are quoted by journalists and people are encouraged to feed information to them in the hope of winning favour or close association with journalists.  This should be resisted by every member of Government as it is very regrettable and contrary to the Constitution.  In the interests of all Governments it is very important that such practices should be resisted.  This pattern tends to give rise to comment in the media about differences and divisions in Government.  That is not in the interest of the body politic, neither is it in the interest of Cabinet solidarity and confidentiality.  In view of the interpretation of the Supreme Court decision I welcome the introduction of this Bill but had it not been introduced, a member of any Government would not be precluded from saying the Government did not decide to do something.  This Bill responds to the understandable need for the <Col N="653" /> Oireachtas to co-operate fully with tribunals established by it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their interesting comments during the debate. Although only a small number of us contributed to the debate, there were very different views expressed.  I acknowledge the contribution of the former Taoiseach and of the Attorney General in the preparation of the Bill and I also thank Deputy Howlin and the others who worked on the committee for constitutional reform.  I am conscious of the amount of work which went into the Bill.</P>
      <P>When I examined this issue in July, I quickly came to the conclusion &mdash; having spoken to my officials and others &mdash; that the whole debate should be opened up again and that all of the arguments should be examined.  Without divulging any view, I can say there will be plenty of argument in the Cabinet and in the respective Government parties on this issue.  We have heard from two seasoned Members of the House, Deputies O'Malley and O'Kennedy, who have probably served in excess of 20 years in office between them.  They have very different views on the issue.</P>
      <P>My preference is to move along the route proposed by Deputy Howlin.  However, I am obliged to give the opinion of the Government which is that the issue should be moved forward quickly and a referendum held as soon as possible.  I do not want to take from what I am sure are excellently drafted amendments, nor do I have any difficulty in listening to the arguments, but a balance has to reached.  Deputy Howlin is aware of the arguments on this issue and they were carefully considered.  Mr. Gleeson, whose legal capacities I hold in high regard, favoured this approach. Deputy O'Malley is probably correct in saying this issue will be further addressed on a future occasion and people may then have swung back to Deputy O'Kennedy's view that this is a dangerous route to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When changes were made over the years in various areas, we tended to fear the worst but it rarely happened and we moved on.  I have read Mr. Justice Finlay's judgment &mdash; and I have great regard for Mr. Justice Finlay and the many fine judgments he has given over the years &mdash; but I would not like to see the day when 15 Ministers at the Cabinet table would take detailed minutes so that they could say at some future inquiry that they, and not just the Secretary of Government, have notes of a particular Cabinet meeting.  That would result in contradictory views being expressed.  Over the past 20 years in this House I have watched colleagues differ on various issues, and that happens in all parties.  Deputy O'Kennedy's argument is that those who framed this legislation did so from a Cabinet confidentiality point of view, and that we cannot get away from that.  It was my judgment, however, that we should move quickly on this issue, having regard to the enormous effort that was put into the preparation of <Col N="654" /> the Bill.  Regardless of what happens in the future, this is a step forward.  If I were to go back on that decision it would open up the whole debate again and it would be a considerable time before we could proceed.  I wanted this legislation to be ready in time for the forthcoming tribunal.</P>
    <P>The issue of the civil servants has been discussed and I do not believe that is a difficulty. Ministers are not precluded from giving the content of what happened but they cannot say what an individual said.  It is not as restricted, therefore, as Deputy O'Malley suggested.  I have no doubt we will return to some of the issues raised. The Bill before the House is the result of a great deal of effort &mdash; I understand two dozen drafts of one form or another were prepared &mdash; and if I were to open up for discussion some of the issues raised we would not have this legislation available for the forthcoming tribunal.  I ask the House to accept the Bill in its present form which I hope will be of considerable benefit, despite the views expressed by some speakers.</P>

    <P>The Taoiseach's heart was not in the argument he made.  It is not a good practice, on such a fundamental issue, not to enact the best legislation. I understand the pressures of time &mdash; the Opposition parties contributed to the pressure in ensuring we had this measure before us &mdash; but it is important that we amend the Cabinet confidentiality rule before the next tribunal gets into the meat of its work.  For that reason I am anxious that we meet the timeframe of having the referendum in conjunction with the presidential election. We must get this right.</P>
    <P>I am circumscribed by what I say about debates that took place previously, certainly around the Cabinet table, but it is important that we are bold on this issue.  On a number of issues of extreme importance to this House and to this country in recent years, there has been a legal opinion and a political opinion.  Too often the legal opinion won out over the political opinion, where the political opinion is much closer to the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>I understand the innate caution attached to any amendment to the Constitution, but making an amendment to the Constitution that makes little difference &mdash; and this amendment does not make a significant difference &mdash; is not an acceptable way to proceed when we have the facility to go further and allow for all the anomalies that have been listed not only by me but by seasoned, able Deputies on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to add the phrase &ldquo;except in such limited cases as may be prescribed by law,&rdquo;.  It would allow for the Legislature to spell out those limited circumstances where there is a logic attached to the right to know.  I do not pretend to have an exhaustive list but a number of areas have occurred to me.  We have heard about the important issue of a Minister resigning from Government and being able to make a statement to the House as to the circumstances surrounding that resignation.  It is normal procedure for Ministers to have an opportunity to explain the important reasons they walked away from Government.  We have had examples of that over the years in this House. Deputy O'Malley said he twice resigned from Government and he has a right to explain for his own integrity, as does every other Member, the circumstances surrounding that.</P>
    <P>Another distinguished lawyer, the former Deputy Michael McDowell, somebody for whom the Taoiseach would have great respect, said in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 25 August 1992 that it would be grotesque to require a Minister to remain silent in a situation like that.  We cannot impose such a blanket restriction on people in that set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>The issue of memoirs has been raised.  Are we <Col N="656" /> not to have any memoirs that touch on Cabinet decisions, the dynamic of Government?  There are many other areas, for example, documents released under the National Archives Act.  There is no public interest in keeping confidential Cabinet discussions which took place decades ago if they are recorded in Cabinet documents released under the National Archives Act.  My amendment would provide flexibility for those to go into the public domain.</P>
    <P>It is contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights to restrain the publication of details of discussions which are already in the public domain.  On 26 November l991 the European Court of Human Rights ruled in the case of <i>Observer</i> and <i>Guardian v.</i>  the United Kingdom that restraining a breach of confidence after the material concerned had already been published was contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights.  My amendment would allow flexibility for us to comply with the spirit and letter of the European Convention.</P>
    <P>In regard to the disclosure of discussions in accordance with the interests of public service, the Taoiseach said it was in order to give the gist of a discussion to senior civil servants.  However, there are other circumstances where it would be necessary for the administration of Cabinet decisions and the carrying out of instructions for a detailed briefing to be given to civil servants, advisers or others who work with Government.</P>
    <P>These are a few of the circumstances which go beyond the very circumscribed provisions in the Bill.  This is the most important amendment tabled by me and I ask that it be accepted so that we allow that extra degree of flexibility.  We can then take the time to very carefully craft the governing legislation, taking on board the experience of all the seasoned campaigners in the House in formulating a new Bill, subsequent to the enactment of the amendment to the Constitution by the people, to cover all these clear anomalies which will remain unless this amendment is accepted.  I ask the Taoiseach for once to assert the political and overrule the legal advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  It is very important that we do not end up failing in our duty to improve this amendment to the Constitution. This is a very important matter and perhaps there should be more deliberation on it before we finalise this debate.  The insertion of this additional clause would allow for future possibilities.  If we do not accept this amendment there is a danger that we will end up with a very restrictive Bill which does not allow for the possibilities which have already been outlined and which may need to be debated in the future.  We know that the pace of life is very fast and change is occurring all the time.  We, therefore, need to ensure that the Bill provides for future possibilities. I strongly recommend that this amendment be accepted.</P>

      <P>I am very much in sympathy with Deputy O'Malley's point that imposing time constraints on the debate on an issue as important as this is probably not the best way to proceed.  It is evident from the observations made that there is an understandable concern about what one might term the normal effective administration of a Department by a Minister or, as Deputy Howlin said, the need for personal vindication by a former Minister who has resigned from Government. Deputy Howlin put this well when he asked the Taoiseach to assert the political and overrule the legal.  I understand precisely the point he was making.  Most of the participants in this debate have had the privilege of serving in Government. While I understand the motivation and bona fides behind the Deputy's amendment, I wish to register what I hope will be regarded as well-based reservations.</P>
      <P>As I understand the Constitution, a person who has retired from Government &mdash; I presume it is always on a matter of principle &mdash; is not prevented from saying, &ldquo;I retired from Government because I did not agree with a decision of the Government on a very important matter&rdquo;.  I do not understand how that would be a breach of collective Cabinet confidentiality as a decision of the Government will be promulgated and a former Minister will be free to state clearly the reasons he or she retired.  I appreciate that this is an important matter of principle for an individual member.</P>
      <P>I do not believe I am wrong in that interpretation, any more than I was wrong in my first statement that even before the introduction of this Bill there was nothing to prevent anyone who was in Government from saying, &ldquo;The Government did not decide to give special benefits to two beef companies&rdquo;.  That would not be a breach of Cabinet confidentiality.  I take the same view in relation to this matter but I wish to balance it.</P>
      <P>If there is to be a balance of advantage, so to speak, between the constraints imposed on a former member of Government in vindicating his or her position of integrity and maintaining the effective role of Government I would come down very strongly in favour of securing the effective role of Cabinet confidentiality.  There is no doubt that government imposes very severe constraints on members.  This is very different from Opposition where Members may act as a cohesive political group but where all of them can outline their positions and the only test is whether they are in harmony.  However, even that is not a constitutional test.  The Constitution refers to the Government and Judiciary, not parties, and for that reason this is a different issue.  Parties which find themselves on the opposite side of the House for the time being have a freedom which does not reside with parties on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every time Fianna F·il is elected to Government I believe all is right with the world and the correct party is in power.  When other parties are elected to Government they have the same convictions &mdash; they believe everything is right with <Col N="658" /> the world, the Lord is in heaven and the correct Government is in office.  As those of us who have been in this business for some time know, the only constant in all of this is change, which is the real essence of democracy.  The understandable concern of individuals to vindicate themselves should not be given preference over collective Government action.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley made a point about a Minister being constrained in regard to the consultations and discussions he or she can have with the Secretary of the Department on return from a Cabinet meeting, which is an important part of effective Government action.  I do not believe that constraint exists now.  If Government decisions are to be implemented, they must be communicated to the Secretary of the Department. That is standard routine practice.  Unless the Minister concerned is imprudent or foolish, he or she will ensure on return from a Cabinet meeting that a Cabinet decision will be recorded by the secretariat and the Cabinet minute confirming that decision will be issued later.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture and Food brings a proposal to Government and having considered it, the Government states it is not happy about aspects of it and asks the Minister to bring it back to the Department, there is no constraint on the Minister returning to the Department and stating the Government wants it to reconsider the proposal and submit a new one.  That has often been required to be done.  I am not persuaded by the argument that this provision will impinge negatively on the effective relationship between a Minister representing Government in collective solidarity and the secretariat of his Department. There is an old maxim which applies in law, <i>omnia presumunter rita esse acta,</i> all things are presumed to have been done properly.  That is the presumption that applies, but it can be upset.  It does not impinge on Cabinet confidentiality if a Minister returns from a Cabinet meeting to the Department and states that the Government requested that certain action be taken.  That happens all the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my conviction.  I know the motivation behind the Deputy's amendment which states that &ldquo;Except in such limited cases as may be prescribed by law,&rdquo;.  We are moving into a delicate and sensitive area.  Under our Constitution the separation of powers is very definitely inserted.  The Judiciary is described as an institution of Government because it has a role in the overall governmental function.  I argued the point strongly with members of a former Government when discussing amendments that if detail such as the words &ldquo;save in accordance with what may be decided by law&rdquo; were inserted in the Constitution, we would invite the type of trouble we wished to avoid.  It would imply that the Oireachtas takes precedence over the Constitution and over the judicial function.  There is that risk.  I know that is not the intention of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Houses of the Oireachtas were to decide to pass a measure that would have that effect, without knowing its precise impact, I suggest there is a risk that we would be moving outside our area of authority into another area.  The courts have a specific independent function to guard the implementation of the Constitution.  If there was anything in the Bill that prevented a Minister from coming back to his Department and saying a proposal is not acceptable to the Government and needs to be amended, I would take a view on this, but I do not believe that is the case.</P>
      <P>Some of us may find it uncomfortable that once in a while we may not be able to say what we would like to say, but that is the price we pay for the privilege of serving the Government of this nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My heart responds to Deputy Howlin's plea.  Unfortunately when we are dealing with law and, in particular, constitutional legislation I must respond with my head in the same way I presume Deputy Howlin responded with his head when he was Minister and considered this matter in the previous Government. One can respond to a plea to let in the light but there is a duty on all of us to be careful and cautious about what we put into the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As of now because of the Supreme Court decision Cabinet confidentiality is absolute.  I did not agree with that decision but the Supreme Court is charged under the Constitution with interpreting the Constitution and they have laid that down.  We are starting from that point and are moving to relax that rule.  The issue is how far <Col N="660" /> it should be relaxed.  It is in that context I made the point about the baby and the bath water.</P>
    <P>It has not been easy to come up with a formula. We are talking about something that is not written in the Constitution which makes it more difficult. Cabinet confidentiality is not expressed in the Constitution but is implied as a consequence of the collective responsibility referred to in Article 28.4.  We have an interpretation of absolute confidentiality as something that is implied as a consequence of the collective responsibility set down in Article 28.4.</P>
    <P>A commitment was given in the rainbow Government's policy document, A Government of Renewal, and even in that there was a degree of caution.  It stated that the principle of the confidentiality of Cabinet discussions, which is important in maintaining collective responsibility, will be maintained as the normal rule.  That was the starting point for the process of change.  That commitment was made in December 1994.  In November 1995 major constitutional, legal and administrative issues were still being considered by the group charged with dealing with this issue. This is not a simple matter.  The first amendment essentially removes the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality.  If one includes, as is suggested by Deputy Howlin, &ldquo;Except in such limited cases as may be prescribed by law&rdquo;, effectively the Oireachtas can override the principle at any time.  I am not sure what the definition of &ldquo;limited&rdquo; is.  The Oireachtas could prescribe many areas where Cabinet confidentiality would not apply and the rule would be set aside.</P>

      <P>If this amendment is accepted, that constitutional shield could be removed.  That is a major step and should not be taken without grave consideration.  It was not provided for in the Bill which took two years to draft following detailed discussions.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 proposes that Cabinet confidentiality would apply &ldquo;unless waived by or in accordance with a decision of the Government&rdquo;. The problem is that the Government is a corporate body.  Could this Government provide a waiver of decisions or discussions of the last Government?  What would that lead to?  I accept that in constitutional matters I am a cautious conservative.</P>

      <P>I am all for a programme of reform.  I was chairman of the committee which recommended 30 or 40 changes, all of which were <Col N="661" /> carefully considered.  One does not rush into change without due consideration.  The points raised by Deputy Howlin are worthy of due consideration. I am prepared to give them such consideration and tease out the consequences.  It would be crazy and dangerous to rush into a judgment immediately and accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>I reject Deputy O'Malley's suggestion that this Bill be postponed for another year so it can be given fuller consideration.  We need it in place, as it is, for the upcoming tribunal.  I do not want that tribunal limited so it cannot obtain the necessary order to make full inquiries in the public interest. There should be no question of rushing it through but it has been in gestation for a number of years and has been considered by both Governments. In that context, I would be happy to see the Bill passed as it stands although in normal circumstances I would like to give it more detailed consideration.</P>
      <P>The points raised by Deputy Howlin are worthy of careful consideration.  Those of us who are interested in these matters would be happy to tease out the legal, constitutional and administrative aspects of these amendments.  This would require much time, research and procurement of advice.  This issue was mentioned as being under consideration by the Government although it was not given any consideration by the all-party committee to review the Constitution.  I hope the committee will be reconstituted shortly and the issues raised by Deputy Howlin could be profitably examined by it with a view, if necessary, to making further recommendations.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, as regards the relaxation of the existing absolute rule and the upcoming tribunal, this Bill should be passed as it stands.  I make that recommendation to Deputy Howlin and Deputy McManus who is also keen to follow his line.  I hope she is a member of the next committee, <i>in lieu</i> of her excellent former colleague who made a great contribution to the previous one.  These issues should be considered further at the all-party committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity we seem to have reached an impasse.  I gather it is not intended to accept any amendments and obviously Fine Gael agrees with the Government on this.  The matter might as well be a case study in what transpired previously.  It is ridiculous that we cannot even talk about that and what discussions took place at respective Cabinets.  It is unreal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently looked at some of the operations of the Israeli Cabinet, not that it is to be held up as perfect but votes taken at their Cabinet meetings are provided as well as the views expressed. Other Governments, quite sensibly, take a very different view to ours.  We have an obsession with secrecy, which is a purely British phenomenon.  In Brussels it is thought we and the British are crazy, out of line with the rest of the world and the sooner we realise that the better.  In Ireland, the <Col N="662" /> public service, politicians and the courts are obsessed with secrecy and the importance of it.</P>
    <P>What is important here is not so much Cabinet confidentiality as the whole culture of secrecy. Letting some light in is regarded as the wrong approach.  We will have to grow up and the sooner we realise the British manner of conducting matters is not necessarily the best or only way, the better.  It is amusing that frequently the British have jettisoned their own traditions to their benefit.  Slavishly, we have not.  We are like a post-colonial country which thinks that what was done in Westminster in the 19th century must be the best thing for all time.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy takes great exception to the phrase &ldquo;Except in such limited cases as may be prescribed by law&rdquo;.  He says this would give the Oireachtas freedom to change the Constitution, which only the people should do.  The phrase mentioned by the Deputy features prominently in the Constitution, if he cares to examine it.  I can think of several instances, perhaps the most important of which is the administration of justice.  In certain limited cases, the administration of justice is allowed by a body other than a court.  This has never given rise to any great problems.  Our Constitution is littered with this phrase.  It would be unworkable if this type of phrase and system was not used widely.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy harked back to the time when apparently there was a dispute as to whether favouritism was shown to a particular beef producer at a Cabinet meeting.  He said that because the Government records did not show that such a decision was taken, then one can say that decision was not made.  What is important is what was proposed.  The tribunal wanted to find out who wanted what, why and for whom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to get the final decision.  What is significant, however, is what led up to it, why it was made and who wanted it made or not made, as the case may be.  That is what was at issue at that time in the beef tribunal.</P>
      <P>As well as the instances I gave in the brief speech I made on Second Stage, there are others that would be anomalous if this Bill were passed. The Government could not set aside this rule, nor could the D·il, even though Article 28.4.1∫ of the Constitution states the Government shall be answerable to the D·il.  It will not be exclusively answerable to the D·il and the people, it will also be answerable to the High Court under the proposed subsection (3).</P>
      <P>There is a major question about whether lawyers or elected people should make the ultimate decisions.  The spirit of the Constitution is that those who are elected, and therefore answerable to the people, should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong that the Government in its wisdom cannot set aside this rule, or that the D·il cannot force it to set it aside if the D·il so thinks fit.  If this discussion had taken place 20 or 30 years ago <Col N="663" /> it might be regarded as academic.  When this debate concludes, we will come to an item on today's Order Paper which suggests that Mr. Justice O'Hanlon's and Mr. Justice McCarthy's fears about many of these matters concerning discussions at Cabinet could well be justified.  It could happen.  We can consider that in more detail under the next item.</P>
    <P>If it became necessary in the investigation of an offence or a possible offence by a member of the Government, for the Garda to make inquiries relating to what happened at a meeting, they are also precluded.  This is because Part II of the Schedule to the Bill states that the exception will apply only &ldquo;in the interests of the administration of justice by a court&rdquo;.  The case must be before the court.  It must be brought that far before one can apply to the High Court to set it aside.  The Garda will be inhibited in making inquiries.</P>
    <P>In his judgment, Mr. Justice O'Hanlon went on at some length about the possibility of corruption in a Cabinet.  We cannot say he was wrong in raising such a possibility but that cannot be investigated by the Garda, at least to the extent of talking to other members of the Cabinet and asking them what went on there.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>The point can be met by this amendment which states: &ldquo;except in such limited cases as may be prescribed by law&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; is used already in the Constitution and is easily recognisable and defined.  I have given six or seven instances which can be covered because they are specific, limited cases.  One can still maintain the principle of Cabinet confidentiality without making the matter ridiculous.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, overruled this principle when he directed the National Archives to publish documents that included discussions at Cabinet. Everyone at the time said he was right and that it was common sense.  If he was right then, why is it not right to do it now, particularly when they are over 30 years old?  Why could common sense apply in 1992 but not in 1997?</P>
    <P>If this was an ordinary Bill I would not be that worried about it because one could amend it in three or six months' time if these problems began to arise.  With the Constitution, however, one cannot do that.  Deputy O'Keeffe tells me I am wrong to want to wait a few months but I am not wrong. It is much better to get it right.  Would we not all have been better off if things had been got right in 1983&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Taoiseach. Deputy O'Kennedy made a strong case on the precedents for discussion between Ministers and their Secretaries when Ministers came back after a decision.  There is probably some validity in that point.  However, we are now proposing a change in the Constitution and all existing precedents are nullified by the words in this amendment &ldquo;respected in all circumstances save only&rdquo; which we propose to put into the Constitution.</P>
      <P>There is no use in Deputy O'Kennedy talking about precedents and saying that we will do it anyway.  We must frame laws, and particularly the Constitution, in a very clear way.  This restriction is too great.  If it were challenged it would circumscribe the relationship between a Cabinet Minister and his or her most senior civil servants in relation to the imparting of knowledge.  It would be nonsensical, in the instance that Deputy O'Kennedy gave, if a proposal from a Government Department for a Minister was ordered to be amended by Government.  The rationale for the instruction of Government would have to be explained and &ldquo;respected in all circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy also objected to the term &ldquo;except in such limited cases as may be prescribed by law&rdquo;, which is the wording of my first amendment.  Deputy O'Malley accurately and rightly said that is simply lifted from the Constitution in so many other cases.  The Constitution repeatedly gives the Oireachtas the power to set <Col N="665" /> limitations in a legal framework.  I also make this point about the provision for the courts for the benefit of the learned Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  Justice must be administered in public save in such limited circumstances and &ldquo;cases as may be prescribed by law&rdquo;.  That is already in the Constitution so there is nothing new or ground breaking in using that phrase in this context as well.</P>
    <P>It is important to make this amendment and I believe the Taoiseach is well disposed to it.  It is not something we can revisit, although Deputy Jim O'Keeffe said we might do so.  It would be nonsense to revisit the same sections of the Constitution. We should not put a proposal to the people if we are not convinced the form of words in this Schedule is right.  There is every danger the people will read the record of this debate, the trenchant criticisms by Deputy O'Malley and others and the reservations put forward by those proposing it and then tell us to get the form of words right because this is the basic law of the land.</P>
    <P>I have made my case on amendment No. 1 which is sensible.  Amendment No. 2 allows the Government to waive confidentiality.  Confidentiality is the right of Government and there could be circumstances in the normal course of business where that right could be waived.  I am not as wedded to that amendment as to amendment No. 1.  People might feel that giving the right to waive confidentiality to a succeeding Government could cause political difficulties.  However, my experience is that succeeding Governments, particularly some Ministers, need no such constitutional provision to put a construction on the actions of their predecessors.  We do not have to look too hard to find examples of that.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 states &ldquo;in page 6, line 14, to delete &ldquo;in all circumstances save only&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;save&rdquo;.  The purpose of this amendment is to remove the statement that the two listed exceptions to confidentiality are the only exceptions to be permitted.  We have listed all the cases which should be looked at coldly and calmly in a legislative framework.  We have had this debate so often about other issues, but I trust the Oireachtas to do this.</P>
    <P>There is a growing body of professional practising politicians who are fed up that people do not trust them.  It is not long since the people had their say and we are their elected representatives. We should not undermine politicians by implying we must put a ball and chain on them because they might do something mad or daft which would run counter to the views of the people who elect them.  My experience is that politicians are extremely well attuned to the views of the people who send them here and they do not take mad or daft actions.</P>
    <P>I ask that these three amendments, particularly amendment No. 1, be considered because it is important to ensure we have a sound provision to put to the people so that we do not have to revisit it in one or two months' time when they would <Col N="666" /> have every right to ask us why we could not get it right when they first voted on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is the most important of these three amendments.  I ask the Taoiseach to remember the reason we are here today and the traumatic events which have occurred here.  This is the most significant day I have experienced since entering the D·il.  It is important that the public has confidence in the Constitution.  This is not the most important amendment on which the people will be asked to vote.  The Constitution is an important part of people's lives and this amendment must be the best one possible.  There is much rhetoric about openness and accountability but it cannot be measured until it is tested.  This is one such test for the Government.  The Government must live up to this test if the confidence building process is to be successful in the long run.  Small steps will make the difference.</P>
      <P>This is essentially an enabling provision which does not force the Oireachtas to impose anything on anyone.  It allows this body of elected people to recognise situations which require legislation. Amendment No. 1 must be accepted by the Government and by the Fine Gael Party to improve the constitutional amendment, to maintain its tightness and focus and to give the protections which we all recognise must be given.</P>

Some may be opposed to the issue while others may take a different view.  The previous Attorney General and the Government tried to strike a balance and to move things forward in a spirit of openness.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McManus that perhaps the argument about openness is brought to ridiculous conclusions, but I am equally convinced that people believe change is good.

      <P>It would not have made any difference.  People would not have been able to derive anything from the discussions at the time. However, that might not always be the case. When I first entered the D·il, the view was that any Cabinet memorandum or decision should not be seen; we are now talking about Cabinet discussions. I am not sure about the logical conclusion. Sometimes one must read the weekend <Col N="667" /> newspapers to know what happened at the Cabinet meeting.</P>

      <P>Sometimes they are right but sometimes they are wrong.  It is often possible to get more detailed accounts from newspapers than from Government memoranda.  That is the position and I do not think we should come to the view that all of this will change anything.  To Deputy O'Keeffe I say if there was no tribunal, I would have taken the view of allowing an extended debate on this issue but it is important that we have this tribunal.  Deputy Howlin told us why he believes that to be the case and I do not think this particular waiver will in any way affect the position.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 1, to permit exceptions to the rule of confidentiality of Cabinet discussions would undermine the entire concept.  Cabinet confidentiality derives from the collective responsibility provision in the Constitution.  To enable exceptions to be drawn up by way of legislative measures would undermine the constitutional protection envisaged by the measure before us and the intended role of the High Court.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 would create inconsistency and confusion in the new constitutional provision. A Government and the High Court could decide to waive Cabinet confidentiality.  The whole purpose of the previous Government's amendment was to take a decision out of the realm of political controversy and give it to the High Court.  Deputy Howlin will be aware that the Supreme Court in the 1992 judgment determined that a succeeding Government cannot waive the privilege which a previous Government enjoyed in relation to Cabinet discussions.  Consideration was given to the question of giving sole power to the Government to waive the confidentiality of Cabinet discussions, past and present.  However, since the Government of the day would continually come under pressure to waive the rule in relation to its own discussions, it would also be open to accusations of political opportunism if it were to decide that the confidentiality attaching to a previous administration's discussions should be waived.  That is a fair argument.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 would dilute the emphasis placed on the need to respect the confidentiality of Cabinet discussions in all circumstances.  The emphasis is considerably reduced by the amendment.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 4, the existing wording &ldquo;tribunal appointed by the Government or a Minister of the Government&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Deputy's <Col N="668" /> argument on amendment No. 4.  I will do the Deputy the courtesy of letting him explain it.</P>
      <P>Much of what Deputy O'Malley said today was interesting but I do not agree with him when he said that we cannot return to these things as they progress.  I would side with Deputy O'Keeffe, because we continually return to them.  We are also engaged in a review of the Constitution and I mentioned the good work which has taken place.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Howlin's point, Deputy O'Keeffe felt rightly proud that the committee he chaired excellently managed to do many things by consensus. The very point he made was that we, as politicians, can make sound judgments on what we can and cannot do.  The one benefit of the committee system as opposed to the normal adversarial atmosphere of the House is that we can reflect on these issues and bring forward what are considered to be sensible amendments.</P>
      <P>I hope that, with the passage of this Bill, the referendum, another tribunal and the legislation I hope to introduce either later in the year or next year on how we should do business in the future, the provision of rules and procedures which we can follow following the sad lessons of the past for colleagues, will mean people will know the rules in future.  My only difficulty, as a Deputy rather than as Taoiseach, is to understand how some of those rules fall on Deputies and what precisely we must do.  When in Opposition I called for clarity and I do so again in Government. We must be clear on this.  In fairness to Members, that on which we are judged must be understood in a non-legal way.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendments for the above reasons.  There is merit in continuing to examine these matters and others about closeness which affect us, and I certainly have no difficulty in doing so.  We can come to understandings on an all-party basis on a number of those issues.  I would be willing to have the Government's Members on that committee join in examining this.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Justice McCracken is to be complimented on his excellent report and on the manner in which he willingly undertook and carried out the onerous task assigned to him.  The tribunal into certain allegations of payments to politicians was established <Col N="673" /> last February, consequent on resolutions passed by D·il …ireann and Seanad …ireann on 6 February 1997.  I welcomed it; indeed, I had sought it.  I also welcomed the appointment of Mr. Justice McCracken as chairman and spoke of his expertise in commercial law and in unravelling complex accounts, as well as his reputation for getting to the bottom of these matters in a short time.  Mr. Justice McCracken has brought all these attributes to bear on his task during recent months and a debt of gratitude is owed to him by all of us.  It is also appropriate that we commend, as he does in his report, the work of the team, both legal and administrative, which assisted him so efficiently in his work.</P>
    <P>The report of the tribunal is a model of clarity and conciseness, and we must come to terms with the starkness of its contents.  Its judgment, on what it has discovered, is trenchant, but in the circumstances appropriate.  The tribunal stresses a point I have repeatedly emphasised, that public representatives must not be under a personal financial obligation to anyone.  We are not dealing with legitimate political contributions here.  While I felt a deep sense of relief on reading in the report that the tribunal had concluded that &ldquo;no political impropriety&rdquo;, or, in other words, no actual corruption, had been shown to have occurred within its terms of reference, the findings of the tribunal in relation to Mr. Charles Haughey and Deputy Michael Lowry are nevertheless extremely disturbing.</P>
    <P>Let me outline in particular what I, and I believe all of us, and indeed the tribunal find unacceptable.  It is unacceptable that people who have held high office and enjoyed a high degree of public trust should give evidence that is &ldquo;unacceptable and untrue&rdquo;, or deliberately conceal vital information from this House or from a tribunal established by this House.  There is no excuse for this.  It is also unacceptable that in the case of Mr. Haughey full co-operation was with-held from the tribunal forcing it to undertake lengthy, painstaking and costly research to establish facts, which could have been established almost at once with his full co-operation.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that in a manner hitherto concealed from the public a Taoiseach should be personally supported to the tune of £1.3 million. It is appalling that any businessman should be able to believe, even if wrongly, that he could in any sense &ldquo;buy&rdquo; the Taoiseach, or that he might have him in his pocket, if he ever needed him.  By accepting such favours, Mr. Haughey thereby laid himself open to the possibility &ldquo;that political or financial favours could be sought in return for such gifts, or even be given without being sought&rdquo;, even though thankfully this did not occur.  As the tribunal stated, &ldquo;if such gifts were to be permissible, the potential for bribery and corruption would be enormous&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the case of Deputy Lowry, who received several hundred thousand pounds in cash or in kind, the tribunal comments that he &ldquo;made himself vulnerable to all kinds of pressures from Dunne's <Col N="674" /> Stores, had they chosen to apply those pressures&rdquo;, and that indeed he would be open to blackmail from other sources.</P>
    <P>There is also an issue of equity of access, that has arisen in the general context of political contributions. As the tribunal puts it, &lsquo;if politicians are to give an effective service to all their constituents, or to all the citizens of the State, they must not be under a financial obligation to some constituents or some citizens only&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>Taoisigh and Ministers often have the duty to urge on the nation or on particular groups income restraint, and to warn that we all have to live within our means, but we should not require of others what we are not prepared to practise ourselves. Otherwise, we only encourage deep cynicism and a resistance to the notion that moderation can be in the long-term interests of all.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that the people, who decide upon the laws, and especially those in Government who have to set an example for others, should engage in placing their money outside the jurisdiction in offshore accounts, not merely for the purpose of concealment from the public but in a way that lends itself to wholesale tax evasion. To avail of the tax amnesty, while politically condemning it and flouting its obligations, is particularly reprehensible.  Paying tax is not something just for &lsquo;the little people&rsquo;.  No one, however eminent, is above the law.  Tax evasion is a form of stealing from the public purse, which pays for schools, hospitals and many other social services. The amnesty was an opportunity for full and voluntary restitution.  If our tax system is too onerous, then it must be changed for all, not bypassed by a few with access to offshore accounts and resourceful accountants.</P>
    <P>We must make it clear in this House by our actions that we are going to insist on the highest standards in public life.  It would be very dangerous, if the message were ever to go out, either here or abroad, however ill-founded, that Government here operates on the principle of backhanders, or that there are golden circles with a high entrance fee.  We must nip that notion in the bud once and for all.</P>
    <P>The disgrace now being suffered by a former Taoiseach and a former Minister should be a solemn warning to any aspiring Deputy or any other elected representative to stick to the rules we make and by which others are required to abide. I accept the criticism that too permissive a culture has been allowed to develop, particularly during the past 30 years.  While some may have been more outspoken in pointing out the dangers than others, can any party point to an entirely blameless record?  The responsibility and the corrective action should be undertaken collectively.  I am glad to say that the legislation we passed in the last D·il went a considerable distance towards closing off possible avenues of abuse.  We must find new more transparent and acceptable ways of raising necessary political funding from our supporters and well-wishers without making <Col N="675" /> further calls on the taxpayer and without allowing a privileged few to create a sense of obligation.</P>
    <P>I naturally and sincerely regret the damage to the reputations of those most directly concerned. Deputy Lowry did much good work for his constituency of Tipperary North, for which, despite everything else, the people there are still grateful, and some good work as an office-holder. However, as a new Minister he made the fatal mistake of preaching to others about cleaning out &ldquo;cosy cartels&rdquo; and implying that innocent third parties were in some way guilty of improper behaviour.  Keeping offshore accounts, except where they are necessary or convenient for legitimate transactions abroad, is not my idea of patriotism or public duty.  The question does arise as to what standards we expect of those who sit in this House, and whether the House has adequate sanctions in respect of unacceptable behaviour. We may need to put in place, on an all-party basis, tighter rules for continued membership of this House.</P>
    <P>The record of Charles Haughey is well-known.</P>
    <P>Parts of it, independent of anything related to this report, will always be controversial.  However, in many important areas, valuable service by someone of immense ability will be recalled.  For the positive things that he did he will always be held in high regard by many people.  None of us will disagree with the verdict of the tribunal that &ldquo;by allowing himself to be put in a position of dependency&rdquo;, Mr. Haughey &ldquo;has devalued some of the undoubtedly valuable work which he did when in office&rdquo;.  It is inevitable, unfortunately, that his achievements will now be seen or set off against what we have learned from the tribunal.  I find that very sad for an individual that many of us know well and have honoured and admired.  Nor is it just sad for the party he led or for his former colleagues in Government who sought to serve the public under his leadership.  It is sad for our democracy and our nation that a leader who, after Lemass, put more of his stamp on the Ireland of the second half of the 20th century than possibly anyone else should have demeaned himself and political life by accepting such huge sums of money for his personal benefit from Ben Dunne.</P>
    <P>There are some who wish to damn the entire Fianna F·il Party by association and all the numerous honest and public spirited members who are proud to belong to the organisation. However, I am no more responsible for the misdemeanours of Charles Haughey than Deputies John Bruton, Dick Spring or Proinsias De Rossa are responsible for the misdemeanours of their colleague in Government, Deputy Michael Lowry, or would be for any other colleague who departed from politically acceptable norms of behaviour.  All of us took Government decisions on the basis of the best information available to us at the time, on the political judgment of colleagues whom we trusted and in our view of the country's best interest.  That is the view of <Col N="676" /> Members on all sides of the House whenever decisions are made.  If there was any hidden manipulation from motives of private gain, which has not so far been demonstrated, then none of us was aware of it at the time.</P>
    <P>Why were we not more aware that something was untoward?  In most walks of life, particularly with colleagues who have made a substantial income previously from a successful business or professional partnership, we respect their privacy and do not pry into their personal financial circumstances. Perhaps we were at fault for not asking more questions, though that is never an easy thing to do given our instinctive respect for each other's privacy.</P>
    <P>That charge is levelled primarily against Fianna F·il, even though Charles Haughey's leadership was more contested than any other.  In the state of knowledge that we then had, his strong points had to be weighed against known flaws and honourable people took different sides of the argument.  In that there was no conduct unbecoming. However, one could equally ask if Deputy Lowry's senior colleagues or his leader ever wondered at his facility in procuring substantial contributions both for the party and for themselves individually from Ben Dunne.  It is easy to be wise in hindsight.</P>
    <P>Politicians do not always appreciate the critical attentions of the media, to put it mildly.  The media can sometimes seem to be unfair, particularly when they try to judge yesterday's actions by today's rules and standards, or when they single out an individual for persistent and unwarranted attack, but it is right to pay tribute to those in the media who exposed the state of affairs brought before the tribunal or who previously questioned it.  The Fourth Estate &mdash; a free press &mdash; is vital to democracy.  We, as politicians, are entitled to argue with people from the media where we think they are wrong and to defend our integrity and reputation where needs be.  The price of freedom is eternal vigilance and the only issue in regard to the matters before the tribunal is whether there was enough vigilance and how we can in future ensure adequate vigilance.</P>
    <P>It is our job to do everything in our power to restore public confidence in the political system. However, before looking forward it is necessary first to clear up the past.  Answers are needed on essential points.  I am not interested in hounding people to death, in witch hunts, or in scape-goating one or two individuals for faults in society as a whole.  We have important problems, long-term unemployment and social exclusion, peace in the North and economic and monetary union to focus on.  To the extent that the tribunal and related matters are impediments to concentrating on the central business of Government, we need to sort these matters out expeditiously without recourse to endless tribunals.  We need to do the job properly, and not to have to keep coming back to it.</P>
    <P>In the light of the report of the Dunnes payments tribunal, the evidence which was given <Col N="677" /> before it and the limitations placed on it by its terms of reference, there seem to be reasonable grounds to investigate whether other payments were made which fell outside the terms of reference of the Dunnes payments tribunal.  Accordingly, there is a motion before the House seeking the establishment of a new tribunal to investigate whether any payments were made to Mr. Haughey in the period from the beginning of 1979, and Mr. Lowry, while they held ministerial or public office and whether such payments influenced any decisions made by them in an official capacity.  The terms of reference of the new tribunal are geared towards following the &ldquo;money trail&rdquo; rather than examining particular allegations concerning specific public, ministerial or Government decisions, so that we do not unnecessarily drag in innocent third parties or, on the other hand, omit decisions that may turn out to have been tainted.</P>
    <P>The Government considers that following the money trail is the most efficient and effective way to progress this type of inquiry as witnessed by the great success of the Dunnes payments tribunal which adopted this approach.  Any relevant decisions can be examined in the light of that. The tribunal will be required to ascertain whether there were substantial payments, who the donors were, how much was involved, when they were made, whether any of the controversial decisions were made at that time involving that donor and whether, as a consequence, the tribunal believes that either Mr. Haughey or Deputy Lowry did any act or made any decision to confer any benefit on that specific donor in respect of that particular transaction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring has raised the issue of the party leader's allowance during Fianna F·il's period in Opposition.  In so far as I could with little available records I am satisfied, having spoken to the person who administered the account, that it was used for bona fide party purposes, that the cheques were prepared by that person and countersigned by another senior party member.  Their purpose was to finance personnel, press and other normal supports for an Opposition leader.  There was no surplus and no misappropriation.  The person involved had sole control of the account.  The money came in, the person lodged the cheque, dealt with the bills and invoices and paid those not covered by the ordinary allowance.  The account as far as her excellent recollection goes was normally short, not the other way around.  I have spoken to her at some length.  She has served many Taoisigh beginning with Mr. Jack Lynch.  We consider her to be totally honourable.</P>
    <P>The motion also provides for the further investigation of the so-called Ansbacher accounts to ascertain if any funds were held there by or for the benefit of any other holder of ministerial or other public office.  I remind the House in this regard that Mr. Justice McCracken has yet to decide whether the tribunal should proceed with its appeal against the ruling of the Grand Court in the Cayman Islands concerning these accounts. <Col N="678" /> I have already stated that it is the Government's desire that the appeal should proceed, but I acknowledge that this is a decision solely for the tribunal.  I assure the House that any resources which are required by the tribunal to proceed with the appeal, should it decide to do so, will be made available.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Ansbacher accounts relate to private citizens, the Revenue Commissioners have the powers to pursue inquiries and will no doubt take into account in a more general way the picture presented and lessons learnt as a result of the tribunal.  Large-scale tax evasion must be vigorously pursued, and those who engage in it must realise that if caught they face the possibility not just of severe penalties but diminished public standing and even public disgrace in the eyes of their fellow citizens, no matter how prominent they may be.  No one is too powerful or wealthy to be investigated.  It is appropriate at this time to refer to the Government proposals for legislation on Cabinet confidentiality that have been put to the House and will be the subject of a referendum on 30 October 1997.  These include relaxation of the rule of absolute confidentiality of Cabinet discussions where the High Court determines that disclosure should be made in the interests of the administration of justice or by virtue of an overriding public interest pursuant to an application by a tribunal appointed to inquire into a matter of public importance as a necessary prelude to any investigation by a tribunal which is mandated in respect of issues on which it is necessary to seek evidence in relation to discussion at Government meetings.</P>
    <P>In regard to the future, I have often stated my determination that financial probity should be strictly observed by all our elected representatives. The public is entitled to have an absolute guarantee of the financial probity and integrity of their elected representatives, officials and, above all, Ministers.  It is a core value which I am sure is shared by all in this House that participation in the democratic life of this country is about public service alone.</P>
    <P>It is important to draw attention again to these basic principles which must underpin our democracy. It is in this context that the report of the tribunal must be considered.  To ensure these principles of good public service are rigidly adhered to, neither I nor the Government I lead will shirk from taking any decisions necessary on foot of the tribunal report.  The aim must be to ensure mechanisms and structures are put in place so that the public can have full confidence in the manner in which public affairs are conducted from now on.  The undertaking contained in An Action Programme for the new Millennium published by the two parties in Government to implement the recommendations of the McCracken tribunal will be honoured quickly. We may indeed go beyond them.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specific recommendations made by Mr. Justice McCracken, on reflection and further consideration I agree with the tribunal <Col N="679" /> that it would be impractical and ineffective to seek to impose an obligation on accountants, bankers and other professionals in regard to certain transactions concerning politicians.</P>
    <P>The Government will consider the recommendations concerning extension of the powers of the Ombudsman to carry out investigations of breaches of ethics in public office.  The Government will also consider the implementation of the recommendation contained in the Report of the Constitution Review Group, May 1996, and endorsed by the all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in its first report, that a new Article should be inserted in the Constitution in relation to the Office of the Ombudsman.  Such a constitutional provision would confirm the establishment of the Office, providing for the independent exercise of such investigative and other functions of the Office as may be determined by law. A referendum on such a provision could best be held in conjunction with the referendum which will be necessary on the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Ombudsman, however, has much other work to attend to relating to the vindication of the rights of the individual citizen <i>vis-‡-vis</i> the State, and more debate is needed before we would decide to shift radically the public focus of his work.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that it should be mandatory for any candidate for either House of the Oireachtas to produce a certificate that his or her tax affairs are in order, accompanied by a statutory declaration to that effect.  As promised in the Government's action programme, we had been examining such a proposal, which we strongly support in principle.</P>
    <P>Government consideration will include reconciling the tribunal recommendation with the recommendation of the all-party committee on the Constitution in relation to the establishment of an electoral and ethics commission.  As the all-party committee states in its first report, a single commission, incorporating the Public Offices Commission, the Constituency Commission and a proposed independent referendum commission, under the Constitution would guarantee the independence and impartiality of the commission; generate greater confidence in public life; create greater transparency in public institutions; and provide an independent source of advice and information in the areas of ethics in public life and electoral law reform.</P>
    <P>The all-party report also makes the point that provision in the Constitution for such commission would provide a powerful constitutional mechanism to guarantee the probity of public life.  I personally believe such body is the best way for us to go, so that we have a permanent watchdog in place, with the necessary powers, which will develop a special expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate on the tribunal's report will provide an opportunity for these options to be discussed.  Subject to the outcome of the Attorney <Col N="680" /> General's examination of all these issues, the system which will be put in place will mean all allegations of impropriety by politicians or public servants will be dealt with in a comprehensive and transparent manner.</P>
    <P>Pending the introduction of substantive measures by the Government, I have instructed that the necessary amendments to the Ethics in Public Office Act be prepared for introduction in the House in the next session to implement with immediate effect the tribunal's recommendation in regard to the creation of a criminal offence for breaches of the legislation and the consequent barring of a convicted person from standing for subsequent election.</P>
    <P>Any decisions which will arise from Government consideration of the report will not prevent existing authorities such as the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Revenue Commissioners and the Comptroller and Auditor General from exercising their statutory powers as they deem necessary.  I remind the House that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has stated publicly that the proceedings of the tribunal had been monitored closely by Revenue and all appropriate action will be taken.  The Minister for Finance has also indicated that any additional investigative powers required by the Revenue Commissioners can be introduced.</P>
    <P>I now want to go through the legal rationale behind some of the terms of reference.  The purpose of paragraph (a) of the terms of reference is to capture &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; payments of cash either directly to Mr. Haughey or through some third party or parties in circumstances where, from the point of view of an objective observer, there may be an inference that the motive for making such a payment was in some way linked with the holding of ministerial or other public office by Mr. Haughey.  It goes further and captures substantial payments which, although not having the effect of influencing the discharge of ministerial or other public office, would still have the potential so to do.  In other words, it does not matter whether or not there was any cause or effect associated with the actual payments.  According to this term of reference, the tribunal does not have to look to see whether or not something was done in return for the payment but rather inquires into whether any payment was made at all.  It also permits the tribunal to inquire whether such payments were used to discharge moneys or debts due by Mr. Haughey or due by any company with which he was associated or by any person connected to Mr. Haughey.  A similar provision applies to Deputy Lowry.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; in relation to payment is not defined.  It was proposed that the word &ldquo;payment&rdquo; should not include moneys or any benefit in kind less than £500 in current money values.  However, it has been considered prudent to allow the tribunal itself to determine what is &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; without setting out any specific threshold.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> It has been said it should be included in any terms of reference that an inquiry should be undertaken as to the lifestyle of Mr. Haughey and the sources which sustained it.  The objection to this is that the concept of &ldquo;lifestyle&rdquo; is too nebulous and uncertain and would fall foul of the criterion set in the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1979 in that it lacks the characteristic of &ldquo;definite&rdquo;.  There is a risk that such a term of reference could be challenged in the courts as being <i>ultra vires</i> the legislation and as being too vague.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of the terms of reference captures the following class of bank accounts: (i) the Ansbacher deposits held for the benefit or in the name of Mr. Charles Haughey; (ii) the Ansbacher accounts held in the name or for the benefit of any person who holds or has held ministerial office; (iii) any other bank accounts that may be discovered by the tribunal in the name of or for the benefit of Mr. Haughey; (iv) any other bank accounts that may be discovered by the tribunal in the name of or for the benefit of a &ldquo;connected person&rdquo; to Mr. Haughey within the meaning of that term as it is defined in the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995; (v) any bank account discovered by the tribunal held in the name of or for the benefit of any company in which Mr. Haughey owns a majority shareholding or is a director or member of the board of directors of the company.</P>
    <P>This term of reference will enable the tribunal to inquire into the circumstances of the source of moneys paid into the above mentioned accounts. Presumably, these sources will be domestic and therefore it may not be necessary to seek evidence outside the jurisdiction, although this is merely supposition at this point.  The focus of inquiry is not who benefited from the payments but who paid moneys into the above mentioned class of accounts.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of the terms of reference enables the inquiry to be focused on the recipients of any payments from the bank accounts described in (b) above.  It is confined to payments from those accounts to recipients who hold or have held ministerial office.  It permits the tribunal to inquire into such payments that were made at the time only that the recipient held ministerial office.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) of the terms of reference goes one step further from (a) and (b) in that the tribunal, having identified whether payments were made to Mr. Haughey, and having identified the source of such payments, will then inquire into whether or not Mr. Haughey did any act or made any decision or conferred any benefit on any person who made such payments or who was the source of such payments or whether or not in fact he arranged for another individual, whether or not the holder of ministerial or public office, to do such an act or make such a decision.  This term of reference in effect permits the tribunal, once it has established the fact of payment and the source of payment, to go on to identify, upon an examination through all the period that Mr. Haughey held ministerial office, whether or not <Col N="682" /> there existed a connection between anything he did when he held ministerial office and the payment itself.</P>
    <P>Terms of reference (e) to (h) relate to Deputy Lowry and follow a similar line of approach in relation to his case, taking into account differences in circumstances.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (i) of the terms of reference goes one step further from (c) and (h).  Once the tribunal has identified to whom the moneys were paid or for whose benefit the moneys were held and the source of those payments, if the recipient was the holder of ministerial office at the time of such a transaction, the tribunal is permitted to inquire into whether or not that ministerial recipient conferred any benefit on the person who was the source of that payment.  The tribunal may examine whether or not that ministerial recipient procured any other person, whether or not a Minister or holder of public office, to do any act to confer any benefit on the source of the payment.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;payment&rdquo; is defined for the purposes of the terms of reference as including not merely money but any benefit in kind.  The word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; is not defined.  This would be a matter for the tribunal.  &ldquo;Connected person&rdquo; is defined by reference to section 2(2) of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and this includes &ldquo;relatives&rdquo; as defined in that Act.</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph (j) relating to the actions of the Revenue Commissioners, this will have to be interpreted and implemented in a manner consistent with existing law.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference include references to &ldquo;benefit&rdquo;.  This is defined in section 2(1) of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference at (b) and (f) refer to any company controlled by either Mr. Haughey or Deputy Lowry.  The tribunal will have the benefit of the definition of &ldquo;control&rdquo; in section 157 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference go on to describe the <i>modus operandi</i> of the tribunal which is to carry out such investigations in private as it thinks fit, using all the powers conferred on it under the Acts, to determine whether sufficient evidence exists in relation to any of the matters referred to above to warrant a full public inquiry in relation to such matters.  This merely reflects what has become the practice of tribunals of inquiry in that before the taking of oral evidence, counsel for the inquiry, at the direction of the chairman of the tribunal, undertake the collecting of evidence relevant to the inquiry by means of the issuing of orders of discovery or letters of request to examine witnesses abroad.  The fact that it is being formally stated in the present terms of reference merely reflects the desire of the Oireachtas that the tribunal undertake the groundwork before proceeding to a full-blown inquiry involving the taking of oral evidence, cross-examination etc. It allows the tribunal to assess the result of its preliminary groundwork as to whether it amounts to sufficient evidence to warrant a full-blown inquiry.  This ensures that the tribunal will <Col N="683" /> be efficient in its operation in that, if and when the tribunal proceeds to a full inquiry, matters upon which there is no evidence or insufficient evidence will not cloud the core issues before the full-blown inquiry.  Private investigations also protect the integrity of the inquiry itself so that the line of investigation is only revealed when the tribunal deems it appropriate.  It also protects the good name of innocent third parties.</P>
    <P>In relation to any matters where the tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence to warrant a full public inquiry, it will report that fact to the Clerk of the D·il and report in such manner as the tribunal thinks appropriate on the steps taken by the tribunal to determine what evidence, if any, existed.</P>
    <P>Though the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979, are silent as to this two-tier procedure for an inquiry, it has been advised that it is within the scope of the Acts and constitutionally permissible.  It is appropriate that at the end of the first tier of investigation by the tribunal to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a full inquiry, and if the inquiry reaches the determination that there is insufficient evidence to warrant a full inquiry on certain terms of reference, the tribunal should report the circumstances and reasons for such determination to the D·il.  This is simply the <i>prima facie</i> evidence principle in practice.</P>
    <P>The whole procedure envisaged is a painful necessity for our democracy.  It is essential that we dissipate the atmosphere of cynicism and suspicion and that we show we are capable of acting resolutely without fear or favour to defend it.  Our aim is to have a republic free of any taint or abuse of power, that is honoured and respected at home and abroad, in the spirit of our President now about to leave office and of our founding fathers.</P>
    <P>I thank the leaders of the political parties who have given me the benefit of their judgment on the matters they believe I should include in the tribunal's terms of reference.  I have not been able to fully accept their recommendations but I thank them for the time and courtesy afforded me.  I have tried to the best of my ability to include the central issues.  I and my legal advisers in the Attorney General's office will listen carefully to the debate and to the points made.  Deputies can be sure that I will try to take on board any matters that are deemed relevant.  I assure the House that in preparing the legislation points made now or later will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The challenge for us is that we should be seen to get our house in order.  We are an important profession in this democracy.  People who serve in this House do so at great inconvenience to themselves and their families at all times.  They are not particularly well remunerated for it. When independent groups indicate to what extent we should be remunerated we have difficulty in implementing even that.  People in this House are honourable, and what we have to do in the period ahead is to prove that by bringing <Col N="684" /> in whatever legislation is necessary we are prepared to stand on these issues and are not afraid to be questioned on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Justice McCracken has produced a clear, precise and judgmental report.  It contrasts starkly with the non-judgmental and difficult to read report of the beef tribunal.</P>
      <P>This debate is part of a painful but necessary preliminary to the cleansing of the Irish political culture.  For too long we have had to live with the public perception that, in a way that is different from other occupations, people go into politics for what they can get out of it.  That widespread if inaccurate public view has tainted everyone in public life.  The sad reality of the clear and shocking evidence in the McCracken report is that people can now believe they have sound reasons for their long held suspicions.</P>
      <P>Those who behave honestly and within the law in public life are angry and upset at this state of affairs.  Many will justly see the fact that the McCracken report found no evidence of impropriety or favours granted by either Deputy Michael Lowry or Charles Haughey for the largesse bestowed upon them by Ben Dunne as a positive and supportive finding, but that will cut no ice with the people.  They will believe in the <i>quid pro quo.</i>  They will believe that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and they will go on believing it until the Irish political culture is changed.  For that, among other reasons, the investigations must continue.</P>
      <P>Constructive actions can and must be taken immediately to deal with the problems identified in and arising from the McCracken report and from earlier reports and inquiries into dubious transactions.  We must end the insider culture that has allowed those problems to be created.  Recent reports are full of examples of a structure of decision-making here that has deliberately allowed decisions to be taken by Ministers or officials on the basis of executive discretion rather than on the basis of unambiguous laws that are available to all and applied openly by the courts.  This culture of executive discretion has its origin in the import licences and protected monopolies of the 1920s and 1930s.  The modern expression of this unaccountable insider culture is to be found in the framing of special tax breaks for particular properties, the disposal of public assets without competitive tendering and the absence of clear criteria for rezoning some land but not other land.  Once the laws allow discretionary decisions to be taken without clear rules, we create an environment for corruption.  It is in the Bills that allow unaccountable executive discretion that we pass in sleepy committee rooms or a half empty D·il Chamber that we create that environment in which corruption can flourish.  In that sense no legislator can wash his or her hands of what may have happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want to change Irish political culture we must have the maximum separation of powers and the creation of veto points that can check <Col N="685" /> arbitrary decisions.  We must open closed sectors of the economy to competition and thus remove the cosy conditions in which cartels can operate. Competition is the enemy of corruption.  As far as openness is concerned, the Freedom of Information Act is a major step in that direction.  We need a complete audit of all our tax incentives and grant schemes to remove unnecessary executive discretion and occasions where the criteria for the exercise of discretion are vague.</P>
    <P>We need to update our anti-corruption legislation. Under the ethics legislation of 1995 payments or gifts to some public officials must now be disclosed, but there may still be gaps.  The legislation does not require a declaration of a decision maker's level of indebtedness, a factor that leaves individuals open to corruptibility.  A tax compliance certificate does not in itself reveal whether an individual is vulnerable because of his or her personal debts.</P>
    <P>The ethics legislation covers only disclosure. After 75 years of independence, our fundamental criminal offence of corruption is still dealt with under legislation introduced by Britain in 1889 and 1916.  The following changes are required to that legislation.  The law should impose a special obligation on those who hold public office and who know or suspect corrupt decision making to report it.  Not only should there be immunity for whistle blowers, there should be a positive obligation placed on people in particular offices to blow the whistle.  The law should criminalise the use of threats or deception to get a public official to make a decision in a particular direction, as well as the use of financial inducements.  Special powers of the kind available to those investigating tax evasion or company fraud should be available to those investigating corruption.  It should be made clear that the law against corruption covers decisions taken by Deputies in the D·il. These may still be exempt from the 1916 and 1889 legislation by virtue of parliamentary privilege. Our criminal law against corruption should not be confined to the bribery of officials in Ireland. It should be an offence for a person from Ireland to bribe an official abroad.  Our current tax law may allow bribes paid abroad to be tax deductible which is anomalous.  We must update our legislation to deal with money laundering and the abusive employment of offshore accounts.  Our money laundering legislation should be extended to cover estate agents, insurance brokers, accountants and lawyers as well as banks and building societies.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the Fine Gael problem, the actions of Deputy Lowry.  When the story was first published of how the extension to his home was paid for, notwithstanding the closeness of our political and personal relationship, I gave him a very short time in which to come up with a satisfactory explanation.  Deputy Lowry knew the alternative.  He tendered his resignation within about 60 hours of the original revelations.  Furthermore, as Members will be aware, some weeks later I gave him an ultimatum that he would have <Col N="686" /> to publicly demonstrate his financial and tax affairs were in order or be ineligible to be a Fine Gael candidate.  Deputy Lowry resigned from Fine Gael.  He continued to protest his innocence and made a statement to the D·il on 19 December last, which the tribunal found to be seriously incomplete, a statement, in the words of the tribunal, to be viewed with &ldquo;some astonishment&rdquo;. Deputy Lowry made a personal statement on that matter today.</P>
    <P>I have already made clear in public my view of his position.  In his own and his constituents' interests Deputy Lowry should not continue as a Member of the House while he has so many personal financial issues to resolve.</P>
    <P>Another widespread perception among the people is that many of those in business use under the counter payments, off shore accounts and contra deals of all kinds in the black economy as a way of evading tax.  The McCracken report found that both politicians, Charles Haughey and Deputy Lowry, had availed of such methods to evade tax.  That they did so may have been found out only because they were politicians, but that is irrelevant.  They, like others who abuse our system and ignore the laws of the land, must face the consequences of their actions.  This can and must be done by due process, without hindrance or pressure from politics.  Non-politicians who used such methods to hide money should be pursued with equal vigour.  Those are the comments I have to make about Deputy Lowry and his relationship &mdash; now ended &mdash; with Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>I will turn to the responsibilities of the major party in Government, Fianna F·il, in dealing with what has been revealed in the McCracken report about the party's former Taoiseach, Minister and dominant figure in the party for more than three decades.  It came as no surprise to anyone that Charles Haughey required large sums of money to maintain his visibly lavish lifestyle, least of all to those associates of his who had occasion to visit his home over the years, where Mr. Haughey carried out much Government business.  Some journalists and politicians tried unsuccessfully to force him to disclose the sources of his wealth down through the years.  Serious questions were treated with derision.  Mr. Haughey always seemed to have a willing band around him ready to crease their faces with derisory laughter when he treated with contempt serious questions on this matter from the press.  Some of those faces are still visible on the Front Bench opposite.  Do some of those in Fianna F·il feel even mildly embarrassed that they were among those who laughed or gave moral support to their leader when these questions about his wealth were imperiously dismissed at press conferences and on public platforms?</P>
    <P>While the issue was of public importance, it was, or should have been, a matter of serious concern to Fianna F·il during those years, but the party was blind.  We should also recall the withering media, political and public criticism of Garret FitzGerald's questioning of Mr. Haughey's suitability <Col N="687" /> for office in a D·il debate of 1979.  Admittedly there were those in Fianna F·il who wanted rid of Mr. Haughey and tried unsuccessfully to see him off.  However, to my knowledge, the issue of his wealth and its sources was never raised publicly by his party colleagues after that period in the 1960s when the late George Colley had the courage to refer to &ldquo;low standards in high places&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The matter was, of course well known and discussed privately within Fianna F·il at the time, but nothing was said or done openly.  The problem of Mr. Haughey's money was discussed in the conversation between Dr. Martin O'Donoghue and the then Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry on 21 October 1982, a conversation that was surreptitiously taped by Mr. MacSharry with equipment he received from the Assistant Commissioner of the Garda at the request of the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Doherty. People knew about the matter, but did not do anything about it.</P>
    <P>Why were these issues buried and why were media attempts to uncover the sources of Mr. Haughey's wealth denounced as vilification?  Is it because of the legendary intimidation by Mr. Haughey of his party colleagues?  Is it because people were cowed and fearful?  If that is so, could it happen again?</P>
    <P>Part of our response to the McCracken report must be to ensure it does not happen again, that political leaders can never again avoid serious questions about the source of obvious wealth, that a Taoiseach can never again be personally provided by a rich businessman with huge sums of money so that he can live in the style of an 18th century baron, without any accounting in public, that a Taoiseach can never again live as a kept man, leading a fraudulent lifestyle, probably many million of pounds beyond his means, evading tax in off shore accounts in the Cayman Islands and treating the public like suckers.  One can only wonder how an entire political organisation, strong and powerful like Fianna F·il, that fought so many battles with outsiders, could be so cowed into fearful silence by its own leader.  It is clear from the McCracken report, and without the benefit of yet another tribunal, that Mr. Haughey's behaviour while he was leader of Fianna F·il and of this country was indeed the very embodiment of low standards in high places. The ruthlessness with which he eliminated all his internal opponents within Fianna F·il clearly had more than a political purpose.</P>
    <P>It is not unfair to say, on the <i>prima facie</i> evidence available to us, that Mr. Haughey behaved like a Mafia don, and no Mafia don can operate without the aid of willing acolytes.  For instance, Mr. Haughey held his grip on the party through intimidation.  He insisted on a roll call vote on the motion of no confidence in his leadership of Fianna F·il on 6 October 1982 and a majority of Fianna F·il Deputies, including the present Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, fully supported him and <Col N="688" /> voted in favour of this intimidatory procedure. He expelled Deputy O'Malley from Fianna F·il for &ldquo;conduct unbecoming a member of Fianna F·il&rdquo; and again he was supported in this political act by the then Deputy Ahern.  The very mechanisms of democracy that operate with a party such as Fianna F·il must, therefore, be examined to ensure that such a scenario can never come to pass again.  Fianna F·il has yet to take a stand on whether Mr. Haughey is even now a member of or eligible to be a member of Fianna F·il.  We do not know whether his conduct is &ldquo;conduct unbecoming&rdquo; a member of that party in its eyes &mdash; that has not been said even yet.</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey's financial lifestyle was only possible because his political lifestyle was maintained by his political supporters.  He would not have received those donations if his political lifestyle was not being maintained in that way.  The acolytes of Mr. Haughey at that time, many of whom are still on the other side of this House, will have to ask themselves searching questions about their role in sustaining his political lifestyle through so many crises.</P>
    <P>The inquiry into Mr. Haughey's financial affairs must take full cognisance of the speculation both public and private in the late 1980s when Mr. Haughey was in serious financial difficulties. All trails will inevitably lead back to the beef tribunal report.  I am in no doubt that there must be a re-examination of that report in light of the revelations of the McCracken tribunal report.  For instance, there must be a re-examination of how £500 million in export credit insurance was granted to the Goodman companies against the expressed advice of senior departmental officials and advisers.  There must also be a re-examination of Mr. Haughey's direct involvement in the £25 million loans made available by the IDA to Mr. Larry Goodman and his company.  There has never been a satisfactory answer to why the IDA board was pressurised into by-passing the normal procedures and waiving a jobs performance clause in the agreement with Mr. Goodman, after a meeting between Mr. Goodman and Mr. Haughey.</P>
    <P>The beef tribunal report shows there was gross favouritism in the allocation of IDA grants and export credit in the beef industry.  It shows that Cabinet decisions were ignored; huge personal benefits were conveyed to individuals at meetings from which officials who could account for them were excluded; Ministers did deals with private companies, pre-empting the grant-giving role of the IDA; and Irish export credit was squandered on non-Irish intervention beef that the then Ministers, Mr. MacSharry, Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Reynolds all must have known was likely to be non-Irish EU intervention beef &mdash; even the published trade statistics showed we were insuring more beef to Iraq than we were exporting there.</P>
    <P>The beef tribunal report, like the McCracken report, revealed massive tax evasion, this time by the Goodman organisation.  These accusations of <Col N="689" /> tax evasion were publicly known to be before the beef tribunal in 1993 when the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, drew up the detailed terms of his tax amnesty.  The justification for this unjust amnesty was that it was supposed to bring in unknown potential tax liabilities.  The then Minister knew the Goodman Group had been accused of tax evasion before the beef tribunal. This was a known potential tax liability, not an unknown one.  Despite this knowledge, he carefully drafted the tax amnesty provisions of his Finance Bill not to exclude firms from eligibility even though the taxes which might have been evaded were the subject of investigation before a tribunal.  There was only one taxpayer in a position to benefit from that exemption.  In sharp contrast, the then Minister provided that evaded taxes which were subject to an investigation by a court rather than by a tribunal would be excluded from the tax amnesty.  Why did he make this distinction? Was that not a specific exception inserted to benefit a particular company?  How can the Taoiseach explain that decision of his? All those who voted for the tax amnesty need to explain their support for the then Minister for Finance's decision to exclude from ineligibility for the amnesty taxes which had been evaded and which were being investigated by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The sale of Carysfort College to UCD must now be re-examined in far greater detail and with far greater rigour.  It defies belief that Mr. Pino Harris could make a £1 million profit on the turnaround in the purchase and sale of this prime site without Mr. Haughey and the Government having applied pressure on the education authorities in UCD to purchase this property.  It was well known that UCD would have preferred to build its business school on the Belfield campus.</P>
    <P>Exactly the same pattern of collective Government decision making is to be found in the Carysfort case as was disclosed in the beef tribunal. Ministers worked alone, without civil servants to ensure accountability.  The absence of civil servants from eight meetings with UCD, some of them involving Mr. Haughey, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and others between 11 September 1990 and 12 December 1990 does not, to quote the Committee of Public Accounts, &ldquo;suggest the degree of transparency which one would expect to be evident in all financial transactions of the State&rdquo;.  The then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, is now deputy leader of Fianna F·il and Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>In the beef case, matters were rushed through Cabinet without proper procedures being followed. Ministers, including the present Taoiseach, acquiesced in this and were collectively responsible for it.  The same happened in the Carysfort case.  The Committee of Public Accounts found that at a meeting of the Cabinet on 4 December 1990 the Government decided to approve funding for the purchase of Carysfort for UCD &ldquo;without having a formal memorandum presented to it&rdquo; and in a way that prevented the Department of Finance from presenting cogent <Col N="690" /> observations on the financial wisdom of the decision.  The then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, proposed this, Mr. Haughey was in the chair, and I believe Deputy Ahern was at this Cabinet meeting.  Deputy Reynolds was Minister for Finance at the time.  None of them did their job properly.</P>
    <P>The involvement of Mr. Haughey's successor, Deputy Reynolds, in the passports for investment scheme has already been documented and debated in this House.  The deep involvement of Mr. Haughey in this scheme when he was Taoiseach has already been referred to publicly by the current Minister of State, Deputy Molloy.  It is known that, as Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey met privately on at least one occasion with overseas investors who acquired Irish passports.  He met them privately &mdash; note the pattern.  In the beef tribunal it was found that Ministers, including Mr. Haughey and Deputy Reynolds, met beef interests without civil servants being present.  In the case of Carysfort, representatives of UCD were met by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, and the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, without officials being present.  In the case of the passports for investment scheme, Mr. Haughey met investors without officials being present.  There is a pattern.  It is also known that naturalisation certificates for some of these people, which are normally signed by officials, were signed by the current Minister for Foreign Affairs and then Minister for Justice, Deputy Raphael Burke.</P>
    <P>At some stage after 1987, as we know from the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, effective control of the passports for investment scheme passed from the Department of Justice to the Department of the Taoiseach when Mr. Haughey was in office.  We need to know why this decision was taken and whether the then Ministers for Justice, Gerard Collins and Deputy Raphael Burke, approved of the decision to hand over this responsibility to the Taoiseach.  Were any officials in the Department of the Taoiseach involved in the administration of the scheme or, as was the case with the beef industry, were all meetings in regard to passports held between Ministers and those who could benefit from their decisions without officials being present?</P>
    <P>Was there a file in the Taoiseach's office on passports for investment when Mr. Haughey or Deputy Reynolds were Taoiseach?  Where is that file now?  Was it shown to the then T·naiste, Deputy Spring, when he was shown the Department of Justice file on the subject?  Was he told there was another file?  Was he told that the Department of the Taoiseach dealt with this matter when Mr. Haughey was Taoiseach and that, therefore, there would have been another file?  If not, why was he not told?</P>
    <P>Subsequent to Mr. Haughey's time as Taoiseach the family business of his successor, Deputy Reynolds, received an investment of £1.1 million. Incredibly, Deputy Reynolds claims he never met the investor nor had his company prior dealings with him.  Happily, however, the then Minister for <Col N="691" /> the Environment and current Minister of State, Deputy Michael Smith, was able to write to the Minister for Justice assuring him that he could vouch for the lender from personal knowledge and intimate acquaintance with him.  The T·naiste's party colleague, Michael McDowell, rightly dismissed this whole saga as shameful.</P>
    <P>The style of decision making evidenced in all three cases &mdash; the beef industry, Carysfort and passports &mdash; is one for which every Minister who sat at the Cabinet table at the time is collectively responsible.  They may not have been responsible for every individual decision but they were collectively responsible for the style of decision making by the Cabinet which they allowed to continue. They were responsible for the delegation of responsibility which they allowed, just as in the McCracken report all the directors of Dunnes Stores were deemed responsible for the delegation of authority which they allowed to their managing director.  Every member of the Governments of which Mr. Haughey was a member and which did business in the way I have just described was collectively responsible for delegating authority in a way which allowed such decisions to be taken.</P>
    <P>It is not possible for members of those Governments, such as the current Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Woods, who are present in the Chamber, to say it was all Mr. Haughey's business and had nothing to do with them.  The essence of collective responsibility is that all 15 Ministers are responsible for each other's actions.  It is not possible for a Government which went to the Supreme Court to defend Cabinet confidentiality on the grounds of collective responsibility to say now there is no collective responsibility for everything done by Mr. Haughey and his Administrations of which they were members.  They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot use collective responsibility to justify the maintenance of Cabinet confidentiality but then say there was no collective responsibility for Mr. Haughey's actions as Taoiseach and his allowing business to be done in the absence of officials.</P>
    <P>The importance of the absence of officials from these meetings cannot be overstressed.  The only control we have in this House to ensure taxpayers' money is not misappropriated is the procedure whereby the Accounting Officer, the Secretary of the Department, must account to the Comptroller and Auditor General, and ultimately to the Committee of Public Accounts, for the way in which money is committed.  However, if a Minister holds a meeting at which money is committed from which a permanent civil servant is excluded, that exclusion represents in itself a deliberate subversion of the system of accountability to this House through the Secretaries and Accounting Officers which was created at the foundation of this State to ensure probity.</P>
    <P>Any Minister who held a meeting which involved the commitment of money and from which officials were excluded must explain <i>prima</i><Col N="692" /><i>facie</i> that such procedures were not corrupt.  The burden of proof that nothing wrong occurred rests with anybody who held such meetings because such exclusion, in itself, subverted the system of accountability.  I have given three examples &mdash; the beef industry, Carysfort and passports for investment &mdash; where valuable assets such as passports, grants, loans and export credit were given away at meetings from which officials were excluded.</P>
    <P>There is one obvious step which the Fianna F·il organisation, particularly the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, has failed to take.  It would surely have been in Fianna F·il's interest &mdash; and definitely in the public interest &mdash; if the Taoiseach had by now publicly called on Mr. Haughey to come clean on his finances and co-operate fully in advance of this new tribunal.  It must be noted that the Taoiseach, when he was Leader of the Opposition, and the Fianna F·il Party failed to ask Mr. Haughey to co-operate fully with the tribunal when he was manifestly failing to so do.  Now that he is Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern has not yet asked Mr. Haughey, as the leader of his party and as a matter of party discipline, to co-operate with the tribunal.</P>

Does Deputy Woods believe Mr. Haughey is eligible to be a member of Fianna F·il?  If not, why has his party leader not said he is ineligible to be a member? Is the party still afraid to say, even now, that his conduct warrants being described as conduct unbecoming a member of Fianna F·il?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one overriding truth which must be confronted.  If Mr. Haughey did wrong in his public business he could not have acted alone.  He needed the co-operation of either senior Ministers or senior officials, or both.  That cannot be evaded.  The Taoiseach stated, &ldquo;I am no more responsible for the misdemeanours of Charles Haughey than Deputies John Bruton, Dick Spring or Proinsias De Rossa are responsible for the misdemeanours of their colleague in Government, Deputy Michael Lowry&rdquo;.  That would be true in regard to either Mr. Haughey's or Deputy Lowry's private affairs.  However in regard to their public responsibilities and any misdemeanours that may have been committed in any public decisions they made, we are responsible. There is a clear distinction between private and public responsibilities.  I drew attention to <Col N="693" /> this point and I was continually misrepresented for having done so.  However, that distinction exists.</P>
      <P>If Mr. Haughey did something wrong in any of the public examples I gave, such as the beef, Carysfort or passports issues, it cannot be said that the same responsibility rests on his colleagues as rests on Deputy Lowry's colleagues with regard to his private tax affairs.  The two are not in the same category.  We have no concept of public accountability unless we understand that distinction.</P>
      <P>One matter is outstanding from the serious consultations, which were welcome, between the Government and the Opposition parties in recent days.  I understand the Government is considering a two or three person tribunal.  I caution it against such a move.  The procedure which worked in the Finlay and McCracken tribunals was excellent and we should be reluctant to depart from it.  The idea of a three person tribunal, where there might be a two to one vote on a specific issue, does not commend itself.  The possibility that the chairman of the tribunal might be outvoted on a particular question by two others is not favourable.  Some thought should be given to this aspect.</P>
      <P>It is most important that a serious judge is appointed to the tribunal.  All judges, in the same way as all politicians or grocers, are not the same. Some can make judgments; they can come down definitively on one side or the other.  However, others find that painful and cannot do it.  There is no point having a non judgmental judge chairing the tribunal.  We must have a judge like Mr. Justice McCracken who can come down off the fence and make judgments.  It is most important this matter is taken into account in the choice of person. In a sense, this aspect is as important as the terms of reference.  I appreciate that the choice is a matter for the Government, having consulted the President of the High Court, and not the House.  It would impossible if the Government had to seek the agreement of all parties to a name.  I do not suggest such an agreement should be sought but I advise the Taoiseach that he should be rigorous in his choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion in so far as it goes and the establishment of a new tribunal which will be difficult and sometimes painful. However, it is necessary in the interests of political life that we undertake a detailed and rigorous examination of all the outstanding issues and that we collectively seek new ways to re-establish the role of politics in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential meaning of politics is public service. The House is the engine room of our democracy and its Members are, almost exclusively, dedicated to doing a professional and decent job of representing their constituents.  The events we are debating and a range of other issues have distorted and muddied the perception of politics and politicians.  If we are ever to clear the mud away, we must be prepared to face up to a relentless <Col N="694" /> search for the type of standards which reflect the aspirations of the public we serve.</P>
    <P>During my contribution I will elaborate on a number of amendments I tabled.  I acknowledge the consultations that the Government afforded the Opposition.  They have gone some way towards meeting the points we made in response to the original draft.  In particular, I acknowledge that the Government has adopted points I made, and even the language I used, in my letter to the Taoiseach last Friday.  I also pay tribute to the courtesy and efforts of the Attorney General. Attorneys General have not been praised often in the House in recent times but the current Attorney General, although he has been very busy in recent weeks, has been helpful and open to the Opposition in trying to reach an agreement on this issue.</P>
    <P>However, I maintain that there are flaws in the terms of reference.  I hope that in the course of the debate the Government will give serious consideration to the amendments which have been tabled.  In seeking to address the necessary changes, I have sought to develop more fully some of the points I put forward originally.  I will return to the amendments in more detail later but I wish to mention the McCracken report and the lessons we need to learn from it.</P>
    <P>On the day he retired as Taoiseach in the House, former Deputy Charles Haughey described himself as having &ldquo;done the State some service&rdquo;.  Whatever about that, it is certainly the case that Mr. Justice Brian McCracken has done the State and all its people a considerable service. The clarity and directness of his report make it easy and gripping reading and the lessons in it will serve as a model for years to come.  It should be required reading for everyone involved in public life at all levels.</P>
    <P>Judge McCracken is straightforward in his report.  He dismisses outright Mr. Haughey's claim that he knew nothing about how his financial affairs were handled over many years.  He expresses the feelings of the great majority of people when he says that &ldquo;it is quite unacceptable that a Member of D·il …ireann, and in particular a Cabinet Minister and Taoiseach, should be supported in his personal lifestyle by gifts made to him personally&rdquo;.  He has rightly asked the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider whether Mr. Haughey should be prosecuted for, in effect, lying to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>He is equally scathing about Deputy Lowry.  He accuses him of benefiting from the black economy from shortly after he was elected to the D·il and of cynically ignoring and evading the taxation and exchange control laws of the State.  Who can disagree with Judge McCracken's assessment that &ldquo;if such a person can behave in this way without serious sanctions being imposed, it becomes very difficult to condemn others who similarly flout the law&ldquo;?</P>
    <P>I have already called on the Government to ensure that the entire report and the web of deceit and criminality it uncovers is referred to <Col N="695" /> the Director of Public Prosecutions immediately so that he can consider what additional action is necessary in relation to offences under tax law, exchange control law, and company law generally. The recommendations of the report, and especially those that have implications for the House and its Members, should be referred to a special committee of the House for immediate examination.  I call on the Government to establish such a committee immediately.</P>
    <P>As far as Mr. Haughey is concerned, he has engaged in wholesale lies and deliberate tax evasion. He was a holder of the most important office in the State and he dishonoured it.  There is an onus on the Government, and especially on his party leader, to take steps immediately to prepare and outline the political sanctions necessary. Judge McCracken is very clear about the unacceptability of Mr. Haughey's behaviour.  The political system must be prepared to demonstrate equally clearly that it is prepared to follow these findings to their logical conclusion and that all appropriate legal, financial and political penalties are applied.  This means that the Revenue Commissioners must pursue all taxes owed; the Director of Public Prosecutions must consider whether other prosecutions are warranted and the Government must review whatever perks are in place to ensure Mr. Haughey's comfort as a former Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Lowry, it is clear that he too has been indicted in relation to cynical and systematic tax evasion, compounded by criminal breaches of exchange control regulations.  It is equally clear that Deputy Lowry brazenly misled the D·il in his detailed statement on 19 December 1996 when he failed to mention payments of more than £100,000 and when he referred to offshore accounts in such a way as to imply that he had no involvement in such things. Although I am aware that it is not considered appropriate to comment on personal statements made by Members in the House, I doubt if any Member was impressed by the statement made by Deputy Lowry today.</P>
    <P>The question one must ask is why it took him so long.  He said nothing in the House that he could not have said on the day the report was published, although then he seemed almost to claim some type of vindication from the report.  One must also wonder why he dealt with none of the criticisms made by Judge McCracken but confined himself only to those issues where he misled the House. It is right and proper that Deputy Lowry should consider himself as having unfinished business and that the new tribunal should pursue that unfinished business to its ultimate conclusion. There are other issues to be investigated, and we are here to discuss how that should to be done. We all know about a number of decisions made by Governments in which Mr. Haughey was Taoiseach &mdash; and we all know about the rich people who were made richer by those decisions.  No <Col N="696" /> matter how difficult it is to set up further investigations, those decisions will have to be gone into again.  Judge McCracken uses the phrase &ldquo;an unhealthy relationship&rdquo; to describe this.  We have to root out the basis for all such unhealthy relationships in Irish life.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference in front of us refer to &ldquo;no decisions&rdquo;.  I appreciate the difficulty of framing terms that would retain focus, and yet allow and encourage the tribunal to explore areas of public concern.  However, we must, in our terms of reference, at least try to set a tone for the tribunal that will encourage the exploration of controversial decisions.  That is why I have proposed an amendment to the terms of reference which, while it would not set specific tasks, would establish a tone for the tribunal that would provide a measure of reassurance that the search of the so-called &ldquo;money trail&rdquo; has a deeper purpose to it.</P>
    <P>The amendment I propose is in the following terms, and I propose that it go in as a second paragraph:</P>
    <P>Bearing also in mind serious public concern that certain decisions (including as examples those relating to the sale of lands at Carysfort and Glending Woods, the rezonings of land in the greater Dublin area, issues arising from the sale of the Johnson Mooney and O'Brien site in Ballsbridge, Export Credit Insurance, the grant of the ESAT Digifone licence, and the grant of citizenship under the Business Migration Scheme) made by holders of public office may have been improperly influenced or obtained.</P>
    <P>Members of the House may well have other issues they would wish to see included in this illustrative list.  I would be more than happy to support the inclusion of additional issues, should Members wish it.</P>
    <P>We are all now agreed that the so-called Ansbacher accounts uncovered by the tribunal must be fully investigated.  We need to know what other people were using these accounts and for what purposes and to who else was Mr. Haughey indebted.  Tens of millions of pounds, in the region of £38 million, are hidden in these accounts.  The public is asking why?  Whose money is it?  How much more of it was or is being used to support Mr. Haughey's lifestyle or future? We must get to the bottom of the Ansbacher accounts if there is to be a satisfactory conclusion to this tribunal.</P>
    <P>This gives rise to the next difficulty about the terms of reference.  As I read them, they will not enable a tribunal to get at the source of the Ansbacher accounts without first establishing that any moneys there are for the benefit of Mr. Haughey or other Ministers.  To put it bluntly, people who had money salted away in the Ansbacher accounts for commoner garden illegal purposes may well be immune under these terms. It may well be argued that these are ordinary citizens, caught up through no fault of their own in the machinations of Mr. Haughey and his financial <Col N="697" /> advisers, but it is impossible to escape the conclusion that every single person who invested in the Ansbacher accounts was involved, knowingly, in a highly orchestrated and well-designed tax scam.  There is absolutely no reason they should be exempt from scrutiny and disclosure in this tribunal.</P>
    <P>For that reason I have tabled an amendment which would have the effect of opening up the Ansbacher accounts to a much fuller scrutiny than is at present envisaged.  I urge the Government to reconsider its position in the matter, and I will insist on a vote on this amendment if necessary. I have said on many occasions that this House, and the public, is entitled to a detailed explanation, based on an impartial investigation, into the way in which a million pounds in Party Leader's Allowance was used by Mr. Haughey in the 1983-1992 period, and into the way in which that money was managed by Fianna F·il Party officers in the period.  I have listened carefully to what the Taoiseach has said today about that money.  It was a great deal of money, perhaps not in the context of £38 million, but it was taxpayers' money, meant to be used for political and parliamentary purposes only.  We need reassurances on that.</P>
    <P>I have tabled the following amendment, which would require the tribunal specifically to examine:</P>
    <P>the manner of disbursement by Mr. Haughey of public moneys received by him by virtue of his office of leader of Fianna F·il in the years 1983 to 1992, and the procedures and controls which were applied by him or the Fianna F·il Party to such disbursements.</P>
    <P>However difficult it might be for people still in this House to face this issue, I believe we must. There should be records available for people employed in the private office in relation to salaries paid and tax deducted from them.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference set out the areas of reform that can be considered by the tribunal.  We need to go further.  The integrity of public administration; the dependence of politics on private and secret money; issues of company law and the role of company directors; the role of the Revenue Commissioners, its independence and future accountability; the role of the Central Bank as a regulator and indeed the regulation of relevant professional people all need to be explored by the tribunal.  I have tabled the following amendment, in place of paragraphs (k) and (l) of the existing terms, to try to achieve these objectives:</P>
    <P>And further in particular, in the light of its findings and conclusions, to make whatever broad recommendations it considers necessary or expedient</P>
    <P>(i) to ensure that the integrity of public administration is not compromised by the dependence of party politics on financial contributions from undisclosed sources;</P>
    <P>(ii) for the reform of the disclosure, compliance, <Col N="698" /> investigation and enforcement provisions of company law (including in particular those which relate to directors' duties);</P>
    <P>(iii) for securing the formal independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the performance of their functions while at the same time ensuring the greatest degree of openness and accountability in that regard that is consistent with the right to privacy of compliant taxpayers;</P>
    <P>(iv) for enhancing the role and performance of the Central Bank as regulator of the banks and of the financial services sector generally, and for the effective regulation of the conduct of their members by such professional accountancy and other bodies as are relevant to these terms of reference, for the purpose of achieving the highest degree of public confidence.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government parties will be willing, after further examination, to support this amendment. If it is adopted, I further hope the tribunal will rely on far more than submissions from political parties before reaching its recommendations. There are many areas of expertise and concern in Ireland that could usefully contribute to the tribunal's deliberations, and I hope the tribunal will consider this to be an important aspect of its work, rather than an afterthought.</P>
    <P>The final amendment I have proposed is, I hope, non-contentious.  We should allow the tribunal to work in private or in public as it sees fit. I am not sure the terms proposed by the Government give the tribunal sufficient flexibility and freedom in that regard.</P>
    <P>The road on which we now embark will be long, complicated, and painful, but it is fundamentally essential.  We were fortunate to be served by Judge McCracken in the last tribunal, and I hope and expect the Government will consult the Opposition about the appointment of the next tribunal.  I wish it well in its work, and I commend the amendments proposed to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I greatly welcome the report issued just over two weeks ago by Judge McCracken.  It restores one's faith in tribunals of inquiry.  The tribunal was effective and expeditious.  The report is readable, concise, clear and delightfully unambiguous.  It is not afraid to confront prominent people with their wrongdoings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The McCracken report speaks for itself and does not require any great review or examination by me.  We should concentrate our efforts on trying to ensure that McCracken is built upon and that the openings and leads provided by it are followed and not ignored in the way many matters referred to in the beef tribunal report were subsequently ignored.  Much of the evidence to that tribunal was completely overlooked as if it had never happened.  I hope there will be prosecutions as appropriate, not confined as in the past to one journalist and a handful of minor <Col N="699" /> players who were not beneficiaries.  I hope on this occasion the Revenue Commissioners, who are frequently so assiduous in pursuing small defaulters who have often simply fallen on hard times, will pursue with the full rigour of the extensive powers given to them by this House, the people who have been identified as being in breach of the taxation code in a serious and ongoing way.</P>
    <P>I welcome paragraph (j) of the terms of reference relating to the Revenue Commissioner. Ideally it should be wider because the beef tribunal report identified clearly what is probably the largest and most professionally organised systematic fraud on the Revenue in the history of the State.  It was carried out by a major beef group with professional assistance.  To the best of my knowledge, after examining the Revenue Commissioners' Annual Reports since then, no prosecutions have been taken or penalties imposed in respect of that widespread and systematic taxation fraud.  I have heard it suggested that those who perpetrated it were allowed to avail of the tax amnesty, which seems amazing.  It is also noteworthy that the Institute of Chartered Accountants did not see fit to take any action as a result of what came to light in that report.</P>
    <P>I hope the new tribunal's powers are wide enough to enable it to look into the various matters of a serious nature that came to light in the beef tribunal report where no action was taken. The willingness to turn an official blind eye to fraud and to huge tax evasion brings all the laws of the State into disrepute and makes ordinary compliant members of the public aggrieved and cynical about the partial manner in which some of our laws are applied, not least, as they believe, our taxation laws.</P>
    <P>The motion to establish this new tribunal owes its existence to the McCracken tribunal and its aftermath.  It is perhaps a frightening thought that all these matters would have gone unknown and uninvestigated had it not been for the private legal dispute between the members of the Dunne family, the raising of the payments issue in those proceedings and the subsequent disclosure of the Lowry payments to Sam Smyth for publication in the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  By any standards, that is a highly improbable chain of events.  It was far more probable in retrospect that these matters would never have reached the light of day.</P>
    <P>There is every reason now to believe that the Dunne payments, substantial though they were, are but the visible tip of a much greater iceberg and that the true magnitude of corrupt and compromising payments was much greater.  It seems unlikely that Mr. Haughey, when he sent out Mr. Traynor in pursuit of wealthy patrons who would bail him out of one of his financial crises, would have recalled him from that task as soon as Ben Dunne turned up trumps nor does it seem likely that Mr. Dunne was his first benefactor.  If Mr. Haughey was prepared to compromise himself in relation to Mr. Dunne, as he was, the strong likelihood <Col N="700" /> is that he would not shrink from doing so in relation to other wealthy businessmen.</P>
    <P>The report of the McCracken tribunal has made plain what many of us for years could only harbour as suspicions, namely, that Mr. Haughey was a malign influence on Irish public life.  While it is true that there was no evidence adduced of any attempt at a direct or indirect political payoff for Mr. Dunne's largesse, nobody but the most naive could possibly believe that being indebted to Mr. Dunne in the sum of £1.3 million did not create the circumstances in which corruption could take place.</P>
    <P>It is also true that Mr. Haughey's political career was characterised by the attitude he exhibited in obstructing and misleading the tribunal and later in tendering false evidence to it.  Truth never seems to have mattered greatly to Mr. Haughey.  How ironic it is now, and how chilling, that when he escaped justice in 1970, his first instinct was to turn on his accusers and ask them to &ldquo;take the honourable course&rdquo;.  The truth is that the ascent of Mr. Haughey to political power was in large measure by questionable means.  Many people were secret victims of his ambitions; some few were his public victims.</P>
    <P>In the very precincts of this House, Mr. Jim Gibbons was kicked to the ground for standing up to Mr. Haughey.  Other Deputies were confronted with explicit threats, not merely to their future in public life, but also to their private livelihoods, unless they bent the knee to his ruthless personal agenda.  I was expelled from the party he controlled largely because I would not play the game his way.  It was on me that the badge of &ldquo;conduct unbecoming&rdquo; was pinned.</P>
    <P>I am by no means the only person who can rightly claim political vindication by the outcome of the McCracken report &mdash; there are many others, some of whom are still in public life. Others have left public life &mdash; by choice, out of disillusionment or involuntarily.  There are also private people who have been victimised by the same ruthlessness in many other spheres of life. They found promotion blocked, doors closed and their competitors unfairly favoured.  They suffered in silence.</P>
    <P>Some may now ask why if I suspected all of this did I accept office in 1989 as a member of a Cabinet in which Mr. Haughey was Taoiseach.  That decision was one of the most difficult of my political life, as I said at the time.  The six Progressive Democrats Deputies in 1989 individually had every personal reason to have nothing to do with Mr. Haughey but we knew there was a great likelihood that if we did not take part in Government we would play into his hands and give him the overall majority he craved.  We also knew it was impossible to support him from outside the Cabinet. We were, at the last, left with one option &mdash; to participate in Government on the basis of coalition and to influence from within the Cabinet that which we could not hope to influence from outside.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have been criticised <Col N="701" /> for some of the stances we took on issues of standards in that Government.  History will judge whether we were right or wrong on each stance. Because we had entered Government with the gravest of misgivings concerning Mr. Haughey's standards and methods, we had to be absolutely determined to prove that we would not compromise ourselves in relation to those standards or methods.  We took the two leaders that Fianna F·il successively chose and we dealt with them, but we refused to compromise on our beliefs in what should and should not be done.  In the end we left that Government because the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, made it impossible to stay.</P>
    <P>This brings me to certain aspects of the beef tribunal that disturb me, in particular the State's involvement and attitudes.  A completely unwarranted adversarial procedure was adopted as opposed to an inquisitorial role.  The manner in which the State legal team, acting on the instructions of the then Attorney General, Mr. Whelehan, conducted its case was disquieting.  Those who made allegations, as they were called, were treated with hostility by the State and strict proofs of everything were demanded from them. Large sums were expended by the State on public relations and economic consultatants in an effort to disprove or discredit the evidence of a Minister which did not suit the State in the guise of the personal and political interests of two successive Taoisigh, Mr. Haughey and Deputy Albert Reynolds.</P>
    <P>With what we now know from McCracken, is it unreasonable to suspect that substantial payments may have been made to win favours in political decisions concerning the beef industry, including State aids and State export credit insurance?  The evidence of favouritism was overwhelming. What was the explanation for the illegal Government decision to overrule the IDA's conditions relating to the Goodman organisation?</P>
    <P>Having seen what transpired at the McCracken tribunal, I am driven to the conclusion that Mr. Haughey was in receipt of substantial payments from several wealthy persons.  His lifestyle and growth in personal wealth can only be explained in that way, as far as I can judge.  The real question is not just the fact of payments, although that is important, it is the identity and motives of the paymasters.  Others, however, may not co-operate as Mr. Dunne did.  It may not be possible to trace all the payments.  I have reason to suspect that the use of cash may have played a part.</P>
    <P>When one recalls that in relation to the Ballsbridge Telecom Eireann site, the inspector, Mr. John Glackin, reported that part of the proceeds was withdrawn in cash in the amount of £0.5 million by an accountant working for Dermot Desmond; that it was carried through the streets of Dublin and stored in Mr. Desmond's safe in a tennis holdall; that Mr. Desmond later claimed to have paid it to an elderly and infirm foreign resident called Probets; that this claim was disbelieved by Mr. Glackin and that Mr. <Col N="702" /> Glackin concluded that it was paid to someone else, some serious questions arise.</P>
    <P>To convert £0.5 million into legal tender cash required taking enormous risks.  It could only have been done for an unlawful motive: to be a deniable payment to someone for a corrupt purpose or to be a deniable payment for tax evasion purposes.  We must ask ourselves whether such risks would be taken merely for tax purposes.  Is not the more obvious explanation that the money was needed for ultimate payment to someone who simply had to be able to deny it?  There is a case for believing that the money was intended for such a purpose.</P>
    <P>That payment may be just one of a series of dubious or corrupt transactions by, or involving, members of a golden circle of people who placed themselves above the law.  If Ben Dunne could buy the friendship of a Taoiseach, then there were other well-known people with every reason to do the same.  If Des Traynor could seek out Ben Dunne's largesse with such ease, it seems inconceivable that he did not seek out equal generosity among a small circle of wealthy people who rubbed shoulders with Mr. Haughey and whose fortunes could be considerably assisted by him.  That is why it is essential that the next tribunal comes to grips with the real implications of the McCracken tribunal, namely, that the head of an Irish Government was secretly on the payroll of wealthy businessmen.  That is why the Oireachtas must inquire into the matter through a tribunal.  We will have some idea of the spider's web of favouritism and corruption strung across Irish society in recent decades when we find out which and why wealthy businessmen financed the opulent lifestyle of a Taoiseach; why an Irish bank forgave him huge debts; why he could count on large gifts to pay for yachts, houses, race-horses, furnishing and works of art, and how all of this went unnoticed and unchallenged by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>It is only by confronting the truth that we can demand accountability and remedies.  The House will be healthier when we raise the blinds and open the windows.  We can only purge and restore our democratic system by a good dose of sunlight and fresh air.</P>
    <P>Some may think that Deputy Lowry is unfortunate to be involved in this affair.  However, people make their own luck.  The record shows that Deputy Lowry engaged in massive personal and corporate tax evasion; that he lied to the Revenue when he availed of the amnesty, against which he had voted; that he lied to the then Taoiseach about his tax affairs on appointment as Minister; that he lied to this House about his offshore accounts, and that he exposed himself to blackmail.  In these circumstances it seems reasonable that his personal finances should be investigated to ascertain whether he has other accounts abroad, whether his lifestyle was supported by any unexplained income and to see if and how the discharge of his public duties was or might have been affected by such matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> He claimed last December and again during the general election to have told this House &ldquo;the simple, unvarnished truth&rdquo;.  That turned out not to be so.  He can only blame himself if the public now demands a thorough investigation of his financial affairs and conduct as a Minister.</P>
    <P>One could make a case for a substantial list of matters to be investigated by this new tribunal. For example, a procedure developed under the Irish nationality and citizenship legislation of 1986 whereby citizenship by naturalisation could be given to those with close Irish associations. This came to be interpreted as providing Irish passports for those who made investments in Ireland.  It appears that while Taoiseach Mr. Haughey directed all such cases to be brought to his attention, by the Department of Justice, presumably to make the decisions himself.  This is the understanding of one of my colleagues.  We know something of the circumstances in which a decision was subsequently made in respect of the Masri passports.  It would seem desirable that the operation of this scheme from its initial use should be reviewed as it was clearly open to abuse.  Only a proper investigation can definitively establish whether it was abused and by whom.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a statement was made to the Garda by a Mr. Shanahan, an employee of Anglo Irish Beef Processors in Rathkeale, County Limerick. It appears that very little of this statement was used at the beef tribunal but it was used in a subsequent criminal trial of some of the Rathkeale employees.  It was not controverted.  It sets out in detail how intervention beef was regularly and systematically removed from intervention boxes and certain cuts reboxed in commercial boxes and sold in Ireland and Britain on the commercial market.  The sale in this way of such intervention beef, the property of the Minister for Agriculture and Food as agent of the Commission, was illegal.  The statement goes into considerable detail about how this was done and states that it was carried out in full view of agricultural officers from the Department who did not intervene to stop it.  It states that the difference in the weight of the intervention boxes was made up with fat.</P>
    <P>This conduct was carried out on a wide scale. Nobody in Rathkeale benefited in any way from the sale of the stolen meat.  The only beneficiaries were the owners of the plant.  Why were they never prosecuted?  On occasion the benefit to them was up to £250,000 per month.</P>
    <P>It is widely believed that what occurred in Rathkeale happened in numerous other factories in the same ownership.  The amount stolen, therefore, from the Minister is potentially enormous. This is a major fraud to which an official blind eye was turned.  In the context of these tribunals, both past and proposed, should we not ask why a blind eye was turned?</P>
    <P>I formed the impression at the beef tribunal that there was collusion between the State's representatives and those representing the Goodman <Col N="704" /> organisation.  Their interests appeared to be the same.  The State and Goodman were never in serious or prolonged dispute.  The State was in vehement dispute with one of its own Ministers who disagreed with the Goodman approach and the favourable way in which Goodman was treated.  Did this collusion predate and extend beyond the tribunal?</P>
    <P>There are numerous instances of matters arising in the supervision of the beef industry by the Department of Agriculture and Food which give rise to disquiet.  My disquiet is shared by, among others, the European Commission which has imposed fines on Ireland approaching £100 million for the Department's failures.</P>
    <P>The release of securities for export refunds is a matter that requires examination.  The manner in which it was handled by the Department was most unusual.  My fear is that where securities were wrongly released the Commission can seek reimbursement by fining the Department.  In other words, the Irish taxpayer will yet again have to pay while Mr. Goodman, who was wrongly enriched by the payment of the refund, is allowed keep his ill-gotten gains.  These refunds mostly date from the 1987-9 period.  Some fines have already been imposed.</P>
    <P>Why is forgery of official documents by some officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food not a matter of concern?  No officials were ever prosecuted, dismissed or even disciplined for forgery.  It must, therefore, have been officially approved.  Why was this?  Why are the actions of the Revenue being examined in this tribunal and not the actions of the Department of Agriculture and Food?</P>
    <P>As an individual I cannot provide all the answers but, as somebody who has carefully looked at this scene for several years, I can provide some of the questions.  For too long part of the problem was that we would not even ask the questions.  That is why we find ourselves in this unseemly pickle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I record my thanks and appreciation, and that of my party, to Mr. Justice McCracken and his team for this landmark report.  It is a model of clarity and common sense. It rescues our democracy from growing uneasiness that a small group of powerful and wealthy individuals had come to regard themselves as the beneficial owners of the State while nobody in authority was prepared to call a halt.  We do not conclusively know the identity of those who have acquired or bought mastery of the system but the genie is out of the bottle.  Despite ignorant comment to the contrary, the report of the beef tribunal was a devastating critique of the conduct of public affairs.  How Ministers interacted with big business, civil servants, State agencies and with this House was subjected to public scrutiny for the first time.  The issues included the economic well-being of one of our major industries, our reputation as a trading nation, the behaviour, competence and practices of our most senior politicians <Col N="705" /> and the propriety of relationships between senior Ministers and a prominent businessman who was a major financial contributor to the political party of the Ministers concerned, a businessman whose stated objective before the tribunal was to persuade the Government of the day to confine enormously valuable State assistance to his own companies.  All of this was immensely valuable but, where the beef tribunal failed, the public test is perhaps best expressed in the following comments of the <i>Church of Ireland Gazette</i> of 19 August 1994:</P>
      <P>Throughout this report there is a reluctance to express opinions or pass judgment where the weight of evidence appears to warrant it.  That reluctance allowed central figures to rush out exculpatory statements proclaiming their vindication.</P>
      <P>No such reluctance is demonstrated by Mr. Justice McCracken.  Ordinary people are most energised by his willingness to call a spade a spade. Mr. Justice McCracken knows a brazen liar when he sees one.  He can spot a tax dodger at the same distance as Mr. Haughey can shoot duck on his estate.  When something is plainly incredible, unbelievable, contrived or untrue, then the tribunal report calls it incredible, unbelievable, contrived or untrue.  If the evidence is manifestly implausible, as so much of the evidence to the beef tribunal plainly was, then Mr. Justice McCracken calls it implausible.  No matter how powerful the individual, how prestigious his residence or occupation or how large his house extension, there is no reluctance to express opinions or pass judgment where the weight of evidence warrants it.  This will do much to reassure the public who pay their taxes as best they can.  The rest is up to this House and to the independent organs of the State such as the DPP and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>When it did not prove possible to find corruption, Mr. Justice McCracken states as much but quite properly does not leave it at that.  Mr. Haughey's entire lifestyle was dependent on the receipt of substantial gifts from business people. He was therefore in &ldquo;a position of dependency&rdquo; in relation to these wealthy individuals and if such a position were permissible &ldquo;the potential for bribery and corruption would be enormous&rdquo;.  Of equal importance is Mr. Justice McCracken's stated view that democracy itself can be corrupted by the perception that those who make the law are willing to break it.  Within his terms of reference, there was little else Mr. Justice McCracken could do.  Further action lies with this House.  Perhaps it can be said that more consideration might have been given to the making of recommendations for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The picture painted by Mr. Justice McCracken and by Deputy O'Malley's direct experience is a long way from Mr. de Valera's vision of a nation whose citizens might live in frugal comfort.  What would Mr. de Valera have thought of the Gandon mansion, the estate with the roaming thorough-breds, the island, the fine wines and the yacht?  A <Col N="706" /> successor of Mr. de Valera posing as a country squire, a man of the arts, a man of the turf, a great helmsman who embodied the spirit of the nation and who was born in, or with an affinity to, a county in each province, a man who was the possessor both of the common touch and wealthy benefactors.  The persona which Mr. Haughey affected, where Miche·l Mac LiammÛir meets the Great Gatsby, seemed to regard the huge private payments not merely as being permissible but as being the natural order of things.  Just as the chieftains of ancient times lived off the fat of the land, our modern day warrior took it all as his due entitlement.  Others, while almost certainly not knowing any of the details of Mr. Haughey's financial chicanery, also seemed to regard it as the natural order of things.  This was the high point of the new political culture ushered in when the men in mohair suits took over from the men with no arses in their trousers.</P>
    <P>Charles J. Haughey was the arch-practitioner of the new culture in a party where only a few rebelled and a majority willingly did his bidding. Since Mr. Justice McCracken's report, we have been treated to several images of an oppressed Cabinet where grown men and women cowered like children, dreading the footsteps of a drunken, tyrannical father.</P>
    <P>M·ire Geoghegan-Quinn, writing about his volcanic impatience, tells us that Mr. Haughey &ldquo;created a largely anonymous force of high energy individuals bonded to him in a conspiratorial collegiality&rdquo;.  The only thing one can say about that is that it lets most of the Cabinet off the hook.  Lest it does not, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn goes on to explain that there were &ldquo;degrees of closeness to him&rdquo;.  There were the people, she said, who had visited Kinsealy only once, which included Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn on one occasion for just a half an hour according to herself, and there were the people who had &ldquo;spent the evenings at the bar in Kinsealy&rdquo;.  The latter group she says were &ldquo;the real insiders. they were the ones who must have been conscious of the distance between income and spend.  The rest of the party had little sense of the scale of the art collection, the good wines in the cellar or any other evidence of great wealth&rdquo;.  Whatever about the fine wine, the purpose here is clearly to put enough clear water between the columnist and the grand old villain.  In any event, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn demonstrated her independence by continually talking to Deputy O'Malley during divisions.  This unparalleled bravery must be viewed against Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn's memory of watching &ldquo;senior Ministers trembling after Haughey had erupted at them and see them later rush to be near him much as a beaten dog returns to its master&rdquo;&mdash; what an enduring image. This is how the former Minister for Justice characterised those who served with her under Mr. Haughey's rule, the present Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, Ministers Burke, O'Rourke, Woods, Brennan, Walsh, Deputy O'Kennedy and others.  I accept that only those who were called <Col N="707" /> to the bar at Kinsealy can say if former Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's characterisation is fair.</P>
    <P>The refrain has become all too familiar &ldquo;I am clean because I really didn't know him that well and I don't have a wine cellar in the house&rdquo;.  This refrain fundamentally misunderstands what is at issue.  It is not being suggested by anybody in this House or outside of it that when the wine merchants were finished replenishing stocks at Kinsealy they were then despatched to fill up at Athlone, Renmore or Drumcondra with the bill being forwarded to Des Traynor.  The issue is what decisions other Ministers colluded in which they knew, or suspected, were wrong.  Did anyone object to the Carysfort deal?  Did anyone question why countless millions in State aids were conferred on one beef company to the disadvantage of others?  Why was the IDA unlawfully pressurised to help Mr. Goodman?  Why was up to £200 million of public money put at risk to underwrite beef deals with the Saddam Hussein regime for what Mr. Justice Hamilton found to be &ldquo;no economic benefit&rdquo; and when much of the beef was not even Irish?  Did anyone query the manner of the acquisition of the lands and the manner of the awarding of contracts for the IFSC?  Did anyone get curious about who was signing the passports for sale, to whom and why were they being sold and for what benefit?  It appears that when the Masri affair flared most Ministers in Haughey Governments did not even know of the existence of the passports for sale scheme.  When one financial guru sought to justify a fee of £2 million for the Pernod Ricard case by claiming that he had used up his political clout at the highest level, did any serving Minister raise any questions about this?</P>
    <P>What questions were asked about the Telecom affair?  Can the Taoiseach tell the House whether the last minute amendment to the 1994 Finance Bill, introduced by him in respect of provisions relating to the residence of individuals in this State for tax purposes, was designed to help certain wealthy individuals, at least one of whom was connected to the Telecom controversy and who was disclosed to have substantial funds in an offshore account on which significant taxes ought to have been levied?</P>
    <P>Throughout all these controversies we did not hear one word of criticism about the conduct of the main players from any senior figure in Fianna F·il.  When in Opposition, the Progressive Democrats had no doubts about the reason this was the case, as their then Finance spokesperson, Michael McDowell, made clear in the Goodman debate of 2 September 1994.  He stated:</P>
    <P>We have never heard it and I dare say we never will because the reality is that they were bought and stay bought.  They know that Goodman knows where the bodies are buried; they dare not even rebuke this man because they know in their hearts that he has information on them and that he would bring them down like a group of skittles if the truth ever emerged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> That was the Progressive Democrats in Opposition. In Government there are two positions &mdash; one fomented in the experience of Deputy O'Malley and the other in that of the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, the T·naiste, Deputy Harney, who sees no evil and hears no evil these days.  For a politician whose antennae were so sensitive to scandal in Opposition, this is quite remarkable.  Every morning she does a rain check with the Taoiseach that everything is well with the world and then faces into the day personally fortified.</P>
    <P>It is the task of this House to agree the most appropriate terms of reference for a new tribunal of inquiry.  It is not the business of this House to tell the tribunal how to go about its duties. However, the terms of reference are designed to flush out Mr. Haughey's other benefactors and then examine in detail certain transactions, some of which have been adduced in the debate so far this evening.  It may be helpful to suggest that Mr. Lawrence Goodman, Mr. Dermot Desmond and Mr. Pino Harris be invited at the outset to submit statements to the tribunal setting out, in the context of the terms of reference, whether they can be of assistance to the tribunal.  All three have been involved in controversial transactions during Mr. Haughey's time as Taoiseach, and a vivid one has been presented to the House this evening by Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <P>Having acknowledged that the Government has come some way to meet the Opposition parties in the matter of the terms of reference, there remains cause for concern.  I acknowledge that the Government has come some way to meet the Opposition parties.  This is a fair effort by the Government and the direction of what it is seeking to do is right, but there are some specific matters with regard to the terms of reference about which concern still exists.  First, there is the important matter of the preliminary investigations being held in private rather than being left to the discretion of the tribunal.  Second, there is no explicit reference to certain controversial transactions which <i>prima facie</i> would seem to warrant investigation.  Third, it would appear that the Ansbacher accounts may only be investigated as they relate to Mr. Haughey.  This last restriction in particular seems to be mistaken.  Whereas the argument in respect of the reason these accounts as they relate to a former Taoiseach must be investigated is clear, why should other wealthy Irish residents suspected of tax evasion escape scrutiny?</P>
    <P>The paragraph providing for an investigation of how the Revenue Commissioners availed of their powers in respect of Deputy Lowry and Mr. Haughey will provide comfort for tax compliant citizens who are puzzled as to how such conspicuous consumption could have been paraded for so long.  The question arises, however, as to whether the compliant taxpayer is expected to acquiesce in the non-investigation of certain wealthy figures suspected of tax evasion but who happen not to be politicians.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> The focus inevitably in the debate today, in the commentary in the media &mdash; I have not yet heard it &mdash; and in the print media tomorrow will be on politicians, but the ordinary taxpayer finds it difficult to understand how one accountant working for one small bank could assemble a portfolio of £38 million, salted away offshore presumably, and, in the case we know of, evade tax.  That is not to be inquired into in full.  We have an amendment before the House in this regard.  Mr. Justice McCracken was not in a position to conclude that all of that £38 million is evading tax but he clearly stated that the motives of some of those depositors are questionable.  If one is in public life and making laws in this House, and one breaks laws, it is obvious why that ought to be inquired into, but what if we cannot inquire into a particularly wealthy individual who, for example, might have accumulated some money from illegal purposes and salted it away in the same Ansbacher accounts?  I suggest to the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, who has been quite forthcoming in the discussions he has had with the other party leaders, that this should be examined. Why the narrow focus?  Why restrict the investigation of the Ansbacher accounts as they relate only to Mr. Haughey?  That matter must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about public administration and administrative action in relation to the Ansbacher deposits.  In particular, will the Minister for Finance tell us what the Central Bank knew about this matter?  The disclosure that at one stage the deposits comprised almost 35 per cent of the liabilities of Guinness and Mahon Bank would appear to breach the Central Bank's licensing and supervision requirements and standards for banks.  I ask the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach to reply to this question and in particular whether rules 16, 17 and 18 of the supervision requirements and standards were breached.  Is the Central Bank satisfied that it acted in conformity with rules 7 and 10?  Given what is contained in the 11th and 12th schedules of the McCracken report it would seem there are serious questions about the functioning of the regulatory and supervisory system.  There would appear to be serious questions hanging over the role of all the directors and senior management of Guinness and Mahon, both from the point of view of banking law and regulations as well as under the company law code.  Will the Taoiseach say if it is the case that it was the Guinness and Mahon internal auditors in London, and not the Irish management, auditors or authorities, who blew the whistle?  We know now that Innisvickillane was not the only offshore island of interest to Mr. Haughey.  We know now that Mr. Bernard Dunne was not Mr. Haughey's only benefactor, although it is possible that he gave better value than the others.</P>
    <P>The preliminary task of the new tribunal is to uncover the identities of the other main benefactors who kept Mr. Haughey in the style to which he had become accustomed.  In this regard <Col N="710" /> I must express serious reservations, as we have done in direct discussions with the Government, that as the terms of reference now stand these preliminary investigations will be carried out in private.  I cannot understand why the words &ldquo;in private&rdquo; have been inserted and why the matter cannot be left to the discretion of the tribunal.  It was left to the discretion of Mr. Justice McCracken and that worked quite well.</P>
    <P>In his contribution to the House this evening the Taoiseach set out an explanation for the reason the sifting process at the preliminary investigation stage is being conducted in private. He stated: &ldquo;This merely reflects what has become the practice of tribunals in that before taking the oral evidence, counsel for the inquiry, at the direction of the chairman of the tribunal, undertake the collecting of evidence relevant to the tribunal by means of the issuing of orders of discovery or letters of request to examine the witnesses abroad&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said it has become the practice to carry out this sifting process or preliminary investigation in private.  It worked well in the case of McCracken but none of us who was closely involved with the beef tribunal would say it worked particularly well there.  Deputy O'Malley dealt with this at some length and I spoke on it for two hours the day the ceasefire was conveniently called in September l994.  If this is the practice then why insert for the first time the words &ldquo;in private&ldquo;?  Why not leave it to the discretion of the judge?  If the tribunal has had that discretion up to now &mdash; and it has worked well at least in the case of McCracken &mdash; then why not leave it to its discretion in this case also?</P>
    <P>This raises the question already raised by Deputy John Bruton about the membership of the tribunal.  His words are on the record and perhaps they carry more weight than if I said them. However, I wish to underline one aspect of what he said, if it is true that the Government is contemplating the appointment of two or three members to the tribunal then it should think again.  The sole member of the tribunal in this case worked very well.  It also worked very well in the case of Finlay and the hepatitis C issue.  I counsel that the Government should make available to the sole member of the new tribunal technical expertise, for example, in the form of a chartered accountant who has no conflict of interest. It does not appear to be easy to find such a person in this small town but I am sure such a person exists.  The Minister for Finance is better placed than most to run down through a list of names.  If progress is to be made in carrying out the very difficult job we are entrusting to the new tribunal then technical expertise should be put at the disposal of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The euphoria about the McCracken tribunal is partly due to the shock of finding a judge who calls a spade a spade and is prepared to draw sensible common sense judgments and informed opinion, which was not our experience in the case of the beef tribunal.  There is a euphoria outside <Col N="711" /> this House that because McCracken was successful the next tribunal, McCracken Two, will automatically be successful.  I am afraid this does not follow.  The chances of getting the same kind of entrepreneur benefactor with the same eccentric proclivities as Mr. Ben Dunne are not too high. There was a story in the public press about an attempt to nobble Mr. Dunne.  I do not know if that happened but I would not draw the conclusion that every benefactor will be as forthcoming as was Mr. Dunne in this case.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's acceptance at paragraph (k) of the proposal by Democratic Left that the tribunal be asked to make whatever recommendations it considers necessary for the reform of company law.  Whereas the focus has been almost exclusively on politicians and the purchase of political influence, once again the McCracken report gives rise to serious questions about compliance and the adequacy of company law.</P>
    <P>It also gives rise to serious questions about the conduct of some professionals.  Yesterday's move by the Institute of Chartered Accountants to get its retaliation in first simply does not impress.  The well timed announcement that &ldquo;several accountants are to appear before a disciplinary committee due to be set up later this month&rdquo; arising from McCracken is of some interest but I counsel the House not to hold its breath.  When various kinds of skulduggery were unearthed by the beef tribunal what action was taken by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ireland?  The answer is none.</P>
    <P>It is not only the company law provisions governing the actions of directors and executives of companies which require examination but also of accountants and accounting firms in their role as auditors, financial advisers and consultants and the accountancy profession representative organisations as self-regulatory bodies.  For example, in regard to the relationship between Mr. Dunne and Mr. Lowry and their companies the tribunal concluded: &ldquo;It is clear that once the overall contract was agreed Streamline Enterprises existed for one purpose only, namely to perform the contract with the Dunnes Stores group&rdquo;.  Critically it went on to report that: &ldquo;It was agreed that Streamline Enterprises would make a small profit which was envisaged as between £20,000 and £50,000 per annum&rdquo;.  This picture makes a mockery of the theory and conventions of accountancy which is that company accounts convey an objective picture of a company's affairs.  What it conveys is a picture of company executives sitting down together to fabricate a fiction, the declaration of a small profit.  This raises profound questions about the behaviour of the financial director and the common auditors of both Dunnes and Streamline.  The provisions of section 94 of the Finance Act, l983, are absolutely relevant here.</P>
    <P>At least three issues arise.  The treatment of the Faxhill Homes refurbishment raises questions in relation to the behaviour of Mr. Dunne and his <Col N="712" /> financial controller from the point of view of section 94 of the Finance Act, 1983.  Again there are implications for Mr. Dunne from the point of view of his responsibilities and duties as prescribed under the company law code.  In the aftermath of two inquiries into major indigenous Irish enterprises, Goodman and Dunnes, it is difficult to avoid putting the question to Irish business whether these revelations suggest a mode of behaviour in the Irish business community and also among the regulatory professions, in particular the accountancy profession, that calls for deep examination.</P>
    <P>Tax evasion is not a victimless crime.  Deputy Lowry's conduct has let him, his party and this House down.  It is not a defence to say that &ldquo;if I had not entered the public realm everything would be fine and I would today be a wealthy businessman&rdquo;.  However, it begs the question, how many other suppliers had Mr. Dunne in a similar bind?  A further tribunal is painfully necessary to show that our democracy cannot be purchased no matter how impetuously generous the supermarket owner, no matter how dominant the beef baron, no matter how exotic the offshore accounts of the financial guru, no matter how many Japanese trucks are imported or how many race horses are trained or how many acres rezoned.</P>
    <P>It is still an honour to be elected to this House and a privilege to participate in the making of laws which are intended to apply equally to all of our citizens.  A further tribunal is necessary to keep faith with the citizens of this Republic who do their best to pay their taxes.  They need to be reassured that there is not one law for the rich and a different law for the rest.  If a Member of this House is for sale there is nothing we can do to prevent him finding a purchaser if he is determined to do so, but by our words and actions we can demonstrate our conviction that D·il …ireann will not become the play thing of any puppet master, elected or unelected.  We can demonstrate this conviction not merely by a determination to purge the wrong doing of the past but by the rules we establish for the conduct of our affairs, how accountability for decisions of the Executive will operate and how the political process is funded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three Charlie McCreevys speaking in the debate today on the issues before the House.  One of them is the Minister for the Finance who carries responsibility for the Revenue Commissioners, for exchange control and also for certain institutional aspects of the recommendations of the McCracken tribunal.  Another is the elected representative for the people of North Kildare. That constituency and others have benefited from the upsurge of economic activity and the rising standards of living which flowed from a process begun by Fianna F·il in 1987 and broadly pursued by various Governments since that time.  My constituents want the upward spiral of economic betterment to continue and my responsibility to <Col N="713" /> them requires me to approach the issues raised in this debate in a way which ensures that what is said in, and done by, this House does not inadvertently jeopardise what we have gained from the transformation of our economic status or what we stand to gain from its continuance.</P>
      <P>Finally, among the Members of this House, I was probably the most assiduous critic of the acts, omissions and political approaches of one of the two former office holders who are the subjects of the motion before the House.  It is no secret that I was a long-standing critic of Charles Haughey, on one occasion being suspended from the Fianna F·il Parliamentary Party for a brief period for voicing my opinions freely.  I was never intimidated &mdash; perhaps I was meant to be.  I lived with my principles on the backbenches for all of C.J. Haughey's reign as leader of Fianna F·il.  Life for a backbencher who regularly challenges the leader or the leadership style of a parliamentary party, whether in power or hoping shortly to attain it, is never easy.  That is not unique to this country, to Fianna F·il or, in all honesty, to Charles J. Haughey.  Hannibal set out over the Alps with his convoy of innumerable elephants to mount a challenge in the plains.  I did the political equivalent during Mr. Haughey's leadership, but when the day of battle dawned only a band of stragglers remained and I was routed.</P>
      <P>The prospect of some day dancing on the political grave of a triumphant adversary may at times provide the motivation to survive the black night of a backbencher so circumstanced or the incentive to hold on to life in a parliamentary gulag.  If today that opportunity has come, I would willingly forego it.  I feel only sadness and regret at the shadow which recent discoveries have cast over so much achievement by a man who for so long dominated this House, and at the devaluation in the public mind of his sustained contribution to the public good.</P>
      <P>It has been argued that the press and the media were remiss in not pursuing certain issues; that they were subservient to, or soft on, Charles J. Haughey.  Remiss they and we may have been at times but let us not forget two things.  Outside the limited area of personal finance, the general thrust of the media over several decades ranged from outright hostility to acknowledgement tinged with begrudgery or innuendo where both Charles J. Haughey and the Fianna F·il Party were concerned.  Let us remember that there exists a category of media which is uninstitutionalised, unaccountable but tremendously effective &mdash; the medium of rumour and of pub talk &mdash; which can carry clout within this State beyond the wildest dreams of an ambitious press baron.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My grounds for dissent were twofold.  I had expected Mr. Haughey, when he took over as Taoiseach, to call a halt to the profligacy of the 1970s, which created some of the mountain of debt which we face today.  After a brief pause in 1980, when we were eloquently told that as a nation we were living beyond our means, the <Col N="714" /> rake's progress was resumed and the mounting debt further compounded.  The same has to be said of his Fine Gael and Labour successors up to 1987, despite their equally fine rhetorical opening.</P>
    <P>My second ground for dissent was a disagreement with an old style of authoritarian leadership which seemed to demand and reward unquestioning loyalty and obedience, once summed up by a good friend of mine as <i>uno duce, una voce.</i> Despite its apparent revival in certain other jurisdictions, I do not believe it is appropriate to a modern democracy.  Political wisdom does not reside solely in one place.  The appropriate course of action in given circumstances needs to be argued through openly and debated in a free atmosphere before collective decisions are taken and supported.</P>
    <P>I would like to acknowledge some of Mr. Haughey's more lasting achievements.  In his support of Ray MacSharry in 1987 and 1988, he succeeded in putting the economy and the national finances back on a sound course and working with Deputy Bertie Ahern as Minister for Labour he secured the support of the social partners for this.  Since the decisions taken in the late 1980s, the economy has never looked back.  The only pity is that they were not taken much earlier.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to the success of his diplomacy with EU Commission President, Jacques Delors, which led to the first round of Structural Funds on a hitherto unknown scale.  His successors were able to build on this in the second round in Edinburgh.  Imaginative institutions such as the Financial Services Centre and Temple Bar have helped transform the city, not to mention the major contribution of the IFSC to the Exchequer.  As a former Minister for Social Welfare, I am conscious of what he did for the elderly. None of this detracts from the serious position which we are now facing or provides a defence for the matters investigated by the tribunal. In recalling his undoubted service to the State, we must equally in other matters before us today &ldquo;nothing extenuate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Our success as a small nation in a world of competing economies depends on the economic policies which we pursue, the industry and skills of our people and our industrial relations climate. Everyone would accept that, but it is equally and increasingly dependent on the reputation and credibility of our institutions.  Various organisations produce league tables of countries in terms of their comparative institutional probity.  We rank high on those tables, a fact which influences decisions on investments, job location and the purchase of our products.</P>
    <P>What has been disclosed before Mr. Justice McCracken may well have caused some slight slippage in our position on those league tables and, in consequence, created a less benign perception of us in boardrooms across the world.  Let us not, through over-reaction or the quest for partisan advantage, set in train arrangements which, on the basis of nothing more than rumour or <Col N="715" /> hunch, will alter our standing as an investment destination or make life more difficult for Irish companies.</P>
    <P>If there is corruption or wrongdoing in our public life, let us set out rationally and clearly to locate and eradicate it.  Surgery is sometimes essential to the health of the body politic, but we must not give vague rumours, pub talk or malicious allegations a status they do not deserve by embarking on a series of investigations for which they alone provide the fuel.  Exploratory operations weaken the healthy.  We should not embark on them unless some sound diagnosis precedes them.  That is the approach the Government is proposing in this House today.  Our motion equips a tribunal to investigate specific material which has come to light from Justice McCracken's investigation and enables that new tribunal to determine, where it sees a <i>prima facie</i> case for the investigation of connected matters, to pursue whatever lines of inquiry it thinks appropriate.</P>
    <P>The success of the McCracken Tribunal, the speed with which it was completed and the succinctness of its findings should not blind us to the fact that previous tribunals have taken much time and resulted in findings which did not always allay public disquiet.  Wide-ranging terms of reference for a tribunal may require a cast of hundreds of witnesses and the gap that can arise between the taking of evidence on a particular matter and the publication of findings can create difficulties for persons and businesses which are called to provide evidence even where the findings exonerate them.</P>
    <P>I know from my time as Minister for Tourism and Trade that foreign competitors are not slow to exploit this situation to the detriment of Irish businesses.  The formula which the Government has put before this House, and which factors into the terms of reference a stage of preliminary investigation in which the procedure and reporting arrangements will be substantially at the tribunal's discretion, is designed to minimise the danger of damage to individuals or firms from unwarranted public attention.</P>
    <P>I will deal with two aspects of the report of the tribunal, namely, the findings regarding tax evasion on the part of the individuals concerned and the recommendation that candidates for the D·il and Seanad should be &ldquo;tax cleared&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of the tax affairs of the individuals in question and any individual in the State is a matter solely for the Revenue Commissioners. The Minister for Finance does not get involved in such cases for obvious reasons.  This is the position which has been accepted in the House since the foundation of the State.  I understand that my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, on radio recently entirely endorsed that position.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have already made it clear, following the tribunal report, that any action needed to uphold the implementation of the tax code in the light of the information <Col N="716" /> contained in the report is being taken.  This does not prevent me from expressing a view on the total unacceptability of tax evasion no matter who engages in it.  This unacceptability is all the more reinforced when the persons accused are, or have themselves been, lawmakers passing laws to levy and collect such taxes.  Nor am I prevented from seeking a review by Revenue of their existing powers, which are substantial, in the light of the findings of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Immediately on publication of the report, my Department requested the Revenue Commissioners to carry out such a review in conjunction with the Department of Finance.  If additional powers are required and these are shown to be desirable and likely to be effective they will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I will briefly refer to what the leader of the Opposition, Deputy John Bruton said in the course of his address relating to the tax amnesty of the 1990s.  He said:</P>
    <P>These accusations of tax evasion were publicly known to be before the beef tribunal in 1993 when the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, drew up the detailed terms of his tax amnesty.  The justification for this unjust amnesty was that it was supposed to bring in unknown potential tax liabilities.  The then Minister knew that the Goodman Group had been accused of tax evasion before the beef tribunal. This was a known potential tax liability, not an unknown one.  Despite this knowledge, he carefully drafted the tax amnesty provisions of his Finance Bill not to exclude firms from eligibility even though the taxes which might have been evaded were the subject of investigation before a tribunal.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Bruton, or someone on his behalf, has inadvertently made an incorrect assumption in researching his speech.  The tax amnesty Bill known as the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, was commented upon following the publication of the beef tribunal report.  The Revenue Commissioners then issued a statement on 4 August 1994 which stated:</P>
    <P>In view of comments and speculation in the media arising from the references to the tax liabilities of the Goodman Group in the report of the beef tribunal, the Revenue Commissioners wish to clarify certain matters relating to the tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>The relevant legislation provided essentially for two types of amnesty.  The first amnesty did not apply to companies.  It allowed individuals to settle their tax affairs by paying 15 per cent of the relevant income or gains.  The second, or general amnesty applied to both individuals and companies.  It allowed them to settle their liabilities by paying all outstanding tax in full. They did not, however, have to pay interest or penalties.</P>
    <P>In order to avail of the general amnesty, the taxpayer had to pay the full amount of tax in question by 14 January 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> Perhaps Deputy John Bruton and his advisers were misled on this matter.  From my professional knowledge, I can assure him the incentive amnesty, which the hullabaloo concerned, did not apply to companies, as is referred to in the Revenue Commissioner's statement.  The Revenue Commissioners found it necessary, immediately on publication of the beef tribunal report and following comment in the media, to issue that statement. What Deputy John Bruton said tonight is incorrect in so far as it relates to companies.  He said then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, carefully drafted the tax amnesty provisions of his Finance Bill not to exclude firms from eligibility. This is incorrect as regards the incentive amnesty. The Revenue Commissioners issued its statement to explain the position, which upheld what was in the tax amnesty of 1993.  The incentive amnesty did not apply to companies, which I and most accountants would know.</P>
    <P>The last major change in revenue powers was given effect in the 1992 Finance Act, brought in by the current Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance.  The principal new powers were; the provision on an automatic basis of &ldquo;third party&rdquo; returns to revenue by certain persons receiving income on behalf of others, or persons making payments to, or on behalf of, others, for example, letting agents, traders making payments for services, persons receiving income belonging to others &mdash; such returns were to be made previously only on request by revenue; reporting arrangements for domestic institutions in relation to the opening of foreign bank accounts by Irish residents; extra powers for revenue to enter business premises to search for and examine or remove tax records; powers for revenue, when dissatisfied with the tax accounts of a taxpayer, to seek details from business suppliers or customers; increased powers for revenue, when dissatisfied with the return, to require a person to give a statement of affairs showing his or her assets and liabilities; wider powers of attachment of amounts owed by a third party to a taxpayer who has defaulted in paying tax; the introduction of tax clearance requirements for pub licences which extended to other excise licences, for example, betting shops, in the Finance Act, 1993; new penalties to counter the destruction, defacement and concealment of business records and books and imposed minimum mandatory fines in certain circumstances, and extended inspection powers for revenue in relation to tax records and in particular in relation to computer records and accounts. Members of the House may recall there was a considerable outcry, both in and out of the House, against the then Minister when he introduced these provisional measures in the 1993 Act. Many people were disconcerted and said the powers went too far.</P>
    <P>The powers were further extended in 1993 and penalties for tax evasion were significantly increased, in conjunction with the introduction of the tax amnesty.  In relation to bank accounts, the Revenue Commissioners are empowered to seek <Col N="718" /> access through the courts to the bank accounts of named individuals resident in the State.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the existence of these powers is an important factor in underpinning voluntary compliance with the tax laws by the vast majority of taxpayers. Where necessary, the powers are formally brought into play by revenue in support of their investigations.  It is important that the right balance be maintained so that adequate powers are available and their use is targeted mainly on those actually evading tax.</P>
    <P>I know the Revenue Commissioners have been active in recent years in streamlining their operations to facilitate pursuit of tax evasion.  A large number of staff has been placed on audit and investigation work.  In 1996 this work yielded £133 million in tax receipts.  I know from personal observation, and I am sure the House knows, that Revenue have transformed their whole approach to tax administration in the past ten years and how this has played a significant part in the increased tax revenues we are now experiencing. We should compliment Revenue for the professional and practical approach they take and for the way they have made the changes to tax collection and administration in recent years.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the commissioners that in keeping with their commitment to show they are tough on tax evasion, Revenue has designed and put in place arrangements to secure a more effective prosecution policy.  As part of this a prosecution policy unit established during 1996 now directs the approach to prosecution of tax cases and provides guidance and support to the field officers.  Officers have been trained during the year in matters relevant to criminal investigation, in particular on the evidential requirements to achieve a successful prosecution.  Under the new arrangements some cases will now be handled by Revenue without the involvement of the Garda.  A number of such cases have already been reported to the DPP and court proceedings have been initiated.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the part played by my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, in promoting a number of these changes and in making clear his interest and concern that more resources be devoted to the prosecution aspect of serious tax evasion cases.  I too have made it clear to Revenue that the recent innovations should be developed and built upon. It is important to be able to show clearly to people who obey the law that those who do otherwise in their tax affairs will face a real and imminent possibility of prosecution.</P>
    <P>Turning to tax clearance for individual candidates for D·il and Senate elections, the Government accepts the tribunal's recommendation on foot of a proposal put to the tribunal by counsel for Fianna F·il.  Tax clearance is already widely used for applications by individuals or companies for grants of more than £500 from the State and for the issue of licences such as excise licences.  It also applies to awarding of public sector contracts exceeding £5,000 in any 12 month period.  My <Col N="719" /> Department has asked the Revenue Commissioners, who administer tax clearance, to examine the practical aspects of applying tax clearance in the case of D·il and Senate candidates. Such practical issues relate, for example, to the information or declarations to be required from applicants and the time schedule which would be involved for applications, given the limited time before an election in which tax clearance will be sought.  I am sure both Houses will wish to debate this proposal in detail when legislation comes forward to give effect to it.</P>
    <P>On the exchange control issues raised by the tribunal report and referred to by Deputy Rabbitte, the report said two payments were made into Isle of Man bank accounts by Mr. Ben Dunne for the benefit of Mr. Michael Lowry.  It said &ldquo;these accounts were opened and the monies paid in this way with the intention of enabling Mr. Michael Lowry to have money in an offshore account, contrary to the exchange control legislation then in being, and to assist him in evading tax&rdquo;.  It made no such statement about the payments to Mr. Charles Haughey.</P>
    <P>Exchange controls existed here under the Exchange Control Acts, in force from 1954 to 1992.  Exchange controls were fully in force until 1988.  In that year a process of liberalisation was initiated, which eliminated all exchange controls by the end of 1992.  Exchange controls were directed at transactions which involved the transfer of funds either to or from the State which did not relate to normal travel, trade or other commercial activities.  Irish residents were not permitted to hold offshore accounts without specific authority.</P>
    <P>On Monday, 25 August 1997, the day the report was published, my Department wrote to the Central Bank, to which in 1965 day-to-day administration of exchange controls was delegated on behalf of the Minister for Finance.  The Central Bank was asked to instigate a detailed investigation of the issues raised by the report in its references to exchange controls.  My Department asked that the report of this investigation be conveyed to it as soon as possible.  Contacts with the Central Bank in recent days indicate that, in view of the volume of records to be examined and the need for the Bank to consult a number of banks, the process will take some time. However, the Central Bank has informed me it hopes it will be possible to send a comprehensive reply to the Department by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>If the Central Bank finds that apparent breaches of exchange controls occurred, my Department will then send the papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration as to whether proceedings on indictment should be initiated.</P>
    <P>On the institutional front, the tribunal felt that rather than have a new institution investigate breaches of the Ethics Act, that task might be entrusted to the Ombudsman.  While I have every sympathy with Mr. Justice McCracken's anxiety <Col N="720" /> to avoid the creation of yet another organisation, I must admit to some doubts about the appropriateness of assigning that task to a single nonjudicial office holder whose office has a radically different basic function.  The Government has already signalled its intention to establish a Public Ethics Commission and its precise form and powers will be set out in legislation which I will shortly put before the Government.</P>
    <P>In the past, passionately held views on the Constitution and external relationships of this State divided our people.  In the absence of such fundamental divisions, it is probably inevitable that personality should now provide much of the focus for political discussion in this House or in the country at large.  Nevertheless, the level of personal as distinct from political antagonism in this House has been mercifully low in my years here. The work we are doing today is unusual in that it requires all of us to acknowledge circumstances which may call into question the personal actions of two men who served with us in this House. Most of us are grateful the task of sifting the evidence and reaching a conclusion on it falls, quite properly, to an independent tribunal.  My colleagues and I believe the mandate we are giving to that body is crafted, as far as is humanly possible, to ensure a fair and prompt conclusion and to provide both Deputy Lowry and Mr. Charles Haughey with every opportunity to vindicate their names which stood high in the esteem of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>As many people in the House have said, the Honourable Mr. Justice McCracken has done an excellent job.  This House owes him a debt of gratitude.  I thank the members of the legal team who assisted him, the registrar of the tribunal and the administrative staff.  The report is a model which I have no doubt will be emulated by those who have the onerous task of drawing up reports of any other tribunals which the Houses of the Oireachtas may put in place.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference drawn up by the rainbow coalition Government, and in particular the input of the Attorney General to that Government, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, have had a major bearing on the efficacy of the McCracken tribunal. Comparisons have been made between the McCracken tribunal and the beef tribunal and their respective reports.  The key difference was in the terms of reference.  The beef tribunal's terms of reference were broad and ill-defined. The terms of reference given to Judge McCracken were focused and measured.  The then Government decided what precisely it wanted the tribunal to investigate and because the tribunal and its personnel had a clearly defined job they were greatly assisted in the performance of that task by the riding instructions they received in the terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should all remember that in the course of this debate.  It is almost a rule of tribunals that their efficiency and success will be in direct proportion <Col N="721" /> to the clarity of the terms of reference under which they operate.  I will return to this issue later.</P>
    <P>The McCracken report established that Mr. Ben Dunne made payments both to Mr. Haughey and Mr. Lowry.  It established the manner in which these payments were made.  It established that the payments made to Mr. Lowry were payments for work carried out by him for Dunnes Stores.  There was no commercial relationship, however, between Mr. Haughey and Dunnes Stores.  The payments made by Mr. Dunne to Mr. Haughey originated from Mr. Dunne's generosity.</P>
    <P>The McCracken tribunal also established that in the cases of both Deputy Lowry and Mr. Haughey no evidence exists that either acted in office to confer any favours on Mr. Dunne or Dunnes Stores as a result of the payments made.</P>
    <P>The report paints an appalling vista of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, receiving huge sums of money to support his extravagant lifestyle. It shows how these sums of money were channelled through offshore accounts and how Mr. Haughey denied all knowledge of this until the tribunal had established independently that he had received the sums of money claimed by Mr. Dunne and in the manner described by Mr. Dunne.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has left much unfinished business. It has not, however, dodged any of the issues and it indicates clearly what must now be done.  It states in the most unambiguous terms that Mr. Haughey obstructed the work of the tribunal.  It states quite unambiguously that the tribunal does not believe Mr. Haughey's evidence.  Most importantly, it has referred the report to the DPP and has requested the DPP to adjudicate on whether Mr. Haughey has committed an offence under section 1(2) of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 as amended by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979.</P>
    <P>In respect of both Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry the report makes it quite clear that there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of tax evasion and that the Revenue Commissioners have an obligation to investigate the financial affairs of both men.  It is quite clear also from the McCracken report that Judge McCracken does not regard this as the end of the affair.  While he does not specifically recommend another tribunal to move forward from the destination at which he has arrived, it is clear from the tone of the report that he believes a new tribunal is necessary.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's decision to set up a second tribunal.  I also welcome the consultations which the Government had with Fine Gael regarding the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>We agree with the broad thrust of the terms of reference.  We want terms of reference which are sufficiently focused to ensure that the tribunal's work is carried out as efficiently as that of its predecessor. However, they must also be wide enough to ensure that all the matters of public <Col N="722" /> concern which arise from the McCracken report are dealt with in a new tribunal.  Fine Gael believes the terms of reference are deficient in two major areas.  We have tabled amendments to widen the scope of the terms of reference and to amend what we regard as the deficiencies.</P>
    <P>We are proposing to include the question of whether the parliamentary allowance, known as the leader's allowance, paid to Mr. Charles Haughey as leader of the Opposition in the 1980s out of State funds was used either in whole or in part to discharge moneys or debts due by Mr. Haughey, by any company of which he was associated or by any connected person to Mr. Charles Haughey within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.  In the event that the tribunal finds that such funds were used either in whole or in part in such manner, we propose that it should make whatever recommendations it considers necessary to ensure that in future such funds are not used for personal or non-political purposes.  We believe there is some evidence to suggest that the leader's allowance paid to Mr. Haughey while in Opposition was not used solely to cover expenditure by the Fianna F·il Party but was spent by Mr. Haughey at his sole discretion to cover political and non-political liabilities.  If this is not so, the present Taoiseach can correct the record quickly by showing that the leader's allowance was properly dealt with within the Fianna F·il Party.  If the Fianna F·il Party accounts do not put this issue beyond doubt, then it should be inquired into by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>All parties in this House are agreed that the best way to proceed is to follow the money trail to establish if large donations, other than those paid by Mr. Ben Dunne, were used by Mr. Haughey to underpin his extravagant lifestyle. The leader's allowance is part of the money trail. Its accumulated value during those years in the 1980s when Mr. Haughey was leader of the Opposition amounted to approximately £1 million. Fine Gael believes this must be investigated at least in the initial stages during the private sessions of the new tribunal.  If <i>prima facie</i> evidence is established that the money was not spent for the purposes for which it was intended, that is, for normal political expenses of the biggest political party in this country, then it should be included in the full public inquiry which is envisaged under the terms of reference of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that the aspect of the tribunal report which has shocked compliant taxpayers more than any other is the revelation that £38 million was lodged by Irish residents in offshore accounts, yet they had full access to the money through so-called memorandum accounts at Guinness Mahon.  There is widespread belief that there is massive tax evasion.  This belief by compliant taxpayers has been reinforced by the enormous amounts of money which accrued to the Exchequer in the course of the two tax amnesties introduced by Fianna F·il Ministers for Finance.  Despite the best efforts of the Revenue Commissioners in recent years, compliant taxpayers <Col N="723" /> still believe there is one set of rules for PAYE taxpayers and that other rules or no rules at all apply to certain fat cat residents.</P>
    <P>The revelations in respect of the Ansbacher accounts have added to this belief and have angered taxpayers.  The public wants the Ansbacher accounts investigated.  The terms of reference proposed by the Government will only allow investigation of any donation which may have been made to Mr. Haughey or to current or former office holders.  The present terms of reference will not allow the new tribunal to investigate the non-political Ansbacher accounts.  Mr. Justice McCracken points out that he has no doubt that some of these accounts were held for legitimate purposes, but he also clearly indicates that he believes others were not held for legitimate purposes.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is proposing an amendment to widen the terms of reference to enable the tribunal to investigate the Ansbacher accounts, as referred to and identified in chapter 6 of the report of the tribunal of inquiry, to identify in so far as possible the procedures used whereby Irish depositors of such accounts could have their moneys offshore with no record of their deposits in Ireland, to report whether such a system was used by the depositors to evade the payment of tax or was in contravention of exchange control legislation and to recommend all necessary steps to prevent such mechanisms being used to avoid the payment of tax.  We believe the public interest requires the broadening of the terms of reference to empower the tribunal to carry out this investigation.</P>
    <P>I cannot establish what the Government's position is on this matter.  In an interview on the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo;, which I understand was pre-recorded, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was of the view that Mr. Justice McCracken could continue his work under the terms of reference of the original tribunal, that he was empowered to identify the beneficiaries of all the Ansbacher accounts and that he could require the Revenue Commissioners to investigate possible cases of tax evasion.  The Minister is clearly in error in his belief.  The terms of reference of the McCracken tribunal confine Mr. Justice McCracken's inquiry to payments made by Mr. Ben Dunne, Dunnes Stores and associated companies.  The McCracken tribunal has no power to investigate the accounts of other citizens unconnected with Mr. Ben Dunne, Dunnes Stores or the associated companies.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of the view that a new tribunal acting in accordance with the terms of reference proposed by the Government may only investigate the Ansbacher accounts in so far as they relate to Mr. Haughey or current or former office holders.  It may not investigate Ansbacher accounts opened for the purpose of tax evasion or for avoiding exchange control regulations.</P>
    <P>The public has been horrified by the revelations contained in the McCracken report.  The <Col N="724" /> public wants to ensure a clean political system and that holders of public office are not corrupt. This is the public's first priority as it examines what we are doing in the House today and the terms of reference we put in place for the new tribunal.  They will not forgive this House, however, if we miss the opportunity to enable the new tribunal to investigate the Ansbacher accounts and to expose tax evasion or breaches of exchange regulations, if that occurred.  The Fine Gael amendment will enable the new tribunal to do this.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend that the Government accept this change in the terms of reference because the public, who will scrutinise us more critically now than ever before, will not be satisfied if we confine this solely to the issue of possible political payments through the Ansbacher accounts and possible favours conferred on foot of those payments.  They will want the wider issue of the possibility of tax evasion and breaches of exchange control regulations to be examined also. Compliant taxpayers will not be satisfied with the terms of reference we are now debating.  In the interests of having a proper tribunal which will satisfy public concern, I recommend that the Government accept the Fine Gael amendment and widen the scope of the terms of reference along the lines suggested.</P>
    <P>We are also proposing other constructive amendments which will improve the clarity of the terms of reference.  I will deal with those at the end of my contribution.  The two amendments I have dealt with in some detail are different from the others as they significantly extend the scope of the next inquiry without damaging the focused nature of the terms of reference.  As I have already said, they accord fully with the major public concerns which remain in respect of the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I will now comment briefly on the recommendations made in the report.  The action taken by the previous Government in the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1995, has provided Members of this House with a new and crystal clear mandate in respect of what is ethical or unethical in public office or in the conduct of general elections, particularly in respect of expenditure and donations connected with election campaigns.  The tribunal in its recommendations acknowledges this and &ldquo;considers in particular that it should be highly effective in monitoring ordinary political donations&rdquo;. Mr. Justice McCracken also said that the combined effect of the two Acts put in place by the Government, of which I was proud to be a member, amounts to a &ldquo;commendable attempt to ensure that the unacceptable elements of the financial transactions of which Mr. Michael Lowry and Mr. Charles Haughey were part will not be repeated&rdquo;.  It points out, however, that the legislation may not go far enough as many of the payments made to Deputy Lowry and Mr. Haughey were made offshore, in a manner veiled in secrecy <Col N="725" /> and in an attempt to ensure they remained undiscovered.</P>
    <P>What Mr. Justice McCracken is saying, in effect, is that those who would get involved in offshore accounts and mechanisms of such secrecy are unlikely to comply with the law in respect of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, unless the sanctions are particularly onerous and he recommends a strengthening of the sanctions. Fine Gael welcomes the recommendations of the tribunal to make sanctions and penalties for breaches of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, more onerous.</P>
    <P>We also welcome the suggestion that consideration should be given to extending the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to enable an independent third party to investigate possible breaches of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.  I have just heard the Minister for Finance expressing a different view.  It is obviously a matter which would concern everybody in the House and it should be debated fully.  We should find an agreed way of going further than the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, has gone in the light of the new information and circumstances which prevail.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael also agrees that it should be mandatory on candidates for election to either House of the Oireachtas to produce to the Clerk of the D·il or Seanad, as the case may be, a certificate from such person's tax inspector that his or her tax affairs are in order and this should be accompanied by a statutory declaration by the person concerned to that effect.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with the recommendations in the McCracken report is a very short one. There are no earth-shattering proposals to clean up Irish politics contained in these recommendations. Mr. Justice McCracken believes, quite rightly in my opinion, that the two Acts introduced by the previous Government and enacted by the Oireachtas, to which I have referred, have provided an adequate framework for those of us now in the D·il and Seanad.  It is a tribute to the thoroughness of both Acts that Mr. Justice McCracken makes only a small number of recommendations and that none of them is an issue of magnitude.</P>
    <P>When the McCracken report was first published many Members of the House and commentators in the media were of the view that a new tribunal should investigate a series of controversial Government decisions made while Mr. Charles Haughey was Taoiseach.  These range from the sale of Carysfort College, the Masri affair, the passports for sale scheme and the beef tribunal, and we heard the list recited again in this House this evening.  Every commentator and every Member of the Opposition seems to have his or her own list but there are a number of issues which appear on all lists.  Wiser counsel has now prevailed and the tribunal in the first instance will operate along the lines of the advice given by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy John Bruton, and follow the money trail.  If the <Col N="726" /> money trail leads back to the beneficiaries of those Government decisions, then a <i>prima facie</i> case will have been established that these decisions were not due merely to political incompetence but that political corruption occurred, and that is where the circle would be completed and the tribunal would get down to very serious business.</P>
    <P>I want to examine two issues arising from the beef tribunal in which I have a strong interest to illustrate what I mean, namely, the issue of export credit insurance and the IDA package for the beef industry.  In both cases the Goodman group of companies was the principal beneficiary.</P>
    <P>I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, abolished export credit insurance for beef exports to Iraq in May-June 1986.  I did this after a thorough examination of the risk of continuing the cover after being advised to do so by my officials at the Department of Industry and Commerce and after consultation with Government colleagues. The incoming Government led by Mr. Charles Haughey, with Deputy Albert Reynolds as Minister for Industry and Commerce, restored the export credit insurance scheme in respect of beef exports to Iraq and the principal beneficiary of that action was the Goodman group.  The facts in respect of these events have been frequently recited in this House.  Charge and counter charge have been made and nothing has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.  It is appropriate that the issue should be revisited in the context of what we now know about payments made to Mr. Haughey.  I am not challenging anybody's moral worth or the personal integrity of Deputy Reynolds as I revisit these issue.  I believe, however, that the public has never been fully satisfied in respect of these decisions and if the new tribunal, as it follows the money trail, arrives at the beef industry, then the decisions made by the Fianna F·il Government in 1987 must be examined by any new tribunal in this light and context.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the beef tribunal in 1994 when the D·il was recalled at the end of the recess, the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy John Bruton, set out the charges arising from Mr. Justice Hamilton's report which Deputy Bruton and Fine Gael believed Deputy Reynolds should answer.  Deputy Reynolds failed to answer them then or since and I would like to recall some of these for the benefit of the House.  In this section of my speech I will refer extensively to the speech made by Deputy John Bruton in the course of the debate on the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry on 1 September 1994.</P>
    <P>On 8 September 1987 the Cabinet agreed to raise the ceiling on export credit insurance to Iraq to £150 million.  In so doing, it left the overall limit for export credit insurance generally unchanged at £300 million worldwide.  Therefore, the Cabinet had decided that Irish exporters to markets other than Iraq were to be denied cover because so much of the cover was now to be concentrated on Iraq, a market in which the risk of non-payment was exceptionally high.  This serious <Col N="727" /> Cabinet decision was proposed by Deputy Reynolds on the basis of a memorandum circulated by him at the Cabinet meeting on 8 September 1987.  This memorandum set out the special conditions on which this extra cover for Iraq was to be granted: (a) a maximum of 70 per cent cover would only be allowed for any contract; (b) a maximum credit period of one year as opposed to the normal six months for low risk countries; (c) a claims waiting period of 12 months as opposed to the normal six month period for low risk countries; (d) a minimum premium rate of 4 per cent of full contract value as opposed to the usual 0.04 per cent for good risk countries; and (e) cover would be provided only to exporters in respect of whom claims because of non-payment had not arisen in Iraq or who had been subsequently paid.  The increased cover for Iraq was specifically agreed by the Government on these five conditions on 8 September, yet that very afternoon Deputy Reynolds, as Minister, started to break the conditions of the Cabinet decision.  At 4 p.m.  that day he met Mr. Oliver Murphy of Hibernia Meats and Mr. Paschal Phelan of Master Meats, a man who was not unknown to him.  At that meeting he awarded £10 million cover to Hibernia Meats with a credit period of 18 months.  By doing so, he had within hours broken two of the conditions on which the Cabinet had on that morning agreed the extra cover for Iraq.  First, he had granted a credit period of 18 months whereas the Government had decided that the maximum period was one year. Second, he had awarded cover to Hibernia Meats, a company from which claims had arisen in Iraq and in respect of which payments were still outstanding.</P>
    <P>Six days later, on 14 September, Deputy Reynolds, as Minister, broke even more of the conditions set by the Government on 8 September, this time for the benefit of the Goodman organisation.  He agreed to give Goodman 80 per cent cover whereas the Government conditions specified 70 per cent.  He cut the claims waiting period for Goodman to six months, not the year specified at Government.  He cut the premium charged to Goodman on the Iraqi contract to 1 per cent as against the 4 per cent specified by the Government.  This premium concession constituted on its own a gift of £2.74 million from the taxpayer to the Goodman organisation.  This cut-rate premium of 1 per cent contrasted not only with the 4 per cent being charged to other exporters in the scheme but with a market rate premium of between 15 and 24 per cent which Mr. Goodman would have had to pay if he had insured his contract for Iraq on the commercial market.  The Goodman organisation was getting a clear cash benefit as a direct consequence of Deputy Reynolds breaking the terms of the Cabinet decision.  This special 4 per cent premium was advanced in the memorandum for Government as one of only three arguments in favour of giving Iraq a larger share of the total amount of export <Col N="728" /> credit available, almost half of the total market. Yet that argument was ignored within hours of the decision being taken.  No additional jobs would result from the gift of £2.74 million to the Goodman organisation because the Goodman group had the deal which was going to create the jobs in the bag for the previous two months.</P>
    <P>The Minister's actions were a clear and deliberate breach of a Cabinet decision and this has never been fully explained.</P>
    <P>The way in which Deputy Reynolds dealt with granting export credit to other companies was arbitrary and unfair.  At the meeting on 8 September between Deputy Reynolds and Mr. Paschal Phelan, the owner of Master Meats, Mr. Oliver Murphy, the owner of Hibernia Meats, was also present.  Mr. Murphy had been making representations, directly and indirectly, to Deputy Reynolds to no avail.  He was trying to get a piece of the action in respect of export credit insurance cover which, until then, had been made exclusively available to the Goodman organisation.  The difficulty was Hibernia Meats was owed money by Iraq and the Minister had made it clear up to then that any company owed money by that country would not receive cover.</P>
    <P>However, at this remarkable meeting, to which no officials from the Minister's Department were invited to attend, out of the blue and without explanation Deputy Reynolds did an about face on the question of issuing export credit insurance cover to Hibernia Meats.  Suddenly the Cabinet decision did not matter and Deputy Reynolds, at a meeting attended by himself and two others but not by officials from the Department of Industry and Commerce or a representative of the insurance company ICI, decided to issue export credit insurance to Hibernia Meats.  At that meeting the Deputy agreed to provide £10 million export credit cover to Master Meats, the company of his friend Mr. Paschal Phelan who was also present.  This was an amazing decision because there was no record of Master Meats having applied to the Minister, the Department of Industry and Commerce or ICI for export credit insurance cover in respect of Iraq.  Master Meats had no contract to export beef to Iraq when it was offered the £10 million cover and subsequently made little attempt to negotiate a contract.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that, shortly after, a host of beef exporting companies which had negotiated contracts with Iraq were refused cover.  Master Meats did not use the cover provided by Deputy Reynolds but transferred it to Hibernia Meats.  We do not know whether this was done at no cost or for a commercial consideration. However, the worth of what was transferred to Hibernia Meats in terms of cover in the marketplace amounted to £1.7 million.  Master Meats never applied for cover.  However, due to the attendance of its principal officer at the meeting in question, it received such cover.</P>
    <P>From this series of decisions, it can be seen that Deputy Reynolds flagrantly overrode the <Col N="729" /> Government decision he sought in Cabinet that morning.  He did so in the absence of civil servants and, therefore, no minutes of the meeting were taken and there is no record of the decisions made.  Deputy Reynolds played favourites in issuing export credit insurance.  He favoured the Goodman companies, Hibernia Meats and Master Meats to the exclusion of other beef companies. He also provided exclusive advance information about future Government plans for export credit to the Goodman Group, which gave it the inside track and amounts, in effect, to insider dealing.  The Goodman Group knew the price it could charge in Iraq because it knew it would receive cover.  This is plain from the written evidence presented to the beef tribunal.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of Deputy Reynolds' decision in respect of export credit insurance have been debated in the D·il on a number of occasions. However, in light of the findings of the McCracken tribunal and if in pursuit of the money trail a personal money link is established between the favoured meat companies and the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, the issue of export credit insurance already investigated by the beef tribunal would have to be re-investigated by the new tribunal.  I believe that the infamous package in respect of the Goodman Group of companies forced on the IDA by the then Government will also have to be re-investigated.</P>
    <P>The beef tribunal report shows that while Deputy Reynolds was the Minister responsible for protecting the statutory independence of the Industrial Development Authority he allowed the then Taoiseach to pre-empt the role of the IDA by meeting the Goodman Group in connection with details of its negotiations with the IDA without the knowledge of the authority.  Deputy Reynolds allowed a press conference to be called in respect of the Goodman beef project before the grant agreement was signed and before the authority had met to decide whether to accept his decision.  This completely compromised the statutory independence of the IDA, an independence which, as Minister for Industry and Commerce under the 1986 Act, the Deputy had overall statutory responsibility to protect.  Before that he allowed the Goodman package to go straight before Cabinet over a weekend.  This allowed the Department of Finance one working day to examine the package worth £120 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds was involved in a Government decision which, in the words of the beef tribunal report &ldquo;wrongly and in excess of its powers directed the IDA to remove the performance clause from the grant agreement being negotiated between the IDA and the Goodman Group.&rdquo; This was another extraordinary decision which could be put down to a mixture of high-handedness or incompetence.</P>
    <P>In retrospect, as the new tribunal proceeds with its work, if the money trail ties in the favoured beef companies with significant payments to Mr. Charles Haughey to underpin his lifestyle, the door will again open on these incidents.  There are <Col N="730" /> an entire series of such incidents and I could refer to them at length.  However, I referred to one example with which I am particularly familiar.  I have made my point and I am aware that other Members of my party will do likewise in respect of other inexplicable decisions.</P>

      <P>In discussing the serious issues being addressed we would all do well to recall how this House and the institutions of the State came into existence.  The republican democracy we cherish today was won for the Irish people by deeply committed and dedicated men and women who, during years of struggle, put their lives on the line to create a new Irish state in which all citizens would stand equal under the law.  The leaders included visionaries and scholars, but the broader ranks of those who bore the brunt of the struggle were very ordinary people &mdash; trade union members from urban factories, sons and daughters of small farmers, tradesmen and shop assistants.</P>
      <P>I am sure that, while these men and women were decent and courageous, few of them would or could claim to be saints.  I imagine, for instance, that very few of them would presume to personify the ideal held by Pearse when he said that &ldquo;splendid and holy causes are served by splendid and holy men&rdquo;.  They understood that among the broad mass of humanity, very few could ever meet that idealistic concept of Padraig Pearse.  However, they had lived under an alien regime where class and privilege entrenched its own form of inequality and corruption.  They rightly expected that those who would serve in the political life and administration of the new Irish State would adhere to high standards and that their prime motivation would be, at all times, the public good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking back over the decades since the State was established, we can take pride in the fact that the overwhelming majority of those of all political persuasions who served the State have done so with integrity and honour.  This is as it should be. It is what our people have a right to expect.  That is why the matters which came to light during the McCracken tribunal have caused so much public dismay.  They have also inevitably led to much questioning of our political and administrative system and, as is evident from recent opinion polls, much cynicism about the motives and bone fides of those of us who have chosen to make politics our life's work.  That cynicism is unjustified and unfair not only to the overwhelming majority of the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas but also to the many hundreds of men and women who give dedicated and often scantily <Col N="731" /> acknowledged service as members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>While, as I stated, that cynicism is generally unjustified, it is, in the current post-McCracken climate, understandable.  For that reason, we have a duty to ourselves and to all who serve in political life at national and local level to address its root causes and explore these particular instances of inappropriate behaviour.  By so doing, we give a clear signal to the community at large and to all those aspiring to political office that we expect and require correct and proper standards from all who are privileged to discharge the affairs of the nation.  In Government and in this House we are about the people's business, not our personal business.</P>
    <P>The proposed tribunal is mandated and empowered to go as far as is possible and practical in its investigation of the many questions which arise following the outcome of the McCracken tribunal. The terms of reference of the new tribunal are broad enough to focus in a realistic way on finding answers to them and, yet, specific enough to ensure it does not wander and remain in session following various leads until we are dead and gone.</P>
    <P>The McCracken tribunal deserves the many commendations it has received.  It has set a head-line and provides an example of how such tribunals should go about their business.  I am confident the proposed tribunal will be equally effective.  Its terms of reference reflect a reasonable consensus of the views of all parties and Deputies.  I am confident that Members of the Oireachtas and the citizens they serve will be satisfied with the work of the new tribunal and its outcome.</P>
    <P>In dealing with these matters I have tried to avoid political acrimony.  It is a pity the adversarial traditions of our parliamentary system and the competitive prompting of human nature should cause Deputies to indulge in partisan political point scoring when issues such as these are discussed in the House.  I accept to a certain extent this is inevitable but that should not be our general approach &mdash; too much is at stake for that. Opinion polls show that the revelations prior to and during the McCracken tribunal have diminished us all in the perception of the public.  Our approach, whatever our political allegiance, should be to make sure public trust in our institutions and politicians is not misplaced.  It follows that systems and mechanisms must be provided which ensure that if public office holders abuse their office there are means to discover and expose such abuse.  The tribunal proposed in the motion is one such mechanism.</P>
    <P>Since the State was established, the need for tribunals of this nature has only arisen on relatively rare occasions.  As the proverb has it, big oaks from little acorns grow.  People rarely set out to misbehave from the start.  As is the case with all temptations, people fall little by little as one <Col N="732" /> misdemeanour leads to another.  It would be to our advantage if we had the means of nipping things in the bud in the House.  That is why I am attracted to the idea put forward by the Taoiseach of a committee or similar body which would be available on a permanent basis to examine allegations of irregularities as they arise.  The existence of such a body would be a salutary deterrent to anyone tempted to stray from the straight and narrow in discharging his duty to the electorate.  More importantly, from the standpoint of the great majority of well motivated politicians, it would provide the means to deal readily with and dispose of malicious rumour and unsubstantiated accusation.  People in public life make easy targets for purveyors of rumour and insinuation. Decent men and women who work hard and honestly in the service of their constituents should have a means of defending themselves from baseless charges or from the deadly inference conveyed by nod and wink.</P>
    <P>Through this tribunal we rightly seek to thoroughly investigate inappropriate behaviour by people who hold high office and try to establish whether important policy decisions could have been influenced by contributions or donations along the presumed money trails.  They must be thoroughly explored whatever the consequences. When that is done and a regular investigatory body is eventually set up, this phase should be put firmly behind us.</P>
    <P>If public life comes to mean living constantly at the mercy of rumour mongers, what sane young men and women will want to embark on a political career?  Watching events in the United States over several years, one is struck by the time and energy devoted to the seemingly endless pursuit of scandals, real or imagined.  Accusations of scandal have become a regular weapon in the American political armoury and we should not go down that road.  We must be careful not to replace democracy with, to coin a word, &ldquo;enquirocracy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This evening in our bid to host the Special Olympics in 2003 I had the opportunity to address most of the overseas ambassadors in Dublin.  A few of them made the point that we are fortunate to have a press and media which are by and large models of responsibility in comparison with those in other countries.  I hope this enviable reputation enjoyed by the great majority of the Irish media will long continue.</P>
    <P>I am afraid some members of the Opposition, particularly in the Fine Gael Party, see inquiries and the hint of scandal as a means of gaining the glittering prize of office repeatedly denied them by the electorate.  Some people in Fine Gael have not yet been able to come to terms with the recent and emphatic verdict of the electorate. They recall that three years ago following an incomprehensible administrative foul-up which had hardly anything to do with politicians a good Government was put out of office.  As a result Fine Gael to its amazement found itself in Government.  Some of its members seem to harbour <Col N="733" /> the illusion that they can make history repeat itself.  The situation and parliamentary mathematics are quite different today from what they were three years ago but hope springs eternal. Having cast aside their one time great white hope, Deputy Lowry, into outer darkness they have re-adjusted their plastic halos which melted in the heat of Government, donned their familiar but badly dented armour of righteousness and with the help of certain sections of the media and a long time disagreement between two very elderly gentlemen have targeted the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has a predictable time worn and never varying strategy in attacks on Fianna Fail. It is based on a mythology it has cultivated since Fianna F·il first entered the D·il.  In it Fianna F·il politicians and supporters are all a bit dodgy. Fine Gael strides to the attack with all the disdain and pious suspicions of old money confronting pushy tradesmen who do not know their place and need to be taken down a peg.  Of course, we must never ask where the old money came from in the first place.</P>
    <P>However, down the years, the public has not been taken in by these boring attempts to demonise Fianna F·il.  People know that Fianna Fail is the party which has always led the national advance and which has transferred this country from an economic backwater into a thriving modern State.</P>

Following his convincing D·il statement it is not Ray Burke but his accusers who have questions to answer.  I have known the Minister as a colleague for a number of years.

      <P>In dealing with this controversy the Minister has been forthright and direct, his accusers have not.  If the accusations made against him had any substance we would expect him to be a man of conspicuous wealth.  In the course of my many conversations with him over the years, I have always found he had the same mundane worries about the cost of things, such as school fees, car repairs and household expenses, as the rest of us.  I saw no evidence of the Midas touch in the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The Minister came to this House as the son of one of the most highly regarded and decent Deputies who ever served in the Oireachtas &mdash; the late Deputy Paddy Burke.  He inherited a great tradition of service to the country and to his constituents from his late father.  The resounding votes of confidence he has received from the voters of north County Dublin in election after election, is telling evidence of how well he has followed in his father's footsteps.</P>
      <P>The new tribunal can do a valuable service for Irish democracy in demonstrating our determination to ensure high standards.  I was never more proud of Fianna F·il than on the occasion of our recent Ard Fheis when the Taoiseach, the leader of my party, set out in unambiguous terms his determination that Fianna F·il would always respect the trust and confidence placed in it by the people and that no wrongdoing would be condoned, no matter how eminent the individual involved might be.  He will continue to operate in that vein and this House and all its Members will benefit as a result.</P>

      <P>I do not feel diminished by what has been happening nor should the vast majority of Members from all parties.  The Members, out of 166 TDs, who might be guilty of some mis-demeanour would be in the minority, probably much smaller than in any other profession or occupation here.  The people have been well served by the vast majority of Members over the years.  It is important that all of us work to restore the confidence of the people in the institutions of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year between my father and myself, we have given 70 years of unbroken service to this country.  When I became a Member in 1965 I had the honour to serve with Members who had put their lives on the line to create this State.  My late <Col N="735" /> father, Robert, was one of those people.  He served the people for 38 years; I have served for 32 years and I am proud of that.  I am proud too that no taint of scandal has ever touched my name or that of my late father.  I have the same confidence in most of the Members.  Most of us believe in high standards in public life.</P>
    <P>It is time to give consideration to the setting up of what is popularly known as a whistle blower's charter for any member of the Civil Service who considers a Cabinet Minister is behaving in a way which is detrimental to the office and to the country, that such officials will have a committee to which he or she can report.  We should consider also setting up a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to examine complaints. Rather than having such complaints dealt with outside they should be heard by an all-party committee.  If questions deserve further attention they should be passed on to an outside body for adjudication.  That would be preferable to a series of tribunals year after year.  I stress that I support the tribunal.</P>
    <P>There are many bodies that may need closer examination.  I do not believe, for example, that every semi-State company is as pure as the driven snow.  There may have been abuses by a small number of people.  I do not wish to turn this into a police State but a watchdog system would enable people to report wrongdoing without fear of losing their jobs.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a young accountant working in a company came to see me.  He was troubled because the company had asked him to do something he considered to be dishonest.  He was told if he did not comply he would be fired and would not get a job anywhere else.  I sent him for legal advice and it was suggested to him that he resign from the company.  The number of companies that tempt people to perform dishonest deeds for reward is probably greater than we believe.</P>
    <P>Our first priority is to restore public confidence in the institutions of the State.  As the Taoiseach said we are grateful to those in the media who have highlighted the wrongdoings of recent years. Certain members of the press have a responsibility for the role they played in supporting wrongdoing over the years.  I will not mention any particular journalist by name but the person who comes to mind has long since gone to his eternal reward.  That person was doing things that, had a Member of this House done them, would have resulted in him being called a rascal.  No profession is free of its rascals.  The journalists have their rascals, the semi-State companies have their rascals and I am quite sure there are civil servants who are also rascals.  However, we have been served well by the Civil Service, and it is wrong that a civil servant may find it difficult to report wrongdoing.  That is why it is important to have a whistle blower's charter under which people can make their fears known in confidence.</P>
    <P>Governments will have to examine the pay of D·il Deputies.  I am a full-time TD as are a number <Col N="736" /> of other Deputies.  The pay of a TD is less than that of middle management in a supermarket. A Quinnsworth manager gets more than a TD. Garda Superintendents are paid more than a TD. It is ridiculous that Deputies are confined to such a low pay structure, that many TDs, where they have large families, cannot afford even to send their children to university.  If we want people of quality to go into politics full-time we have to pay them.  Why should they work at a career in politics if politicians are so badly paid, when there are other occupations they could take up which would benefit them much more?  I have been a TD for 32 years but anyone who is elected gets as much pay on the first day as I get having served 32 years &mdash; there is no such thing as an incremental increase for a Deputy, no such thing as service pay.  If I were in the public service I would probably have been kicked out years ago for inefficiency if I were still of the same rank at which I started.  If I worked in a lawyer's office or in an accountant's office I would not expect to be on the same salary after 32 years unless I were doing something very menial.</P>
    <P>We appointed people to look into the conditions and pay of D·il Deputies, but we appointed the wrong people.  Within the past few years a lawyer recommended £15 a week to cover our constituency expenses.  That man had no difficulty in taking £1 million in fees for himself.  I was insulted when I saw that report.  We have not had the courage to give a decent salary to Deputies. Interestingly, the backbenchers in the House of Commons gave themselves a substantial increase, and there was nothing the Government of the day could do about it.  Perhaps it would be a good idea for us to set up an all-party backbenchers' committee with some power.  There will always be people who will oppose increases, but somebody who did that lost his seat at the next election. Anyone who cares to look through the record will find that is true.  It is sometimes said that for people to stay honest one has to pay them, but that is not necessarily so.  People are either honest or dishonest.  My point is that honest people should not be penalised, and most people who go into politics are honest and should not be penalised because they have an idealistic bent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: There is no doubt the McCracken tribunal confirmed a series of scandalous actions by Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry.  I am extremely concerned that the steps being proposed by the Government in the terms of reference before us do not in any sense address the real concerns ordinary people want addressed in the dealings between politics and big business.  It is correct to further inquire into the affairs of Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry, but my concern is that confining further investigation to those two men is to use them as lightning rods to conduct the anger of ordinary people and to divert attention from wider questions that should be addressed in regard to the relationship between big <Col N="737" /> business, wealthy individuals, leading politicians and political parties.</P>
      <P>It was entirely accidental that Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry came to light in terms of their relationship with one business man.  We will have had two tribunals because of that accident.  We have dozens of leading politicians, hundreds over the past ten or 15 years, and hundreds of business people and powerful firms.  Should it be left to a further accident to discover if other scandals remain hidden in regard to the relationship between other businesses and political parties or other politicians?</P>
      <P>For many years it was known that a golden circle involving some of the most powerful people in the State was in existence.  That golden circle was unmasked by the revelations at the McCracken tribunal, but how much of the circumference of the golden circle has been revealed and how much still lies hidden we can only guess at.  Ordinary people want the truth.  Unfortunately, an opportunity which now presents itself to get close to the full truth is not being taken by the Government in its proposals.</P>
      <P>The Government speaks of following the money trail.  There have been a number of extremely significant trails, not just one, in the past ten years in politics and business.  The Ansbacher accounts constitute one important money trail that should be followed, the £38 million deposited by Irish residents in offshore accounts.  According to the report of the McCracken tribunal, Mr. Haughey used this to evade tax.  In the report Mr. Justice McCracken spoke about this being an ingenious system that other unidentified individuals or businesses use. He said perhaps some people used it for business but that no doubt there were others who deposited money in this way for other motives. That alone should have set lights flashing for the Government when it came to drawing up the terms of reference of a new tribunal.  What other motives, and who?  It seems clear that should be examined.  No wonder the accounts were in codes rather than in names, in view of the other motives.  The full glare of a public inquiry should be focused on the Ansbacher accounts and on those who deposited money in them.  The Government's proposal narrows the focus essentially to Mr. Haughey and &ldquo;to any other person who holds or has held public office during the period of his/her tenure&rdquo;.  Why not hold an inquiry into all depositors and all aspects of Ansbacher?  That is why I tabled an amendment which proposes that we should establish the beneficial owners of the moneys in the accounts and the motives for lodging the money there.  I hope all parties support my amendment as the majority of people want what is proposed under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a curious restriction in the Government's wording.  Why should the inquiry be confined to the period of tenure of an office holder? An office holder could have had significant accounts before or after his or her period of tenure. Those words should be deleted to enable a full investigation into funds held at any time by <Col N="738" /> office holders before, during or after their tenure of office.</P>
    <P>The tax amnesties of 1987 and 1993 are another significant money trail in Irish politics and business in the past ten years.  The McCracken tribunal dealt with scandalous events at the interface of big business, politics, leading politicians and political parties in the State.  It has uncovered serious scandals, but no event has revealed the scandalous undertakings at the interface of business and politics more than the two tax amnesties granted by the D·il in 1987 and 1993 when up to £1 billion was wiped out in due taxation by super rich individuals and powerful companies.  It is a scandal that because of the secrecy surrounding the amnesties we do not even know the amount of money that was written off. Those amnesties could be viewed as a direct robbery of taxpayers which cheated people of resources that could have transformed the lives of people such as the homeless.  The £1 billion involved could have been used to reduce hospital waiting lists and to provide much needed facilities in working class communities.  It could have been used on a multitude of causes that could have assisted people in need in our society.  However, it enriched an elite by up to £1 billion.  In the more blatant cases, top companies and super rich individuals benefited by many millions of pounds because they were able to write off large sums of money.  It was similar to writing a cheque into their accounts.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that political parties elected by the people of the State could foist such a cheating double cross on the majority of hard pressed PAYE workers who carry the brunt of the taxation system.  The injustices are still obvious.  I wonder if the elected Members for Dublin are aware that every week, local authorities drag decent PAYE taxpayers before the court because they refuse to pay water charges, which they consider intolerable and unjust double taxation.  They are being prosecuted for the sake of £210 arrears in the South Dublin County Council area or £255 in the Fingal County Council area, and are threatened with mention in <i>Stubbs' Gazette</i> and other sanctions.  While the backbone of the taxation system is treated in this way, not one millionaire taxation cheat has darkened the door of a court in this State to answer tax evasion.</P>
    <P>The cheated PAYE taxpayers want to know whether support for the tax amnesties of 1987 and 1993 was swayed by contributions from the beneficiaries of those amnesties not just to politicians but to political parties.  That is why I have drawn attention to this by proposing an amendment which would require an examination of whether any substantial payments were made, directly or indirectly, to any political party, public representative or D·il candidate by any person who benefited from those amnesties.  That is a simple matter to investigate since the identities of those people are available on the files of the Revenue Commissioners.  If the inquiry about to be <Col N="739" /> embarked upon is to mean anything to ordinary taxpayers that question must be answered.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have said that many of the more blatant Government actions when Mr. Haughey was Taoiseach must be examined, and I agree.  In particular I want an examination of the sale in 1992 of Glending Wood, near Blessington, County Wicklow.  I have put down an amendment in this regard which I hope will be supported by all the Opposition parties and those Fianna F·il and Independent Deputies who have publicly expressed concern about this matter.  This is a scandal of major proportions which must be investigated and exposed.</P>
    <P>The State secretly sold 147 acres of land owned by the Irish people to Roadstone Dublin for £1.25 million.  Roadstone purchased the land in order to quarry the sand and gravel which exists in large quantities on the site.  It is conservatively estimated that some 24 million tonnes could be quarried there.  If one conservatively prices the material at £3 per tonne, the total receipts would be £72 million.  Industry sources say the cost of extraction might amount to £1 per tonne, and if one subtracts £24 million from £72 million, this one company is left with a potential profit of £48 million from lands which were secretly sold without going to public tender.  The sale price of the land amounts to about one penny per tonne.</P>
    <P>That is not related to the priceless value of those lands for the people of Blessington, Wicklow and Dublin who would use them for recreational purposes.  It is an area of beauty in which people can engage in recreation and relaxation.</P>
    <P>Another price of this scandal would be a dramatic change in the surrounds of Blessington by the removal of sheltered areas close to the quarry.  That could have an adverse effect on the microclimate of the area.</P>
    <P>In the course of this episode an archaeological site, SMR 11, was delisted before the sale and has subsequently been restored.  There should be a full investigation of the circumstances surrounding the delisting of that site to facilitate the sale to Roadstone.  Who ordered it?  By what mechanisms was it carried through?</P>
    <P>During the negotiation of this sale Mr. Traynor was chairman of the parent company, Cement Roadstone Holdings, and manager of the Ansbacher accounts and Mr. Haughey was Taoiseach. In view of what has emerged in the McCracken report and the massive amounts of money and lands involved which belong to the people, all aspects of this matter must be included in the terms of reference of this tribunal.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for the Environment not to await the outcome of the tribunal but to intervene now to set aside the scandalous rezoning of these lands last year by Wicklow County Council to facilitate quarrying by Roadstone.  He has the power to set aside the rezoning and begin the process of returning those lands to the ownership of the people of this State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> I have also proposed an amendment that all political parties should make full disclosure for a period of, say, ten years of substantial contributions they received from wealthy individuals or business concerns.  It is crucial that this happens. All the talk of accountability, transparency, restoring confidence etc.  is just so much empty rhetoric if the parties which dominate political life in this State are not prepared to be upfront, put their hands in the air and say how much they received from individuals, businesses or powerful economic concerns.</P>
    <P>There are many questions to be asked.  The two leading parties in the State, Fianna F·il and Fine Gael, have raised massive sums for their campaigns and to erase their debts over the past ten years alone.  They should be upfront now and state from where the funds came and how much they constituted.  I have tabled an amendment that that should be within the terms of reference of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The difference between personal donations and those to political parties is only one of degree. Leading members of the main political parties are always at pains &mdash; in fact, they protest too much &mdash; to differentiate between personal donations and those to political parties.  I hope they know that nobody believes big business contributes substantial amounts of money to political parties because they are philanthropists and want to be nice.  A number of years ago the banks contributed hundreds of thousands of pounds to five political parties.  Dunnes Stores, one of the stingiest employers one could find, exercises huge largesse in the political arena.  People believe they do so on a <i>quid pro quo</i> basis.</P>
    <P>Corruption is not necessarily a secret deal behind closed doors where terms are clearly laid out in return for a political donation.  In my view donations are given to create an atmosphere where the leading political parties will think favourably of the businesses which make them. For example, when it comes to framing a budget, the banks hope a levy will not be imposed on them, or if one is imposed that it will be several percentage points less than it might be otherwise. In that way they save millions if not tens of millions of pounds.  That is the use of large-scale political donations by business to political parties. Businesses hope that when parties are in Government they will look with sympathy on their special pleadings.</P>
    <P>This position arises from the nature of the economic structures which dominate society.  I equate it to an economic dictatorship where big business interests, powerful millionaires and banks and financial institutions wield enormous power &mdash; almost to the extent of life or death &mdash; over ordinary people, particularly in terms of their jobs, income, living standards and other aspects of their lives.  The philosophy of the conservative political parties in this State is at one with that system.  They regularly received substantial funds from the main players.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> This creates an atmosphere which inevitably results in the scandals of which we are aware and others which are still hidden.  The details which emerged in Mr. Justice McCracken's report in terms of sheer cronyism and corruption rival the Philippines of the late President Marcos.  There is utter cynicism among ordinary working, unemployed, poor and young people about the political system and the major political parties which dominate the State as a result of the link between business and politics and the scandals that have emerged.</P>
    <P>Following the catastrophic death of Diana, Princess of Wales, there was an extraordinary outpouring of emotion and mourning by millions of people in Britain, Ireland and internationally. Did any Irish politician remove himself or herself from the atmosphere that was undoubtedly excessively hyped up by the media, which is among the most cynical players in society, to ponder the real meaning of the reaction which was so strikingly demonstrated on television and in the press?</P>
    <P>Politicians should ask how a celebrity from an aristocratic background, whose status resulted from being part of the most conservative mon-archy that western Europe has ever seen, became a symbol of concern and compassion for the poor, the sick, the homeless, lone parents, the Third World and victims of landmines which are the result of cynical manoeuvrings by governments and the military-industrial complex.</P>
    <P>The fact that this is where people reposed some hope is a crushing indictment of the leading politicians and parties in these islands.  It means that they have left the vacuum which allowed this phenomenon to occur.  They have failed utterly to address the concerns or problems of those people who have mourned for the past week.  A majority of ordinary people have no faith that politicians have solutions for their problems and projected their hopes on to a celebrity who died tragically. That should be pondered carefully by politicians in this State.</P>
    <P>The events leading up to the McCracken tribunal have added hugely to the cynicism of ordinary people regarding the established political parties.  A new tribunal will not remove that cynicism but will add to it unless the terms of reference are widened to include some of the major concerns expressed by ordinary people who pay their taxes and live up to their responsibilities. Those concerns should be addressed, which is why I have tabled the amendments which I ask other Members to address in their contributions.</P>

      <P>I echo the comments of <Col N="742" /> Deputies on both sides of the House congratulating Mr. Justice McCracken and his tribunal team on their excellent report.</P>
      <P>I recall how when this tribunal was first established the sceptics suggested it would run into the sand and become lost in a maze of financial transactions. It is to the credit of Mr. Justice McCracken that these predictions proved ill-founded. Instead the tribunal team showed remarkable investigative zeal and in doing so rendered an important public service.  The tribunal has produced a report that is comprehensive and succinct, and one with grave implications for the body politic.</P>
      <P>All of us who believe in the vocation of public service will have been deeply dismayed by the contents of the report which raise grave issues of public trust that must be immediately addressed. The tribunal's investigative work was excellent but, with all due respect to Mr. Justice McCracken, much of the two pages of recommendations, which referred mainly to proposals made by Fianna F·il's senior counsel to the tribunal, did not go far enough.  Mr. Justice McCracken and his team could have made more detailed proposals.</P>
      <P>The Government is united in its determination to ensure the truth will emerge and will ensure the full and speedy implementation of the report's recommendations.  This is why we are establishing a new tribunal, why we have produced terms of reference that will ensure the fullest possible investigation, why we are to establish a permanent policing structure in the form of a public ethics committee and why we are holding a referendum on Cabinet confidentiality.  We may uncover what happened in the past, although we cannot change it, but we can definitely find a cure for the future.</P>
      <P>It is a great honour to be elected to this House and to hold a position of trust.  Honesty and integrity must be our core principles.  The majority of politicians, past and present, subscribe to these principles.  This means that any behaviour not in accordance with these principles must be exposed to public view.  Our democracy is a precious thing. It should not be taken for granted.  Members of this House are the custodians of our democracy. We must ensure our democratic system is untainted and that it is seen to be above suspicion at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, our democracy depends on public faith in the political system and, unfortunately, at present cynicism is rife about political life here. The vocation of politics is not held in high esteem.  This cynicism is corrosive and eats into the foundations of our democracy.  There is a responsibility on all of us in this House to restore public faith in the political system and remove this atmosphere of cynicism.  The public has a right to demand the highest standards from politicians and political parties.  The public also has the right to a transparency which ensures that politicians are not being compromised in any way in regulating business or legislating for the public <Col N="743" /> interest.  Rightly or wrongly, for some time there has been a public perception of an elite golden circle operating in Irish society with direct access to the levers of power and the time has come to tackle this perception head on.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in the short-term the findings of the tribunal may serve to increase this cynicism. However, in the longer term, the McCracken tribunal, and its successor, will vindicate the strength of our democracy and serve to reaffirm public faith in the democratic system.  It shows that the Government, and all parties in the Oireachtas, are ready to address serious allegations about office holders, and former office holders, without fear or favour.  The public expect nothing less and the Government will deliver nothing less.</P>
    <P>Such are the findings of the McCracken tribunal that it is vital that a new tribunal be established without delay to bring this process to a full and transparent conclusion.  However, the success of the new tribunal will depend on its terms of reference.  If the terms of reference are not sufficiently focused the tribunal runs the risk of getting bogged down in a morass of red tape and losing sight of our original aim, that is, the disclosure of the truth.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference for the new tribunal have been carefully considered.  In framing these terms of reference the Government was particularly keen to ensure that any remaining anxieties about the conduct of ministerial office holders in recent times are fully resolved.  The terms of reference will allow for a full investigation into the &ldquo;money trail&rdquo; revealed by the McCracken tribunal, including the Ansbacher deposits unearthed in the course of that inquiry.  The new tribunal will have the power to investigate any further donations to Mr. Haughey or Deputy Lowry, and will ascertain whether such donors benefited from any Government decisions.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to a number of points in regard to the terms of reference with which some Members may have difficulties.  The first is the privacy provision; the second is the inclusion of private individuals in the inquiry into the Ansbacher accounts and the third is the failure to include a list of controversial decisions.  These are, the privacy provision in the terms of reference, the non inclusion of private individuals in the inquiry into the Ansbacher accounts and the failure to include a list of controversial decisions. There are reasons the tribunal is being mandated to conduct its preliminary investigations in private.  In effect this is putting in explicit terms, the procedure adopted by Judge McCracken when he conducted investigations in private. Private investigations will protect the integrity of the inquiry by not alerting those who are the subject of investigation until such time as the tribunal deems appropriate.  Investigations in private allow the tribunal to sift the evidence, discard allegations where there is no evidence to substantiate them and only proceed in public with issues <Col N="744" /> supported by evidence.  This has the effect of protecting the good name of all persons who may be involved either directly or indirectly in such investigations.  In effect, this concerns <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  The more time spent in private investigation the less time will be spent in public hearings, thereby containing the cost of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is incorrect to say there will not be an inquiry into the Ansbacher accounts under the terms of reference currently before the House.  Such an inquiry will be made in relation to Mr. Haughey to determine whether there were sources other than Mr. Dunne who lodged money in these accounts for the benefit of Mr. Haughey.  The accounts will also be investigated to determine whether any payments were made from money held in the Ansbacher accounts to any person who held public office during the period of their tenure.</P>
    <P>The inquiry will not determine whether private citizens held money in these accounts, whether for the purpose of tax evasion or not.  Such an inquiry falls directly within the remit of the Revenue Commissioners and should be left to them. If necessary they should seek further powers to enable them carry out their work.  However, I do not believe they need further powers.</P>
    <P>The new inquiry must focus on whether there is evidence of political corruption.  The Government's view is that the McCracken tribunal should proceed to investigate what was referred to in the report as the missing links in the Ansbacher accounts.  In this context there was reference by the Government to the McCracken tribunal having already lodged a notice of appeal against the decision made against it in the Cayman Island courts.</P>
    <P>I accept the Opposition has a duty to make political capital out of an issue like this.  However, listing six or seven controversial decisions would result in missing out on other issues.  Even an expanded list could be attacked by the Opposition for being incomplete.  It is not intended to refer to a list of transactions where there may have been corruption but where there is no evidence of such.  Any list risks inclusion of transactions which are innocent, to the detriment of the good name of innocent parties while on the other hand excluding transactions which may have been tainted.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference are drafted in such a way that the tribunal can investigate the circumstances of any payments found to have been made to Mr. Charles Haughey or Deputy Lowry and examine whether any transactions were influenced by those payments.  The transactions which may be investigated are not, therefore, confined to an arbitrary list.  The tribunal will be required to ascertain whether substantial payments were made, who the donors were, how much was involved, when the payments were made, whether any controversial decisions were made at that time involving that donor and whether, as a consequence, the tribunal believes that either Mr. Haughey or Deputy Lowry carried out any act or <Col N="745" /> made any decision to confer any benefit on that specific donor in respect of that particular transaction.</P>
    <P>The responsibility to address the matters raised in the McCracken report is shared by all parties and Members of this House.  The Government has gone out of its way to achieve cross-party support on this crucial matter.  The Taoiseach has engaged in an unprecedented degree of consultation with Opposition party leaders to achieve the broadest measure of agreement on how we should proceed.  The public expects to see us work together in this regard and I am somewhat disappointed that the Opposition parties have seen fit to amend the Government recommendation. The fact that they have, in effect, endeavoured to play politics does them no service.  The Opposition parties have acknowledged on the air-waves that the Taoiseach went far beyond their expectations in regard to the consultations on the terms of reference and the way in which he addressed them, yet they felt it necessary to table other amendments.  They will not receive any kudos from the public as a result because the public believes that D·il Members should unite on this issue and should endeavour to get the best possible terms of reference in order that we can allow a tribunal to get on with its work.</P>
    <P>The manner in which we conduct ourselves during this debate is also important.  I would caution against any attempt to make political capital out of this situation or to manipulate this debate for party political advantage.  No one party has an exclusive claim to the moral high ground as parties on the other side of the House have found to their detriment.  There is sufficient public distaste for political squabbling as it stands; to engage in it at this time would only serve to foster the public cynicism I spoke of earlier.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that on 21 July, the final day of the tribunal hearings, senior counsel for Fianna F·il outlined a wide series of proposals, including the establishment of a Public Ethics Commission.  This followed directly on proposals made by the Taoiseach and then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Ahern, when he spoke at a debate in Trinity College on the issue of public ethics in February.  He effectively laid out his stall in regard to the way in which he viewed the issue of public ethics and the effort by politicians to turn around the cynicism which unfortunately exists among the public in relation to the profession of politics.  The Taoiseach's views were amplified in the course of the final submission by our senior counsel to the tribunal.  The proposals which were outlined were correctly described as radical by one senior political commentator.  It is this radical approach to standards in public life which is the hallmark of Deputy Bertie Ahern's leadership of Fianna F·il and his stewardship of this country.</P>
    <P>In Opposition and in Government, the Taoiseach has been determined to establish the highest standards of probity not just in political life, but in public life generally.  From the initial revelations <Col N="746" /> regarding the Dunnes payments to date, the Taoiseach has acted decisively, setting the agenda in addressing these serious matters of public trust.  In a speech to the Fianna F·il ¡rd Fheis earlier this year, he set out, in blunt terms, what was acceptable and unacceptable behaviour in public life.  Nothing less will be tolerated by this Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's approach represents the politics of a new generation for a new generation.  He has made it clear that no unethical behaviour will be tolerated in public life and that any deviation from these high standards is unacceptable and will be addressed upfront.  In other countries, and in several American states, an independent investigative agency is an integral part of the policing of standards in public life.  It is par for the course.  The Government believes that such a body should be established in Ireland and become a permanent part of our political system. In February of this year, Fianna F·il in Opposition proposed the establishment of such a public ethics commission with a remit extending beyond that set out by the Ethics in Public Office Act. We did that on the basis of the models already in existence in America for some years.  In Government with our partners, the Progressive Democrats, we will make that commitment a reality. The commission would be independently appointed and would be headed by a senior public official who would have the status of a High Court judge or the Ombudsman.  This body will be able to investigate, with the assistance of all the resources of the State, any accusations of impropriety that appear to have substance.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat disappointed with the recommendations of Mr. Justice McCracken, particularly that which suggested that rather than setting up a public ethics commission we should give the Ombudsman the job of investigating these matters.  We examined that recommendation but felt it did not go far enough and that a public ethics commission, preferably with a judge as its chairman, with powers similar to a High Court judge, should sit on a permanent basis to investigate complaints such as those we heard about earlier today in the House.  A Member of this House had to come into this House to answer in effect unfounded allegations made by somebody who was not prepared to put his name to a statement. If a public ethics commission was established, the person who made those allegations could have appeared before it to make the complaint so that the person against whom it was being made could answer it.  Such a body is absolutely essential if we are to move forward.  The Minister for Finance is progressing that legislation and will bring it before the House quite quickly.</P>
    <P>I am still at a loss to understand the criticism of this proposal by some of the more verbose Deputies.  I will put this carping down to the party political jockeying I referred to earlier.  The model of a public ethics commission has already worked well in America.  Such a body would provide <Col N="747" /> a permanent structure to ensure the highest standards in public life.  It would allow for a wide range of information to be made available to the public and would provide a legal basis to oversee and ensure the integrity of public officials and elected representatives.  It would also provide a mechanism by which to monitor the interests of those who seek to influence those in public life. Once again we will consult with the Opposition to ensure that any mechanisms established in this regard will be effective and efficient.</P>
    <P>The Government has also pledged to relax the rules on Cabinet confidentiality in a referendum to be held on 30 October.  This is another crucial step in the process of ensuring proper transparency. It should facilitate the new tribunal in its work by relaxing the absolute obligation imposed on Ministers not to disclose the content of Government discussions.</P>
    <P>Taken collectively the new tribunal, the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality and the forthcoming public ethics commission represent a substantial response to the issues raised by the tribunal.  These measures will allow for a more open conduct of political life and establish ongoing mechanisms for dealing with breaches of public trust.</P>
    <P>The contents of the tribunal report make for painful reading.  However, the report offers us an invaluable opportunity to lift the cloud of innuendo and suspicion that currently hangs over politics in this country.  Through the establishment of a new tribunal we can get to the root of questions raised by the McCracken report and dispel the cloud of suspicion that hangs over political life. This would allow for a cleansing process, one that would restore public faith in our political system. The Government is determined to bring this cleansing process to a conclusion and in doing so usher in a new era in Irish politics, one exemplified by openness, trust and accountability and one in which the public will have full confidence.</P>
    <P>This country currently faces tremendous challenges &mdash; the fulfilment of the peace process, continued economic growth and European Monetary Union.  As Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs I am anxious that the fruits of our economic prosperity are shared with the less well off and that the problem of social exclusion is addressed in a meaningful fashion.  It goes without saying that we represent the ordinary people of Ireland.  However, I want these objectives to be achieved in an atmosphere of public trust and confidence where politics is clearly perceived to be a force for good and justice.  The initiatives outlined by the Government will serve to restore that bond of trust and usher in a new era in Irish politics for the new millennium.</P>
    <P>I ask the Opposition to accept that the Government has made a genuine effort to strike the best balance possible in formulating the terms of reference. I accept that the Opposition probably has to play politics.  Perhaps this is because there are more parties in Opposition in this D·il than there <Col N="748" /> were in the previous D·il where it was repeatedly accepted that we provided reasonable and practical opposition.  While we opposed some measures we were always constructive in our opposition. Even today the parties opposite have run with the latest agenda set by the media.  I will say no more on that issue.  The Opposition is doing itself no service by ignoring our efforts to ensure all-party agreement on this issue.</P>

      <P>I thank Mr. Justice McCracken and his tribunal team for producing this excellent, succinct, lucid and compelling report.  Let nobody be in any doubt that the Government intends to implement fully the recommendations of Mr. Justice McCracken and the recommendations which will be produced by the next tribunal.  It also intends to go further.</P>
      <P>The McCracken report has been compared with the earlier Hamilton report.  The reason the tribunals adopted different approaches in their reports is that different terms of reference were given to them &mdash; those given to Hamilton were wide and diffuse, while those given to McCracken were focused.  My constituency colleague, Deputy Noonan, claimed credit on behalf of the rainbow coalition for giving more focused terms of reference to the McCracken tribunal.  I accept his point but it should be remembered that this was done with the benefit of knowing why the Hamilton tribunal had failed.</P>
      <P>The Opposition has proposed a number of amendments to the motion.  One amendment in the name of the Fine Gael Party suggests that the tribunal should investigate the then party leader's allowance.  The Taoiseach dealt comprehensively with this matter.  It is a question of balance.  I know the people to whom he referred and their integrity and probity cannot be impeached.  I sincerely hope that the Opposition, on reflection, will accept the statements made by those individuals to the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Like banks, we do not keep records indefinitely and it is extremely difficult to examine some matters. However, the Taoiseach investigated this matter in so far as he possibly could.  Again it is a question of focus.  If the Opposition wishes to go down this road then it has to be said that Deputy Michael Lowry got money from Ben Dunne not only for himself but also for Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wishes to follow that argument to its logical conclusion, should we not investigate Fine Gael's activities in office to see whether contributions solicited on its behalf influenced <Col N="749" /> decisions taken by its Ministers in office? By logical extension we should ask about the other contributions which brought Fine Gael from a state of bankruptcy when it first entered office in 1994 to a state of financial health.  Should we not include a term of reference to ascertain who made those contributions to Fine Gael to restore it to financial health and if they influenced any decision taken by a Fine Gael Minister?  If one were to go down that road, one could go down it forever.  The tribunal would be unfocused and would not go anywhere.  Some balance is required.  A tribunal must be reasonably focused to ensure we not only get the information that must be got in the public interest but that it will come to a definitive conclusion in an efficient manner within a reasonable period.  That is what the Government has proposed.</P>
      <P>As my colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said, the Taoiseach has consulted widely.  His openness and willingness to consult widely has been lauded in the public media by the Opposition parties. Like my colleague I am surprised at the tone of some of the contributors to the debate in view of that recognition of the Taoiseach's openness and willingness to consult.</P>
      <P>An amendment tabled in the name of the Fine Gael Party proposes consideration of everything relating to the Ansbacher accounts, but the terms of reference of the tribunal must be focused.  I remind Deputy Bruton it is a matter for the tribunal, but we have encouraged and let the tribunal know that we wish it to appeal the decision of the court in the Cayman Islands.  The Taoiseach has repeated today that the Government will provide every resource necessary for the tribunal to pursue that appeal.  Deputy Bruton and others should be mindful that the tribunal we are setting up will be empowered to investigate any payments made from the Ansbacher accounts to Mr. Haughey and to any other person holding political office.</P>
      <P>The Leader of Fine Gael has pursued a policy of discarding his former best forever friend, Deputy Lowry, and trying to taint Fianna F·il with the sins of Mr. Haughey.  I can speak as somebody who has been a consistent opponent of Mr. Haughey within the Fianna F·il establishment. I had my reasons for opposing him, but they are irrelevant now.  However, not for one moment did I dream what has been revealed by the McCracken tribunal was going on or anything like it.  I assumed and was entitled to do so as was every other Member of Fianna F·il, that Mr. Haughey had made money from a number of wise property investments in the early 1960s, that he had invested his money wisely and had a good source of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also knew as did Members on all sides of the House, irrespective of whether they may seek to pretend otherwise now, that the Revenue Commissioners live in the real world.  They were well aware of the magnificence and opulence of Mr. Haughey's lifestyle.  No attempt was made to conceal it.  I assumed if Mr. Haughey sent tax returns <Col N="750" /> to the Revenue Commissioners that showed a level of income that could not support his lifestyle, that matter would have been investigated by them.  In saying that I am sure I speak for all my colleagues.</P>
    <P>We enthusiastically embrace and welcome the report of the McCracken tribunal.  This party and Government will not shirk from any action that needs to be taken to restore probity to public life. We are moving to provide a referendum on Cabinet confidentiality, a matter that the previous Government ran away from for two years and now pretends it was difficult to find a formula. Anyone who read the heads of the decision in the Cabinet confidentiality case could have come up with that formula following an hour's reflection. We are taking a number of other measures which have been outlined by my colleagues and I hope this will be the start of a return to probity and a restoration of confidence in Irish political life.  It will be a long road during which those of us who have nothing to hide will continue to suffer for the activities of the few.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit some surprise and amazement at the attitude of a number of Fianna F·il Ministers.  The Minister for Tourism and Sport, Deputy McDaid, treated us to antiquated language from the 1930s which did not address the issues.  I am amazed that Deputy McDaid would accuse Fine Gael of illicit behaviour in putting questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at a time when several Fianna F·il Ministers would like to see bankers revealing the fact that politicians are receiving unusual sums.  They would like a permanent ethics commission to deal with allegations, founded or not, to satisfy the public.  It is in sharp contrast to the attitude of some Ministers this evening.</P>
      <P>There is serious concern about the Ansbacher accounts.  Deputy Dermot Ahern genuinely wants consensus and he should look at the Fine Gael amendment as regards the operation of those accounts.  The Revenue Commissioners do not have the power to address the Ansbacher accounts in a meaningful manner as we know from page 50 of the tribunal report that the records in Ireland have been destroyed.  We also know from the description of how these funds were operated that Irish residents paid money to Mr. Traynor who maintained these accounts overseas.  The tribunal expressed considerable concerns about the purpose for which they were used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case pursued by the McCracken tribunal in relation to accounts in the Cayman Islands is related to the narrow terms of reference and Judge McCracken cannot expose, on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, the information Deputy Dermot Ahern suggests he can.  The only way in which we can examine the mechanisms by which named Irish people are taking in deposits from Irish individuals, routing them overseas to be re-deposited in Ireland and then delivering instructions as to how those moneys are to be <Col N="751" /> used, is if we authorise this tribunal to look at them.</P>

      <P>We would not be having two days of debate if we had established information. The reality is that Fianna F·il's Leader consulted with other leaders.  We signalled at the time that there were a number of issues of concern.  We have been working on this issue consistently since and we have availed of this debate to refine advice given to us.  We are putting down these amendments in the public interest.  The public is concerned that there are systematic mechanisms in place as regards offshore accounts, many of which are legitimate.  There are plenty of legitimate reasons for having offshore accounts if one <Col N="752" /> owns a company, but not if one is a private individual. Private individuals are taxable on their worldwide income in Ireland.  That is the tax law here.  An individual is not entitled to earn income in his own private account &mdash; not in a company account &mdash; and deposit it overseas while not declaring that to the Revenue Commissioners. That is an illegitimate use of offshore funds.  It would appear from these Ansbacher accounts that there is a system in place where that was occurring systematically.  The Government should think again.</P>
      <P>I have great respect for Deputy Ahern.  I have known over a long period that he does attempt to listen to what the other side is saying.  Since he has specifically addressed that issue on behalf of the Government in his own contribution, unscripted as it would appear, he should reconsider the matter.  He should take it on faith that this is not being put forward by our party for any ulterior motives but because there is a genuine concern that there may be systematic abuse of a mechanism.</P>
