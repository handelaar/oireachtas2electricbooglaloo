      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. 23 relates to statements on the outcome of the Kyoto summit, a very important summit, just as the recent summit in Luxembourg was important.  We had a debate in the House yesterday in this exact format on the Amsterdam summit and in terms of media reporting the debate might as well not have taken <Col N="886" /> place.  There was no opportunity for questioning of the Taoiseach and, in this instance, there is no opportunity to question the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on what took place.  A series of scripts were read out. Some of the Taoiseach's script was reported, but other statements made off-script might as well not have been made at all.</P>
      <P>Since these reports are important I ask the Tánaiste to consider whether it would be better to take them in a committee of the House.  I am also referring to reporting back on EU summits where the Taoiseach would give his report, other Members would make their comments and there could be dialogue on the matter.  If a statement is not to be reported, in terms of publicity, it may as well not be made.  It seems the worst place in Ireland to deliver an important announcement, in terms of having it reported, is here &mdash; that is not a reflection on anybody.</P>
      <P>In the case of important statements such as this, I ask the Tánaiste to consider a better format for genuine dialogue between Opposition and Government on these matters, which are largely non-contentious and where dialogue could be useful to both sides.  Will the Tánaiste consider new arrangements for future debates of this kind?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the Government was pleased to agree to the request.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government intends to bring this matter before the environment committee in the new year.  I agree with Deputy Bruton that some important matters do not receive coverage.  From my experience at the weekend, I can give the Deputy advice on how to get coverage, if that is what he is interested in.  Deputy Bruton made a valid point that should be considered for the future.</P>

      <P>The House will not meet again until 28 January.  The Taoiseach is meeting President Santer in Brussels this morning, apparently still negotiating something that was agreed by the previous Administration, the proposed corporation tax rate after 2006.  In view of the Taoiseach's failure to refer to this matter yesterday during the European Union summit debate, will the Tánaiste, in consultation with the Whips, provide an opportunity at the earliest possible date in the new year for the Taoiseach to report on this issue, bearing in mind that attitudes to corporation tax have been dealt with on an all-party basis in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Taoiseach's visit to Brussels is to brief President Santer on a number of matters, including Northern Ireland and his meetings with President Clinton in the United States.  Agenda 2000 will also be discussed. A wide variety of issues will be discussed, it is not a negotiating meeting.  It is the Government's wish to keep parties informed on such issues.</P>

At its meeting tomorrow, will the Government consider the introduction of an amnesty for asylum seekers <Col N="888" /> already resident in the State?  At the very least, will it ensure asylum seekers are not deported over the Christmas period?</P>

      <P>I raised this matter in the context of the failure of the Government to implement the Refugee Act, 1996 and the Tánaiste has offered to reply to my question.  I would appreciate if you would allow her to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been raised more regularly than any other issue in recent months. Problems arise because of the pending law case, but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has made administrative arrangements and genuine asylum seekers will not be deported or stopped from entering the country.  Obviously, we will honour our international obligations on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I also suggested that an amnesty should be introduced for asylum seekers already resident in the State.  I accept new arrangements will be introduced, but a strong argument could be made for an amnesty for those who are already resident here.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated he would consider this, but he should do so soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed by the Government at a meeting last Tuesday.  A small working group is examining, among other issues, the question of an amnesty, but a decision has not been made yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In her capacity as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, will the Tánaiste consider amending the legislation to give asylum seekers the right to work here legally so that they are not a burden on the State?  Since that power comes under the remit of her Department, has she any legislative proposals to allow asylum seekers the right to work here pending the long and laborious process of assessment in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the question of work permits is not covered on a statutory basis.  I am currently preparing proposals to bring to Government to put the matter on a proper statutory footing and the points made by the Deputy are being considered in that context.  As we have had an unprecedented number of requests for work permits, there should be an appropriate statutory basis for granting or refusing them.</P>

      <P>On Tuesday last the Minister for Health and Children told the House that a clinical information pack on the potential CJD infection risk from amerscan pulmonate II <Col N="889" /> was being prepared for consultants, GPs and health boards so that those at risk could be fully informed and counselled about their circumstances. The Minister said the information pack should be completed by Wednesday.  However, following inquiries to the Department last evening, I was told the pack could not be completed before Christmas.  Today, a full month after this potential danger became known&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The 400 people and their families are a priority for the Minister for Health and Children.  He has spent a considerable length of time working on this issue.  It is a very complex area and all the necessary resources are being made available to get the packs out as quickly as possible.  I am not sure when they will be released. I will talk to the Minister and communicate with the Deputy later today.</P>

The Authority was set up in 1996 and there will be a gap of two years before it has effective powers.  This shows the Government does not have a sense of urgency about the BSE problem.</P>

    <Title>Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Bill, 1997  [  Seanad ]:   Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Mr. O'Shea: I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 3, line 7, to delete &ldquo;MAKE AVAILABLE FURTHER&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;APPROPRIATE&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to clarify that the Bill does not provide new money but allocates or appropriates money from the Vote for the Department of Education and Science.  I want to delete &ldquo;make available further&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; to show that this is additional funding.  The 1998 Estimates for the third level and further education sector are down £70 million compared to the 1997 Estimates.  Yet £70 million in the Supplementary Estimates is bolstering up the outturn this year.  I am talking about the recoupment of third level grant money by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The £20 million for the craft deficit in the hotel and catering sector is recycled Structural Fund money which was initially allocated for other purposes. The £250 million for this fund is additional money.  It has nothing to do with the reductions in both the capital allocation to the regional technical colleges, institutes of technology and certain vocational education committee colleges and the capital amount for the universities and designated colleges sector.  If we take the 1997 Estimates compared to the 1998 Estimates into account, there is a shortfall of approximately £9 million in the capital forecast for regional technical colleges, institutes of technology and certain designated vocational education committee colleges.  Is the <Col N="894" /> money being provided by juggling the Estimates each year?  Is there a net increase in the amount of money being provided?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the use of the word &ldquo;juggling&rdquo; in connection with the establishment of this fund. The £250 million over the next three years is in addition to the normal annual Estimates.  It is not true that there is a decrease in the Estimates provision for 1998 compared to the Estimates provision in 1997.  The figure for 1997 was £36.7 million, which was made up of £21.45 million from the European Regional Development Fund for the Dublin Institute of Technology and regional technical college sectors and £15.25 million for the Higher Education Authority sector.  The comparable figure for 1998 is £41.4 million, which is made up of £25.087 million for the regional technical college, WIT and Dublin Institute of Technology sectors and £16.315 million for the Higher Education Authority sector.</P>
      <P>In terms of outturn, I took certain initiatives to purchase land for a number of colleges which was paid for out of the Supplementary Estimates.  We did that because requests were made to the Department. Some £2.5 million was made available to Galway Regional Technical College to purchase land because if it was not purchased, the college would not be in a position to expand.  The Estimates show an increase on the 1997 Estimates. We also took an initiative in July to allocate an additional £5 million capital to meet the skills requirements mentioned in the Lindsay report which was published in July.  The previous Government had made no provision for that.  We decided to act by creating approximately 1,550 places in computer software and technician programmes starting in October.  To do that we had to introduce a £5 million capital allocation over and above what was provided in the 1997 Estimates, but which was nonetheless required to create additional places to filter through the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is not necessary.  I accept the Deputy's desire to ring-fence the fund as additional spending in the Estimate and this is also the Department's view.  I assure him the purpose of the fund is to establish clear daylight between the money allocated to it and the annual Estimates process.  There would be no point in creating a fund if it was to merely substitute for Estimates.  Furthermore, the bottom line in terms of the funding identified by the Deputy for the craft and tourism sectors is that the money was not available to fund urgent capital requirements in them and that is why in the fund we have identified approximately £20 million to be invested in colleges that provide for the catering industry so that we can improve and modernise facilities and create additional places to meet the skill shortages and needs of the tourism industry generally. In many respects the genesis of the fund was in the identification of the skills needs of the economy <Col N="895" /> and the sense of urgency required from the Government to send a clear signal that it was serious about dealing with them.</P>
    <P>I do not see how the insertion of the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; in the long Title is necessary or why &ldquo;make available further&rdquo; should be deleted in terms of achieving the objectives articulated by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>According to the unabridged Estimates the 1997 forecast outturn is £31.3 million and the Estimate provision is £25.087 million, a reduction of 20 per cent while the recent Supplementary Estimate added £10 million to the subhead.  Are the figures in the unabridged Estimates for 1998 accurate?  These figures deal with regional colleges and institutes of technology, while under subhead M2, An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas, the forecast outturn for 1997 is £19.35 million against the 1998 Estimate of £16.315 million, a reduction of 16 per cent.  Do the figures still stand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, since July we undertook additional capital spending over and above that provided in the Estimate by the previous Government. The 1997 Estimate was for a total of £36.7 million under both subheads &mdash; £21.45 million for the regional technical college-DIT sector and £15.25 for the Higher Education Authority sector. The chairman of the Higher Education Authority chaired the skills group, which came forward with recommendations in July just after the Government was formed.  It recommended the provision of an annual intake of 1,000 extra computer software engineers and 750 technicians over the next five years and was pressing for action this autumn so that the universities, regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology could take in people.  The Government was faced with a choice and since the previous Government had allocated nothing in the Estimates for skills, we decided, as an initial sign of goodwill, that we would allocate £5 million in capital in July.  Even at that stage the institutions were concerned that we would not come back with a serious effort on the skills issue, but we have with the provision of this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, funding had to be arranged for extra land at Galway and Tallaght Regional Technical Colleges and spending in Blanchardstown and Cork Regional Technical Colleges. There was additional capital spending approaching the end of the year which made for a significant outturn on third level expenditure.  Prior to this, we identified a fund of £250 million to cover a range of areas where need had been established. <Col N="896" /> If one looks at the capital provision for the third level sector over recent years, next year's is consistent with previous ones for both sectors of higher education and demonstrates that the investment fund is not a substitute for annual Estimates.  It is an additional allocation ringfenced for specific areas and needs to modernise our technological capacity at all levels of education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;An tÚdarás&rsquo; has the meaning assigned by section 4(3)(a).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments were discussed on Committee Stage yesterday with the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy.  There was a concern that the provisions of the Bill were diluting or undermining the legal functions of An tÚdarás, the Higher Education Authority.  Amendment No. 2 seeks to have a definition of An tÚdarás inserted in section 1 as it would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>The first reference to it in the Bill is in section 4(3)(a) which states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall consult with An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas (&ldquo;An tÚdarás&rdquo;) before making such a payment.</P>
      <P>Currently the procedure is that an institution will, in the first instance, make an application to the Higher Education Authority and subsequent to that the Minister becomes a player.  The use of the term &ldquo;consult with&rdquo; caused a great deal of concern and the Minister of State indicated he would come back to us on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, among the functions of the Higher Education Authority is the funding of universities and designated third level institutions, the development of third level education to meet the needs of the community and it has an advisory role.  Consultation is not taking advice.  We can consult without any advice passing one way or the other.  The subsection I have quoted is in effect a dilution of the statutory role of the Higher Education Authority.  Suppose a particular institution approached the Minister directly and the Minister decided he wanted to fund this project without reference to anybody else, there would be an onus on him to consult with the Higher Education Authority but that could mean informing it, and not much more than that.  There is no binding obligation on the Minister under this Bill to take <Col N="897" /> advice in this matter.  I am concerned about the bypassing of the HEA.  I recognise there is a wider remit in terms of the third level institutions and that the regional technical colleges, institutes of technology and so on come directly to the Department but the other role of the HEA, that of providing advice in relation to the third level sector as a whole, could be bypassed.  Those are the concerns which were expressed on Committee Stage.  I withdrew my amendments to re-enter them on the basis that the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, would be responding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy O'Shea's concerns in this area.  Yesterday the Minister of State was keen to point out that nothing in this Bill changes the role of the Higher Education Authority. Accordingly, I have sponsored an amendment, the import of which is that nothing in this Bill shall interfere with the role and functions of An tÚdarás as set out in the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.  My principal concern on Committee Stage was to maintain the traditional relationship between the institutions, the Higher Education Authority and the Minister, as set out in section 8(1) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971:</P>
      <P>Any request by an institution of higher education for State subvention shall be submitted by the institution to An tÚdarás in such manner as An tÚdarás may require.</P>
      <P>In other words, an idea or proposal is submitted to An tÚdarás.  Section 10(1) states:</P>
      <P>An tÚdarás shall assess amounts of State financial provision, both current and capital, which it recommends for higher education and research or for any part thereof, either in relation to current or future periods.</P>
      <P>The proposal is submitted to the Higher Education Authority which assesses how much should be spent on it.  Section 11 provides that it can obtain more information from the institution if it wishes to look more deeply into the proposal. Section 12(1) states:</P>
      <P>There shall be paid to An tÚdarás, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  .. as may be approved of by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The order is clear.  The proposal comes from the institution, it is assessed for its value by the HEA. The Higher Education Authority recommends to the Minister that he spends so much and the Minister says either yes or no. It is clear from the Bill that a different procedure will occur.  Under section 4 the Minister will pay money from the fund to institutes of higher education.  By way of clarification, the Minister will consult with the HEA.  That has definitely changed the traditional relationship.  The Minister is now in a position where he evaluates the proposals and ultimately makes the decision on whether to proceed.  The Higher Education Authority has been given the <Col N="898" /> subsidiary role of consultation.  The Minister disagrees with this interpretation.  That is why he will have no difficulty in accepting amendment No. 11 with the exclusion of the reference to individual sections because it goes right through the Bill.  It would then read:</P>
    <P>nothing in this Act shall interfere with the role and functions of An tÚdarás as set out in the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971 in respect of financial provision to an institution of higher education from the fund.</P>
    <P>That would satisfy me but I am not sure whether it would satisfy Deputy O'Shea.  Another Minister might have a different intention and the powers which allow him to subvert the traditional role of the Higher Education Authority should not be allowed.  That should be put in proper statute, rather than depend on the goodwill of this Minister to leave intact the powers of the HEA. I submit that amendment No. 11 is the neatest solution to this problem.  It would give assurances to this side of the House and to the Higher Education Authority that its role is protected.  I commend it to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their concern. The amendments are superfluous in that the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, stands and is in no way undermined by the Bill.  Section 8(1) states:</P>
      <P>Any request by an institution of higher education for State subvention shall be submitted by the institution to An tÚdarás in such manner as An tÚdarás may require.</P>
      <P>That section is not covered in Deputy Bruton's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough.  I know where the Deputy is heading.  Section 8(1) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, still stands.  Any institution seeking funds from the fund would have to go through the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority would then go to Government in the normal way and discuss with the Minister the proposals received from particular institutions under its jurisdiction. Some of the amendments are broadly framed and give the impression of covering all institutions such as the regional technical colleges, the Waterford Institute of Technology and Dublin Institute of Technology.  It is envisaged at some stage that they would come under the remit of the Higher Education Authority, in terms of funding.  Section 4(3)(b) of the Bill stipulates that all payments from the fund to universities or institutions under the Higher Education Authority must be paid through the Higher Education Authority.  That is included to copperfasten and underline the role of the Higher Education Authority in the allocation of money from the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> The Higher Education Authority works closely with the Department in processing applications and identifying the needs of various institutions. It is unfair to suggest there is some machiavellian motivation behind the phraseology in the Bill to the effect that there is an attempt to circumvent the Higher Education Authority.  That certainly is not on my agenda or on the agenda of anyone in the Department.  Clearly the Higher Education Authority has been given considerable status in the Bill as the Authority through which requests will be made in terms of projects they wish to have funded from the fund and in terms of payments to be made through the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Authority must be consulted by the institutes of higher education in relation to funding from the fund programmes. Amendment No. 5 would have the effect of preventing the Minister from making any such payment, in any circumstance, unless the Higher Education Authority requested it.  The Higher Education Authority should not have that role in respect of every programme funded from the fund. Its jurisdiction extends to the institutions designated under the 1971 Act only; it does not have a role in respect of second level schools, vocational schools, PLC colleges, the regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology or the Waterford Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>The amendments are unnecessary and superfluous.  The Bill does not undermine or supersede the 1971 Act.</P>

      <P>While I accept the Minister's good faith, he is misreading the legislation.  Under the 1971 Act An tÚdarás makes recommendations which are approved by the Minister and the money is paid out.  The Minister has gone out of his way to tell us that he is providing in section 4(3)(a) of the Bill for consultation.  He has already assured us that An tÚdarás will have been at the heart of the process.  Either section 4(3)(a) is redundant and should not be inserted <Col N="900" /> because this activity is governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act or amendment No. 11 is appropriate. I do not want to see its role being usurped by another Minister, if not by the Minister.</P>

That is a matter the Minister will deal with in his own time.  I accept the 1971 Act has to stand but it is in conflict with section 4(3)(a)(i) of the Bill.  While I take the point that the jurisdiction of the Higher Education Authority does not extend to the institutes of technology, the regional technical colleges, first and second level schools, in respect of the institutions designated under the 1971 Act is it the Minister's advice that the provisions of the Bill which provide for consultation do not damage that Act?</P>

    <P>As soon as may be, but not later than 3 months, after the end of the financial year, 1998, and each subsequent financial year, the Minister shall prepare a report with respect to the operation of the Fund during that financial year and shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and published.</P>
    <P>It is not clear from that section whether a report will be prepared within the period specified.  I am seeking to ensure the details of the allocations made to institutions from the fund will be placed in the public arena at an early date after the end of the financial year.  In politics nowadays we operate on the basis of transparency and accountability. This is not an unreasonable request.  It is not beyond the ability of Ministers and Departments to make financial reports available within three months of the end of the financial year.</P>

I do not have any difficulty with its thrust, to ensure that within three months the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be made available to all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 21, after &ldquo;account&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the account with the Office of the Paymaster General&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This simple amendment goes to the heart of the concept of what the fund is about.  I imagine the Minister will be very pleased to accept it because <Col N="902" /> it would have the benefit of adding perhaps £30 million to his fund.  It provides that, when the Minister for Finance agrees to pay over his £100 million early in January next, that money will be invested by the National Treasury Management Agency, the interest earned thereon accruing to the benefit of and for the purposes intended by the fund.  This will mean that, if the Minister finds not sufficient projects are being submitted quickly enough and his money remains invested in State securities, the interest thereon will be rolling up to his advantage and purposes, namely, the promotion of scientific and technological education and research.  That is what was understood by the public when the Minister announced the establishment of this fund.  It certainly came as an enormous shock to me to discover that, once the Bill had been passed, in January next the Minister for Finance would issue a cheque to the Minister responsible for the fund, lodged not to the fund but back to the Minister for Finance who would pocket it, with the interest accruing to the benefit of the Minister for Finance and not for educational purposes.  That condition is tucked away very subtly in the Bill.  For example, section 2(5) reads:</P>
    <P>Moneys standing to the credit of the investment account which are not, for the time being, required for the purpose of making payments out of the Fund under section 4 shall be invested by the Minister for Finance in securities issued by the State.</P>
    <P>That sounds great but then one discovers from the definition of &ldquo;the investment account&rdquo; that that is interpreted as not being all the moneys in the fund but a tiny proportion only, namely, the private contributions.  Effectively this means we are asking the private sector to dip into its funds, which will lead to very substantial debt in the case of those companies, which will have to increase their borrowings to contribute to the fund.  They will do so, we hope, in good faith.  Their contributions will accumulate to the fund and its investment earnings will be ploughed back into the fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will behave in an entirely contrary way and will not allow any money to be taken from the Exchequer until a project is submitted and approved.  As far as the Exchequer is concerned, there will be no money there and any potential investment income will not exist because what the National Treasury Management Agency has been told to do is just treat this as though it were something to be used to reduce the national debt.  Therefore, the cheque will issue on day one, come back in on the same day, having been processed through the National Treasury Management Agency, with a chit somewhere saying &ldquo;Minister for Finance owes the fund £100 million&rdquo; but there will not be moneys accumulating there.  That is a huge disappointment.</P>
    <P>When I heard the Minister's initial announcement I understood this was to be a fund to which <Col N="903" /> both private and public sectors would contribute, that those moneys would accumulate and be available for projects and would not be invested immediately.  If the Minister wants to get best value from this fund, he should endeavour to spend as speedily as possible because he will be reaping the advantage of its early expenditure. We should give the Minister a proper fund because, if he has to await the submission and approval of appropriate projects, he should be earning interest on his money, perhaps reaping £30 million over the full period.</P>
    <P>I predict the Minister will be very pleased to accept this amendment since it promotes the cause he advocates so eloquently.  I hope the Minister for Finance will see that that is what the public expected when he announced the establishment of an education fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The same surprise descended on me yesterday as on Deputy Richard Bruton in regard to how this fund would be operated.  My recollection of what we were told yesterday was that effectively the fund would be managed by the Minister for Finance who, in turn, would delegate that function to the National Treasury Management Agency, which body would handle the moneys to maximise the benefit to the taxpayer as distinct from maximising the benefit to the Department of Education and Science; in other words, that any interest accruing would not be to the benefit of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>We want to help the Minister in the belief that he should benefit from all moneys accruing.  I can see where the Minister for Finance is coming from regarding financial management.  I note that section 4(1)(e) states:</P>
      <P>such other scientific, technological or vocational education and training programmes (howsoever established) as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, considers appropriate</P>
      <P>This means that particular projects can be considered for appropriation, representing an intrusion into areas proper to the Minister for Education and Science.  In terms of the various institutions that may avail of these funds, or of an allocation or payment therefrom, the real say should rest with the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Richard Bruton's amendment on the basis that, if accepted, additional moneys would accrue to the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting the good intentions of my fellow Members that I should have more money to spend, at the outset it was made clear that there would be two separate accounts. The State's contribution of £250 million would be held in an account for the Office of the Paymaster General, the account into which Exchequer contributions would be made and, second, a private <Col N="904" /> donations investment account would be established into which private donations might be paid, drawing a clear distinction between the two.  Anybody who reads my press releases at the launch of this fund or my Second Stage speech would acknowledge that it was made absolutely clear that was the intention.  We put it up front, for the reason that the private sector needs to know that whatever it contributes to the fund is not a substitute for Exchequer funding, with a clear distinction between private sector and public sector contributions. The fund was established initially to send a clear signal to the private sector, to anyone who might wish to donate to third level institutions or to education generally, that the Government was absolutely up front and committed to investing in the skills needed in our economy by the creation of such a fund.  The demonstration of that commitment would facilitate investment by private companies either into institutions or via the fund mechanism.  If we were to invest the Exchequer contribution of £250 million in securities, it would represent an inefficient use of the financial resources of the State.  The State would stand to gain more by the National Treasury Management Agency managing the Exchequer money rather than letting a lump sum lie idle in an investment account.</P>
      <P>We will have many projects coming on stream. There is no shortage of projects seeking money from this fund.  The genesis of the fund was that, having read the files on the technological sector, the regional technical colleges, Waterford Institute of Technology and Dublin Institute of Technology, and having realised it was starved of capital, there was a huge mismatch between press releases and articulated policy and resources to meet that policy. People were saying we must invest more in Waterford Institute of Technology and Tallaght Regional Technical College, and construct a new regional technical college, for example, in Blanchardstown. All these press releases were being made over the past 12 or 15 months, yet the existing regional technical colleges, built 20 years ago, have double the number of students for which they were originally built, their equipment is obsolete in many instances and they were starved of resources.  Clearly something, over and above the annual provision in the Estimates, had to be done and that is why the fund was created.</P>
      <P>It was clear the PLC sector was short of capital investment; it had never had meaningful capital investment since its establishment many years ago.</P>
      <P>The Lindsay report identified a £50 million need for technicians and for skills in computer software.  We have increased the sum available to £65 million, if one counts the £5 million we spent in July and the £60 million in the fund.</P>
      <P>The genesis of the fund was the need for skills in the economy.  The technological sector was undercapitalised and there was an urgent need at primary and second level to allocate funding to provide information and communications technologies to schools.  We are behind in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> The key point is that we will be able to move on these projects quickly.  We will be in a position, once this Bill is enacted, to start into a multi-annual medium-term framework for spending so that we can sanction projects in the first couple of months.  The realisation of the cost of those projects may occur in the second or even the third year because there is a lead in time to the start of capital projects, that is, a period between construction and the ultimate payment of the cost.</P>
    <P>The major mould-breaking nature of this fund is that we can now start planning over a medium term.  Up to now, one had to allocate money on a year to year basis.  Once the Bill is enacted and the fund is in place, we can start sanctioning projects and telling institutions they can move forward. We can do that in the first year even for a sum in excess of £100 million because the £250 million is there over a three year period.  That will save the Exchequer money too because there is greater value in medium-term planning as opposed to sanctioning projects on a year on year basis.</P>
    <P>The NTMA has been superb in managing Exchequer moneys.  Deputy Richard Bruton is shaking his head, but it has done a good job overall. This is an imaginative use of funds and the NTMA.  We will be able to draw down money subject to a limit of £250 million over the next three years when requested and we can process projects on the basis of that sum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth is coming out now, that this is really no more than a multi-annual budget.  It is not a fund.  We are already introducing multi-annual budgeting.  Essentially the Minister is saying he has a multi-annual capital budget over the next three years, which will consist of £100 million in the first year and £75 million in each of the subsequent years.  It is a good measure and I am all in favour of it.  However, to call it an investment fund is a misnomer.</P>
      <P>The Minister told me to read his press statement and I have it with me.  In it he stated that the investment fund will comprise £250 million to be allocated to capital programmes; that there will be an initial £100 million; and that the investment fund will be enabled to receive donations from non-Government sources.  He did not state at any stage that there will be an investment fund consisting solely of private donations and a separate multi-annual capital budget.  The only money the NTMA is investing is not the £100 million which the Minister is providing; it is whatever he receives in private donations.  That is the reality.</P>

On reading his statement, everyone saw there would be a fund for education purposes in an account and that it would comprise £250 million from the Exchequer and private donations and would earn interest. However, it is a multi-annual capital budget and a separate private operation which is the investment fund.</P>
      <P>To achieve that, the Minister had to introduce this strange definition of the investment account. Did Members notice that?  Everybody thought the investment account was the whole sum of money but it is just the account of private donations.</P>
      <P>To call this a fund was a bit of a cod.  I commend the Minister for spending the money because it is needed, but it is a deception to treat the private sector contributions differently from the State money.  The State money will not be contained there.  The private money will be contained there accumulating interest.</P>

      <P>It is unworthy of the Deputy to make the allegation that at some stage of this process we were not upfront about the identification of the investment accounts for private donations. From day one we made it clear that there would be two separate accounts.  One of the problems experienced by the private sector and those who donated to universities over the past number of years was the perception that they were doing the State's job.  There was a perception that the State was substituting private donations and contributions for State funding and that we, as a State, <Col N="908" /> were not playing our part in matching those funds or giving a commitment to the sector.  That is why the two separate accounts were put in place.  We are not proposing anything additional to what has always been the case in terms of the financial management of the country.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance has always had a key role in agreeing to sanction any spending, particularly from a fund as large as this.  The Department of Education and Science has not had any difficulty with the role of the Department of Finance in this.  We worked closely with the Department of Finance in the preparation of this legislation and appreciated the support we received from the Minister for Finance and his Department.  It made sense to those of us on the education and science side that the NTMA should be the appropriate body to manage the Exchequer's contribution.  This £250 million is a tremendous contribution by the Government which surpasses anything the previous Government attempted in this area.</P>

The net point is that if money is accruing from the investment of the £100 million it should be to the benefit of the Department of Education and Science. I accept the strategy of how matters are managed and the question of what is to the benefit of the taxpayer, but I am concerned about what is to the benefit of education and to the students attending our colleges and schools.</P>

      <P>If the Minister responds to amendments and a serious debate on issues that will affect the future of this country by delving back into the past and criticising the service of his predecessors, he will have a rough ride in this House.  I carefully read and I have all the Minister's announcements on this.  I also have the statements made by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  I read them carefully, but not one of them referred to the existence of two funds.  No one said that there would be two funds, one of which would accrue investment income to the benefit of education and another in which that would not occur.  That was never stated.  One could read those statements until one is blue in the face, but would not discover that to be the reality.  It was only when we studied this Bill we discovered this.  It is disappointing that was not made clear.  As the Minister said, it was made clear that private money would not be substituted for public spending and that is important, but it was never made clear that there would be two funds.  That is the point I am making.  It was not made clear that private donors would be treated differently from public donors.  They will have to talk to their bank managers to make a contribution to the fund at a cost to themselves, but the Exchequer will not be required to contribute to the fund until suitable projects are proposed in respect of which it will expend money.  That is the <Col N="909" /> reality.  I am disappointed that is the route being taken by the Minister and that is why I tabled this amendment.  If this amendment is accepted, the Minister would have more money to spend on projects which the House would agree are worthy of expenditure.  I propose to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iv) a college within the meaning of the Vocational Education Acts, 1930 to 1970, or</P>
      <P>(v) such other colleges as the Minister may from time to time approve,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under section 4(1) a number of colleges are listed to which funds will be given for the provision of scientific, technological or vocational education. That list is currently confined solely to the universities, the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  This amendment provides for the inclusion of colleges within the meaning of the vocational education Acts and such other colleges as the Minister may from time to time approve.  I strongly believe that all colleges should have equal access on similar terms to the fund being established.  We have seen the quality of education provided by the vocational education committee sector, particularly in the PLC area, where those colleges have pushed out the boat dramatically and are now providing significant scientific and technological education. Colleges, such as Coláiste Dhúlaigh in my constituency and the Ballyfermot college, are doing excellent work.  They deserve to be treated on as fair a footing and be held in the same equal esteem as other traditional colleges.  If anything they should get a boost and be held in higher esteem because they are catering predominantly for children who come from poorer families than those who attend the regional technical colleges and universities.  The Minister will know that from data in his Department.  We should treat those students fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will no doubt say that such colleges could be included under other provisions. They could be included under paragraph (b) if <Col N="910" /> the Minister decided there was a special need to be catered for.  He could decide that PLC colleges should have a role in providing teleservice courses, but that would be only on the basis of he deciding that.  He will put them on an <i>ad hoc</i> funding basis compared to the universities and regional technical colleges.  It is only if he decides it suits the occasion that they will be included on similar terms.  He may designate the provision of teleservice courses to vocational education committees because there is a skills shortage, but he is not allowing them to develop a coherent set of courses in a long-term strategic way with the possibility of access to this fund on the same basis as universities and regional technical colleges. That is not fair.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably also advert to section 4(1)(e) which provides that such other scientific, technological or vocational education and training programmes can be provided with the consent of the Minister or the Minister for Finance.  The Minister is long enough at this game to know what that section means.  It means that the Minister for Finance will have to individually approve any idea emanating from these colleges and the likelihood of that happening is next to nil.</P>
    <P>I am concerned not only about the vocational education committees, which are a lead contender, but also private colleges which should have access to the use of this money on an equal basis if they show they have a good project.  I was disappointed that when the Minister concluded the competition initiated by the Government in respect of those who would provide training, software, engineering and other such courses, private colleges were not included in that provision. I was surprised by that because, from my knowledge of some of the private colleges, they were providing very good education on a basis that would have been competitive with the universities.</P>
    <P>I fear that what may be behind the reluctance of the Minister for Finance to sign up to private colleges is that he sees it opening up the possibility that fees and maintenance would have to be paid in private colleges in the longer term.  That reluctance to open up a new vista is giving private colleges unfair access.  That is the reason they have not been listed for consideration in the first instance, and they will have to come through some other more difficult route.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have a list that is equitable to all educational institutions in paragraph (a), which lets them all in on a fair basis.  He will be seen to be fair in particular to colleges catering for those from lower income backgrounds.  If we want to see the scientific and technological revolution become deep-rooted, it should not be predominantly middle-class children who get to regional technical colleges and universities.  It must apply throughout the workforce.  The Minister should reconsider this amendment which is not a dramatic one but it opens up the possibility <Col N="911" /> of him using the fund freely to promote long-term strategic development in the vocational sector.</P>

      <P>I call Deputy Sargent whose amendment is being discussed with amendment No. 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton put forward many of the arguments I would cite in support of my amendment which is to include, in the remit of this funding, youth organisations recognised and grant-aided through the youth work grants scheme and other such schemes, as administered by the youth affairs section of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>As it stands the Bill comes across clearly as a middle-class school enhancement Bill.  The Minister will talk about the overall equity of his thinking on it, and I do not doubt his bona fides in the matter, but when the Bill becomes law it will have to stand on its own merits.  The intention of the Minister will not be known to those reading the Bill and, in particular, to those not accustomed to the current trends in IT education.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider how the Bill will read when it becomes law.  It comes across as being restrictive in terms of its concentration on formal education.  For good reasons, formal education does not need to be updated in regard to IT education.  That is not in dispute.  However, the Bill does not explicitly deal with the need to target disadvantaged areas of education, although I do not doubt the Minister's intention in that regard.  I ask the Minister to examine the Bill as somebody who has never seen it before and make the case I make that the two tier level of education, which mirrors the two tier level of society in general, must be given priority in legislation so that it can be tackled.</P>
      <P>My amendment recognises the need to give the public an opportunity to see at first hand the Minister's breadth of inclusion in this legislation. It also takes into account something of which the Minister will be aware from yesterday's newspapers, namely, the growing trend of people bypassing college and taking up immediate employment, regardless of the long-term prospects. People are tempted to get out of the education system when an opportunity of employment arises.</P>
      <P>As the people in Clonmel can testify, those who have left the formal education system may wish to examine their options anew.  When employment is no longer available to them, education becomes an option.  The way education is administered now is much broader than in the past.  Distance learning and the youth organisations to which I referred have a role to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to this amendment, which is not attempting to add something that the Bill does not already have.  From what the Minister of State said yesterday, however, I believe the Minister may refer to paragraph (e) which <Col N="912" /> refers to such other scientific, technological or vocational education and training programmes, however established, as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, considers appropriate.  That paragraph has merit but it does not come across in the Bill as being inclusive.  It does not give the clear message that the Minister will examine a proposal on the same footing as the proposal explicitly allowed.  As Deputy Bruton said, that creates a two tier evaluation in its own way.  That should not be encouraged because the powerful lobby groups, such as the universities, are very good at lobbying TDs and making clear they have a case, which they often do, but other organisations are not so good at that.  We should try to help them in every way we can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In an earlier contribution the Minister referred to the need for institutions to be engaged in medium rather than short-term planning.  I agree with him in that regard.  These amendments ask that the provisions of the Bill be more specific which will assist the type of institutions Deputies Bruton and Sargent spoke about and the need to embark on the medium-term planning that is desirable.</P>
      <P>Section 4(1)(e) refers to education or training programmes, however established, as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, considers appropriate.  The consideration of whether the programmes are appropriate does not tie the Minister to anything in particular.  It should be made clear that certain institutions are not excluded, particularly the youth organisations referred to by Deputy Sargent.</P>
      <P>In the Seanad the Minister referred to a provision of £20 million for capital purposes in the PLC apprenticeship area.  Will the Minister expand on that?  Does this mean that FÁS will benefit from the fund in terms of apprenticeship provision or is it specifically an apprenticeship provision?</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised the issue of private colleges. I tabled an amendment, which was pushed to a vote, on this issue on Committee Stage.  As things stand there is nothing to prevent private colleges benefiting from the fund.  However, I have a number of reservations.  Private colleges should only benefit when there is equality of access for all students.  In that context, the amendment I tabled on Committee Stage sought that the private colleges which will benefit should already be in receipt of a modicum of public finance. It also stipulated that the colleges should meet the requirements set down, particularly those relating to taxation.  It is the Labour Party's view &mdash; I believe it is also the Minister's &mdash; that equality of access to education should be a fundamental plank of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in the Minister's views in respect of the private colleges.  Deputy Sargent raised a number of points in respect of disadvantage and yesterday's ESRI report.  A large section of the population requires either second chance or continuing education.  It is the view of the Labour <Col N="913" /> Party that a significant amount of the resources provided by the Department should be targeted in a positively discriminative way toward the long-term unemployed.  There is a clear pattern that those with low skill levels, except in exceptional circumstances, cannot attract employment which provides any real quality of life or a basis on which these people can fully realise their talents.</P>
    <P>I support the thrust of the amendments.  It is important to make clear, beyond reasonable doubt, that the organisations which can benefit under the fund will be encouraged to develop innovative plans, etc., in respect of providing assistance to people who are &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; in terms of their skills and abilities to play a worthwhile and meaningful role in the economic system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I share many of the views articulated by the Deputies in respect of the need for inclusion and the further need to ensure that we improve the skills base and provide proper education and training to people among the ranks of the long-term unemployed and those who are not adequately catered for by the formal system of education.  In many ways the section is worded flexibly to allow for innovative submissions and projects to be made to the Department and the Minister of the day in terms of such social inclusion measures.</P>
      <P>The difficulty with including further definitions sought by the amendments is that others will become excluded.  For example, in the post-leaving certificate sector, the vocational education committee colleges are predominant in providing the majority of courses.  Other second level colleges &mdash; voluntary secondary schools, community schools and comprehensives &mdash; also provide some PLC courses, particularly in the regions.  It is very important in any given townland or region if there is a PLC component in second level schools. It would be wrong if the intention of amendment No. 6 is to ring-fence the PLC sector within the vocational education committee colleges alone. Other second level schools have developed this capacity in respect of valid post-leaving certificate courses and they should be equally entitled to make applications under the provisions of the fund.  For example, this might be done in respect of the areas of teleservices or electronics where a skills need may exist.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage in the Seanad I made it clear that £20 million will be allocated in respect of apprentices and PLCs.  This is deliberate because, if one considers the evolution of the PLC sector, no real capital provision has been made in terms of the capital needs of colleges such as Coláiste Dhúlaigh, the College of Commerce in Cork, St. John's Central College or Whitehall College. Many of the PLC colleges developed without the provision of capital equipment and a number of them are now short of space and cannot accommodate existing student numbers.  There is a clear need to provide capital funding and that is why £20 million is being allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> There is also a shortage of apprentices in key areas.  In that context, the regional technical colleges, which predominantly provide apprentice training, will be given additional resources to improve facilities and provide additional places. The funding for apprentice training will be directed toward the regional technical colleges, the Waterford Institute of Technology and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy Sargent's concerns in respect of informal education but it is not fair to label the Bill &ldquo;middle class&rdquo;, because it is concerned with identifying skills needs.  The Department's ICT plan &mdash; Schools IT 2000 &mdash; contains a clear priority to deal first with schools in disadvantaged areas.  Funding for that plan amounts to £50 million, £25 million of which will come from the investment fund.  The plan clearly sets out the need to bring ICTs to disadvantaged areas.  It is designed to ensure that children in these areas are not further disadvantaged by a failure to embrace ICTs or to have access to computers and the best of equipment in their schools.</P>
    <P>The fund will provide the resources to tackle disadvantage, in both the formal and informal context.  In the informal context, a good model exists in the form of the area partnerships which work with schools, youth services and health boards and take a multi-agency approach.  Those responsible for the area partnerships may inform the Department that, in order to change the skills profile of a given area and provide young people with training, a certain line of action should be taken and a process of investment put in place.  Taking account of the type of plan an area partnership might bring forward, that investment could be directed toward the informal or formal sectors or a combination of both.</P>
    <P>I am trying to consider this issue from the point of view of someone reading the Bill for the first time.  However, the Bill must also be considered from the point of view of those who framed the it.  Legislation is not framed to exclude anyone.  It is often framed to give a Minister significant room for manoeuvre and flexibility in terms of application of the money at his or her disposal.  Therefore, good projects which may be brought forward from the informal and formal sectors will not be excluded.</P>
    <P>All primary schools and second level schools &mdash; irrespective of whether they are vocational schools, comprehensives, community schools or voluntary secondary schools &mdash; are adequately catered for under paragraphs (b), (d) and (e).  It is our intention that these schools should be catered for equally.</P>
    <P>Private colleges are not excluded from putting forward projects in respect of the skills area.  On the last occasion, only one college applied.  I intend to meet the HECA in January to discuss a wide range of issues about which it is concerned in respect of private colleges.  Those colleges may come forward with projects in the skills area.  I have no ideological hang-up about private colleges <Col N="915" /> putting forward projects to meet skills needs.  I am open to anything which generates competition between the public and private sectors to achieve value for money.  As to the provision of places in the skills area, one has to be careful how one proceeds.  One reason for growth in the private sector is the lack of public sector spaces.  That is also why people travel to the UK and Northern Ireland.  I hope the provision of the fund will in itself generate a minimum of 7,000 extra places in computer software alone.  That will provide genuine equality of access to young people who wish to attend third level.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister is not willing to accept these amendments.  The arguments used by the Minister of State yesterday were repeated today.  Given the shortage of time I do not intend to pursue the matter, except to say the Minister misread the amendment when he said I did not envisage second level colleges providing PLC courses as being possible beneficiaries. I deliberately provided that the Minister may from time to time approve other such colleges to allow him that flexibility.  I regret that the Minister is not agreeable but <i>c'est la vie.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I also regret that the Minister mistakenly feels my amendment would have the effect of excluding others.  I cannot understand how he reached this conclusion, given that my amendment deletes nothing from the Bill and he said the provisions would include whatever institutions were appropriate.  I was trying to extend the &ldquo;fast track&rdquo; consideration &mdash; some applicants would be mentioned in the legislation and, therefore, would be more inclined to take an interest in what the Bill is trying to achieve.  The amendment neither deletes, excludes nor restricts anything &mdash; it does the opposite.</P>
      <P>Whereas I understand the Minister has plans for disadvantaged areas in other aspects of his remit, this Bill must stand alone and will apply to any future Minister.  To that extent it must be read in and of itself.  I was trying to improve it and I am sorry he has not seen fit to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's remark that the provisions of section 4(1), particularly the three paragraphs to which he alluded, are of a catch-all nature and on that basis do not exclude. However, there is another agenda to be addressed, which is that organisations should have a signal that they are welcome to apply to the fund or investment account, rather than a general provision such as this.  There is no enabling section which would allow the Minister, by way of statutory instrument, to provide lists of the institutions at first, second or third level which could benefit from the fund.</P>

Paragraph (d) covers &ldquo;programmes the primary objective of which is to improve the ability of students and teachers at primary and post-primary schools, including vocational schools, to use computers and other types of information technology&rdquo;. Paragraph (e) covers &ldquo;such other scientific, technological or vocational education and training programmes howsoever established as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, considers appropriate&rdquo;.  We are deliberately being flexible enough to catch any conceivable project or innovation which may emerge from both the informal and the formal sector.  Our ICT programme is geared to disadvantage and the fund contains £25 million specifically for disadvantaged areas, including provision for proper training of teachers and youth workers.

      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 32 to 35.</P>
      <P>We spent a good deal of time on this yesterday and the Minister of State undertook to come back on Report Stage.  There was concern on the Opposition benches that the Minister for Education and Science was not the best Minister to engage in venture capital exercises, which is essentially what the provision covers.</P>
      <P>The section promises that the Minister will make funds available to commercialise research &mdash; he would fund commercial ideas resulting from research work in the colleges.  I am all in favour of seed-funding such ideas as are capable of commercial exploitation but that is not the function of the Minister for Education and Science.  If he wishes to do that from the fund, there should be a separate section whereby such moneys would be allocated by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who would in turn consult Forbairt and the IDA and appoint a venture capital manager to look at these investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not appropriate that the Minister for Education and Science should be drawn into this sort of exercise.  It is always possible that the money will get lost and the Minister will come under pressure about keeping a lame duck in operation. It is not the Minister's area because he does not, to my knowledge, have any venture capitalist in his Department to manage this for him.  This is also the most risky end of the venture capital <Col N="917" /> market &mdash; ideas coming fresh from research laboratories. The Minister for Education and Science should not do this but I am not opposed to him drawing up a separate section, should he so decide, to provide that money from the fund could be administered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which would seed-fund research ideas which are capable of being commercialised.</P>
    <P>One has to do this with one's eyes open, knowing that this is a risky area.  There are venture funds under Forbairt and the Minister will know we have been extremely careful to arrange that taxpayers' money is matched by similar moneys from private institutions and that the fund is managed privately, with tough criteria as to what represents a good investment.  I hope the Minister's officials, reflecting overnight in consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, will think better of going ahead with this provision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we are not witnessing the emergence of old turf wars between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Education and Science.  The notion that industry and education should not be involved in very active collaboration, even in commercial enterprises, is flawed.  There is no reason they should not collaborate.  Yesterday I met a professor, the Vice Chancellor at the University of Surrey, an Irishman, who explained that his university is the least dependent on State resources in the UK because of successful involvement in commercial enterprises, in a satellite company and a massive industrial park which has benefited the university, the region and the local economy.  We should, therefore, think carefully before agreeing to delete sections of a Bill and thereby exclude such possibilities in the future.  I accept that the best expert advice should be obtained in advance of any decision.  The Tánaiste and I are co-chairing a forum made up of industry and State agencies involved in enterprise and employment, the Secretary General <Col N="918" /> of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science and a skills implementation group.  There is obviously considerable expertise to ensure that checks and balances are put in place.</P>
      <P>The Universities Act gives considerable autonomy to universities in terms of the management of their affairs.  What we are talking about here is the utilisation of fund money.  There is a need to have very strong synergy between education and industry and between industrialists and the educational world, and the notion that a Minister for Education should be completely divorced from any such activity and should have no input is flawed.  In Europe there is a merging of education and training and of research and innovation and development.  It is very hard now to draw lines as rigidly as they may have been drawn in the past. We should think carefully before we exclude the possibility of money from the fund being used in such enterprises.  There should be no difficulty because Forbairt already works with universities and other third level institutions.  Section 4(1)(c) facilitates support for research activities undertaken by or on behalf of a body, college or institute.  We are endeavouring to be flexible enough to facilitate funding of collaborative efforts between colleges and business and between industry and educational institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may misunderstand me.  I am not saying that we should prevent the emergence of business and educational partnerships for the exploitation of commercial results.  The amendment I withdrew made it clear that we should encourage that.  However, with the best will in the world, the Minister for Education and Science should not engage in venture capital activities.  Essentially the investment of money in high risk commercialisation of research is not a proper function of the Minister for Education and Science.  The Minister's Department is not equipped to deal with and has no experience in venture capital management.  This is a highly risky area.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has no experience in this area either.  That is why it has had to set up specialised funds at considerable arm's length from the Department, bringing in particular expertise from the private sector to sufficiently ringfence taxpayers' money and have it properly managed independently.  That was the right way to go.  The Minister should accept this amendment, forget about this for the time being and, perhaps, come back with a new section next year with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment taking a role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister will not do that, he should, at the very minimum, agree to amendment No. 13 &mdash; which we may not reach &mdash; which provides that guidelines should stitch into the record that there will be private management of this fund, that it will be done on the very elaborate terms that have been worked out in respect of venture <Col N="919" /> capital investments elsewhere by the State, and that the Oireachtas should be satisfied with those guidelines before we give them the go-ahead.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the attitude the Minister of State adopted to this amendment and the related amendment No. 13 yesterday in Committee. To give him credit, he agreed to consider it overnight with the Department officials and to come back today with a more refined position. However, the position has not really been refined.  It is a similar position to the one we heard yesterday.  The Minister may be making a mistake in the context of the long term.</P>

      <P>I do not agree.  It would not be right to delete the section from the Bill and to exclude that possibility in the future.  Some colleges, in advance of the publication of this Bill, have successfully developed commercial activity through the normal processes.  There are risks, but we should not exclude this possibility. Obviously there would be considerable checks and balances in advance and considerable expertise brought into play in terms of the assessment of any money paid out in this area.</P>

      <P>Campus companies are not always successful. In the context of campus companies interfacing with the private sector in terms of any research and development that is undertaken there would, obviously, be a heavy level of scrutiny of projects by the Department where capital moneys are involved.  There are certain provisions in the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology legislation but I am not quite sure of their legal status.  I understand campus companies can operate at the universities.  Is there a need for guidelines in relation to that?</P>

      <P>We receive much funding from Europe for research and development.  However, many companies use this funding instead of investing their own funding in research and development.  Industry is not investing the proper resources in research and development.  One of the problems is that industry will not invest in the fund but will wait for the State to invest the money and then cream it off.  This amendment will ensure that the fund will benefit universities in that money can be taken back from industry. Very few companies fund research in universities. Most companies wait for the research to be published and then use it to develop a product without giving any acknowledgement to the university. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the concept of the commercialisation of the activities of universities. However, this is not the point at issue, it is the necessity to safeguard public moneys.  Forbairt has a venture capital fund of more than £60 million, yet it is proposed to use the scarce resources of the Department of Education and Science to duplicate work.  I would not like people to think I am against the commercialisation of the activities of universities and of the results of research which can be used to create wealth and jobs.</P>
      <P>However, at a minimum the Bill should provide that the guidelines will be published in conjunction with or after consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forbairt, the IDA etc.  This would ensure that safeguards are in place for the future and prevent duplication.  The resources made available to the Department of Education and Science should be protected and used for the many other things which have to be done.  I strongly recommend to the Minister that he consider building into the legislation a requirement that there must be consultation before the publication of the guidelines.</P>

      <P>Section 4(5) provides for the establishment of guidelines, while the section dealing with consultation with Ministers gives priority to consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in regard to payments out of the fund.  The level of funding available within colleges for research and development has been low and the investment fund envisages up to £15 million being made available for this purpose. Deputies are concerned about the need to safeguard public moneys.  This is why the Bill contains a provision dealing with the establishment of guidelines prior to payment.  Obviously people need to know the guidelines before they seek funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am endeavouring to develop innovation within colleges.  It is important to adopt a balanced <Col N="921" /> approach when prodding colleges and institutions in the direction of research linked to industry and business which can be used for commercial purposes.  There are risks attached to projects and not all of them are successful.  There will be consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and State agencies.  The idea behind the joint forum between the Tánaiste and me is to develop the strong connection between enterprise and employment and education in this area.  The Tánaiste is very anxious that we use the forum to develop the debate on the skills issue, etc.  The deliberations of the forum and of the implementation group chaired by Mr. Chris Horn will have an impact in terms of how the money is spent. The Bill provides adequate safeguards in the areas about which the Deputies are rightly concerned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between line 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;(1) The Minister shall from time to time publicly invite applications for financial support for some or all of the monies in the Fund from eligible bodies for qualifying purposes.</P>
      <P>(2) The Minister shall publish the criteria and procedures by which he shall select projects, which shall include <i>inter alia</i> the extent to which:</P>
      <P>(i) the proposals are innovative in conception and/or in delivery,</P>
      <P>(ii) embrace a number of partners,</P>
      <P>(iii) generate a local contribution to the cost,</P>
      <P>(iv) contribute to regional development, and</P>
      <P>(v) contribute to supporting equality of opportunity.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes that the Minister should hold competitions for at least some of the money.  In other words, he should invite proposals which would then be open to evaluation by him or a team appointed by him.  I refer the Minister to the experience of Horizon, NOW and other EU initiatives under which there was a huge upswing of activity in communities who put forward ideas the traditional institutions and the Department might not have thought of.  Advertising the fund and allowing people to put forward proposals would be of great benefit.  If the Minister is agreeable to going down this road he should follow the procedure proposed in my amendment.  If he did he would be surprised at the wealth of new ideas put forward even for a small slice of the fund.  I strongly recommend this amendment to him as similar procedures have worked very successfully.</P>
      <P>The second amendment proposes that in the operation of the fund regard should be had to regional disparities in educational choice and regional development needs.  If the Deputy from south Kerry was here, I am sure he would warmly applaud this amendment as an addition to the fund.  In many parts of the country, particularly Border counties, which are disadvantaged there has not been an impact from science and technology, firms are not strong and educational institutions need an extra fillip.  It should be set down in the Bill that, in allocating money, consideration should be given to regional needs, to spreading the advantages of technology and science in terms of high quality jobs to regions that hitherto found it difficult to encourage high tech companies to establish there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent times regional technical colleges have made perhaps the most important contribution to regional equality, particularly in the education field.  They certainly caused an improvement in the level of participation in third level education in the regions &mdash; there is evidence of correlation between the location of an Regional Technical College and participation in third level education in that region.  They allowed for a massive uptake in third level education generally. In the PLC sector approximately £20 million has been allocated.  PLCs will play an extremely important role in the regions.  The Deputy mentioned Border counties.  In Cavan and Monaghan, for instance, there are strong PLCs and I would like the fund to improve the capacity and facilities in those regions.  The business industry indicates that PLCs have a major role to play in meeting the needs of local and regional industry and businesses.</P>
      <P>Projects from various sectors will be invited to apply for funding.  A sum of £60 million has been allocated for the skills package.  Universities, Regional Technical Colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and PLCs are entitled to apply for funding, and that will be made clear to them. That does not need to be provided for in legislation. The amount of money provided could be spent in the morning in terms of the need in particular sectors.  The decision to set up this fund derived as much from the need for innovation and new ideas as from the needs that had been identified over many years.  There was a great need in the regional technical colleges sector for capital investment.  For example, in the regional technical college in Carlow the number of students is double that for which the college was built.</P>
      <P>When I came to office I found there was a crisis in terms of capital needs of regional technical colleges, and many of those colleges will not be slow in seeking funds.  I would not be opposed to ringfencing £5 million or £10 million for a development scheme or imaginative idea.  The amendments, however, deal with operational matters and need not necessarily be included in legislation. I would have difficulty with the criteria referred to in the amendment in terms of generating a local contribution to the cost.  Everybody would not be in a position to generate a local contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey) Noel Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to report to the House on the third conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  I pay tribute to the officials of my Department and the official from the Department of Public Enterprise for their hard work and commitment to looking after our interests in Kyoto.  This was commented on not only by the media people present, but by people at European <Col N="925" /> Council level.  I appreciate their endeavours during the ten days of the conference.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago, Environment Ministers and representatives of more than 170 countries gathered in Kyoto to respond to the growing threat of climate change influenced by human activity and recognised this as the greatest environmental challenge facing us.  Climate change involves all countries.  It requires responses from Governments, economic sectors and society.  It brings us face to face with the real meaning of sustainable development &mdash; the balance between environment and development which we must secure today to sustain future generations.</P>
      <P>This third meeting of the conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto was an important step in a process that started in the 1980s.  The process reflects a growing scientific consensus that human activity is having an adverse effect on climate.  In response to the emerging evidence that climate change could have a major global impact, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.  Ireland signed the convention in Rio and ratified it in April 1994.</P>
      <P>The ultimate objective of the convention is the stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.  The convention recognises that developed countries should take the lead in combating climate change.  It calls on these countries to aim to return, individually or jointly, to 1990 levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000; to adopt policies and measures to mitigate climate change; and to provide technology transfer and financial resources to help developing countries.</P>
      <P>Ratification of the convention by a large number of parties, and its entry into force, was remarkably rapid, reflecting the seriousness attached to climate change throughout the world. However, a view quickly emerged that the convention commitments were inadequate and needed to be strengthened.  Accordingly, at the first conference of the parties in Berlin in April 1995, a negotiating process to strengthen the convention was established.  This was to focus on additional commitments to be entered into by the developed world for the post-2000 era.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for additional action and stronger commitments was underpinned by the second assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  This report concludes that the balance of evidence suggests there is a discernible human influence on climate change, and unless urgent action is taken, global temperature will rise by about 2 degree centigrade by 2100. This would mean an average rate of warming greater than any seen since the end of the last Ice Age and a 50 centimetre rise in sea level.  The second assessment report clearly demonstrates that intensified action to abate climate change is <Col N="926" /> needed.  If allowed to occur, change of the magnitude indicated would have profound consequences for human health, food security, water resources and coastal areas.  It would impact heavily on global security and our economies. The conclusions of the second assessment report have been widely accepted by the world community and were noted by the second conference of the parties to the convention in July 1996 as an urgent basis for finalising the negotiations to strengthen the convention's commitments It was against this background that the third conference of the parties took place in Kyoto from 1 to 11 December 1997, to conclude the negotiations commenced in Berlin two and a half years earlier.  Throughout the negotiating process, and at Kyoto, the European Union took a lead role among developed country parties, seeking to ensure the most ambitious outcome possible.  The EU also wished to avoid a situation where additional flexibilities in the terms of the protocol could dilute the commitment to real action to reduce emissions.</P>
    <P>The outcome at Kyoto is, necessarily, a compromise.  It is, however, a considerable step forward, having regard to the low level of ambition associated with some opening positions by developed country parties.  Kyoto provides a foundation on which future action can be intensified. It establishes, for the first time, legally binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  It also confirms the capacity of the international community to co-operate in action to deal with a major global environmental problem. The alternative to agreement at Kyoto would have been an admission that we are not prepared to tackle climate change on the global basis that is necessary.  That would be a serious setback for a process which depends on global commitment and needs to be advanced steadily and progressively into the future.</P>
    <P>The centrepiece of the protocol is the legally binding commitments of developed countries to reduce, individually or jointly, emissions of six greenhouse gases in the period 2008 to 2012 to below their 1990 level.  The targets agreed will result in an overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by developed countries in the period 2008 to 2012 of more than 5 per cent below I990 levels.  Bearing in mind that in a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; scenario emissions in that period are projected to be some 30 per cent above 1990 levels, it is clear that the reduction targets adopted are demanding.  While the overall reduction will be in excess of 5 per cent, the targets applicable to individual parties vary somewhat.</P>
    <P>The EU and the associated countries are committed to &mdash; 8 per cent reduction, the US is committed to &mdash; 7 per cent, Japan to &mdash; 6 per cent, while others, such as Russia and Australia, are committed to stabilisation or growth limitation targets.  The EU's &mdash; 8 per cent reduction target will apply to the Union as a whole.  The Union's internal arrangements for achieving the target will be the subject of an agreement under article <Col N="927" /> 4 of the protocol which provides for parties jointly to meet an emissions commitment.</P>
    <P>The outcome in relation to targets is, I think, positive and encouraging.  This is particularly so when one considers the starting position of, for example, the US and Japan who sought stabilisation and a small &mdash; 2.5 per cent reduction, respectively.  The agreement secured on reduction targets is in no small measure due to the strong role played by the EU and the headline it set with its proposals for a 15 per cent reduction.</P>
    <P>The protocol also provides for the promotion of sinks to absorb CO 2, the establishment of an emissions trading regime, joint implementation and the adoption of policies and measures.  In relation to sinks, the protocol will require parties which have directly ensured afforestation, reforestation and deforestation since 1990 to offset the amount of carbon sequestered in these sinks against their target.  This is a restricted approach to the counting of sinks, linked very clearly to quantifiable human action.  There is also provision for the inclusion of additional sinks related to human activities once rules, modalities and guidelines for these additional sinks are agreed at a future conference of the parties, taking into account uncertainties, transparency and verifiability. While sinks will help some parties to meet their targets, it must be recognised that they cannot provide a long-term offset against continuing emissions from fossil fuels.</P>
    <P>Emissions trading between counties with defined targets is allowed in principle under the protocol.  Provision for emissions trading was a critical element for several parties, but during all stages of the negotiations the EU sought to ensure that trading would not become a major loophole.  The requirements that trading may be supplemental only to domestic action and that relevant principles, modalities, rules and guidelines will be defined by the conference of the parties, reflect the concerns of the EU in this regard.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance many parties attach to resolving this issue prior to their ratification of the protocol, I expect the next conference of the parties in Buenos Aires will decide on the necessary principles, modalities and rules to allow for emissions trading.  Provision is also made in the protocol for parties with defined targets to share reduction credits where one party invests in a project in the territory of another with the aim of reducing emissions or enhancing sinks.  Such projects could, for example, be investments in energy efficiency or high efficiency power plants and the credits involved would reflect the savings in emissions accruing on account of the investment.</P>
    <P>Separate provision is made for a clean development mechanism.  This will allow developed country parties to gain reduction credits for investments in appropriate projects in the developing world.  This is similar to joint implementation between developed country parties, but additional safeguards and provisions attach to the <Col N="928" /> clean development mechanism.  These are the following: the projects must assist developing country parties to achieve sustainable development; the mechanism will be subject to the authority and guidance of the conference of the parties to the protocol, which will elaborate modalities and procedures for the whole process and independent certification of reductions must be achieved. This mechanism, the details of which remain to be worked out, provides an incentive for the provision of additional financial support and technology transfer to developing countries to facilitate their participation in global efforts to control climate change.</P>
    <P>In relation to sinks, emissions trading and joint implementation, the EU was particularly concerned to ensure the provisions on these matters would not allow parties to avoid their responsibilities. The EU secured a good measure of success in this regard.  It will now be a priority at EU level to actively pursue the further elaboration of the rules and modalities which the protocol provides for in these matters.  At a meeting of the European Council of Environment Ministers earlier this week it was indicated that work would start between the Presidency and the Commission to bring forward proposals in this area for the March Council meeting.</P>
    <P>In achieving their targets and commitments and to promote sustainable development, developed country parties will be obliged to adopt a range of policies and measures in accordance with national circumstances.  The areas involved include enhanced energy efficiency, protection and enhancement of sinks, renewable energy, promotion of sustainable agriculture, reduction and phasing out of fiscal incentives for fossil fuel use and reduction of transport emissions. Co-operation between parties to enhance the effectiveness of individual action is encouraged, and the conference of the parties may consider ways and means to elaborate the co-ordination of such policies and measures, should it decide this would be beneficial.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge this provision is not as strong as the EU would have wished, for example, in relation to mandatory effect and mechanisms for international co-ordination.  However, I am satisfied the requirements of the protocol nonetheless represent a step beyond the framework convention and provide a basis for further development in the future.</P>
    <P>To emphasise that the protocol is another stage in what will be a long and ongoing process, it is worth noting that provision is made for the second meeting of the parties under the protocol to review it in the light of best scientific information and assessments of climate change and its impacts and relevant technical, social and economic information.  This will provide a relatively early opportunity to reassess the commitments made in Kyoto and to ensure that the global momentum to deal with climate change is maintained and accelerated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> I have now outlined the main elements of the protocol.  Coming into the negotiations, however, the issue of developing country commitments was a major concern for some developed country parties. In the negotiations, developing countries were successful in their insistence that the terms of the Berlin Mandate be respected, that is, that no new commitments for developing countries be included in the protocol.  They also prevented the inclusion of a provision whereby developing countries would voluntarily take on emission limitation commitments.  While some parties pressed for meaningful participation of key developing countries through the assumption of binding obligations, the EU regarded this as unhelpful.  If it had been insisted on, we probably would not have had such a successful outcome.  I hope the provision for joint implementation through the clean development mechanism will provide a sufficient basis for all parties to proceed towards ratification.</P>
    <P>The Kyoto protocol presents a challenge and an opportunity for Ireland.  We are part of the most ambitious position taken at Kyoto.  In my address to the plenary session I indicated the areas in which we have already intensified our action to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  I acknowledged, however, that efforts to date, globally and nationally, have not been enough to ensure reasonable progress towards the ultimate objective of the convention.  Like others, we were there to state our ambition for the future and to define the means to achieve it.  I underlined that our vision for the future must be matched by action now.</P>
    <P>Over the next six months or so the EU will review all the implications of the Kyoto outcome. This will include the burden sharing for member states involved in joint achievement of the legally binding 8 per cent reduction target adopted in Kyoto.  As I have indicated, the minus 8 per cent reduction target applies to the EU as a whole. The internal EU burden sharing arrangement must be finalised in the coming months so that the Union and its member states will be in a position to sign and, in due course, ratify the protocol. In doing so, the EU must take account of the inclusion of three additional gases in the overall basket of gases covered by the protocol.  In the context of the determination of the EU position for the Kyoto negotiations, Ireland adopted an indicative national target of limiting the growth in emissions of the three main greenhouse gases in the period up to 2010 to 15 per cent above their 1990 level.  It is my intention to adhere to this level of ambition.</P>
    <P>Once the EU burden sharing arrangements are finalised, the Union and member states will be in a position, as required under the protocol, to notify the other parties of the terms of the agreement and to proceed to ratification.  The growth limitation target for Ireland set out in the EU agreement will then become our target under the protocol.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> I acknowledge the hard work done by the Department officials on behalf of the Government at Kyoto.  The EU adopted a unified position and at its recent meeting the Council reiterated its determination to be ambitious in this area.  I thank the House for the opportunity to make this statement and I would welcome another chance to discuss it further at the Oireachtas committee in the new year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing his time with me.  I compliment him and his officials for representing the people and the Government effectively and efficiently at this important conference in Kyoto last week.  The outcome of the intensive negotiations in Kyoto last week signals a new point in the response to the global challenge of climate change.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has just given a detailed statement on its background and outcome.  The European Union was a major player in the negotiations and Ireland, as part of the Union, was fully represented also, including representation from my Department.  As we enter the third millennium we find our world is defined by many global issues, markets, information technology which crosses all borders and in the matter of climate change, a global challenge ultimately requiring a global response.</P>
      <P>Globalisation must not be seen solely in terms of financial markets and competitiveness; it also means globalizing risks and responsibilities for the future of the planet.  The challenge posed by climate change is undoubtedly global and it brings a need to redefine international co-operation. It has never been in the forefront like it is today.  Scientists have confirmed that the planet is becoming warmer, precipitation patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, and this change is influenced by human activity.  That is why nations gathered to negotiate and adopt a protocol that will be a milestone in addressing climate change and will allow us to ward off the potential significant economic and social damage, which could be particularly acute in developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Climate change is a truly global issue because it pervades our daily behaviour and economic thinking.  Public opinion, Governments, non governmental organisations and industry have recognised that action has to be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to protect the environment and to create opportunities for the economy. Based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility and of the historical responsibilities of developed countries in the emission of greenhouse gases, we have accepted that developed countries must take the lead in modifying the trends of emissions, However, no <Col N="931" /> one country can act on its own to protect the global climate system.  A commitment by all to a partnership approach will be of vital importance to the success of the protocol.  A partnership approach within and between countries, between different economic sectors and government and business is necessary if we are to have effective climate change policies.</P>
    <P>For Ireland, the challenge posed by the outcome of the Kyoto process is a national one and all sectors must be prepared to respond.  Inside the EU, Ireland will be expected to play its role in contributing to the limitation and reduction of greenhouse gases.  The question of the internal sharing of the EU's commitment will arise in the context of the outcome of the negotiations.  The internal distribution of the EU's burden will be negotiated in the coming months.  With this in mind, it is important to state that the distribution of the burden must be carefully calibrated across different sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>In so far as the energy sector is concerned we are not starting from scratch.  Progress has been made towards implementing our commitments under the Convention.  Our second national communication already outlines the policies and measures which have already been put in place to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  These include: electricity generation by alternative energy sources; the establishment of the Irish Energy Centre and Energy Advisory Board; improved insulation standards incorporated into the building regulations for new buildings; a demand side management policy by the ESB to limit the growth in demand for electricity; improved public transport and measures to reduce traffic congestion in Dublin and the Waste Management Act.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding action already taken, I share the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's belief in intensifying existing policies and measures and undertaking additional measures to address climate change.  That is why a major consultancy study has been jointly commissioned by my Department and his.  A consortium of consultants led by Environmental Resources Management is undertaking the study, assisted by the ESRI and Byrne O'Cleirigh.  They have held discussions with representatives from all sectors relevant to limiting and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including private, semi-State and public sector organisations.  A number of environmental and renewable energy representatives have also met the consultants. Their findings are expected early in 1998 and will form a core element in developing a further refinement on overall national strategy.</P>
    <P>Conscious that the concept of enhanced renewable energy is a valuable and acceptable response to climate change I was especially pleased that for a two year period up to the end of 1999, a new tax relief to encourage corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects such as wind energy and biomass was announced in the budget. I wish to see such excellent measures extended to <Col N="932" /> other forms of renewable energy.  I aspire to that provision being made in the not too distant future and it is concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to the promotion of renewable energy, with particular emphasis on wind energy and biomass.</P>
    <P>Many of the energy responses available for climate change policy have stand alone strong economic cases even without this element. Energy action on climate change can create opportunities as well as challenges.  I reaffirm that we need to explore and reflect the beneficial effects of climate related measures for environment, energy, economic and other policies.</P>
    <P>In the struggle against climate change, technology plays a unique role.  Technologies already developed and those of the future offer the best prospects for curbing greenhouse gas emissions in an economically and politically optimal way, but scientific breakthroughs do not just happen.  They require ideas and investment.  Once achieved they need to be translated into workable, cost effective technologies and once developed, they must be widely and rapidly deployed where they will do the most good.</P>
    <P>The energy sector is well placed to maximise the benefits of technology development and deployment.  As Minister for Energy I reiterate the commitment of the sector to meet its obligations. I call on other sectors to share in the national response.  Together we can meet the challenge and obligations of climate change.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the outcome of the Kyoto Conference, although this is the wrong time to discuss this issue.  Information should have been provided to the members of the Dáil prior to the Minister travelling to Kyoto, as was requested on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an agreement whereby Ireland is committed to reducing its emissions of greenhouse gases, but the people have had no input into the decision and neither have they any idea of how the proposed reductions are to be arrived at.  I understand from previous discussions with the Minister that he has no idea of how we are to reduce our emissions.  The decision that the EU would reduce its emission of greenhouse gases by 8 per cent below the EU level was made in isolation without consultation with the various sectors who will be involved in providing those reductions.  Although it is not yet known where Ireland stands within the EU bubble, I hope we will stick to our original target of limiting our emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in 2010 to 15 per cent above the 1990 level. We should, along with our EU partners, show leadership in this area and work within the targets to improve air quality for the benefit of those <Col N="933" /> who have to contend with decreasing levels of air quality.</P>
    <P>The commitment to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases should have been made in consultation with all the environmental partners.  It is not only an issue for the Department of the Environment and Local Government but also for the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Public Enterprise, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Marine and Natural Resources.  They will be involved in contributing towards curtailment of our emission of these gases, yet they appear to have had no input to the targets set for them.  The commitment made in Kyota concerns us all and the Minister should have consulted the relevant partners and obtained a consensus prior to agreeing to the setting of legally binding targets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to talk to her predecessor about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>We are informed that man's activities are contributing to an increase in atmospheric temperature and are changing the climate pattern of the world.  There are numerous examples quoted to prove this theory.  The five hottest years have been in the 1990s and 1997 is said to have been the hottest since records were first kept in the 1860s, 0.43º above the average.  A rise of 3º is predicted over the next 100 years threatening climatic changes of drastic proportions.  A climate cooling of just 3º centigrade brought about the ice age.  All this warming will melt the ice caps and cause expansion of the oceans thus leading to rising sea levels and flooding of low lying areas.  The floods in Europe last year and here have been attributed to global warming.</P>
      <P>There are many uncertainties and gaps in information and in the ability of scientists to project and detect future climate change, as most of the computer models used to detect and predict climate change are a matter of considerable dispute. Most of the models cannot predict with precision; they estimate that the amount of warming should be about twice as much as that which has occurred so assertions that future projections are correct need to be considered bearing this point in mind.</P>
      <P>Nature is one of the greatest contributors of greenhouse gases.  The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 threw up twice as much sulphur dioxide in three hours as the whole of American industry in one year.  Every year the oceans yield 90 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide as do decaying plants compared with a man-made total of six billion tonnes.  Man-made emissions account for approximately 4 per cent of greenhouse gases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not putting forward these arguments to advocate complacency.  The Kyota agreement underlines our commitment to the environment and recognises the negative effects of our activities on air quality.  I note the cautionary words of the intergovernmental panel on climate change that &ldquo;the balance of evidence suggests a discernible <Col N="934" /> human influence on global climate&rdquo;.  We have to take the warnings on board and act for future generations.</P>
    <P>The programme for sustainable development introduced by the previous Government puts an onus on us to examine all developments and their long-term effect on the environment.  The effects of global warming and its implications for future generations need to be considered and policies need to be implemented to ensure air emissions do not have an adverse effect on the world for our children and our children's children.  We have a responsibility to protect the environment and to examine our actions and measure their impact on the world in the year 2010 and beyond.</P>
    <P>The principle of sustainable development must be at the centre of environmental and development policies here.  Building on that principle, the traditional adversarial approach of industrial development on one side and environmental protection on the other should be abandoned.  They should not be promoted as opposites but as partners with a new approach, simultaneously maintaining high environmental standards and promoting a competitive enterprise sector. Environmental quality should be maintained in a way that encourages companies to raise productivity and respond to the new markets created by them.</P>
    <P>Ireland enjoys a strong and positive perception and &ldquo;green&rdquo; image internationally as a country with a clean environment.  It is essential that high environmental standards be maintained not only to protect that international perception and image but also because the quality of the natural environment is a key factor in the quality of life of the people.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, environmental issues are coming to the fore and people want to contribute towards an improvement in their surroundings.  The outcome of the conference in Kyota needs to be explained and people need to be made aware of how to reduce emissions.  How can the average citizen contribute towards a reduction in greenhouse gases?  How do the Government and the relevant Departments plan to assist people to improve the world for our children and our grandchildren?  We need to know what the implications are.</P>
    <P>We need to be involved in the decision-making and not just have some meaningless figures foisted upon us.  People are willing to contribute if they are involved at the beginning and consulted and the benefits explained in a reasonable manner.  I hope there will be open and informative discussion on the subject in the near future. If Ireland were to do nothing about reducing its emissions of greenhouse gases and carry on regardless of the implications for future generations, we would increase the levels by 28 per cent over our 1990 levels by the year 2010.  This was noted by a recent ESRI report.</P>
    <P>At the Kyoto conference the Minister stated we would restrict the percentage increase to 15 per cent over our 1990 levels by the year 2010. <Col N="935" /> We now have a commitment from the Government that we will reduce the projected emissions by almost 100 per cent &mdash; that is we will halve the levels of emissions by the year 2010.  This is highly commendable and I applaud it, but how are we to do it.  The policies to implement such a commitment should be in place now to achieve those reductions.  In an era of increased consumerism the figures show that all the emission levels are increasing at unprecedented levels.</P>
    <P>The major man-made emissions of greenhouse gases in Ireland include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, although I note that the basket of gases agreed in Kyoto include HFC's, PFC's as well as sulphur hexaflouride.  Of these three gases, carbon dioxide is the single biggest contributor to global warming, accounting for 80 per cent of emissions from the EU.</P>
    <P>Carbon dioxide is produced from the burning of fossil fuels and apart from the adverse effect on the world's climate, it is desirable that we consider the reduction in the use of fossil fuels which are non-renewable because the day will come when these fuels will be depleted and we will need to concentrate our efforts on providing alternatives to non-renewables.</P>
    <P>Livestock, landfill sites and agricultural activity contribute to methane emissions.  Cattle and sheep rearing is the main contributor.  Ireland has a greater output of methane emissions than the EU with methane accounting for 29 per cent of our greenhouse gas emissions compared to 12 per cent in the EU.  There is little one can do to reduce the methane output from agriculture as we are very much dependent on this industry.  If we were to serious about this, the Minister might consult his counterpart in India where there are hundreds of thousands of methane collectors. Solar stoves were distributed and many families in India now prepare their meals using methane derived from animal wastes.  The methane produced from landfill sites has been successfully used to power local communities on the Continent, particularly in the Netherlands, and in Cork city.  The methane gas from the landfill site is collected and converted to energy.  This is a welcome advance from the time when we would just burn off these gases.</P>
    <P>Nitrous oxide, another contributor to greenhouse gases, accounts for 14 per cent of emissions. These gases mainly result from the use of agricultural fertilisers.  A recent initiative by the Government to provide funds to Teagasc to alleviate the problem of overuse of fertilisers should contribute to a reduction in the emissions of nitrous oxide.</P>
    <P>The three gases mentioned in the basket of gases, while their output is small, should not go unnoticed.  The European Council recently &ldquo;noted with concern&rdquo; proposals by a US company to commercialise self-chilling drink cans in which one possible cooling agent, HFC &mdash; 134A, has a global warming potential 1,300 greater than carbon dioxide.  Rather than introduce new problems <Col N="936" /> into the equation, action should be taken to ensure that products which are major contributors to global warming are not launched on our markets.</P>
    <P>Carbon dioxide is the principal greenhouse gas and it is emitted almost exclusively in the generation of energy.  Energy demand driven by economic growth and energy consumption has risen steadily since the 1960s, apart from the oil price rises in 1973 and in 1979.  The pattern is one of rapid growth and is likely to continue.  If past trends are followed there will be a further increase in energy demand.</P>
    <P>A cost efficient and reliable source of energy is essential to underpin the competitiveness of our industries.  Ireland should develop an energy policy which will bring us forward to the year 2010, the main objectives of which should be to ensure a security of supply while ensuring that the cost of supplies to firms and consumers can compete with those of our main trading partners.  In general, Irish energy prices have improved relative to those in the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union since the 1980s, although natural gas prices are considerably higher than the EU average, particularly for business.  Energy policy should aim to achieve greater efficiency in the domestic, commercial and industrial sectors. There is much room for improvement and the relevant authorities must bear more responsibility.</P>
    <P>What effect does Energy Awareness Week have on energy consumption?  I suspect very little. As we all know, we should use low energy light bulbs and lagging jackets as well as draught proof our homes and insulate our attics.  An ESRI study of energy conservation in the home shows that if there was a reasonable uptake of these measures in the existing housing stock, carbon dioxide emissions could be reduced by 680,000 tonnes. Because of the boom in the housing industry we are well placed to reduce our energy requirements and the demands on our purses.</P>
    <P>Energy audits of commercial buildings should be undertaken.  An energy audit of several large modern office buildings was undertaken in 1990 and 1991 as part of a pilot project initiated by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications. The results indicate that if there was a similar audit of the entire stock of office space, carbon dioxide emissions could be reduced by almost 80,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>Within a short period there will be transnational competition in the supply of electricity here.  With new technologies, this will open the door to the greater use of renewable sources of energy.  Just as the economic miracles of the 20th century were powered by fossil fuels, the 21st century may be marked by an equally dramatic move from those fuels resulting in an energy revolution.</P>
    <P>The wind power industry is the fastest growing energy industry in the world.  Its annual output is valued at £1.5 billion.  This is growing by 25 per cent annually.  Two decades of research have yielded a thoroughly modern wind turbine.  Thousands <Col N="937" /> of wind turbines have been installed in a dozen European countries.  In Denmark, for example, wind power accounts for 5 per cent of total energy output.  There is no reason we should not consider this alternative.</P>
    <P>Finance is crucial for the development of wind technologies.  The banks and financial institutions, however, have been slow to recognise the value of this investment.  Given more favourable conditions and advancements in technology, renewable sources of energy should become a viable alternative.  The Minister and the Minister of State mentioned this prospect.</P>
    <P>Transport and its consumption of fossil fuels is the largest contributor to carbon dioxide emissions which, it is predicted, will rise from almost 800,000 tonnes in 1990 to 1.6 million tonnes by 2010, a 100 per cent increase.  The increase in the number of motor cars has an effect not alone on air quality but on the visual environment and our general well-being as well as the efficiency of our cities.  This is evident in Dublin but it is also a major problem in our other cities, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  While we cannot discourage people from buying cars, we can encourage them to reduce the number of journeys they make and to buy more energy efficient cars.</P>
    <P>Miles per gallon and the implications for precious non-renewable fossil fuels were on everybody's agenda during the oil crisis in the 1970s but, as the price of petrol has dropped in relative terms, fuel efficiency is no longer at the top of the list of priorities.  It should be.  America, with its large gas guzzling cars and cheap petrol, contributes enormously to world carbon dioxide emissions.  With 5 per cent of the world's population, it accounts for 25 per cent of greenhouse gases.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for more investment in public transport to reduce the number of car journeys. We need to provide an efficient and reliable system that will be more attractive than a car journey.  Greater emphasis should be placed on green commuting and people encouraged to share car journeys.  Park and ride systems should also be introduced.</P>
    <P>This issue has been raised on a number of occasions in the Chamber.  As traffic is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, it should be examined urgently and steps taken to reduce its polluting effects.  On my way to the House this morning I noticed that people were wearing masks.</P>
    <P>When it comes to excise duties diesel is treated favourably.  Yet, it is a major pollutant.  Other more environmentally-friendly fuels should be considered, such as liquid petroleum, gas or biofuels which were mentioned by the Minister and Minister of State.</P>
    <P>There should be greater consultation between the environmental partners and all those concerned about our future.  If we are to protect and preserve the global environment, we must all play our part, as nations, families and individuals, and take part in meaningful discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing her time and congratulate her on her contribution for which she conducted much research.  For those of us who are new to this subject, it was much more informative than those of the Minister and Minister of State.  Her suggestions are worthy of consideration.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the Kyoto Agreement is not as strong as we or the European Union would like.  As he will be aware, commentators have pointed to possible loopholes in some of the commitments entered into.  This is a source of concern. Initially and laterally, even after the arrival of the Vice-President, the contribution of the United States to the conference, considering the role its citizens play in relation to the greenhouse effect, was the source of considerable disappointment. While the target set for the United States is lower than that set for the European Union, we have been told there is a possibility the agreement will not be acceptable to the United States Senate.  That would be even more disastrous than its failure to ratify the agreement on the League of Nations in an earlier generation.  It is potentially that important.</P>
      <P>This is a global problem.  Tip O'Neill was right when he said that all politics are local.  As far as this subject is concerned, the problem is global but it is also local.  I shall concentrate on how this relates to us, the policies we shall need to develop and its effect on people generally.  I shall not go over the ground covered so admirably by my party colleague, Deputy Clune, but will concentrate on two or three matters not already referred to.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clune made a passing reference to security of supply.  Speaking to people with some experience of this issue, the lack of confidence in security of supply arises continuously, as does the fact that we rely on a single source of supply.</P>
      <P>In a recent ESRI report I noticed the following quotation:</P>
      <P>We may leave ourselves open to buying gas from a relatively small number of suppliers who effectively have monopoly powers and may be in a position to exploit them.</P>
      <P>That appears to refer to a type of OPEC arrangement for gas similar to that pertaining to oil.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem of other areas potentially volatile political regions from which we get our natural gas supplies.  For example in the case of the former Soviet Union, most of the Russian supplies to the European Union come via the Ukraine.  We also rely on supplies from North African countries such as Algeria where recent events remind us of how volatile is the position there with its attendant lack of security in relation to our supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union and Irish energy market is vulnerable to political instability in Eastern Europe which could disrupt our domestic markets. As we know, our gas reserves at the Kinsale and Ballycotton fields are expected to expire within five or six years.  If we do not find more <Col N="939" /> gas we shall be totally dependent on imported gas from Scotland <i>via</i> the undersea connection.</P>
    <P>There is also the importance of a natural gas interconnector between North and South which a recent report indicated was technically all right and made economic sense.  I draw the attention of the House to how much all of us rely on the continuation of peace.  We know what happened to the electricity interconnector and, in certain circumstances, a gas interconnector would be even more vulnerable.  All of our efforts are towards continued peace, emphasising that such represents not merely the absence of bullets and bombs but, to a very large extent, our economic future prospects.  That too could be the subject of fairly intense discussion in the present peace talks with regard to the establishment of a board or boards operating between North and South.</P>
    <P>Because of the security and monopoly implications, more emphasis must be placed on renewable sources of energy, a point made by the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>A recent very valuable White Paper from the European Union entitled Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of Energy, subtitled White Paper for a Community Strategy and Action Plan which places enormous emphasis on the necessity for renewable sources of energy, Chapter 1, under the heading &ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; reads:</P>
    <P>Renewable sources of energy are currently unevenly and insufficiently exploited in the European Union.  Although many of them are abundantly available, and the real economic potential considerable, renewable sources of energy make a disappointingly small contribution of less than 6 per cent to the Union's overall gross inland energy consumption, which is predicted to grow steadily in the future.</P>
    <P>I had not realised it was as small as that.  The same paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>A joint effort both at the Community and Member States' level is needed to meet this challenge.  Unless the Community succeeds in supplying a significantly higher share of its energy demand from renewables over the next decade, an important development opportunity will be missed and at the same time, it will become increasingly difficult to comply with its commitments both at European and international level as regards environmental protection.</P>
    <P>If those words are true of the European Union as a whole &mdash; and I believe them to be &mdash; they are certainly true of this country and our contribution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I found the speech of both Ministers seriously deficient in terms of the absence of any proposals to attain our guaranteed position.  The emphasis placed on the consultancy study by both would appear to indicate the answers Members of the House should have liked will not be forthcoming in advance of the outcome of that consultancy <Col N="940" /> study expected early next year; from the point of view of continuing debate, the earlier the better. As these renewable energy sources are indigenous and have other positive consequences &mdash; apart from contributing to the Kyoto proposals &mdash; in particular in terms of job creation and regional development, I ask the Minister to bear them in mind.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the White Paper is optimistic in relation to the outcome and says:</P>
    <P>Current trends show that considerable technological progress related to renewable energy technologies has been achieved over recent years .</P>
    <P>Some technologies, in particular biomass, small hydro and wind, are currently competitive and economically viable in particular compared to other decentralised applications.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear more from the Minister on these matters.  While this is a global problem our contribution to the European Union is of considerable importance.  I would like the Minister to state as soon as possible what our contribution must be to new policies that must be devised and implemented in order to contribute to the overall European Union target.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to comment on the very serious implications of the Kyoto Summit, the whole issue of climate change and its implications for Ireland, all our people and the world community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Members I would have liked to have had an opportunity to have had even an informal discussion in advance of the Kyoto Summit.  One thing I learned while participating in the European Council of Ministers was the degree of engagement in other EU parliaments with policy formation and discussion.  In virtually any other European Union member state it would be unthinkable for a Minister to present a national case, at an international summit, without having gone through the requisite procedures within his or her own parliament, where a continuous brief obtains.  I certainly do not ascribe responsibility for that deficiency to the present Minister but to the system we operate in this House.  I hope the committee system we have now established will be used as a vehicle for much greater interaction between Members of both Houses and the Executive, the Government, in the formulation and discussion of policy so that we can avoid a repetition of many past mistakes.  For example, there springs to mind immediately the Maastricht Treaty and referendum where internal dialogue within Government or within the European institutions was not matched by dialogue nationally.  People are left out of the equation and many of the issues that will have an impact on them are often not understood. We cannot tell people in a matter of weeks about an issue that has been discussed for years. I hope the committee system now in place will be used as a vehicle for an ongoing discussion on the <Col N="941" /> range of important issues we face in the environment area.</P>
    <P>We are discussing climate change which is no longer a hypothesis or abstract proposal but an established fact that requires immediate attention. Sometimes the words &ldquo;global warming&rdquo; are inaccurately used to describe this phenomenon. Global warming creates an inaccurate picture of the changes that are undoubtedly now taking place in the world climates.  For those of us who live in the cold north, the notion of global warming sometimes can be seen in a positive light.  The reality of climate change will more accurately underscore for our populations the changes that need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Although it is estimated that since the end of the last century real temperatures have risen by approximately half a degree Celsius, world sea levels have risen by ten centimetres over the past 100 years.  The basis for our view on climate change rests now with the findings of the authoritative climate panel, the IPCC, the International Panel on Climate Change, established by the United Nations.  Although recently there seems to have been a growing and concerted effort to undermine the climate change argument, it appears that a counter position is being put repeatedly now in the media and among some members of the scientific community.  That is a worrying development because it can lull us into a sense of complacency or a view that we do not need to take decisive action, which would be disastrous for our future.  We must not only heed the clear scientific warnings so clearly expressed in recent times, we must be prepared also to take the necessary constructive action to change the damage being done by human activity.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware of the view expressed recently by the European Union Environment Commissioner, Ritt Bjerregaard, in her newsletter. She stated:</P>
    <P>Experts on the UN's climate panel, the IPCC, forecast that over the next 50-100 years temperatures will rise by a further 1.0-3.5ºC, which again will cause sea levels to rise a further 15-95 cm.  In itself this does not sound very much, but for those people who live in areas below sea level it is a disastrous development. This would, for example, affect large stretches of the Netherlands, certain marshlands in England, the length of the German North Sea coast, coastal areas on the Black Sea, around the Po flood plain in Italy and the tidal flats . on the west coast of Jutland in Denmark.</P>
    <P>For communities across the European Union and throughout the world, the consequences of the rise in sea levels projected by the EU Commissioner would be disastrous.</P>
    <P>Some of our own experiences in relation to totally unforeseen climate patterns in the past year have been mentioned.  We have seen the effects in the Suir Valley, with Clonmel and Carrick-onSuir being repeatedly flooded where there is no <Col N="942" /> logical explanation for it.  What was expected to be a once in a generation phenomenon occurred repeatedly in the space of a few years.  Those of us who live in the south east will remember the past August bank holiday when I thought, after three days and three nights of rain, that it was time to start building the ark.</P>
    <P>The climate is changing and the question is why?  The scientific view is that this change is being caused by the build up of greenhouse gases &mdash; CO 2, methane, oxides of nitrogen and others. These are the gases released by motor vehicles, industry, power stations and a range of other activities, including domestic households.  If we are serious in our determination to halt this disastrous course of events, we must act in a planned and immediate way.  It is not for somebody else to act.  Each of us must act individually as citizens and as a nation within the United Nations family.</P>
    <P>The recent focus on world environment matters began in the most concerted way in the Rio de Janeiro conference of five years ago, the World Earth Summit.  The outcome of that unprecedented world focus on the fragility of our planet was a number of specific and controversial proposals &mdash; Agenda 21, the biodiversity convention and the convention on climate change.</P>
    <P>Agenda 21, which requires action at every level of society, stresses the importance of integrated policy to link economic, social and civic issues.  It stresses the importance of the individual citizen and of global partnerships in bringing about much needed change.  That is much more important than the preserve of Governments.  If we are to react in the way Rio envisaged, we must motivate everybody to understanding the conventions unfolding and the changes in personal consumption patterns that will be required.</P>
    <P>Five years after Rio, in June of this year, a special session of the United Nations General Assembly met in New York to review the implementation of Agenda 21.  This review was attended by more than 160 countries including some 70 Heads of State and Government.  The position disclosed at that grand gathering in New York was bleak.  Progress has been painfully slow since Rio and the UN General Secretary's report to the UNGASS highlighted the paucity of world response over those five years.  The Secretary General highlighted the fact that, globally, the number of people living in poverty rose to 1.3 billion in l993, and that 20 per cent of the world's population lacks access to safe water while 50 per cent lacks access to safe sanitation.</P>
    <P>One of the agenda items in New York in June was the issue of climate change and the preparations by all countries for the Kyoto Summit from which much was expected.  From my own experience in New York and previously at other United Nations environment talks, the divide inevitably rose between most developed countries and the developing countries.  The developed countries focus by and large on the environmental agenda and the developing countries focus on finance, on eastern technology transfer and on <Col N="943" /> the need for appropriate development.  The poorer developing countries, the G77, have a valid point.  The world is very unequally divided now.  We cannot focus only on environmental degradation and decide that we must change our patterns and tell developing countries wrecked by poverty to halt their development while we sustain the unsustainable in the developed world. The developing world expects the developed world to take not only the first steps but to make the greater sacrifice because the major damage to the environment has been caused by the developed world.</P>
    <P>The United States, Canada, the European Union and the G7, now the G8, disproportionately gobble up the resources of this planet.  If we are to bring the world community to address issues such as climate change and other environmental problems that beset all mankind, there must be a clear and complementary policy programme to address the issues of exclusion, technology transfer, appropriate development and the eradication of poverty.  The basic question is the pattern of consumption and production and the unsustainability of the current patterns. There is a view held by some that the developed world can maintain its pattern of consumption but yet expect the developing world to halt its natural wish to develop.</P>
    <P>The average ODA for the period 1993-95 has been lower than for the period 1990-92.  Overseas development aid is falling at a time when there is a new focus on the requirement for global action to solve environmental issues.  That is true in absolute terms and as a percentage of GNP. Overseas development aid is the lowest it has been in real terms for 30 years.  Within the OECD official development aid as a percentage of GNP declined from .33 per cent in 1992 to .29 per cent in 1995.  It is important to acknowledge that the Irish position under the stewardship of the former Minister, Deputy Spring, over the past five years is a happier tale.  Irish development aid has been increased by 300 per cent since Rio, something of which we can be justifiably proud.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that the rich world should lecture the developing world on its environmental responsibilities while running away from the United Nations target in support of the developing world, and that must be addressed. Rather than moving closer to the 0.7 per cent target, we are moving away from it.  There are a range of reasons for that and I remember the discussions within the European Union family of countries on the requirements to meet the criteria for EMU which has squeezed public expenditure everywhere.  Why is it when public expenditure is squeezed one of the first areas to be squeezed is the support mechanism for developing countries?</P>
    <P>The backdrop to Kyoto was one that was less than inspiring.  Not only has there been a NorthSouth split which was almost inevitable, but within the developed world there was a chasm <Col N="944" /> between the progressive standards put forward by the European Union and, not to put a tooth in it, the disappointingly modest proposals for change put forward by others including the United States.  The EU position for the COP 3 of the Framework Convention proposed specific emission reduction targets of 15 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2010.  I note AOSIS proposed a 20 per cent reduction below 1990 levels to be achieved by the year 2005, which was consistent with the Berlin mandate negotiated some two and a half years ago.  The AOSIS countries had a good reason for being the most progressive and the most demanding in setting high targets.  If the projections of the climate change panel come to pass the vulnerable small island states in the Pacific will no longer exist because they will have been swamped.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the summit is a conclusion that has been pulled or cobbled together.  I know how such summits work and a conclusion is reached at the last minute.  Those involved have to deal with people who want to delay matters and they must make a decision.  They will state there is no point in having an inadequate conclusion and they might as well say they have failed.  The choice is to do that or to accept much less than they want. Despite the best efforts of the Minister and the EU negotiating teams, the line of the least progressive was what was arrived at.  Not only were the identified and urgently required targets not achieved, they were watered down, and new inputs not discussed previously were accepted. The issue of trading in pollution licences has been formalised and legalised.  I can envisage specific instances where the notion of trading burdens of pollution might have an advantage.  For example, it would be helpful to a country with a disastrous industrial structure, such as the former Soviet Union countries, to get a major technology transfer in kind from a developed country such as the United States to close down bad polluting industry and at the same time reduce their emissions and be able to trade their quota of pollution in lieu of that.  There might be an environmental and sustainable argument to do that, but many other arguments put forward claim it is simply a mechanism to allow those who are already major polluters to buy their way out of their international obligations and to continue to pollute.  It is an extremely dangerous principle to enshrine into a new protocol.  Whatever safeguards are enmeshed in it, and I know the Minister has indicated to us that the European Union worked very hard to circumscribe it, it is a dangerous principle.</P>
    <P>I remember a discussion at the Berlin talks in early 1995 when Chancellor Kohl pontificated with great conviction on the achievements of Germany in reducing greenhouse gases, and a ministerial colleague, whom I shall not name said to him that if Chancellor Kohl allowed him take over a Third World country and deindustrialise it, they, too, would reduce their emissions.  That colleague was referring to the fact that West Germany had taken over East Germany, and deindustrialised <Col N="945" /> it and naturally the emissions fell dramatically.</P>
    <P>These matters are often not as straightforward as they seem.  The British are vaunting the fact that they will easily meet not only the target of a reduction of 15 per cent but the 20 per cent target. They can do this because of an over-reliance on the nuclear industry.  There are safeguards which one must look at in all of these matters. One can reduce significantly greenhouse gases by changing one's source of electricity generation to nuclear fuel but that would be equally unpalatable and unacceptable to most of us.</P>
    <P>Most people who are interested in this issue will be bitterly disappointed at the outcome of the Kyoto conference.  The line of least resistance is the one which has been agreed.  If the volume of greenhouse gases continues to rise at the rate which is now virtually sanctioned, then global temperatures will continue to rise, the sea level will continue to rise and vulnerable communities will suffer.  There is virtually no argument about that.</P>
    <P>It is often easy to point out the responsibilities of others and say it is disgraceful that they were not more supportive.  What are we going to do? Let us be frank about this.  We aligned ourselves with the most progressive group, the EU, whose position was that it would reduce the volume of greenhouse gases by 15 per cent on the 1990 level. That was our opening position and no other participant, except the AOSIS countries, was more progressive.  However, Ireland, within that bubble, was going to increase the volume of greenhouse gases by 15 per cent.  The battles to achieve agreement were difficult.  I am heartened by the commitment reiterated by the Minister that commitments to the plus 15 per cent threshold will not be exceeded even with a new EU allowable reduction of only 8 per cent rather than the 15 per cent reduction which we had originally envisaged. Within that bubble, Ireland will be as progressive as we had committed ourselves to be.</P>
    <P>Let us be in no doubt of the consequences of achieving that.  There are major issues which must be addressed and major policies which must be put in place, and we are not doing so.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Minister of State Jacob's check list of all the mechanisms which are required to reduce CO 2 and greenhouse gas emissions and to achieve reductions in energy consumption, but who is in charge of the campaign to reduce the consumption of electricity in Ireland?  The answer is the ESB.  That is like putting Guinness in charge of reducing the consumption of stout.  For good measure, we introduce competition.  Therefore, one tells the ESB to be competitive and at the same time to reduce the demand for the product which it will produce.  We must establish an independent agency to reduce the use of energy.  It is not fair or reasonable to expect the producer to sell its produce and at the same time reduce the demand for it.  That is not logical.  It will not happen.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to the development of new <Col N="946" /> sources of energy is miserable.  There is an attitude within the Department of Energy that we must give that group a sop.  The view is not that we must devolve a significant proportion of our energy requirement to those sources.  The only way we will do this is if the Government or the Oireachtas sets effective and ambitious targets for the proportion of our total energy requirement which will be generated from renewable sources.</P>
    <P>We must have a transport policy which does so. All of us who tried to come to this House this morning by car saw what is happening in the city. There are hard choices to be made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's Department, there is the issue of energy conservation in the design of houses.  Better insulation standards must be mandatory.  The technologies are not new but they are more expensive.  These are the issues which we must grasp if we are sincere about climate change and improving our environment generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister lays out an ambitious set of targets, such as those in the national sustainable development strategy.  I look forward to the dialogue in committee on the mechanism to monitor that because it will affect all Departments.  The Minister cannot be saddled with the responsibility of achieving a pristine environment.  That can only be done if every Department and Minister acknowledges the shared responsibility in achieving that important objective.  The question is whether we, as a people, have the determination to achieve ambitious targets on the reduction of greenhouse gases and improving our environment. If the answer is yes, there is a high price to be paid and we must start explaining that cost clearly to the people in the weeks, months and years to come.</P>

      <P>These statements on the Kyoto conference are met with overwhelming indifference in this House compared to some more recent matters such as health scares and sex scandals. It is important to try to put some of what happened at Kyoto in a context which could be understood more easily by Deputies from various parties who will speak after me.</P>
      <P>I see this issue in a similar way to some of those scandals, to which I referred.  Effectively Kyoto was the setting for a tribunal which was seeking a road to justice.  It was a tribunal in which, for the purposes of illustration, the industrialised world can be compared to a frail man in a wheelchair being cared for by a highly qualified woman made available by the Department of Health at taxpayers' expense.  I see the woman as the planet on which we depend and the man is charged with a brutal rape of his carer.  If we were to look at it in that context, we would see quickly that the woman could have chosen a different career and probably would regret having had anything to do with the frail man.  However, the fact is that the woman could do without that man but he is dependent on her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> That is the context of injustice which we are facing here and which must be addressed.  It is more than a nice idea, the need to make an effort, grasp the nettle or have the &ldquo;bottle&rdquo;&mdash; the clichés which will pepper this debate.  It is really a question of whether we are prepared to sustain an injustice, whether we have the ability to see that justice must be done for the future of humanity as well as for the integral rights of other life forms on this planet.  Unless we face up to that fact we will merely pad out this debate which was sought by the Green Party and others.  The debate will go nowhere unless the Minister gets the message that this is a top priority in every sense.</P>
    <P>All Departments must expect to be severely dealt with by the electorate if they do not deliver a sustainable future which involves the changes that were not delivered at Kyoto.  According to various scientific bodies, those changes must include a 60 per cent reduction in CO 2 emissions to stabilise the situation.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he has taken or the representations, if any, he has made to ensure that the latest intervention tender of 12 December 1997 yielded a minimum of 85 pence per pound and a total volume of 5,930 tonnes; the representations, if any, he has made to the EU Agriculture Commissioner to have intervention sales discontinued in the current crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The adjudication of tenders for the sale of beef into intervention is the responsibility of the EU Commission, acting through the Beef Management Committee.  At its last meeting on 12 December, the committee accepted offers from Irish processors amounting to 2,330 tonnes at prices ranging from 83p per lb to 86.5p per lb, related to R3 grade steers.  Prior to the meeting of the committee, I had conveyed to the Commission that a substantial quantity of beef offered by Irish processors should be accepted in view of the difficulties being experienced by Irish beef exporters on the UK market.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the sizeable quantity accepted for this time of year, involving the purchase of over 7,000 steers, will help to stabilise the market.  I continued with my efforts at the Council of Ministers this week to have effective and flexible intervention arrangements in place for the spring of 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also sought a commitment from Commissioner Fischler at the Council that intervention <Col N="948" /> stocks would not be put on offer for sale to third countries until the middle of 1998, when we have a better understanding of how the beef market in the EU is likely to develop.  I am pleased that the Commission withdrew its proposal for the sale of intervention beef for export from the agenda of the Beef Management Committee on 12 December in response to my representations. In addition, I have secured assurances from the Commission that any export sale will be a &ldquo;trial&rdquo; sale only and will involve a very limited quantity in order to minimise any disruption to the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will acknowledge it has been a difficult year for farmers and that the past six weeks have been outrageously bad.  At no time during the past five years did farmers obtain such low prices for cattle as during the last six weeks.  According to the figures provided by the Department, those prices are between 3p to 5p per lb less than they were during the same period last year.  At that time, the Minister and his colleagues stated that things could not get worse.  However, I cannot see the type of dedication necessary to take action on behalf of farmers.</P>
      <P>The Government made a feeble attempt to obtain a greater tonnage in respect of intervention beef.  The factories sought approximately 6,000 tonnes, of which they received only 3,000 tonnes.  Will the Minister guarantee that the trial sale of intervention meat to be refloated on to the market will not happen in the first six months of 1998?  Is he in a position to ensure that the next tranche of intervention will be of such a sizeable quantity that we can expect to see prices in Ireland pegged at 85p to 86p?  Given the introduction of the slaughter premium on 1 January and in light of the fact that there is no real competition on the market in respect of live cattle &mdash; the Minister does not appear to be disposed to the live trade &mdash; will he give a commitment to prevent meat factories further reducing their prices when farmers become eligible to claim that premium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Beef cattle producers have had a difficult year and I have acknowledged that at all times.  The Department and I have done everything possible to assist the trade, cattle producers and Bord Bia, at political and diplomatic level, in respect of access to all outlets and markets.</P>
      <P>The reality is that, while prices have not been good in recent months, the market remained stable.  We were running ahead of 1996 prices until the blockade of British ports and the recent scare regarding beef on the bone which depressed prices by 3p per lb.  In the run up to the tender on 12 December, the Department made extraordinary levels of contact with the Commission to ensure that a reasonable tender would be accepted and that the threat to release intervention beef on to the market did not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The volume of the tender, 2,330 tonnes, was a <Col N="949" /> record high for this time of year.  For example, at the November tender, no tonnage was accepted and at the previous one, only 374 tonnes was accepted.  The 2,330 tonnes represents approximately 40 per cent of the tender offered which, in the nature of the way tenders are made, is the proportion accepted by the factories.  If the entire tender had been accepted, the factories would have been more surprised than anyone.  The level of tenders and the price at which they are pitched is a matter for the industry and the factories.  In this case, the Department made the highest level of contact possible with the Commission.  In my view this proved quite effective and worked out in a relatively satisfactory way in that, since 12 December, prices in marts and quotes in factories have risen by 3p to 4p per lb.</P>

      <P>The Department receives figures from the marts and the factories.  The fact is that prices have recovered by 3p to 4p per lb.  We have made the strongest possible case in relation to next year.  At the Council of Ministers' meeting on Monday I said we wanted the fullest and most flexible access to intervention, particularly in the first quater of the year, and argued that a release of beef on the commercial market would be disruptive and not in the best interests of the Irish industry or the EU.  I hope our representations will bear fruit and that we will have prudent and orderly intervention arrangements for 1998.  Between now and then, the Department will make every possible contact to ensure that is done in the best interests of our cattle and beef industry.</P>

      <P>I received a good deal of correspondence from farmers in the west because the prices of weanlings and calves were reflected in that.  As to the question about meat factories, this is an ongoing problem.  Beef farmers are of the view that beef factories drop prices to match variations in grant aid, deseasonalisation premia, etc.  Since my appointment the Secretary General of my Department, Mr. John Malone, had a number of meetings with factory representatives and farm organisations to ensure transparency and a correlation between the return from the marketplace and the price paid to farmers; in other words, the margin between them will not be excessive but no more than adequate.  I am assured by my Department officials, and by my meetings with farming organisations, that the meetings with factory representatives have been positive.  I hope and <Col N="951" /> expect that a mechanism or structure will be in place for 1998 to ensure the price farmers receive is reflective of the return from the marketplace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>As I explained in the Dáil debate on 8 October last, it has been a priority for me to ensure that the BSE related restrictions on our live cattle trade to Egypt are removed.  A commitment in principle to reopen the market for Irish cattle was communicated on 4 June to my predecessor, subject to agreement on a number of conditions.  Discussions at technical level were necessary in relation to these conditions.  Veterinary delegations from Ireland visited on two occasions in August and the Ambassador in Cairo remained in constant contact with the Egyptian authorities. Final agreement on reopening the market was delayed, however, due to increased concerns in Egypt relating to food imports generally.  In view of this I contacted the Egyptian Deputy Premier and Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Wally, and met him in Cairo on 28 September.  I also met the Minister for Trade and Supply, Dr. Goweily.</P>
      <P>As a result of my meetings, the Egyptian authorities agreed to consider accepting a trial shipment of live cattle from Ireland.  The formulation of a proposal which would allay the concerns of the Egyptian authorities necessitated a detailed veterinary and engineering assessment of quarantine and slaughtering facilities in Egypt.  This was completed in early November and a comprehensive proposal, drawn up by my Department in conjunction with the Irish Livestock Exporters' Association was forwarded by me to Dr. Wally on 20 November.  This proposal is now being considered by the Egyptian authorities and I am keeping in close contact with developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Libya, contact continues to be maintained at diplomatic and political level to have the ban on cattle imports, imposed in March 1996, lifted.  A technical delegation from Libya visited this country earlier in the year and shortly after returning to office, I wrote to my Libyan <Col N="952" /> counterpart to emphasise the control measures in place in Ireland.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, met the Libyan Minister for Agriculture in Rome in November and discussed lifting the ban.  I have also made clear that I am prepared to travel to Libya as soon as appropriate arrangements can be made.  I will continue to avail of every opportunity to seek to have the ban lifted.</P>
    <P>As far as cattle prices are concerned, I am fully aware of recent developments.  The decline in prices is due in large measure to the protest action by UK farmers and the adverse effect of the UK announcement in relation to BSE and bone-in beef.  In the short-term, the decision of the beef management committee on 12 December to accept 2,330 tonnes of Irish beef into intervention up to 16 January will help to stabilise the market.  Some 7,000 steers will be required to meet this tender at prices ranging between 83 pence and 87 pence per pound.  I will continue to press the EU Commission to have effective and flexible intervention in place for the spring period.</P>
    <P>As regards the UK market difficulties, every effort has been made by the Taoiseach, other Government Ministers and myself to ensure unimpeded access for Irish beef to its market destination. In response, the UK authorities have taken firmer action and the position has improved to the extent that the protests are not preventing access to the market for Irish beef.</P>

      <P>It is acknowledged that beef producers are in crisis and that live exports are critical to their livelihoods.  Will the Minister agree that the fact that 140,000 fewer cattle were exported this year, as compared to the same period last year, is of critical importance in maintaining price?  Will he also agree that factories are exploiting the absence of the live export trade to drop, in an unwarranted fashion, the price of cattle, that this is done in a cartel fashion and that it has led to a price fall of £75 per head in the past four to five weeks?  Has there been any contact with the Irish Competition Authority about the reference made by the Minister's predecessor concerning the alleged factories cartels?  What is the present position of that investigation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was at the Red Cow Inn when the Minister made a number of unequivocal commitments to farmers.  There were no blockages at that time but the wheels have fallen off the wagon since.  Have the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs taken a role in ensuring those markets are reopened?  That question was often addressed to other people when they were in Government.  Is there a concerted Government policy to exploit all the diplomatic channels at the disposal of the Government?  Has the Taoiseach taken the opportunity to raise this matter with his counterparts? Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs done likewise?  Has any action been taken to secure the live export market which is critical in the context of maintaining prices?  One hundred thousand <Col N="953" /> livestock farmers are teetering on the brink of extinction.  This is the one question of critical importance that is being raised at all farmers' meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for a live trade.  It provides access to additional markets and competition on the domestic market.  A thriving live trade is always reflected in prices at marts throughout the country.  During my last period in office up to 400,000 head of live cattle were exported.  When I returned to office that trade had disappeared and I have been seeking to have it reopened.  The commercial reality is that if one has merchandise to sell one has to find somebody to purchase it.  The Department has been assisting the trade in every conceivable way through our ambassadors and diplomatic staff and by visiting the countries concerned.  The Taoiseach has assisted in that regard, as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  As recently as a week ago the Minister for Foreign Affairs was in Algeria , and at the top of his agenda was the beef trade to that country.  I visited Egypt and, on 3 January next the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid will visit Egypt.  I met the Iranian Ambassador last week.  Every possible avenue is being explored to help our vital cattle and beef industry.</P>
      <P>My predecessor referred the matter of prices paid by factories to the Competition Authority.  I have made contact with the Competition Authority on a number of occasions since then, but it is not yet in a position to make any report on the matter.  I can only assume it is ineffective in relation to this.  I have pursued a different avenue with the factory representatives and farming organisations.  Officials at the most senior level at my Department and farming representatives are quite positive as to the outcome of those meetings. I expect that in the new year there will be a far more transparent operation in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading between the lines it seems that the Minister is far from optimistic about opening the Egyptian trade.  He has a very downbeat approach to a huge problem.  I am beginning to see a hidden agenda in the Department of Agriculture and Food in the context of the live cattle trade.  It is alleged that at a meeting with a group of young farmers on 19 November the Minister said that as far as he was concerned the Egyptian live trade was not worth our while, that it was worth only 17p a pound for Irish meat and that it would be more worthwhile to send cattle to the meat processing plants in Ireland.  Is that the Minister's view?  If so, instead of being farmer oriented as an Irish Minister for Agriculture should be, the Minister is factory oriented. That means that every farmer who is depending on the Minister already has one hand tied behind his back.  I want the Minister to clear the air.  From the manner in which the Minister answered Deputy Penrose's question I do not believe the live trade to Egypt will reopen.  The <Col N="954" /> Minister does not seem optimistic.  That would not be too bad if we thought he was doing his best, but given what he is alleged to have said to young farmers, it seems he is against the live trade to Egypt.</P>

      <P>When I was in office only a couple of years ago we had a thriving live cattle trade. By the time I returned to office my predecessor had allowed it to dry up.  I am now seeking to have the live trade reopened.  The Government provided finance to get the <i>Purbeck</i> ferry into operation, and that has carried several thousand small cattle to the Continent.  In addition, I assisted in getting the live trade to the Lebanon opened up &mdash; again, for one reason or another, my predecessor abandoned the cattle industry in that country.  Only two weeks ago 2,000 live cattle were exported to the Lebanon, and a further 2,000 will be on their way within the next couple of weeks.  Every possible avenue is being explored to ensure a resumption of the live trade which was tragically allowed to go out of existence while I was out of office.  As far as I am concerned, we will return to the situation that existed when I was last in office, and that will happen very quickly.</P>

      <P>I recently announced a scheme of assistance for weather related crop losses to provide assistance to farmers whose farm viability is threatened because of crop losses, including horticultural crops and potatoes, caused by the severe weather conditions during 1997.  The closing date for lodgement of applications under this scheme with Teagasc is 19 December 1997.  When my Department has received all the applications from Teagasc, I will be able to evaluate the extent of the weather related crop damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have provided an amount of £1,200,000 special aid under this scheme.  The individual rates of assistance and the maximum amounts payable will be determined on the basis of all eligible applications received.  However, payment of aid will be based on the area of unharvestable <Col N="955" /> arable crops and potatoes and on yield losses for grass seed and horticultural crops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter was advertised on the radio, in national and local papers and through the farming organisations.  The people who are affected were made aware of the scheme, and the forms are available from local Teagasc offices. This means that up to 40 people in the Teagasc office were in contact with farmers.  I do not know the precise number of applications but there has been a high demand for forms.</P>
      <P>All farmers will not be included in the scheme as they must meet certain criteria, for example, an off-farm income of not more than £16,000 per year, a milk quota not exceeding 25,000 gallons, a sugar beet quota, delivered, of less than 1,000 tonnes, a forage area no greater than 50 hectares and a pig production unit not exceeding 100 breeding pigs.

      <Quest>his views on the Government's handling of the blockade of Irish meat by United Kingdom farmers; the steps, if any, he has taken, both at EU level and in contact with the United Kingdom Government, to secure complete and unimpeded access through United Kingdom ports and to counter the negative image of Irish beef in the United Kingdom.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The action taken by British farmers over the past two weeks to prevent the import of Irish beef into Britain is completely unacceptable. The United Kingdom is a traditional market for Irish beef and beef exporters are entitled to unrestricted access to that market.  The Government has conveyed this view very strongly to the British authorities at all levels, including to the Prime Minister, since the commencement of the protest action.  Immediately following the first incident at Holyhead on 1 December, I spoke to the Secretary of State for Wales, Mr. Ron Davies, and made it clear that everything possible should be done to ensure that Irish beef could be imported into the UK and traded there without impediment. I met the British Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Jack Cunningham, on 4 December in London to convey the Government's view that stronger action needed to be taken by the British authorities to protect Irish hauliers.  I was assured by Dr. Cunningham that the behaviour of British farmers in impeding Irish trade was illegal and totally unacceptable to his Government and that everything possible would be done to ensure unimpeded access for Irish beef to the British market.  The Taoiseach also raised the matter on two occasions with the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed the issue with his British counterpart Mr. Robin Cook.</P>
      <P>The action by British farmers has also been raised directly with the European Commission and at the Transport Council by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, on 11 December and by me at the Agriculture Council earlier this week.  I met the UK Minister for Agriculture in Brussels in the context of the meeting of the Agriculture Council and I sought and received further assurances from him that Irish beef would be allowed unimpeded access to the British market.  I apprised Commissioner Fischler and other EU Ministers for Agriculture of developments and, in particular, of the difficulties which the action by the British farmers created for the Irish beef industry.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the strong representations made by the Government to the British authorities and at EU level have been successful. These representations resulted in much stronger action being taken by the British authorities against protesters and in greater protection being given to Irish hauliers.  The position now is that Irish beef exports are getting through unhindered to their destinations in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> I do not accept that Irish beef has a negative image in the UK.  A research project undertaken by Bord Bia earlier this year found a very high level of acceptability of Irish beef among British consumers.  Nevertheless, Bord Bia is working closely with the major multiples to ensure that everything possible is done to maintain the presence of Irish beef on supermarket shelves in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that everything possible was done at the time.  While I welcome the lifting of the blockade, according to the farmers' unions in Wales and the UK this was only the first instalment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the real reason for the reduction in prices was the blockade?  It took the Government more than two weeks to make clear its views to the British Government.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach should have done much more.  Does the Minister take seriously the threat by Welsh farmers that they will encourage a boycott of Irish products on supermarket shelves in the UK and, if so, what contingency plans does his Department have to deal with the matter?  The transport of goods along a corridor with an escort does not accord with the concept of free movement enshrined in the Treaty of Rome.  The new twist in the action by Welsh farmers is the most worrying aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government dealt with this issue expeditiously and immediately contacted the British Government when the blockade began.  In this case responsibility for free access under the Single European Act rests with the British Government in whose jurisdiction the blockade took place.  Following representations to the British Government at the highest level &mdash; I travelled to London to meet my counterpart &mdash; stronger action was taken, the protest was withdrawn and full access was granted to beef exports.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the protest, with the BSE scare, led to a reduction in the price of beef of approximately 3p per pound.  It is unfortunate that this happened in the lead up to Christmas when there is a large demand for beef, which previously made almost 90p per pound.  There is no doubt that the blockade was a setback and led to a loss of income for beef producers.  From time to time difficulties are created within member states &mdash; we all recall the truckers' strike in France &mdash; in terms of impeded access to markets.  A week ago the European Court handed down a decision against France in that regard and that will be helpful to Ireland.  Since we export a high percentage of beef, it is important to have access to other markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this matter at the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  I made it clear that Ireland <Col N="958" /> demands adherence to European law, that non-compliance with European law, as demonstrated at UK ports, is unacceptable.  In response, the British Minister for Agriculture accepted that the protests were illegal.  He said the British authorities had done everything possible to deal with the problem, that within a week the protesters had been removed and trucks allowed through. He said that in future they would seek to ensure the rule of law obtained.</P>
    <P>Farmer spokesmen in Wales and the UK generally suggested they would put pressure on multiples there to desist from purchasing Irish beef and that they would promote British beef.  I brought that matter to the attention of the British Minister for Agriculture, through the Council, and received assurances in that regard.  The British Minister said that he could not prevent the industry from promoting its product, as we do here by way of &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; campaigns.  There is a shortage of beef in the UK.  The British Minister made it clear that my predecessor and I have been extraordinarily helpful in regard to the problem of BSE.  It is in the interests of everybody, consumers and beef producers, to have order restored to the market and that is what we are seeking to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that multinationals and multiples have resumed purchasing the quantities of beef they purchased prior to the blockade and that there has been no impact on employment here as a result?  Will he ask the Government to facilitate a class action by hauliers who incurred substantial losses as a result of the blockade.  It would be very costly if individual hauliers were to take action for compensation and, from previous experience, the success rate would be negligible.  A class action taken with Government support would have greater impact.  Will the Minister consider such a means of recovering losses incurred by hauliers, who were innocent victims in this instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Disruption was caused by the blockades, but at all times beef and beef products got through to their destination.  In one incident beef burgers were thrown into the sea, as we saw on our television screens.  Truck drivers were requested to turn around and go back on the ferry but when they returned later they were allowed through.  The disruption was inappropriate and unacceptable.  Since then beef has been getting through to its destination.</P>
      <P>The successful promotional campaign by Bord Bia for Irish beef has suffered a setback because of the highlighting of the farmers' case and multiples being careful to avoid protests at depots which supply goods to them.  Bord Bia is continuing to support the trade in the United Kingdom. Purchases have returned to previous levels and it is hoped that position will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on a number of occasions, particularly in reply to a Private Notice Question, I would be pleased to assist hauliers who pursue a case for <Col N="959" /> damages.  I will take up the case on behalf of any haulier who contacts me, but to date nobody has approached me in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it was on the agenda, much to the disappointment of the Deputy's colleague, Mr. Cushnahan MEP, who tried to make political capital of the issue.  He damaged the industry further by suggesting it was not on the agenda and contacting the media, &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and the newspapers, to that effect.  It would have been much better for the industry if Mr. Cushnahan had fully read the agenda.  The issue was handled professionally and successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the matter was raised under &ldquo;Any Other Business&rdquo;.  We are not talking about a county council meeting, we are dealing with a very serious issue.  As Deputies Connaughton and Penrose said, as a result of the blockade prices dropped.  Why did the Government not take legal action against its British counterparts in the first few days of the campaign? If it had done so, it might have saved farmers money and avoided hardship.  I agree with Deputy Connaughton there are bad days ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Cushnahan MEP has been long enough in Europe to know that two weeks' notice is necessary to get an item on the agenda.  Since this incident occurred less than two weeks before the meeting, the only way to raise it was on the supplementary agenda.  I ask Mr. Cushnahan to learn about European matters rather than seek to damage the industry here.  On the blockade and access to the UK and other European markets, all aspects of this matter were expeditiously and successfully dealt with, including difficulties for hauliers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the last part of Deputy Connaughton's question, the necessity to counter the negative image of Irish beef portrayed in the United Kingdom.  For the past three weeks the BBC and ITV have been portraying Irish beef as cheap imports.  Two weeks ago I saw a similar statement on Aertel on RTÉ.  Cheap imports of <Col N="960" /> Irish beef are being blamed for the blockade.  Has the Minister done anything to counteract that slur on our beef?  Irish beef is known all over the world, particularly in Europe, as being the best. Has he contacted RTÉ, ITV or the BBC to counteract that negative image?  Our beef is not cheap.  It is probably sold as the &ldquo;Best English&rdquo; or &ldquo;Best Scotch&rdquo; beef because they believe there would be a counter reaction if it was labelled as Irish beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the US ban on EU beef.  It is regrettable that any country should ban an Irish product.  We take immediate action on such matters.  We do not export a huge volume of beef to the US, but we are a delisted country and that looks bad in other countries to where we export beef.  The Taoiseach took up the matter with President Clinton during his recent visit.  We made the strongest possible representations on the matter.</P>
      <P>It is a fallacy to claim Irish beef is being dumped on the UK market.  That is simply not true.  When the blockade commenced Irish farmers were receiving less for their beef than their British counterparts.  We contacted the British authorities about the matter and I appeared on several UK television and radio programmes to point out that we are not under selling on the UK market and that our beef is top of the range.  Our control systems in the domestic market and retailers demand those standards.  My colleagues, including the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, also appeared on several current affairs programmes in the UK to counteract that suggestion. We asked Bord Bia to promote the positive image of our beef in terms of quality and price.  I hope that innuendo was not taken up by British consumers.  Irish beef is being purchased in the UK.  A survey carried out by Bord Bia shows that there is a positive image towards our beef there. The assurances we are able to give the UK consumers are obviously being accepted.  However, I take the Deputy's point.  I saw a number of the programmes to which he referred and the suggestions made were outrageous.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State consider amending the Control of Horses Act to oblige local authorities to provide the type of facilities required?  The Act currently provides for the control of horses, their licensing and so on and sets the age at which people may buy or sell horses.  Will the Minister of State consider amending the Act introduced by his predecessor to oblige local authorities to provide support for projects, particularly for the purchase of land? Projects cannot operate unless a substantial amount of land is available.  The Ballymun Animal Caring Association claims it would need approximately 30 acres of land to cope with the development it proposes.  It is obviously planning to care for animals other than horses.  However, we are talking about large tracts of land which would be quite expensive.  Will he consider that approach?  If not, has he a view on how it could be approached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are approximately 4,000 horses causing problems, 3,000 of which are in the greater Dublin area and 2,000 of which are in the Dublin functional area.  It is mainly a Dublin problem.  I accept the amount of land required is vital, but we will not know if the legislation needs to be amended until it is implemented.  People have not yet started to seize loose horses.  I am more concerned with the general health of horses, especially their feet.  Horses are getting strangles, a choking disease, and passing it on to other animals. Dehydration is another major concern.  A horse can drink up to seven gallons of water per day, but many of these horses get only one or two <Col N="962" /> buckets of water a day.  That is not sufficient.  This should form part of an education programme.</P>
      <P>I respect the tradition of young people who have a genuine interest in horses.  This could be compared to the plea that goes out each Christmas not to buy dogs as pets for children, as many of them are abandoned a couple of months after Christmas because people are not willing to house train them.  We intend to encourage local authorities to implement projects in areas where there is a genuine interest in horses.  Local authorities own much of the land in Ballymun and other such areas.  It would be expensive in terms of the loss of a sale but not because of its origins.  An area must be provided for the proper stabling of animals.  A stable would need to be at least ten to 12 square feet for an animal up to 15 or 16 hands.  This week we read a report about a man in Dublin who kept a horse in his backyard. Although he may have a genuine love for the animal, he is not treating it properly.  Local authorities in Dublin should be encouraged to spend money on training programmes.  That would be a positive rather than a reactionary step.  The Department will make money available for programmes which educate people in the care of animals, especially horses.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's approach to this issue which I have advocated for many years.  At a meeting of Dublin Corporation ten years ago I proposed a project similar to the one the Minister suggested which was adopted unanimously. Unfortunately, it collapsed because Dublin County Council was unwilling to co-operate with Dublin Corporation in allocating land in its control on the border between Ballymun and Finglas.  Either local authorities should be obliged to co-ordinate their approach to this problem or a means must be found to encourage them to do so.  As the Minister said he is not interested in amending the legislation, perhaps he would approach his counterparts in the Department of the Environment and Local Government to encourage the city and county managers to adopt a code of practice on such projects so that land is provided.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa and I will contact the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  Every political party in this House should contact its members to ensure they take a proactive role in supporting young children who have a genuine interest in horses. Horses are part of a growing sport throughout the world which can be financially rewarding.  We should encourage the members of our political parties on Dublin Corporation and the other local authorities in Dublin to direct the managers to start projects with the expertise that is freely available from people involved in the horse industry to help young children and to provide care for these horses.</P>

      <P>The total number of farmers who had received almost £85 million under the 1997 cattle headage and beef cow schemes up to and including 8 December 1997 was 77,414, representing 86 per cent of the total applicants of 90,445 under these schemes.  The comparable figure for the same date in 1996 was 85 per cent.  The latest position is that almost 80,000 applicants or 88 per cent of the total under these schemes have been paid.  This compares with 87 per cent of applicants paid at this time in 1996.  A total of 64,236 farmers were paid £72.8 million under the 1997 suckler cow premium scheme up to the same date and this number represents 86 per cent of the total May 1997 suckler cow applicants of 74,719.  The comparable figure for the same date in 1996 was 83 per cent.</P>
      <P>Almost 67,000 suckler cow applicants or 89 per cent of the total have now been paid; 86 per cent of suckler cow applicants had been paid at this time in 1996.  In the period since 1 January 1997 £733 million has been paid to farmers under the various headage, premia and arable aid schemes of which over £480 million relates to payments made under the 1997 schemes.  To date this year some 1.409 million payments have been made of which 903,136 represent payments under the 1997 schemes, including payments made under the various EU BSE and agrimonetary compensation schemes.</P>
      <P>Direct payments to farmers this year to date amount to £940 million.  They are continuing to issue to farmers under all premium and headage schemes.  It is expected that remaining eligible applicants will be paid before Christmas with the exception of real problem cases where herdowners have not returned the required information.</P>

      <P>It appeared from the Minister's reply that about 10,000 farmers did not get <Col N="966" /> anything yet.  Have all area aid applications been dealt with?  If there is a residue in Hume House, many farmers will not get anything until well into 1998.  Can it be taken that everything will be done with the problem cases?  There are many problems, but some of the more frivolous ones could be overcome very quickly, without toing and froing in the Department between Hume House, Agriculture House and the DV offices.  Can it be short circuited to ensure the majority of the 10,000 farmers will be looked after over the next few days?</P>

      <P>There is a difficulty in the Department in getting 1.4 million payments out at different times during the year.  Nonetheless we are, as a member state of the EU, the best country to make payments.  That was acknowledge three weeks ago in the <i>Irish Farmer's Journal</i>, which boasts of being fearlessly on the farmers' side.  All eligible cases have been paid, while problem cases are trickling back in where the Department has written to herdowners asking for information that was missing and they will continue to be paid up to Christmas and the new year.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty regarding area aid and Hume House.  I was amazed and taken aback when I entered office that there were 27,000 problem cases.  Some are still being sorted out but I do not know how many.  I have asked that they be tidied up and regularised for next year so that we do not run into the same problem next year. They are not creating a difficulty now because we had to seek a concession from the EU to allow the payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that I may be speaking to a small group this is in stark contrast to the importance of this debate.  The remit of the Kyoto Conference was to turn around the headlong rush to self destruction on which humanity has embarked.  This is the same remit which I and the Green Party have in politics.  It is a remit that touches on the viability of every area of policy. The action agreed on in Kyoto will affect how every pound is spent.  The seriousness of the situation is evident from the facts laid before world leaders prior to and during the conference.</P>
      <P>In September 1997, the US President, Bill Clinton, was presented with a petition signed by 1,500 of the world's most distinguished scientists, including 108 of the 138 surviving recipients of Nobel prizes for science.  This petition urged President Clinton to act immediately to prevent the potentially devastating consequences of human induced global warming.  Those scientists will take no comfort from what Deputy Clune said about volcanoes and other natural factors.  We want to counteract human induced global warming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October the intergovernmental panel on climate change stated that 60 per cent of CO 2 <Col N="970" /> emission cuts were needed to stabilise the effects of environment change.</P>
    <P>In October, scientist Robert May informed the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, that the Gulf Stream was slowing down due to the melting of ice in Greenland.  We have just finished questions to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  When that trend gathers pace we will be asking a different set of questions.  Meanwhile, Ireland has agreed not to increase greenhouse gases by more than 15 per cent by the year 2010.  Not only is this figure contrary to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but, as measured by the ESRI, it will be exceeded.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to environmental protection has to be measured against the reality of its policies.  Ireland continues to fail to meet energy conservation regulations.  Given the high level of housing construction being undertaken, failure to put in place energy conservation measures will make it more difficult to meet our international obligations.</P>
    <P>The Government boasts about increasing car ownership to one million cars.  This results in near permanent gridlock in urban areas and greenhouse gases multiplying by the tonne.  What is being done about alternative transport methods? The Luas project has been stymied, cyclists and pedestrians are frightened off our roads by the growing volumes of traffic and yet the Government disregards the needs of other transport users with continued indifference.  The operational programme for transport provides for the spending of £1.2 billion on new roadways with only £275 million being spent on public transport.</P>
    <P>Landfill sites continue to grow and hedgerows are disappearing.  The trend is that to make progress there is a need to damage and remove the natural environment. Which member of the Government will be prepared to apologise to the people for the consequences of climate change?  Will the Minister for the Environment and Local Government continue to have to apologise for the effects of flooding?  Will the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources have to apologise for coastal erosion, the Minister for Agriculture and Food for crop losses, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for the loss of biodiversity and the Minister for Health and Children for the increasing incidence of skin cancer, all of which are attributable to human activity?  Will the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment place in context raised insurance premia?  Who will express the nation's concern at the loss of 11.3 million hectares of the world's tropical forests each year while Ireland continues to import mahogany and other hardwoods?  If nations such as Bangladesh, the Pacific islands or the Nile delta and places much closer to home were to disappear, how would Deputy Callely react to the increasing influx of environmental refugees?  We are all aware of what happened at Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> The main item on the agenda in Kyoto was economic viability.  While the Government issued press releases on the effects of climate change, more astute nations were acutely aware that world oil production has peaked and that, regardless of price, output will decline rapidly with the result that in 50 years time it will be at 1950 levels. Recently Mr. L. F. Ivanhoe, president of Novum, an international energy exploration consultancy firm, stated:</P>
    <P>The permanent oil shortage will begin about 2010.  By 2050 oil production will be a small fraction of today's bounty.  A major change in lifestyles should be expected by the lower and middle classes in all societies.  Besides the government, through the police, the armed forces and the politicians, only the upper classes will have the money for auto and aeroplane fuel.</P>
    <P>His opinions are shared by Dr. Craig Hatfield of the University of Toledo who wrote in the magazine <i>Nature</i> that the peak global oil discovery year was 1962 and that no new major oilfields have been found since 1980.  Competitiveness will depend on non-dependence on oil and coal.  We should ask ourselves why Japan uses less petrol per unit of production than any other industrialised nation.  Foreign fuel sources account for 70 per cent of our energy requirements.  This figure will increase to 93 per cent by 2010.  The ESRI estimates that energy demand will be 70 per cent higher in that year than in 1990.</P>
    <P>Because of unfettered free trade, there is a need for greater spending on roads.  In the United Kingdom between 1955 and 1988 spending on roads trebled in real terms.  During the same period the number of car journeys increased tenfold, bus usage halved and bicycle usage declined by 80 per cent.  The trends here are similar.  There has been an increase in the number of days lost through sickness in industry and education and corresponding increases in the numbers of people suffering from environmentally-based conditions such as asthma and diabetes.  Between 1950 and 1986 spending on advertising increased fivefold in the cause of extolling the virtues of the feel good society and the dubious pleasures of foods, approximately 75 per cent of which are processed with additives according to United Kingdom figures.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the selfish society, at a time of high unemployment levels, people in paid employment are required to work longer hours. That is the reality in the Celtic tiger.  This is viewed as success which is measured by the level of activity, positive or negative, in the economy. There are yardsticks by which the effect on quality of life and health and self-reliance can be measured.  Economic growth, as measured by GNP, is not an indication of protection or the enhancement of biodiversity.  That is the reason the Green Party strongly believes in the development <Col N="972" /> of new, inclusive and effective indicators of environmental development and human welfare.</P>
    <P>The international importance of the Kyoto conference must not be understated.  Too often we concentrate on narrow short-term measures. Because of our desire to be re-elected, we have failed in our responsibility, as legislators, to bring about a fairer society and to pass on a healthier world to future generations.  We rarely focus on long-term measures and issues of deeper concern on a global scale.  During the past 30 years when environmental issues have been the subject of much debate too much negative energy has been expended on discussing whether ecological damage has been caused.  Rather we should have focused on the actions needed to avoid environmental problems.  Many warm words have been said at conferences but when delegates returned to their home nations the environment continued to be neglected and treated with indifference. There were indications at the Kyoto conference that we may at long last travel down the long road to environmental protection.  There is a recognition that the life of the planet could be affected by our failure to do so.</P>
    <P>Optimism was also expressed at the Rio earth summit in 1992.  As far as environmentalists were concerned, this soon turned into grave disappointment as world leaders returned to form.  The environment, as a political issue, was seen to have been &ldquo;dealt with&rdquo;.  The first major international conference on the environment was held in Stockholm in 1972, at which many of the issues which are still the source of concern were debated and, subsequently, ignored.  At least, it is now accepted and admitted there are serious problems and action needs to be taken.  There is a need for a change of direction.  In 1995 the intergovernmental panel on climate change stated it was no longer in question that humans were altering the climate.  We do not know how quickly and by how much.  This remains uncertain.</P>
    <P>We are suffering the consequences of years of compounded ecological errors through extreme weather conditions.  Since 1980 we have had seven of the warmest years on record and severe flooding has occurred on a regular basis both here and elsewhere.  Previously, such weather conditions would have been experienced only over a span of 30 to 40 years.</P>
    <P>We should focus on the actions that need to be taken to rectify the problem.  The ESRI, the OECD and various other bodies are of the view that there is a need for radical tax reform and to implement policies based on green economics.  In that context the budget was disappointing.  I hope the debate will continue and we will have an opportunity to discuss in committee the measures needed so that we do not turn our backs on future generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate on the outcome of the Kyoto summit and agree with previous speakers who expressed regret that we did not have an opportunity beforehand to have an <Col N="973" /> input into our country's position at the conference. For future reference, it is important that this House has an opportunity of debating our country's position and that of our Government in advance of major international conferences like this.</P>
      <P>There is no longer any doubt that climate change is a fact of modern life.  Some years ago when the issue was first raised, those who raised it were regarded as alarmist, and well-funded, so-called research from many vested interests in high energy use industry alleged that such claims were alarmist.  That is no longer the predominant view. It is now generally accepted that, unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, the global climate will continue to alter with disastrous consequences for all humanity.</P>
      <P>While the fact of climate change is now generally publicly acknowledged it is not fully appreciated just how dramatic that change is likely to be or in what forms it is likely to manifest itself. There is a popular view that climate change is about some kind of marginal warming of the climate.  For example, the Minister in his introductory remarks spoke about an increase of the order of two degrees in the average temperature. To most people that sounds like a marginal warming up of the average day; there is a perception that the ice-cap will melt a little, that sea levels will rise a little, when there might be some flooding in low lying areas and, with any luck, we might yet see grapes for &ldquo;cabernet&rdquo; growing in West Cork.  There is not the sense that the climate change will be dramatic or have disastrous consequences.</P>
      <P>Climate change in Ireland will have very serious implications and consequences, some of which have already manifested themselves, for example, that of serious flooding which has begun although, in some cases, perhaps for different reasons.  It was a curious coincidence that while the Kyoto conference was taking place there was serious and repeated flooding in the Suir valley, in particular in the town of Clonmel.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the loss of biodiversity with all its implications for the eco system, our health and food production and the threat to agriculture.  Again we are beginning to see some changes here, not necessarily all occasioned by climate change, but a factor in the changing climatic conditions facing agriculture.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem of increasing coastal erosion about which greater numbers of people are becoming concerned.  Virtually all our maritime counties have submitted proposals to Government Departments in respect of coastal protection schemes.  We shall not solve that problem by building a wall around the country.  The only way we shall seriously address it is by tackling the factors causing the rise in sea levels and its attendant climate change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Kyoto conference had very direct relevance for many of the issues becoming ever more prominent here.  Its discussions were not focused on some kind of obscure or remote topic, <Col N="974" /> something unlikely to occur in any serious sense until well into the next century.  They were focused on current occurrences requiring urgent attention.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Kyoto conference managed to produce agreement on a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since, certainly at this distance, it appeared for quite some time as though one might not be reached at all. That fact demonstrated that there was the political will to do something internationally about the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    <P>It appeared for a very long time in the course of that conference that the position of the United States was less than helpful.  It has to be acknowledged that a country, which produces 25 per cent of the total world contribution to greenhouse gases, whose representatives attended the Kyoto conference against a background of a very substantial and vociferous, well-funded lobby arguing against reduction in greenhouse gas emissions signed up to the Kyoto conference.  That in itself, was positive.  I concur with Deputy Currie's view, that it would be a tragedy if the United States Senate were to reject the Kyoto agreement.</P>
    <P>That the conference veered in the direction of reducing emissions is to be welcomed but that is where that welcome must end.  The ultimate agreement reached at Kyoto falls far short of the European Union target of a 15 per cent reduction.  Even the initial target date of 2005, amended to 2010, appears to have been moved tentatively to the year 2012, which must also be factored into the equation.</P>
    <P>The agreement is punctured with loopholes. For example, it will be far too easy for countries and enterprises to renege on the commitments in the Kyoto agreement, in particular that which allows for the so-called emission trading, which will enable large developed countries to locate dirty industry in developing countries or in others not reaching their target.  The inclusion of the provision of emission trading effectively provides a guarantee that globally the modest targets set certainly will not be exceeded.  The turning of greenhouse gas emission reductions into a commodity which will be traded in the marketplace is a retrograde step.  When one adds to that the differentiation for countries like Australia and Norway, the so-called sinks, effectively will allow countries to increase their emissions, provided they grow more trees.  Then there are the so-called banking and borrowing provisions, whereby the emissions from one year can be brought forward into the next and so on, somewhat like the Minister for Finance's approach to accountancy whereby he brings forward next year's expenditure into this year.  All of that will mean that the target stipulated will not be improved on because the agreement provides all of the mechanisms whereby balancing-up will take place so that countries and enterprises will reap the maximum out of the targets set.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the position of the G7 countries.  I agree entirely: we cannot <Col N="975" /> saddle the poor end of the world with the sins of the rich, developed world.  In the developed world we have created the problem of climate change and global warming.  It is in the developed world that the greenhouse gas emissions have occurred. Therefore, primarily it must be the developed world which addresses the problem.</P>
    <P>I agree too with the view the Minister expressed that if the question, particularly of some of the larger G77 countries like China or India, had been pressed in relation to making a commitment, there is a danger that a conclusion might not have been reached at the conference. However, when considering the position of the developing countries, we must put into the equation the global nature of our capitalist economic system and the fact that capital is now extremely mobile.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that industries affected by the Kyoto Summit conclusions will examine them in some detail and look for ways to circumvent them.  Various mechanisms will be used to do this. For example, they can relocate particular enterprises to countries not included in the mandatory requirements of the summit conclusions, or by the use of emissions trading they can move capital around.</P>
    <P>While the conference was essentially a conference of governments, the transnational nature of the enterprises which are directly causing the problem is such that they are not necessarily controllable by their individual state governments. So-called emissions trading will facilitate the industries contributing to the problem to move capital around.  The question of the role of developing countries will eventually have to be re-assessed in that context.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms I would make of the conference relates to the gulf between practice and theory.  The object of the conference was to decrease gas emissions, but one must examine what is happening in practice.  It was interesting that even the European Union was caught in a somewhat embarrassing position during the Kyoto Summit where it argued for greenhouse gas reductions of 15 per cent while, at the same time, the EU Council of Energy Ministers considered a package of measures which excluded cogeneration and put a reliance on the increased use of fossil fuels.</P>
    <P>The real question is what happens from here? The European Union went to Kyoto offering a 15 per cent reduction in emissions, but it has ended up with 8 per cent.  That may result in a renegotiation of the so-called EU bubble.  I very much welcome the commitment of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that it is his intention that this country will hold to the target set for it within that bubble.  It is also important that the EU holds to the 15 per cent reduction to which it committed itself prior to the conference and maintains the strong moral stand it took prior to the Kyoto conference.  Within that context it is also important that Ireland keeps to its target of <Col N="976" /> an overall 15 per cent increase.  The Minister has drawn attention to the fact that the natural increase, if nothing were to take place, would be something of the order of 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>The question that arises is the strategy our Government will adopt to reach that target.  I examined the Minister's speech in relation to the means of implementation and I am not optimistic that they will result in this country meeting its target.  Some of the measures are quite minor as they currently stand.  Electricity generation by alternative energy sources is minimal.  I acknowledge there has been a significant improvement in relation to insulation standards in building regulations but that applies only to new constructions. There is also the problem of existing dwellings where the level of insulation is modest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin referred to the absurdity of expecting the ESB, a producer of energy, to prepare for competition on the one hand, and, on the other, to lead a strategy towards a reduction in demand for electricity.  That clearly cannot happen and I agree with him that an independent agency is required to lead the energy reduction strategy.</P>
    <P>Increased afforestation sounds to me like a dive for the sink provision in relation to its application to Ireland, that we can somehow continue to increase emissions and as long as we have afforestation programme it will absorb it.  The Minister should get a gold medal for hard neck for going to Kyoto and telling the conference that Ireland will have improved public transport and measures to reduce traffic congestion in Dublin at the same time that his Government is effectively torpedoing the Luas project.  That is nothing short of hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>The practical measure for reducing traffic congestion in Dublin and for contributing to a shift to public transport in this city is the Luas project, which the Government has clearly put on the back burner.  If the Government is serious about meeting the targets for greenhouse gas reductions to which it agreed, it will have to change its position in that regard.  It is estimated that the number of cars in Ireland will have doubled by the year 2010 and that by that time emissions from cars will contribute 40 per cent of the total greenhouse gas emissions.  Clearly the shift to public transport is required not only to relieve traffic congestion in Dublin and elsewhere but also to meet the targets we have set in relation to the greenhouse gas reductions.</P>
    <P>We need a clear strategy set out by the Government.  I hope the consultancy study which is being referred to will be published when it becomes available and that it will be the subject of debate.  The requirement to prepare a strategy meeting the targets and cutting our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions from a projected 55 per cent increase to a 15 per cent increase will require dramatic changes in our economic activity and in transport.  Dramatic changes will also be required in relation to industrial policy, for example, as well as changes in energy production <Col N="977" /> and consumption.  We have not adequately prepared ourselves for that.  It will not be met by simply totting up all of the various alternative energy schemes that are included in the Department's Vote each year because a nod must be made in the direction of green practices.  It will only be met by working out a serious strategy and by the compliance of industry and economic activity in that regard.</P>
    <P>I was not encouraged by the statement made by IBEC following the conclusion of the conference. It appears we are beginning to see the first indications of resistance in industry to the efforts required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We need to prepare and publish a strategy on this and to have it debated publicly.  The public, industry and those involved in the range of economic activity here need to understand what this is about, the seriousness of this matter, the necessity for and urgency with which we must draw up a strategy and they must be willing to comply with it.  Far from moving forward to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we are moving increasingly towards the type of problems in which Vice President Gore found himself, where the heart was willing but the body was weak.  He and his Administration were committed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but they were saddled with a lobby from industry in their country which was resistant to it.  That is the scenario we are facing.  We need to be clear about this matter and to draw up a strategy on it and have it publicly debated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  The fact that we are discussing the Kyoto Protocol in such depth is indicative of the importance of this agreement to the global response to the challenge of climate change. Climate change is the leading and most far reaching threat to the global environment.  It is also one of the most critical tests of global commitment to truly sustainable development.  The contributions from all sides to the debate have made clear a wide appreciation that the Kyoto Protocol is a beginning to the process of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  It is not the final answer, but it is a foundation for future action and a framework for intensifying the necessary policies and practical responses.  Now that the protocol has been agreed all parties must accelerate the difficult but absolutely essential process of taking practical steps to halt and reverse the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied the Kyoto Protocol is a worthwhile outcome of the past two and a half years of intensive negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Naturally it cannot reflect all our wishes nor those of any one country or negotiating bloc, however it is better than what seemed possible at the start of the negotiations.  It advances progress and does not prejudice the future intensification of our <Col N="978" /> responses to climate change.  Failure to reach an agreement at Kyoto would have stalled progress in this area for a considerable period.</P>
    <P>From an environmental perspective I would like to emphasise briefly some positive aspects of the protocol mentioned earlier by the Minister. First, it sets an overall ambition for the developed world to reduce emissions of all greenhouse gases by at least 5 per cent below l990 levels by the years 2008 to 2012.  Second, it sets down the targets for each of those parties as legally binding targets.  Third, there are significant reduction levels required of the major economies.  For the EU, the US and Japan those reductions will be in the range of minus 8 per cent to minus 5 per cent. Fourth, the protocol places an onus on all parties to develop climate change and relate policies and measures suitable to their national circumstances. It also raises the prospect of internationally coordinated policy and measures.  Fifth, there is an inbuilt review mechanism to come into effect long before the first commitment period which can provide a means of improving our targets as appropriate.  The protocol provides additional support to the developing world's ability to counter the impact of climate change, including the introduction of a clean development mechanism.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I fully share Deputy Howlin's concerns about loopholes in the terms of the protocol, but strong efforts were made by the EU to minimise the loopholes which might have allowed parties to escape their commitments.  Provisions regarding emissions, trading, sinks and joint implementation are greatly circumscribed with further rules, modalities and guidelines to be developed by the conference of the parties before they can fully come into effect.  The EU will be strong participants in the future negotiations on those issues.  It is determined that the ambition of the targets in the protocol will not be compromised.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the EU aid per cent reduction targets will be met by the community as a whole.  The community will agree on how the burden of meeting those overall targets will be shared between member states.  That mechanism will enable Ireland to maintain an ambitious and demanding emissions limitation target, which will take into account our rate of development since 1990 and our continuing development requirements into the next decade, but we must also recognise that with <i>per capita</i> CO 2 emissions somewhat above the EU average there is a clear justification for us to do better in energy efficiency terms.</P>
    <P>As Deputies pointed out our action must be wide-ranging and it is important to ensure all interests have a real appreciation of what is involved.  The Minister and I welcome discussion in this House and through our committee system.  However, there was no discussion in the House prior to the adoption of the plus 15 per cent indicative target by the previous Government.  We are heartened by the commitment from all sides of the House to maintaining <Col N="979" /> and even improving our current emission level.  That support will be important in the ongoing discussion with economic actors at home and also within the EU in finalising the burden sharing arrangements.  We must use the occasion of the protocol to reaffirm our commitments to serious action to tackle climate change.  The challenge is to intensify the coupling of energy consumption and economic growth to make our economy and society as energy efficient as possible.  That process is already under way and will bring economic as well as environmental benefits.</P>
    <P>In developing and implementing the necessary responses we must fully recognise the general and specific factors which undermine the environmental balance necessary for a stable climate.  In general, intensive developments, unsustainable patterns of living and excessive consumption practices are the main ingredients which fuel the process of climate change.  Growing energy consumption, an ever expanding intensity of traffic, certain modern agricultural practices and the increasing generation of waste also contribute to the rapid growth in the level of greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    <P>Policies under way to address climate change have been mentioned several times in the debate.  I share the concerns expressed in regard to transport growth and emissions.  The transport sector is internationally recognised as the most difficult to tackle.  Almost 20 per cent of our CO 2 emissions come from this sector and this proportion is projected to increase. We have made a start with enhancing public transport, developing traffic management measures and implementing the DTI in Dublin. We strongly support a higher level vehicle efficiency and more stringent fuel standards being developed at EU level.</P>
    <P>Transport must continue to have priority in the future development of our response measures.  As already said, a consultancy study to identify and evaluate the scope for intensifying existing policies and measures and undertaking additional measures to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is now nearing completion.  The final report will be made available to the public for consultation purposes.  We look forward to further public debate and the choices we must make.  Much remains to be achieved, but a good start has been made.  I thank the Deputies for their detailed statements on this most important environmental issue for present and future generations.</P>

I thank the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Garda Síochána and the other people who look after the Houses for their work over the year and wish them a happy Christmas.

      <P>They deserve a happy Christmas.  Let us agree on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise that Christmas can be a very tense and lonely time for many people. People who have suffered bereavement recently, for instance, will feel the absence of a loved one. We should all remember our friends who are in <Col N="981" /> that position.  It is important also that we remember people who are alone at Christmas for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>In our excessive celebratory zeal, we should also recollect the importance of road safety and not do anything at Christmas which could endanger the lives of others.</P>
    <P>In the midst of a hopeful time in the peace process, it is fair to say there is probably more reason for hope than there has been for many years that the ongoing talks will yield something really worthwhile.  This Christmas we should not forget the victims of violence.  I was very struck to learn that many people who might have been the victims of a bombing or knee-capping 20 years ago or more are still in constant pain.  These are people for whom pain is a daily and nightly reality.  They cannot sleep because of pain without medication of some kind.  We should remember not just those who are lonely, who are suffering spiritual pain, but also those who are suffering the physical pain of violence.  In our celebration of the progress which is being made in the sense that we are entering a new era in which this sort of violence will not feature again, we should not forget the people who will suffer until the day they die from the consequences of violence which occurred over the past 30 years in this country.</P>
    <P>I wish the Taoiseach and the members of the Government, in particular, a happy Christmas and success in their work.  I wish a happy Christmas to the leaders of the Labour Party and Democratic Left, Deputies Gormley and Sargent of the Green Party and, most importantly, Deputies Healy-Rae, Blaney and Fox.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle is aware that Kilkenny city and county are both beautiful. Each day there is a vibrancy on the streets of Kilkenny city because of the presence of the many tourists who visit the area.  The sounds of continental and American accents are a feature of everyday experience in our city.  However, this image of Kilkenny often presents difficulties for local authorities, agencies and public representatives when they wish to make a strong case to the IDA or the Government for inward investment to the Kilkenny area.  We are often confronted <Col N="984" /> with the deep seated phrase used by national authorities in particular that &ldquo;Kilkenny is a beautiful place and it is doing very well&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Kilkenny has one of the lowest bases of manufacturing employment in the country.  At present, 2,575 people are registered as unemployed in Kilkenny city, 615 are registered in Thomastown and 516 in Callan.  This provides clear evidence of the dire need to redress the balance and provide the employment opportunities for the people of Kilkenny that have been lacking for many years.</P>
      <P>The area was bedevilled by the closure 18 years ago of Fieldcrest, which provided a major boost to manufacturing employment when it established in Kilkenny in the late 1970s.  There were great expectations that up to 1,500 people would be employed there.  However, when that American multinational pulled out of Kilkenny it dealt a serious blow to the economy and to people's work opportunities.</P>
      <P>Kilkenny's local authority, its Chamber of Commerce and trade unions have actively sought to stem the tide in respect of manufacturing employment since that time.  There has been some success in that the original Fieldcrest site of 14 acres has been broken up into various units which house good employers such as Kilkenny Textile Mills, Great West Life, Kilkenny People Printing, Irish Driver Harris and, a recent addition, NN Ball and Roller Inc., from the United States.  These small manufacturing bases provide employment for approximately 1,000 people.  However, as already stated, the figures clearly show that more must be done.</P>
      <P>With other local public representatives, I was glad to play my part to ensure that the previous Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, sanctioned the necessary finance in 1996 to fund a new IDA business park on the outskirts of Kilkenny city.  The necessary registration in respect of this land has been completed and it was recently rezoned as industrial land by Kilkenny County Council.  It is available for inspection by any inward investors who wish to establish a manufacturing base in Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>I hope the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Treacy, will be able to lend their personal support to helping the IDA attract a major manufacturing industry to the Kilkenny area.  In terms of employment, service industry alone cannot sustain itself into the future in any permanent way. Services can only be sustained from a strong manufacturing base.  The lack of such a base in Kilkenny is giving rise to concern among people because the part-time employment available in the services and tourism industries is not sufficient to retain well educated young people in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that, in the run up to the 21st century, Kilkenny's new business park will be able to play an important role in developing much needed manufacturing employment for the area which will help sustain <Col N="985" /> other employment in the services sector for the many people who depend on it.  I look forward to his support in that regard and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hogan for giving me the opportunity to again address this very import issue.  The number of overseas jobs in County Kilkenny is disappointing in comparison to other counties. Although there are seven overseas companies in Kilkenny city and county employing a total of 350 people, Kilkenny has, despite the best efforts of IDA Ireland, been less than successful in attracting significant new overseas investment in recent years.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is very conscious of its responsibility to promote and bring new investors to regional locations and endeavours to achieve the most equitable spread of overseas mobile investment outside the larger urban centre.  Investors are encouraged to look at many locations across the country, Kilkenny included, during the process of their decision making.  There have been eight site visits by overseas mobile investors to Kilkenny city and county to date in 1997.  One project was announced for Kilkenny &mdash; NN Ball &amp; Roller Incorporated stated its intention to locate a precision engineering plant in the city with employment potential for 150 people at full capacity.</P>
      <P>Decisions on where to locate are made by potential IDA Ireland clients on the basis of competitive advantage.  The one clear factor which will influence the location of projects is the level of industrial competitiveness an area can offer by way of infrastructure and a positive business environment.  To enhance the attractiveness of Kilkenny to potential investors, IDA Ireland has purchased the site referred to by the Deputy for development of a new business park in 1998. Planning permission is currently awaited for this site and when approved, will be actively marketed by IDA Ireland for overseas investment.  I am assured by IDA Ireland that everything possible will be done to attract further overseas investment to Kilkenny city and county in 1998.  I assure the House and Kilkenny Deputies that the Tánaiste, departmental officials and I will be delighted to do anything we can do to supplement and complement their efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House I wish to share time with Deputy Gerry Reynolds.  Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue.  My bone of contention with planning regulations for mobile telephone masts concerns ESB and Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform masts, which are exempt from planning permission, in common with other existing masts.  This is causing extreme <Col N="986" /> frustration to local residents who have no means of objecting to such developments.</P>
      <P>The planning regulations recommend that mobile phone masts are not erected in built-up areas or near schools, yet the majority of exempted masts are in these areas.  For example, two exempt masts in Carrick-on-Shannon are either beside schools, as in Summerhill on the County Leitrim side of the town, or in a housing estate, as in Mullaghmore, on the Roscommon side.  This is causing major annoyance to the local community, which has no say in the erection of these antennae.  To compound the problem, mobile phone companies will not meet residents anywhere in the country.  These companies should meet concerned people to allay their fears instead of avoiding the issue.</P>
      <P>I have a number of questions for the Minister; if he is unable to answer them today I would be grateful if he could reply early in the new year. What is the legal status of the ministerial order exempting masts already erected?  There is a clear change from in-house use to commercial use by Eircell and ESAT Digiphone.  Has independent research been initiated by his Department to investigate the health concerns of people residing near these masts?  Has the Minister been assured that monitoring emissions from masts is taking place and that the results will be published?  Can the ESB, the Department of Justice and other mast owners lease them to commercial concerns while blatantly disregarding the guidelines of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to local authorities?  Immediate independent monitoring and discussions between phone companies and local residents can allay many of the fears at present associated with these masts.</P>
      <P>A loophole in the planning guidelines for the erection of these masts is the recommendation that they should not be erected near schools or built up areas.  That provision, however, does not include the antennae and it is these which are causing major concern to local residents.  The erection of an antenna on a water tower beside a school meets the guidelines yet the erection of a mast in the same location does not.  I ask the Minister to review the guidelines laid down by the previous Minister and examine these loopholes. There are major concerns about these subjects and people are worried because the companies will not meet them.</P>

      <P>I support the remarks of my colleague, Deputy Naughten.  I will be parochial on this issue and discuss a mast located at Summerhill, Carrick-on-Shannon, beside the local primary school.  There has been so much public concern about the mast and antenna that the local ESB offices are picketed from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. five days a week.  I ask the Minister to answer the questions raised by Deputy Naughten, if not this evening then early in the new year.  It is difficult for the Department to give conclusive evidence that there is no health risk associated with these <Col N="987" /> antennae but public concern is so great that an explanation must be offered.  The Minister should reconsider the previous Government's decision to allow a number of masts and antennae to be erected without having to apply for planning permission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to explain the position.  It has been the policy of successive Governments to place Ireland in the top quartile of OECD economies as regards the availability, price and quality of telecommunications services to promote industrial and commercial development, to improve personal and household security and to enhance social exchange and mobility.  Against that background and in anticipation of a growth in the number of mobile telephone masts, my Department published guidelines in July 1996.  This was done to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications antennae and support structures within the planning system.</P>
      <P>The guidelines deal with issues such as the location of masts, co-location with other operators, and health and safety aspects.  They set out a hierarchy of suitable locations for the siting of telecommunications masts.  The main concern of my Department is the impact of these masts on the landscape.  To avoid an unnecessary proliferation of masts, the guidelines provide that owners of masts are expected to facilitate co-location of antennae with other operators.  Where this is not possible, operators are encouraged to site adjacently so that masts and antennae may be clustered.</P>
      <P>Some time after the publication of the guidelines it emerged that the planning regulations would need to be amended to clarify the position in relation to the addition of antennae to existing masts.  Section 4(1)(g) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, provides that the alteration of an existing structure, where the external appearance is not materially affected, is exempted development.  This gave rise to a lack of clarity in relation to the addition of antennae to existing masts.</P>
      <P>This was remedied by the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1997, which came into operation on 13 February.  These regulations provide that, subject to certain criteria like restrictions on the size, number and type of mobile phone antennae and compliance with certain emission standards, the addition of antennae for mobile telephony to an existing radio mast and the replacement of an existing mast are exempted development.  I have no plans to change these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main area of concern appears to be the possible ill-health which the antennae might <Col N="988" /> cause.  All significant research in this area is monitored by the Department of Public Enterprise in liaison with the Department of Health and Children regarding the human health aspects.  Telecommunications companies operating here are licensed by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and are required to operate within emission limits set by the International Radiation Protection Association.  The Office of Director of Telecommunications Regulation was established earlier this year by the Minister for Public Enterprise.  Its function is to ensure that licensed operators of telecommunications systems comply with all the conditions of their licence including emission standards.  Emissions are to be monitored on a regular and nationwide basis.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Thank you, A Cheann Comhairle for choosing this matter for the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Sophie Toscan du Plantier came to west Cork to her holiday home last December to spend a quiet Christmas at her private Irish retreat.  She was battered to death on the laneway to her house on the night of 22 December.</P>
      <P>One year later, we still do not know what stage the investigation has reached.  More important, neither the family nor the lawyers representing the family know how far the investigation has got. I spoke this afternoon on the telephone to Paris to the du Plantier family lawyer, Mr. Paul Haennig. He is extremely angry that a series of requests for information relating to the death of their client has been met with a wall of silence. Mr. Haennig would describe it as a wall of indifference. Numerous requests for information have gone unanswered &mdash; as Mr. Haennig puts it &ldquo;no response, no co-operation, nothing&rdquo;, that is, apart from some early confidential conversations with the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>In desperation, on 4 April, this year, lawyers for the du Plantier family succeeded in having a French judge, Brigitte Pellegrini, appointed in order to gain access to the documentation of the murder inquiry.  It was not the intention to interfere with the inquiry, to impede it or to frustrate it in any way.  It was simply a case of wanting to know what was happening and what progress was being made.</P>
      <P>On 4 April Judge Pellegrini authorised the French Minister for Justice and the justice authorities to seek permission for members of the French police to travel to Ireland to be brought up to date on the case.  Co-operation in this regard has not been forthcoming from this side. Not alone has there been no co-operation, not a single letter has been replied to or acknowledged. I understand that the judge wrote in May and June, but there was no acknowledgment and no response.  Not even details of the autopsy or post-mortem have been forwarded to France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the discourtesy, indeed the insult, to the French authorities, there is the fundamental <Col N="989" /> desire and entitlement of the family to know what steps have been taken to investigate and solve the mystery of the murder of their loved one, what success the authorities have had in bringing charges and what timescale, if any, we are talking about.  For a country that is so proud to flaunt its success and sophistication in so many spheres of life, we can be very intransigent, uncaring and primitive at times in regard to our official duties.  I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to tell the House whether the file on the investigation has been completed; whether it has been sent to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions; if so when was it sent; whether charges are expected to be brought; and if so, when.  The Minister and his Department seem to be impervious and oblivious to what is involved here.  A lady, a non-national was brutally murdered.  Someone killed her and is still at large. The du Plantier family face into their second Christmas, and they still do not know the circumstances surrounding Ms du Plantier's death.  The family agonise, wonder and wait, and they have not even received a line in writing from the authorities in whose jurisdiction the murder occurred or any details of what progress, if any, is being made in investigating this tragedy.  Above all else, I ask the Minister to immediately contact his French counterpart or the Irish Ambassador and convey to the du Plantier family an immediate apology for the insensitive and uncaring manner in which the Department has dealt with this matter.</P>

      <P>If there was a considerable amount of exasperation on 4 April, I would respectfully remind the Deputy that this Administration was not in Government at that time.  In any event I wish to explain the entire situation in a logical manner.</P>
      <P>A fax copy of an International Rogatory Commission &mdash; A Request for Mutual Assistance in a Criminal Matter &mdash; from the French authorities in this matter was received in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 30 April 1997.  Let me make it clear that no communication other than this request was received in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform from the French authorities other than through diplomatic channels, and these were mostly by telephone.  The request had been made through Interpol to the Garda Síochána and was forwarded by the Garda to my Department.</P>
      <P>The request sought very sensitive material relating to the Garda investigation into this crime and also authority for French police to assist the Garda in the execution of the request.  Clearly it would be important not to prejudice the Garda investigation or any subsequent prosecution by the premature disclosure of information to third parties.</P>

    <P>On 21 May 1997 a copy of the same request was received in my Department through diplomatic channels.  On the same day this request was <Col N="990" /> sent to the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Office of the Attorney General for advice which is normal practice.</P>
    <P>It is not true, as has been suggested, that the request was ignored or that no contact was made with the French authorities.  The position is that the French authorities have been kept informed of developments through the usual diplomatic channels used in such cases.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have advised me that the present position regarding this investigation is that a substantial file has been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions for directions. While the file is being actively considered by the Director, Garda inquiries are continuing. I am also informed that in early January 1997 and subsequently the Director of Public Prosecutions issued a number of letters of request to the French authorities on behalf of the Garda seeking that a number of inquiries be made in France.  It would appear that one has been responded to.</P>
    <P>Obviously a decision on the prosecution cannot be made by the Director of Public Prosecutions until the investigation has been completed.  As I mentioned, the mutual assistance request has been referred to the law officers for legal advice and the decision will have to be made in light of this advice when it becomes available.  I expect to have that advice in the near future.</P>
    <P>I understand the deep feelings of the family and their distress, and sympathise with them in this respect.  I assure them that the investigation is being pursued vigorously by the Irish authorities with a view to bringing the perpetrator or perpetrators to justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the plight of 14 children in the Cork area whose cases are sadly similar to many others throughout the country.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, is not present.  I am informed that he is due to meet the parents in Cork on 9 January.  I look forward to that meeting.</P>
      <P>The 14 children in this group, whose parents have formed the Early Childhood Services Parent Group, suffer from severe learning difficulties. Some of the children are autistic, some have autistic tendencies, and the remaining children have equally severe learning problems.</P>
      <P>These children range in age from three to five years of age, and their problem is that educational services are not available to them.  There is an excellent facility available for such children in the Cork region at Scoil Trieste.  Unfortunately, the numbers it can accommodate are limited. I am informed that most of these children will be unable to get a place at Scoil Trieste. There is no other appropriate educational facility for these children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> The problems faced by children suffering from autism throughout the country have been featured on RTÉ programmes in recent days.  We have a duty as an Oireachtas and as a nation to respond favourably.  The Celtic tiger may be roaring, but when there are so many disadvantaged students not just in one county but throughout the country we must invest in the appropriate educational structures to ensure their needs are met.  Most of these children will have a healthy, bright future if they are looked after through the proper educational channels.  We will write off their future if we do not provide a proper teaching system and schools.  This would be unfair and immoral.  My request on behalf of the Early Childhood Services Parent Group in County Cork applies to many other similar groups.  It is important that proper educational facilities and an adequate number of places and teachers are made available at the earliest possible date.  I look forward to the Minister's meeting with the group in Cork on 9 January and hope he gives me positive news on the Government's proposals in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science is engaged with senior officials in the Department in planning for the national forum on early childhood education which stems from the commitment in the programme An Action Programme for the Millennium. The objective is to ensure that the forum will allow all groups with an interest in the area of early childhood education to put forward their views as to how best to co-ordinate, resource and support the development of services in this area to ensure equal access and opportunity for all children of pre-school age.  The outcome of the forum will provide an important input to policy decisions on the future development of pre-school education services.  The Minister for Education and Science is fully committed to maximising the opportunities for special needs children to participate in the education system on a fully integrated basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, gives particular priority to this area through its commitment to equal opportunity and the priority it attaches to the provision of remedial teachers and resources <Col N="992" /> for children with special learning difficulties. Where special needs children are concerned, it is necessary to view each case on an individual basis.  For some children, the nature of the special need may be such that the child can function successfully in an integrated setting with the support, where necessary, of a remedial teacher, a resource teacher or a visiting teacher.</P>
    <P>The degree to which integration can be achieved will depend on the specific and evolving capacities of the individual children concerned.  In more severe cases, provision may have to be made for pupils in special classes or schools dedicated to the particular special need.  At present, a total of 1,242 remedial teachers, 78 resource teachers and 42 visiting teachers are deployed to assist these children.  This includes a total of 51 remedial teachers, 32 resource teachers and two visiting teachers newly appointed for the current school year.  However, there will continue to be cases where the nature or severity of the special need is such as to require placement in a special school or special class attached to an ordinary school.  A wide range of such facilities is provided and each receives a special level of staffing and funding which reflects the severity of the needs being catered for.  It is the Minister's intention to continue to support these facilities.  The Department of Education and Science will continue to consider applications from schools for such classes and will establish them as required.</P>
    <P>The Minister is conscious that there is room for further improvement in this area.  The Deputy can be assured that it is his intention to continue to attach priority to the further development of support services for children with special needs who are integrated into mainstream schools and to ensure that all children have access to an education appropriate to their needs.  The question of the adequacy of speech therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and music therapy is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen.</P>

      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 9, 10, 46 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has made strong representations to the British authorities at all levels over the past number of weeks in connection with the disruption to Irish beef exports to the United Kingdom arising from protest action by British farmers.</P>
      <P>I met the British Minister for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, Dr. Jack Cunningham, on 4 December in London and again in Brussels on 15-16 December.  At the meeting of 1 December, I made it clear to Dr. Cunningham that the attempted blockade by British farmers of imports of Irish beef into the United Kingdom was completely unacceptable.  I emphasised that the United Kingdom is a traditional market for Irish beef and that there was no question of Irish beef being dumped on that market.  I pointed out that Irish beef was entitled to unimpeded access to the British market and I sought assurances that stronger action would be taken by the British authorities to protect Irish hauliers.  I was assured by Dr. Cunningham that he found the behaviour of British farmers totally unacceptable and that everything possible would be done to ensure unimpeded access for Irish beef to the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Similar representations were made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs last week to the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary respectively.</P>
      <P>I met Dr. Cunningham again earlier this week at the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels.  I reiterated my concerns about the need for Irish beef to secure unhindered access to the United Kingdom and I received firm assurances from Dr. Cunningham on the matter.</P>
      <P>I also raised this issue at the meeting of the Agriculture Council itself, where I apprised the Commissioner and the other EU Ministers for Agriculture of developments and, in particular, of the difficulties which the action by the Welsh farmers created for the Irish beef industry.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the representations made by myself and other members of the Government, including the Taoiseach, have been successful. The British authorities have been taking much tougher action against protesters in the recent past and Irish hauliers are now getting through to their destinations unhindered.  In view of this, I do not believe there is any threat to Irish jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties experienced by Irish hauliers and the beef industry generally as a result of the protest action by the British farmers. However, any compensation for losses arising from this action is a matter between those specifically affected and the British authorities.  My Department will provide whatever assistance it can in this regard. <Col N="995" /></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 35, 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>Up to end November 1997, 70 cases of BSE were detected in Ireland compared to 62 cases during the same period last year.  By way of comparison, the number of cases confirmed for the period July-November 1997 was 33 compared with 49 for the same period in 1996.  In addition, the number of cases in November 1997 was five compared to 18 during the same month in 1996.  I have already outlined on previous occasions the stringent controls which are in place in Ireland to ensure the safety of Irish beef which go beyond those recommended by the relevant international organisations.  These include the depopulation of herds in which a case of BSE is confirmed and the removal of specified risk material from all carcases after slaughter.  This risk material is then disposed of under strict conditions.</P>
      <P>The Enfer test referred to is a commercial test involving a post-mortem diagnostic method for detecting BSE and is based on the measurement of the disease specific prion protein.  It employs an ELISA protocol and its unique feature is a novel method of binding the prion protein to the surface of an ELISA plate.  The veterinary research laboratory of my Department participated in the validation of the test and the results obtained showed excellent discrimination between negatives and positives.  The major advantages of the rest are that it can give a much more rapid result than the existing histopathological and immunohistochemical methods and it has the potential to be fully automated.  I understand that the company concerned is currently gearing up to providing the test on a commercial basis. The cost of the test will be a commercial decision for the company itself.</P>
      <P>This test and some others that are being validated elsewhere have the potential to make a positive contribution to providing additional reassurance as to the safety of beef.  The question as to whether the test will provide any additional benefits to the beef industry in its commercial dealings is primarily a matter for the industry itself.  At this stage, I do not have any plans to introduce the test on a compulsory basis over and above those controls already in place in Ireland as far as BSE is concerned.  I will, however, keep the position under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 55 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>There have been 758 new brucellosis herd breakdowns up to 30 November 1997.  At the same date, some 461 herds were restricted, of which 320 were restricted under EU legislation. While infection levels have shown a relative increase in Limerick, north Kerry, north Cork and Tipperary, there have been brucellosis breakdowns in most counties in 1997.  At the same time, it must be borne in mind that close to 99.8 per cent of the country's 150,000 herds are currently brucellosis free under EU rules.  It is essential, for a variety of reasons, that the necessary measures are taken both to protect the status of herds and to curtail and eradicate brucellosis from the national herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To this end and following consultations with the animal health advisory forum, comprising representatives of the farming and veterinary bodies, in August last, I announced a series of measures to be undertaken.  These include in particular: the continuation of milk ring testing on a monthly basis as opposed to the previous four tests at six weekly intervals between April and September; an awareness-education programme directed specifically at farmers and focused principally on promoting effective herd management and health protection practices including prudent buying-in of cattle from reliable sources.  In this regard on 1 September all herdowners were issued with an advice pack outlining the essential measures required to protect their herds; detailed epidemiological investigations by departmental veterinary inspectors of brucellosis breakdowns; in addition, the brucellosis reactor compensation regime was revamped from 15 September 1997 to encourage farmers to: purchase eligible cattle from reliable sources; confine purchases to cattle which have passed brucellosis blood tests within the previous 60 days in the herds from which they <Col N="998" /> are brought and test such cattle again within 30 days of purchase.</P>
    <P>Compensation payments to farmers will be at nominal levels in the event of a brucellosis breakdown where bought-in cattle do not meet these requirements; a further advice pack detailing the conditions to be met to qualify for the top rates of compensation was sent to each herdowner.</P>
    <P>In view of the continuing deterioration in the situation, I have recently decided in principle to have a full round of blood testing undertaken in 1998 and to introduce a compulsory 30 day pre-movement test requirement at national level.  The detailed arrangements for this are being discussed with the farming bodies.  In addition, a full review of the compensation arrangements for both TB and brucellosis is being undertaken in consultation with these bodies.  The intention is to ensure that such payments are directed even more strongly towards herdowners who farm prudently.</P>
    <P>The co-operation and commitment of all 150,000 herdowners, the farm organisations, veterinary and food processing interests will be essential for the sustained effort needed to deal with the current problem.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 65 and 96 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish beef is exported to over 60 markets world wide, including most member states of the EU, Asia, Africa and the Americas.  The level of our exports was adversely affected as a result of the fall off in demand following the BSE crisis.  Due to the extremely low incidence of BSE in Ireland and the effectiveness of our controls, it has been possible to provide assurances to allow trade continue <Col N="999" /> in most of our international markets.  The removal of BSE related restrictions imposed by a number of countries is, of course, a matter to which I have accorded utmost priority and significant progress has been made in particular in the Gulf States and Russia.</P>
    <P>Following negotiations with a Russian delegation led by the Russian Deputy Agriculture Minister, a protocol was concluded which lifted the ban on exports of beef from County Wexford. This represented the first easing of the restrictions imposed by Russia in November 1996.  The agreement comes up for review again in January next and I am hopeful that the process of lifting county restrictions will continue.</P>
    <P>As regards Iran, contacts at a diplomatic level between EU member states and that country were suspended for a period.  These contacts have recently been renewed and I am hopeful that as a result of this, an early meeting will be arranged at veterinary level to discuss lifting the prohibition on imports of Irish beef imposed in March 1996.</P>
    <P>Every effort will continue to be made by my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia to maintain and expand market access and to promote Irish beef as a quality and safe product produced under stringent controls. The recent reduction in what was, in any event, a very low level of BSE in Ireland will underpin these efforts in the coming months.  It is expected that Irish beef exports will reach a level of 450,000 tonnes this year.</P>

      <P>As I already indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 137 of 16 December 1997, funds allocated to my Department under the Community Support Framework are as follows: the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Develoment and Forestry (OPARDF), 1,557 mecu; the Food SupProgramme of the Operational Programme for Industrial Development, 313 mecu.  As a rough guide, the above sums translate into indicative amounts of £1,152 million and £232 million respectively.</P>
      <P>Grants under the Operational Programme for Agricultural Rural Development and Forestry relate mainly to farmers who must follow certain specific criteria if they wish to participate in the various schemes available.  Tendering processes have arisen under the operational programme in relation to the evaluations of the headage scheme, the mid-term evaluation and more recently the evaluation of forestry training.  In regard to the latter evaluation, the terms of reference included an examination of the possibility of involvement of the private sector in this area.</P>
      <P>My Department also has responsibility for the food sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Industrial Development.  In the main, the food sub-programme comprises a number of schemes under which grants are awarded to individual companies or institutions.  While obviously this does not entail a tendering process, in the normally accepted sense of that term, all awards are made on the basis of compliance with the eligibility criteria laid down for the various schemes and a competitive assessment and selection process.</P>

      <Quest>the new procedures, if any, which are planned at national level for the better supervision of payments in view of the findings of the EU Court of Auditors that Irish cereal farmers got roughly £200 million too much in compensation for each of the years from 1993-96, while beef farmers got overcompensation of £25 million; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1992 reform of the CAP provided for a reduction in intervention prices in the beef and cereals sectors and for compensation to be paid to producers through the direct payment system. The over compensation referred to in the report of the European Court of Auditors relates to the level of compensation provided for in the reform for the cuts in institutional prices relative to developments in actual market prices following the reform.  There is no reference in that report to the amounts referred to by the Deputy and I am not aware of the source of that information. The Court of Auditors has not suggested that the over compensation has resulted from inadequate procedures or controls on the payment.</P>
      <P>As far as the cereals sector is concerned, it is true that prices on world and EU markets remained buoyant after 1992, particularly in 1995 and 1996, due mainly to weather induced shortages and depletion of world stocks.  However, EU prices have fallen below pre CAP reform levels and this is evidenced by an increase in consumption of cereals in animal feed of at least ten million tonnes up to 1996, and a reduction in intervention stocks from 33 million tonnes to less than two million tonnes in June 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth noting also that producer prices in Ireland in 1997 were 28 per cent below those in <Col N="1002" /> 1992 and were 33 per cent down on 1990 and 1991.  In the circumstances, it is clear that the adequacy or otherwise of compensatory payments can only be assessed properly over a reasonable period of years and not over the relatively short period during which exceptional market conditions prevailed.</P>
    <P>As far as beef is concerned, it might be noted that the European Commission, in its comment on the report, has rejected the Court's finding that European beef farmers were overcompensated. It is difficult in any event to quantify the extent of any overcompensation because developments in cattle prices are influenced by several factors, and trends can only be established over a longer time-frame than that covered by the report.  In this regard, it might be noted that cattle prices in Ireland were significantly lower in 1996 and 1997 than in 1992.</P>

      <P>The Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals were published in July 1997.  Since then the agricultural aspects have been considered at each meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers and by the European Council at its meeting in Luxembourg on 12-13 December.  The Commission is expected to table its detailed proposals in the first quarter of 1998 in the light of the outcome of these deliberations.  The full implications for Ireland's agriculture sector and any consequences for my Department's policies will not become clear until these detailed proposals emerge.  These proposals will be carefully examined by my Department.  In addition, the four consultative groups consisting of farmers, processors and others, which I decided to set up for the beef, milk, cereals and rural development areas will help ensure that the widest range of expertise will be available to me during the ongoing negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I and other members of the Government will continue to work throughout these negotiations for an outcome that not only will involve no loss or disadvantage for the Irish agriculture and food sectors, but will provide a policy framework within which these sectors will realise their full potential for wealth and employment creation in the future.  Any <Col N="1003" /> detailed plan for the development of these sectors can usefully be prepared only when the outcome of the negotiations is known.</P>

      <P>The Irish food industry is well placed to meet the opportunities and challenges of the EMU.  Through its emphasis on competitiveness and market orientation, the current development plan for the industry has laid a solid foundation. The results in recent years have been very positive. Employment targets within the food sector have been exceeded and, despite the BSE-related difficulties, the value of exports in 1996 was equivalent to the previous year's level.</P>
      <P>Development plans must, of course, evolve to take account of changes in the environment such as the advent of EMU.  In this regard, I am satisfied that the amendments made to the food development plan in the recent mid-term review of Structural Funds are in the right direction. These reinforce the competitiveness and market orientation themes through their emphasis on issues such as food safety, supplier development programmes and world class manufacturing techniques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to be taken next May on the fixed exchange rates of EMU will, of course, be an important one for all sectors of the economy, <Col N="1004" /> including the food one.  While market sensitivity precludes much comment on this issue, the Minister for Finance has indicated that the intention is that Ireland joins EMU at an exchange rate that meets the needs of the economy, in the fullest sense of the term, and that between now and the time the decision is taken, the issue will be kept under active review.  I have had discussions with the food industry representatives about the possible implications and I will remain attentive to their concerns.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise the need for individual food companies to make their necessary practical arrangements for EMU.  I commend to them the EMU business awareness campaign operated by Forfás and the relevant initiatives of their own representative groups.</P>

      <P>The current development plan for the food industry is articulated in the Food Sub-Programme 1994-99.  This provides a comprehensive range of supports covering capital investment, research and development, marketing and promotion, and human resources.  The overall objective of the sub-programme, which is aimed at both large and small enterprises, is to build a competitive food industry which will generate national wealth and employment while helping to sustain rural economies.  The sub-programme forms part of the operational programme for industrial development.  Food companies can also avail of a number of other transectoral measures in the operational programme.</P>
      <P>An Bord Bia has responsibility for the marketing and promotion element of the food sub-programme.

      <P>It is not possible to apply the CSO farm size data to its estimate of income as the CSO income figures relate to aggregate farm income only. However, Teagasc's national farm survey for 1996 found average direct payments of £6,471 among all farms surveyed, while the 14 per cent of farms over 50 hectares received an average payment of £15,107.</P>
      <P>A recent study, based on Teagasc's 1995 national farm survey, was carried out by Trinity College Dublin on the distribution of direct income payments in Irish agriculture.  The findings of this study were that, in 1995, 43 per cent of total direct payments were made to the 14 per cent of farms with an average farm size greater than 50 hectares.</P>
      <P>It must be acknowledged that the nature of the CAP reform payments is such that farmers with more livestock or arable area will receive more payments.  However, I have made efforts to target other payments towards lower income farmers.</P>
      <P>Teagasc's national farm survey has identified headage as the payment most targeted at low income farmers in disadvantaged areas.  I announced recently that, from 1998 onwards, I intend to introduce a ceiling of £3,024 on headage payments.  This should further improve the targeting of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition, I will be starting discussions with the farming organisations very soon, with the aim of drawing up a new and tightly focused scheme of installation aid for young farmers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the necessity to ensure that only clean cattle are presented for slaughter.  Therefore, I intend shortly to sign regulations to extend the grounds under which a veterinary inspector may declare an animal to be unfit for slaughter for human consumption to include the condition of the hide of an animal.</P>
      <P>Under the criteria drawn up to implement the legislation, cattle will be scored into five categories based on the cleanliness of the hide ranging from category one (Ideal) to category five (Reject).  The carcase dressing procedures which will apply are being circulated to the Department's staff at the meat plants and to factory management &mdash; the position in regard to category five is that the cattle will be rejected for slaughter and returned to their premises of origin.  This issue has been discussed with representatives of the meat processors and with the farm organisations.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce a grant scheme to provide equipment and to train meat plant staff. The operation of good hygiene practices is a fundamental requirement for the operation of a meat processing plant both in the context of public health and marketability of the product and the appropriate training of staff is a matter for the industry itself.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with EU Regulations it is necessary to obtain the Commission's prior approval for all schemes for agrimonetary compensation whether the funding comes from the EU budget or the national Exchequer.  The figures of £50 per head for eligible cattle and £17 million for the beef sector were announced by my predecessor despite the fact that such approval had not been obtained by him.</P>
      <P>The compensation to be paid for cattle must, under EU regulations, relate to actual losses to producers resulting directly from the revaluations of the Irish green £ alone and not from any other factor.  On this basis the Commission has given approval for payment of approximately IR£41 per head on eligible steers, young bulls and heifers disposed of between 1 April and 10 June 1997.  A top-up of £2 per head of the special beef premium in respect of animals which qualified for the 22-month premium in 1996 has also been approved.  Payments have now commenced and will be completed by the end of this month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended that certain changes to the disadvantaged areas' headage schemes, which form part of the Partnership 2000 agreement will come into effect in 1998.  The changes are as follows: A ceiling of £3,024 per applicant will apply; the eligibility criteria for receipt of the high (£84) rate of grant for beef cows under the cattle headage scheme in more severely handicapped areas and the beef cow scheme in less severely handicapped areas will be brought into line with the eligibility criteria for suckler cows under the suckler cow premium scheme.  This change will lead to a streamlining and simplification of the scheme.  Cross-compliance between the ewe premium rural world premium and sheep headage schemes and environment requirements will apply in certain areas.  This means that sheep farmers with commonage land in areas classified as overgrazed including such commonages in areas designated by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands as special areas of conservation as required under the EU Habitats Directive, will be required to participate in an approved agri-environment programme to qualify for ewe premium rural world premium or sheep headage payments.  The areas regarded as overgrazed <Col N="1009" /> are in commonages in some certain district electoral divisions in certain counties along the west coast.  The application of these cross-compliance measures will be dependent upon the introducton of a new rural environment protection scheme (REPS) for the areas concerned in 1998.  Negotiations on the introduction of this package are ongoing at present.</P>
      <P>The disadvantaged areas' headage schemes are 65 per cent co-financed by the EU.  Such co-funding cannot be made available in respect of farmers who are in receipt of a non-means tested pension. Certain farmers who have contributed to the PRSI scheme for the self-employed introduced by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in 1988, will qualify for a contributory old age pension if they reach 66 years by 1 January 1998.  Headage payments to such farmers cannot be co-funded by the EU.  While headage payments will continue to be made to such farmers it is necessary for my Department to identify all farmers, both under and over 66 years of age, who are in receipt of a pension other than a means tested pension in order that the payments made to them are not included for co-financing by the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that formal commitment to have compensatory headage payments independently evaluated was entered into by my Department as part of negotiations in 1994 on the Structural Funds leading up to the approval of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry (OPARDF). The EU Commission's attitude was that the funds allocated to the measures represented too high a percentage (62 per cent) of the overall allocation to the structural improvement and rural development element of the operational programme.</P>
      <P>The consultants who carried out the evaluation came up with a number of broad recommendations and, following consideration of their report, the proposals as outlined by me earlier for amendment to the schemes were put to the EU Commission.  Therefore, the changes made are part of that process.</P>

      <P>Components of Votes 10, 25, 30 and 31 constitute the figure of £89 million referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of Vote 31 (Agriculture and Food), a difference of some £51 million between the estimated 1997 out-turn and the 1998 estimate figures for net non-capital supply services is indicated. However, the Abridged Estimates published in November were pre-budget and as <Col N="1010" /> such the 1998 Estimate allocations for my Department need to be viewed in the context of substantial additional funds provided through a Supplementary Estimate for 1997 and the changes announced in the 1998 budget which result in 1997 out-turns being likely to exceed the 1998 estimate in a number of subheads e.g. over £37 million in respect of subhead M4, (Aids to Farmers in Certain Less Favoured Areas); £24.5 million in respect of subhead J6, (Agrimonetary Compensation); and over £4.25 million in respect of subhead C2, (Bovine TB and Brucellosis Eradication).</P>
    <P>As substantial funds were paid out in the early years of the operational programme, the available Structural Funds for the remaining two years of the programme have been diminished.  In addition, the strengthening of the IR£ against the ECU has impacted negatively on the amount of funding available.</P>
    <P>The 1998 budget shows and the Revised Estimates, when published, will underline the Government's commitment to farmers, the rural community and all sectors of society.</P>

      <P>My Department carries out on-farm inspections under the ewe premium and other premium and headage schemes as required under the relevant EU regulations.  In so far as the 1997 ewe premium scheme is concerned those on-farm inspections were carried out in the period January-April 1997 coinciding with the retention period <Col N="1011" /> under the scheme.  For 1997 my Department was able to increase the number of inspection visits made without notification to the farmer due to the availability of detailed information on the location of animals provided by the land parcel identification system.  While this resulted in some increase in the number of irregularities detected the overall percentage is quite small and the findings would not support suggestions of widespread fraud or abuse of the scheme.  My Department has not been involved in any other investigations relating to the ewe premium scheme in the meantime. Inspections under the 1998 ewe premium scheme are scheduled to commence shortly and the number of unannounced inspections will be increased.</P>

      <P>Following the BSE crisis in 1996 a number of measures were agreed at EU level to correct the imbalance between production and consumption in the beef market.  One of the measures agreed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in October 1996 involved a temporary reduction in the special beef premium quota, in order to eliminate an incentive to increase cattle numbers.  The national ceiling in Ireland was reduced from 1,286,521 premium rights to 1,002,458 rights.  The reduction applies for 1997 and 1998.</P>
      <P>While final figures on the number of valid applications for the 1997 special beef premium are not yet available, it is likely that, on the basis of current estimates, the national ceiling will be exceeded by about 10 per cent.  EU Regulations provide for a <i>pro rata</i> reduction in payments to be made across all eligible animals in proportion to the level of overshoot of the national quota.</P>
      <P>There are no provisions in the EU regulations governing the scheme for member states to compensate for any loss of premium payments in the event of the national quota being exceeded.</P>

      <P>The position is that under EU regulations governing the bovine premium schemes payments cannot commence until 1 November each year and even then only a 60 per cent advance payment can be made.  The regulations provide that balancing payments must be made by 30 June of the year following the year of application.  There is a tolerance representing 4 per cent of the total amount paid by 30 June which can be used to make payments outside the 30 June deadline in duly justified exceptional circumstances.  Generally, payments made after 30 June of the year following the year of application and which do not come within the 4 per cent tolerance are not funded by the EU and any such payments must be funded totally by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The regulations do not provide for the payment of interest in respect of payments made outside the deadline of 30 June of the year following the year of application.</P>
      <P>In so far as the disadvantaged areas' headage scheme payments are concerned these are 65 per cent co-financed by the EU but the regulations do not stipulate a payment deadline.  Every effort is made to ensure that full payment is made in eligible cases in the year of application.</P>
      <P>Regardless of the EU deadlines for payment my Department has set out certain target dates for making these payments in the Charter of Rights for Farmers.  Different payment target dates apply to the various schemes.  Under the disadvantaged areas' headage schemes the target is to make full payment in the year of application and to make payments in all eligible cases by 31 October.  Under the suckler cow premium scheme the target is to commence advance payments on 1 November and, where the six months' retention period is completed by 30 November, to make all eligible advance payments by 31 December. Under the special beef premium scheme the target is to commence advance payments on 1 November and, where the two month retention period is completed by 1 November, to make all eligible advance payments by 31 December. Under the arable aid scheme the target is to commence payments on 16 October and to have all eligible applications paid by 31 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the disadvantaged areas' schemes, where initially there were some unavoidable delays linked to difficulties associated with area <Col N="1016" /> aid applications, my Department is on target to meet the payment deadlines set down in the Charter of Rights for Farmers.  Indeed, under the EU arable aid scheme, the target has been significantly surpassed.  In so far as the disadvantaged areas' schemes are concerned some 40 per cent of eligible applicants were paid by 31 October.  To date 92 per cent of sheep headage applicants have been paid and over 88 per cent of cattle headage applicants have been paid.  Payments are continuing to be made under all of the schemes and by 31 December all eligible applicants should have received payment.  Those cases not paid by that date will be a minority of problem cases which may take some time to resolve with the farmers concerned.  In fact the percentage of applicants paid at this stage is greater than the percentage paid at 31 December 1996 under the 1996 schemes.</P>
    <P>To date this year my Department has made 1.409 million payments valued at almost £733 million under the various EU livestock and arable aid schemes.  Some 903,136 of these payments valued at £48 million represent payments under the 1997 schemes including payments made under the various EU BSE and agrimonetary compensation schemes.  At present payments valued at £15 million are issuing to farmers under a nationally funded agrimonetary compensation package.</P>

      <P>Pollution of waterways can arise from various sources, including domestic, industrial and agricultural.  Nutrient management planning, which involves the recycling of farm wastes, on the farm and the correlation of fertiliser usage, especiallly phosphates and nitrates, with cropping requirements, aims to reduce the risk of pollution from agriculture.</P>
      <P>The rural environment protection scheme (REPS) has a major role to play in the promotion of nutrient management planning.  One of the more important measures of REPS is the requirement to prepare a waste management, liming and fertilisation plan for the farm.  This measure is designed to protect the quality of our waterways by minimising nutrient losses from agriculture.  Over 30,000 farmers have joined the scheme from 1994 to date and I envisage that our target of 43,000 farmers in the scheme will be achieved by 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A code of good practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates was published jointly in July 1996 by my Department and the Department of <Col N="1017" /> the Environment and Local Government.  This code prescribes methods to prevent or minimise the pollution of waters from nitrates by adopting certain farm waste and nutrient management techniques in the storage of organic wastes, silage, dungstead and farmyard manure and soiled water.</P>
    <P>Substantial assistance has been provided by my Department in recent years in grant-aid for investment in pollution control facilities under the control of farm pollution scheme and the farm improvement programme.</P>
    <P>In addition to grant aid for investment in farm pollution works, improved capital allowances for investment in controlling pollution on farms were introduced in the 1997 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has overall responsibility for implementation of legislation for the protection of the environment.  In this area, the Waste Management Act, 1996, empowers local authorities to take action where pollution of waterways is being caused by overuse of fertilisers.</P>

      <P>The Leader programme which operates throughout the country provides an opportunity for local groups and communities to involve themselves directly in the development of their own areas.

      <P>The position is that the newspaper article in question refers to comments made by a representative of Sheikh Mohammed to the effect that he might pull out of racing in Britain if prize-money there is not raised over the next five years to a level that will produce a satisfactory return on his investment.  No indication has been given that the Sheikh or his family intend to downscale their bloodstock interests in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Irish Horseracing Authority is currently in the process of implementing its strategic plan for the development of the Irish thoroughbred racing industry, 1997-2001.  In section 12 of that plan, the authority specifically deals with the position of owners and prize-money.  It acknowledges that it is vital for the continued well-being of racing that prize-money should be substantially increased and commits itself to increasing prize-money progressively over the period of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> In this regard, I would like to point out that a grant in aid to the Irish Horseracing Authority of £10 million has been provided in the 1998 Estimates to support horseracing including increased prize-money.  This is a very generous allocation when compared with the amounts provided in previous years, particularly in years prior to 1990 when the allocation was nil.  I am satisfied that the authority will continue to keep the situation under active review to ensure the protection of the interests, including employment, of the Irish horseracing industry.</P>

    <P>The quota rights released for the period of the <Col N="1022" /> scheme are held by the owner but not used for the duration of the scheme, subject to the provisions of EU Quota Regulations.  I would emphasise that the destocking payment in both of these cases applies only to quota rights owned.  It is not possible to compensate applicants for destocking on quota not owned by them but subject to lease because under the EU quota regulations such rights may only be leased for a maximum period of three years after which they must be exercised by the owner for two years.</P>

      <P>Discussions at the World Trade Organisation's first Ministerial Conference in December 1996 resulted in an agreement on trade in information technology products being adopted by a number of WTO Members including the European Union, Japan and the US.  The agreement, which has been driven by industry itself, provides for the elimination of customs duties and other charges on certain information technology products by the year 2000 and covers 93 per cent of world trade in such products.  The first rate reductions came into effect on 1 July this year with further reductions scheduled for 1 January of each subsequent year.</P>
      <P>The information technology agreement covers nearly US$600 billion in world trade and will mean lower prices for consumers and fewer barriers to the spread of technology that is critical to the development of all economies.  At present, negotiations are continuing on the inclusion of additional information technology products in the agreement and on the reduction or elimination of non-tariff measures in the sector.</P>

In the course of the implementation of the plan all hardware and software in use in the Department will be examined and tested for Year 2000 compliance.  The Department is inventorising its software with a view to deciding the elements which need to be replaced, upgraded or amended to ensure Year 2000 compliance.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 80 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>Most of the software in use in my Department is in the form of proprietary applications programmed by third parties.  Most of this is general office software such as word processors, spreadsheets, database applications etc, with which the Deputy is no doubt familiar.  My Department is not aware of the number of lines of code in each of these applications and would not regard such information as being necessary to deal with issues arising from the onset of the Year 2000.</P>
      <P>In dealing with applications programme by third parties, the question of examining each line of code does not arise.  My Department is instead contacting software vendors to confirm that their products are compatible and seeking updated versions of software where compatibility cannot be guaranteed.  The provision of updated software to address customer problems is a normal feature of the software industry and I am assured that while investigations are still ongoing there will, on current evidence, be no undue difficulty in my Department meeting the Year 2000 deadline.</P>
      <P>There are two specific cases where the Department has heavily customised a third party application. This has involved a total of approximately 100,000 &mdash; 120,000 lines of code.  In one case it has already been established that Year 2000 issues are not a problem.  Investigation is continuing in the other case but initial indications are that any problems are likely to be relatively minor.</P>
      <P>Until investigations with sofeware vendors are complete my Department is not in a position to finalise the costs involved in ensuring that the third party application software which it uses is compatible with the Year 2000.  However, initial indications are that this will be relatively low and will mainly relate to application testing.</P>
      <P>One division of the Department makes use of a large quantity of software written in-house (about 400,000 lines of code).  Some of this includes 2digit year codes.  A Year-2000 Compliance Plan has been prepared and work has begun on implementing the plan.  It is expected that modification of the code to make it Year-2000 compliant will be complete by the end of 1998.  The cost of modification (including the cost of staff time) is estimated at £110,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Centre for Management and Organisational Development of the Department of Finance (CMOD) is co-ordinating all necessary changes in respect of the euro to systems which are common to more than one Department.  All of the significantly affected computer systems in my Department fall into this category.  The costs of <Col N="1029" /> any necessary changes to these systems have not yet been fully quantified.  I understand, however, from CMOD that these are unlikely to be significant.</P>
    <P>With respect to the aspects of the Deputy's question which relate to agencies under my aegis, these matters are day-to-day operational ones which fall within the remit of the individual State agencies, and in which I as Minister have no function beyond monitoring the existence of appropriate arrangements.</P>

      <P>The details sought by the Deputy in relation to masts are matters for the companies involved and, where appropriate, the Garda authorities. As such, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on these matters.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of introducing legislation, any proposals concerning the siting of masts would be the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in the context of any planning legislation he might wish to introduce.</P>
      <P>The operation of masts is already covered in the general provisions contained in licences issued to operators pursuant to the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926 to 1988 and which are the responsibility of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.  Although I would have a consent role in relation to the final adoption of any such regulations, the initiative in relation to their introduction rests entirely with the director.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 83, 84 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the Department and the Defence Forces have invested significant resources in upgrading computer systems in the main business areas such as payroll, financial management, inventory management and procurement.</P>
      <P>While this investment was largely driven by business needs, the opportunity was taken to identify and plan the replacement or upgrading of systems which would not meet euro requirements, or systems which were not century compliant e.g. those using two digit year codes.  As a result many of the systems in use are already euro or century compliant.  A compliance audit of the remaining systems will be completed in 1998.</P>
      <P>The Department and the Defence Forces are confident that full compliance will be achieved in the lifetime of the current IT investment programme which runs to 1999.</P>
      <P>Given that the investment programme is largely driven by business as distinct from euro or Year 2000 needs, the Department has not calculated conversion costs <i>per se.</i> It might be of some assistance, however, to mention that total planned IT expenditure, capital and current, for the period 1997 to 1999, inclusive, is £9.3 million and this is expected to meet all IT needs, including the costs of any additional conversion which may be required.</P>

      <P>I have obtained the agreement of the Minister for Finance to draw up a new more tightly focused scheme of installation aid to be targeted towards smaller farmers.

My Department will initiate discussions in the near future with the farm organisations and the revised scheme will subsequently be submitted to the Minister for Finance for agreement.</P>
      <P>In the budget I secured the provision of £3.5 million for 1998 for the scheme of installation aid for young farmers to enable the remaining applications which had been received in my Department when the scheme was suspended on 7 August 1997 to be processed and to ensure that outstanding payments will issue as soon as possible in 1998.</P>

      <P>In accordance with my Department's policy, the herd was depopulated and the carcases were rendered into meat and bone meal which will be destroyed.  In follow-up investigations, a further case of BSE was confirmed in a cohort animal.</P>
      <P>Prior to August 1997 one clinical case of Johne's disease was diagnosed in this herd in an imported animal.  In addition six further animals were removed from the herd on veterinary advice as a precautionary measure.</P>
      <P>Teagasc is currently in the process of identifying replacement cattle for Moorepark so as to continue research work at the location.  I understand that it is following veterinary advice identifying reliable sources in order to minimise the risk of introducing disease to this farm.</P>

    <P>*NOTE: It should be noted that 60 per cent advance payments were made in respect of the 1997 suckler cow and special beef premia schemes.  By special derogation 80 per cent advance payments were made in respect of these schemes in 1996.  Consequently, the carry over into 1997 in respect of 1996 suckler cow and special beef premia schemes was only 20 per cent of total premium.  As a result the total amount payable under these schemes in 1997 would be less than in 1996.  Furthermore the combined first and second instalments payable under the 1997 ewe premium scheme is £2.63 per animal less than the equivalent instalments payable under the 1996 scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100, 101 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the centre for management and organisation development of the Department of Finance, my Department has completed a Year 2000 impact assessment and compliance plan and has also set up a Year 2000 Project Board.  It is estimated that the net cost of converting and testing computer programmes for the Year 2000 problem in my Department will amount to £1.57 million.  There are 48 computer systems within my Department which contain approximately seven million lines of code.  My Department has been liaising with each of the agencies under its aegis to ensure that they will be Year 2000 compliant.  These agencies are currently in the process of compiling details of the effort involved in their case and will shortly submit a report to my Department.  However, I am not currently in a position to report on the number of lines of code in use within the agencies under my control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Year 2000 Compliance Plan identifies that my Department has 28 systems that currently use a two digit year code.  The remaining 20 computer systems use a four digit year code. <Col N="1036" /> With regard to systems using a two digit year code, a schedule has been drafted for the conversion of these systems to process and store the year element of dates in four digits.  The conversion work is targeted for completion by early 1999.</P>
    <P>With regard to the conversion costs from the punt to the euro, the costings are not yet available.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EU regulations it is necessary to obtain the Commission's prior approval for all schemes for agrimonetary compensation whether the funding comes from the EU budget or the national Exchequer.  The figures of £50 per head for eligible cattle and £17 million for the beef sector were announced by my predecessor despite the fact that such approval had not been obtained by him.</P>
      <P>The compensation to be paid for cattle must, under EU regulations, relate to actual losses to producers resulting directly from the revaluations of the Irish green pound alone and not from any other factor.  On this basis the Commission has given me its approval for payment of approximately IR£41 per head on eligible steers, young bulls and heifers disposed of between 1 April and 10 June 1997.  A top-up of £2 per head of the special beef premium in respect of animals which qualified for the 22 month premium in 1996 has also been approved.  Payments have now commenced and will be completed by the end of this month.</P>

      <P>The information requested is outlined in the following table together with a table showing the percentage paid under the 1997 schemes at 18 December 1997 and the comparable percentage paid at the same time in 1996 in respect of the equivalent 1996 schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out that in the period since 1 Janaury 1997 some £733 million has been paid to farmers under the various headage premia and arable aid schemes of which over £480 million relates to payments made under the 1997 schemes.  To date this year some 1.409 million <Col N="1037" /> payments have been made of which 903,136 represent payments under the 1997 schemes, including payments made under the various EU BSE and agrimonetary compensation schemes.</P>
    <P>Payments under the 1997 disadvantaged areas headage schemes commenced on 28 September 1997 and to date over £109.7 million has been paid.  Payments under the 1997 arable aid scheme commenced on 16 October (the earliest possible commencement date under EU regulations) and some £85 million was paid to 94 per cent of applicants within one week of commencement of payments. The current position is that over £90.8 million has been paid to 99 per cent of applicants.</P>
    <P>Payments under the 1997 special beef premium and suckler cow premium schemes commenced on 1 November and 3 November respectively. The EU regulations provide that these payments cannot commence until 1 November and that only 60 per cent of entitlement can be paid.  To date over £131.7 million has been paid under these schemes.</P>
    <P>Payments are continuing to issue to farmers under all premiums and headage schemes.  I am making every effort to ensure that remaining eligible applicants under all of these schemes will be paid by Christmas and that only real problem cases will remain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 105 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the current difficulties facing the beef sector.</P>
      <P>While the underlying problem in the cattle sector can be primarily attributed to the fall in beef consumption in the EU as a result of the BSE scare in 1996, the difficult market situation has been exacerbated in recent weeks by the disruption of Irish imports into the UK and the recent announcements in relation to BSE and bone-in beef.  The British market is the single most important market for Irish beef and any disruption to that trade creates immediate and substantial difficulties for the beef sector in Ireland. Every effort is being made to allow unimpeded access of Irish beef into the UK market.  The matter has been raised bilaterally with the British authorities at all levels, including at prime ministerial level.  I myself met the British Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Jack Cunningham, in London on 4 December and again on 15-16 December in Brussels.  I also raised the matter at the meeting of the Council of Ministers this week in Brussels, where I apprised the Commission and my counterparts in other member states of the difficulties facing the Irish beef industry.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these representations have resulted in firmer action being taken by the UK authorities against protesters and in greater protection being afforded to Irish hauliers.  The position is that our hauliers are now succeeding in delivering their consignments unimpeded to their intended destinations.  However, the campaign by British farmers asking British consumers to buy their own beef is a matter of concern and my Department in conjunction with An Bord Bia are monitoring the situation closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the difficult market situation, I have made strong representations to the European Commission for effective and flexible intervention arrangements to underpin market prices. The decision last week by the Beef Management Committee to accept 2,330 tonnes of beef into intervention between now and mid-January is a clear indication of the success of our efforts in this regard.  This tender will require 7,000 steers at prices ranging between 83 and 87p/lb for the <Col N="1039" /> R3 grade and should help to stabilise the market. I am disappointed that the Commission has not accepted my request that grade 04 steers should continue to be eligible for intervention for the first quarter of 1998.  I will, however, continue to press the Commission for the implementation of effective intervention arrangements which are capable of supporting the market in a way that provides reasonable prices for producers.  Finally, I should point out that the payment of the deseasonalisation slaughter premium, which is worth over £60 per head, will be an important factor in underpinning the incomes of producers and in particular winter finishers at this time.</P>

      <P>All recent IT development in my Department has taken account of Year 2000 requirements and makes use of four digit year codes in its date formats. Some older computer applications still use two digit year codes and these were identified in an exercise conducted earlier this year, which resulted in the production of a Year 2000 Compliance Plan for the Department.  The plan quantified the effort involved in making such software Year 2000 compliant and work has already commenced on this project.  It is anticipated that the necessary remedial work will be completed by early 1999.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, along with all Government Departments, my Department will be providing quarterly progress reports to the Interdepartmental Year 2000 Monitoring Committee, which was recently established to oversee the achievement of Year 2000 compliance for IT systems and other office equipment in the Civil Service.  The committee, which is chaired by my Department, comprises twelve members, eight civil servants and four members appointed by me from the private sector, and will report quarterly to Government on progress on this matter.</P>

      <P>This information is not recorded by my Department, <Col N="1044" /> as it has no relevance to the way in which its IT services are provided.  Software development is conducted almost exclusively through the medium of Fourth Generation Languages (4GLs) and operated on PC networks, where lines of code are not a yardstick by which the speed or efficiency of the software is measured.  The same holds true for the other offices for which I am responsible, with the exception of the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of Public Works, where some such information is recorded for statistical purposes.</P>
      <P>In preparing its Year 2000 Compliance Plan earlier this year, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners identified 1,400 mainframe programmes, totalling 2.5 million lines of code, which were not Year 2000 compliant.  A further 1,650 programmes are compliant.  The Office of Public Works has an estimated 286,000 lines of non-compliant code.  Work is under way in both offices to ensure full compliance by 1999, as per a Government decision of 25 September 1997 on this subject.</P>

      <P>The estimated cost of converting and testing computer software, to ensure Year 2000 compliance, in my Department and the other Government offices for which I am responsible, is shown below.  The figures quoted are those returned earlier this year to my Department by the offices concerned, on foot of Finance Circular 17/97, which obliged all Departments and offices to produce a plan to achieve Year 2000 compliance for their IT systems by 1 January 1999.  The figures reflect only those costs which would not otherwise be incurred were it not for the need for Year 2000 compliance.  They do not, therefore, include the cost of compliance which will be achieved in the normal course of events by the implementation of Departments' ongoing IT strategies, e.g. routine replacement of obsolete equipment. <Col N="1046" /></P>

      <P>My Department, in consultation and agreement with staff interests, recently revised and consolidated the arrangements concerning special leave of absence for overseas development work, with particular reference to public service volunteers on special leave to work with the Agency for Personal Services Overseas (APSO).  This was done primarily to facilitate the Department of Foreign Affairs in the establishment of a &ldquo;Rapid Response Register&rdquo;, that is, a list of volunteers, mainly in the health services, who will be identified by APSO as suitable for rapid deployment in the event of a humanitarian emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> In general, a civil servant may be granted special leave without pay for up to a total of five years for overseas development work.  If the question of special leave with pay were to arise, it would normally only be granted on the basis of full recoupment to the employing Department of the officer's salary, employer's PRSI and superannuation costs.</P>
    <P>On return from special leave for overseas development work, the officer may, if the Head of the Department thinks fit, be placed on the salary scale point which s/he would have reached by incremental progression had s/he not taken special leave.</P>
    <P>An officer who is granted special leave for voluntary service abroad with APSO and who, at the time of assignment, is serving in a pensionable capacity can have such service abroad reckoned for superannuation purposes on a limited basis provided the officer is approved and funded as a volunteer development worker by APSO, and is working in a developing country, as defined.  If the conditions are satisfied, the officer is entitled to have up to a maximum of three years of volunteer service given after 1 January 1995 reckoned as pensionable service for all purposes, where a benefit becomes payable by reference to his-her actual service.  Normally, volunteer service assignments of less than six months will not be reckonable but where an officer on the Rapid Response Register has a series of short-term assignments overseas, which exceed six months in aggregate over a three year period, all such service may be reckoned.</P>
    <P>The arrangements provide that, where an officer is entitled to have a period of volunteer service reckoned for superannuation purposes, APSO makes the appropriate superannuation contributions direct to the employing Department. If appropriate, periods of special leave not covered by these arrangements may be dealt with under the existing scheme for the purchase of notional service for superannuation purposes, with the individual officer responsible for meeting the cost of purchase of the notional service involved.</P>
    <P>My Department has communicated the detailed provisions and conditions relating to the above arrangements to all Government Departments and offices which, as the arrangements extend to many other areas of the public sector, have been requested to bring the detailed arrangements to the attention of all bodies under their aegis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 137 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>My Department and the agencies under my remit are currently considering the Year 2000 and euro issue and part of this programme is to identify, where relevant, the number of lines of code and the programmes requiring change or replacement. In the context of the health services the bulk of the software is provided through third party packages who are the owners of the source code and who will provide the upgrade software for Year 2000 compliance.</P>
      <P>The above process is ongoing and the full costs have yet to be identified.  A total of £14 million for 1998, representing a 100 per cent increase over 1997, has been allocated in the Estimates for capital information systems services in the health agencies.  Resolving Year 2000 problems and euro compliance will be given a high priority in the allocation of these funds.  The estimated cost of compliance internally in my Department is not significant in this context.</P>
      <P>Computer programmes recently developed in my Department use a four digit year code.  It is planned that non compliant elements and third party products will be replaced or upgraded.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is some public concern about possible adverse health effects from exposure to radiation emissions from transmitter masts associated with mobile phone systems.  All significant research in this area is monitored by the Department of Public Enterprise with which my Department liaises regarding the human health aspects.  The general body of scientific evidence to date has not established a definite link between this form of radiation and ill health. However, research and studies in this area are carried out on an ongoing basis and medical officers in my Department keep themselves informed of developments.  Should conclusive evidence emerge that this form of radiation is causing an unacceptable public health risk then appropriate remedial measures will have to be put in place.</P>
      <P>Telecommunications companies operating here are licensed by the Department of Public Enterprise.  Companies are required to operate within emission limits set by the International Radiation Protection Association.  Measurements taken here show that exposure levels are well within the recommended safety levels.</P>
      <P>The office of Director of Telecommunications Regulation was established earlier this year by the Minister for Public Enterprise.  Its function is to ensure that licensed operators of telecommunications systems comply with all the conditions of their licence, including emission standards. Emissions are to be monitored on a regular and nationwide basis.</P>
      <P>Early next year my Department will be cosponsoring with the Department of Public Enterprise a conference on health issues and the telecommunications infrastructure.  A wide range of health and technical matters will be discussed.</P>

      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996 sets out the requirements for the development of these services, including speech and language therapy services.  As recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities are being put in place in each of the health boards.  One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees will be to advise the chief executive officer of each board on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services.  An allocation of £3 million has been provided in the budget for the development of these services in 1998.  The question of allocating funds for the provision of additional speech and language therapist posts will be considered by each health board in consultation with the co-ordinating committee.</P>
      <P>The total allocation of additional funds to physical and sensory disability services in 1998 will be £8.4 million when the Estimates provision and capital allocation are taken into account.</P>

While it is difficult to estimate all the costs of necessary remedial measures &mdash; including testing &mdash; until further preparatory and exploratory work is undertaken, current estimates suggest that a figure of around £200,000 should suffice; this estimate includes provision for issues relating to the introduction of the euro but does not include the cost of time spent on this work by departmental staff.  Such corrective measures as are necessary will be put in place in sufficient time to allow systems to perform properly in the Year 2000 and subsequently.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would take considerable time to establish the exact number of lines of computer code in use in my Department. It should be noted, in the context of the Year 2000 problem, that the number of lines of code in use is not a useful measure of the effort required to resolve it.  For example, remedial measures for computer code written in COBOL programming language require far greater effort than for 4th Generation Language code.</P>
      <P>There are two COBOL systems in use in my Department.  The principal COBOL system affected by the Year 2000 problem is the National Vehicle File.  A new national vehicle and driver file system has been developed, and is being tested at present.  The new system is expected to be operational in my Department's Vehicle Registration Unit in 1998.  The other COBOL system for which the Year 2000 problem arises to a significant degree is the housing grants system. Work on this system is ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question in respect of a two digit year code applies to the majority of computer programmes in use in my Department.  Again, this must be viewed in the context of the underlying computer language being used.  In the case of computer programmes <Col N="1056" /> written in COBOL, the two digit year code must be examined, line by line, and appropriate changes made so that four digit year dates can be recognised and processed correctly.  In the case of 4th Generation Language code, a general upgrade of the software will usually enable four digit year dates to be processed and, where required, will allow two digit year dates to be assigned to a correct range of years.</P>
    <P>Bodies under the aegis of my Department have been asked to examine the impact of the Year 2000 issue on their IT systems, and to take such steps as are necessary to ensure that their systems are year 2000 compliant.</P>

      <Quest>if he will extend child benefit to twins where both are going through full-time education after the age of 18 in view of the fact that this is a particularly difficult commitment for twins.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children, until they reach the age of 19, who are in full-time education, or who are physically or mentally challenged.  There is no provision for payments under the scheme to any children beyond that age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the 1998 budget, which was announced recently, provision was made for a range of enhancements to the child benefit scheme.  For instance, child benefit will be increased by £1.50 per child per month for the first two children and by £3 per child for the third and subsequent children, thus bringing the <Col N="1057" /> lower rate up to £31.50 and the higher rate up to £42.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the additional costs faced by the parents of twins, the 1998 budget also provides for the payment of child benefit at 150 per cent of the normal monthly rate.  The existing grant of £500 which is paid on the birth of twins, and again when the twins reach the ages of four and 12 respectively, will, of course, also continue to be payable.</P>
    <P>The enhancements to the child benefit scheme provided for in the 1998 budget will take effect from next September and will cost £28.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Child benefit remains one of our most effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families most in need.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes.  As it is not taxable, and is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment or assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc., it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.  I will continue to seek to develop and enhance the scheme as resources permit and the Deputy's proposal will receive due consideration in that context.</P>

      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions, or 24 in the case of a retirement pension, registered since January 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.  The yearly average condition was reduced to ten contributions for the new <i>pro-rata</i> old age contributory pension which came into force with effect from 21 November last.  To qualify a person with a yearly average of between ten and 19 must have 260 rather than 156 paid contributions.</P>
      <P>A mixed insurance <i>pro-rata</i> old age (contributory) and retirement pension was introduced with effect from 28 November 1991 for people with a mixture of full rate and modified rate PRSI and is payable subject, of course, to the person satisfying the specified qualification criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable &mdash; national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions.  These <Col N="1058" /> gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
    <P>The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of this pension.  However, as a concession and to enable persons reaching pension age at that time to qualify immediately for a contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1953 were taken into account in calculating a person's entitlement to pension.  These transitional arrangements operated until 1973.  From that date contributions paid prior to 1953 were no longer counted for the purposes of the satisfying of the yearly average test.</P>
    <P>However, social insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account for old age contributory pension and mixed insurance <i>pro-rata</i> pensions in satisfying the first two conditions, set out in the first paragraph above, but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>

      <P>The persons concerned were employed on a community employment scheme up to 21 November 1997.  While employed on the scheme they were, on foot of provisions made in April 1996, insured at the full Class A rate of PRSI and on their return to the live register, they qualified for unemployment benefit at the full rate rather than long-term unemployment assistance.  A Christmas bonus is payable only with long-term social welfare payments and is not payable with unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I recognise the difficulties faced by community employment workers who requalify for unemployment benefit when their community employment period finishes, I cannot introduce special arrangements for them without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients.  Any such arrangements would, accordingly, carry a very high cost and could only be considered in light of available resources. <Col N="1059" /></P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 163, 164 and 165 together.</P>
      <P>My Department carried out a Year 2000 impact assessment study during the period from October 1996 to February 1997.  A full inventory of computer hardware and software was undertaken and the software applications were examined to identify occurrences of two digit year codes in dates. The inventory showed that there are some 6.5 million lines of code contained in the Department's software applications.</P>
      <P>Applications developed in the 1980s use a two digit year field.  Later applications use a four digit field but these will require appropriate testing to ensure Year 2000 compliance.</P>
      <P>Based on the results of the impact study, the Department initiated in February 1997 a project to convert applications and to ensure Year 2000 compliance of all software and hardware. Additional resources such as equipment, staffing and external support are required for this project and in September 1997, the Government approved a special allocation of £8.5 million to cover these costs.</P>
      <P>The overall Year 2000 project is well under way.  The majority of the Department's IT development staff are engaged on the project at this stage and it is expected that the main conversions will be completed by the first quarter of 1999.  On 30 September, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance should instruct all Departments to ensure that all public bodies under their aegis are addressing their Year 2000 problems.</P>
    </Speaker>

All three agencies are examining the <Col N="1060" /> impact of year 2000 for their computer systems and the requirement to ensure they are compliant.</P>
    <P>Detailed planning and estimation of the effort involved in converting to the euro will begin during 1998.</P>

    <P>My Department has some systems which use older programming languages such as DBL.  The total number of lines of code exceeds 300,000 on these systems.  However, such systems are due for replacement as part of the ordinary maintenance <Col N="1061" /> and development of the Department's computer systems.  The new systems will cater for problems associated with the Year 2000.  Most systems are developed using PC based applications, where the estimates of the number of lines of computer code are not relevant.  My Department is currently involved in checking its computer systems to see whether two digit fields are in use.  Several systems have already been upgraded, and others will be completed as part of the ongoing maintenance of systems.  IT staff of my Department are actively involved in managing the conversions required to ensure compatability of software after 1999.  The cost of the conversions in the case of my Department has been estimated at some £50,000.  This matter is also under examination in the various bodies under the aegis of my Department but the total extent of the changes required and the costs arising have not yet been fully determined.</P>
    <P>The euro requirements are also under investigation, and a timetable has been drawn up for implementation.  The cost of this is being assessed at present and should be known by April 1998. My Department is working with other Government bodies on both euro and Year 2000 issues through various interdepartmental fora.</P>

      <P>There is an official patrol car allocated to Skerries Garda station and the Garda authorities inform me that this vehicle provides a 22 hour out of 24 hour Garda coverage of the area.  The district patrol car augments this patrolling as required.  There are five neighbourhood watch schemes and one community alert scheme in operation in the Skerries area.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that the local divisional officer is satisfied that the policing requirements of both Balbriggan and Skerries are being adequately met with the current deployment of resources.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 to 175, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>During 1997 my Department has been carrying out a fundamental review of its information technology needs.  One of the recommendations of this review, which has been accepted, is for a major replacement programme for out of date systems.  The underlying need to have IT systems which are Year 2000 compliant and can handle four digit date codes was one of the key underlying factors in the acceptance of the recommendation. A specific Year 2000 and euro compliance sub-project invloving external consultants is now under way.  The cost of this consultancy exercise will be approximately £20,000.  Its objectives are to compile a comprehensive inventory of all computer based systems and microchip controlled equipment; identify any elements which have specific date of currency dependencies; confirm that the systems replacement projects will address the vast majority of problems; make specific recommendations in terms of replace, repair or discard where other elements come to light; identify fallback positions should the primary strategy be delayed.</P>
      <P>The process of counting lines of existing code is not practicable in the context of the mixture of systems architectures either deployed or under development in my Department and its agencies. Although some of the mainframe based and Unix based systems do have line-counting utilities most of the systems do not.  Even if it could be done, it would not justify the cost involved as, in the light of the strategy above, it would make no contribution to solving the Year 2000 problem in this Department.</P>
      <P>Substantial systems development budgets are in place and systems with already identified Year 2000 problems are receiving first priority.  While this problem alone would have resulted in some of the systems being replaced anyway, it would not be appropriate to allocate the entire development cost to it as many other benefits will be accruing to the organisations concerned as a result of the major investment across all the organisations under my aegis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> Pending the delivery of the recommendations of the study referred to above, scheduled for next March, it is not possible to allocate costs or exact timescales to fixing this specific problem in areas where developments would not othewise be under way.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176, 177 and 178 together.</P>
      <P>There are an estimated 350,000 lines of programme code currently in use in my Department. Of this, approximately 96 per cent is already Year 2000 compliant, and the balance will be made compliant during 1998 by staff in my Department. Regarding the euro changeover, the Centre for Management and Organisation Development (CMOD) in the Department of Finance is co-ordinating all necessary changes to common financial systems in Departments, and accordingly, the cost to my Department will be minimal.</P>
      <P>Since my Department was established, it has been the practice to code all year fields in computer programmes with four rather than two digits.  In the case of the State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department, CERT has, I understand, advised that it has approximately 1.5 million lines of programme code, and it estimates expenditure of £75,000 to test and convert its systems for Year 2000 compliance and for the euro changeover.  Bord Fáilte advises that it has approximately 750,000 lines of code, but on the basis of the maintenance agreements in place with the relevant suppliers, does not anticipate at this stage any additional expenditure as a result of Year 2000 compliance or the euro changeover.</P>

      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year and included the allocation of 51 remedial teacher posts to primary schools with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for remedial tuition.</P>
      <P>I am at present reviewing provision across the special needs area, including current responses to remedial needs, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the context of any additional allocation of special supports which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181, 182 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently implementing a plan which will ensure that all of its computer systems are Year 2000 and euro compliant.  A detailed inventory of all of the Department's IT systems has been prepared and this identifies the applications requiring modification.</P>
      <P>The computer systems in use in my Department use a mixture of two digit and four digit year code formats depending on the particular application.  The staff responsible for developing and maintaining each computer system have been assigned the task of carrying out the necessary modification and other related work.  It is intended that the vast majority of work will be completed during 1998 with some remaining to be completed by summer 1999 at the latest.  Due to the nature of the different types of computer applications and computer platforms in my Department the number of lines of computer code in use is not readily available.  The compilation of such a statistic would not make any practical contribution to the task of achieving compliance which is now under way.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost involved in making the necessary software changes is £450,000, including software and contract staff costs, but excluding Department staff costs.</P>
      <P>In line with a Government decision, my Department has requested bodies under its aegis address their Year 2000 and euro problems.  The bodies concerned have been requested to furnish my Department with details of their plans in this regard by mid-January 1998.  Estimates of the costs involved are not available at present.</P>

Pupils from the area referred to by the Deputy are availing of school transport to the school in question.  These pupils live between 0.1 and 0.8 miles from the present pick-up point, and enjoy a service which is considered to be reasonable in the context of the overall operation of the school transport scheme.  In the circumstances, I regret that the present arrangement is the most that can be offered.</P>
