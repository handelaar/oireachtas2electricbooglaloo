      <P>It is proposed to take 24b &mdash; Technical Motion re. Revised Estimates for Public Services; No. 11 &mdash; Motion re.  Approval of Agreement between Ireland and the Czech Republic for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments; No. 12 &mdash; Motion re. Approval of the Dublin Convention; No. 13 &mdash; Revised Estimates for the Public Services [1997] [Votes 1 &mdash; 46]; No. 3 &mdash; ICC Bank (Amendment) Bill, 1997, Second and Remaining Stages.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 24b, 11 and 12 shall be decided without debate and any division demanded on No. 24b shall be taken forthwith; the Revised Estimates for the Public Services shall be moved together and decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair, and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith; the Second and Remaining Stages of No. 3 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 11.45 a.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments to the Bill, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance; and, in the event of the Bill concluding before 11.45 a.m., the sitting shall stand suspended until that time.</P>

      <P>Are the proposals for dealing with Nos. 24b, 11 and 12 satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 13, Revised Estimates for the Public Services, satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 3 satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There was meant to be a debate on the motion re. approval of the Dublin Convention. There are crucial issues of relevance and concern to Amnesty in relation to our treatment <Col N="730" /> of refugees.  It is inappropriate to pass this motion through Dáil Éireann without an adequate debate.  During the Seanad debate on the Refugee Bill, the Minister gave an assurance that there would be a special appeal mechanism in relation to Dublin Convention decisions.  Those procedures are not yet in place, neither are many of the procedures in the Refugee Act.  We are not in agreement with the proposed procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to ratify this convention.  It was signed by Ireland in 1990 but it has not yet been ratified.  It is important that the Dáil now do so.  The convention provides protections and procedures for dealing with the issue in a very fair way and we should not procrastinate further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to debate it. However, it is not appropriate that this motion be passed through the House without a debate.  The convention may well have to be ratified by Ireland but it should not go through without a debate.  There is no urgency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is even less relevant to talk about pending legislation.  One way or another the Taoiseach will attend an important summit on 16 and 17 June.  A number of important issues have to be dealt with at that summit which are fundamental to the future of the country.  Considering that the Dáil will not be sitting, will Fianna Fáil be consulted before final decisions are made on any important issues?  It is only right as we are dealing with issues such as neutrality, the EU budget, the Commission and many others.  We should be consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the normal course of events they would be discussed in the Dáil.  In recent general elections there was a moratorium on IDA announcements <Col N="731" /> of any kind.  I seek confirmation from the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is very good advice.  As a former Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach would know there is a convention in the Civil Service since its foundation that civil servants act in a particular way during general elections.  This is set down in guidelines of which the Minister of Finance is aware.  Given that there are now political people working in ministerial offices, will this convention continue?</P>

      <P>Following the Brink's-Allied raid on 2 February 1995 the Minister for Justice and the Government promised this House that they would introduce regulations to regulate the security industry as soon as possible.

      <P>The Deputy has raised a serious question, which the Government has been addressing.  There is a need for regulation of the security industry.  However, it is important to recognise that this industry has many types of manifestation where different types of regulation are appropriate.  The Government has established an independently chaired working group which includes the industry to draw up the necessary regulations.  This matter is of considerable importance and I thank Deputy O'Donoghue for raising it.</P>

      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach seemed to indicate on the Order of Business that it would be impossible for the Minister for Health to appear before a committee of the House.  The Minister for Health subsequently suggested that he would like to appear before the committee if he had time.  Will the Taoiseach provide this time before he pulls down the shutters on this Administration, or does accountability mean nothing, <Col N="734" /> particularly given that the man beside him has been a paragon of virtue in that regard for a long time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It falls to me to bring the final piece of legislation to this Dáil.  The legislation is not very earth shattering, but this is a historic moment for me and for the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICC Bank was established 64 years ago with the specific purpose of financing the development of an industrial base in Ireland.  The <Col N="748" /> bank has expanded steadily over the years and has enjoyed consistent profitability since its incorporation. Other than the £11.9 million invested by the State as equity over the years, and the State guarantee in respect of some of its borrowings, the bank has received no other assistance from the State.  The bank has grown through its own efforts to a stage where its balance sheet now amounts to more than £1,300 million.  It has paid regular and increasing dividends to the Exchequer over the past two decades.  In the past five years alone, dividend payments to the Exchequer amounted to almost £12 million while tax payments amounted to more than £14 million in the same period.  In 1996, the bank made operating profits of £13 million.  Of this, £2 million will be returned to the Exchequer in tax and £2.5 million in dividends.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the continued development of the ICC Bank.  It is a simple technical Bill which has no implications for the future structure of the State banking sector. The Bill has just two main sections which are intended to raise both the existing borrowing limit and the limit on the bank's authorised share capital.  This action is necessary to enable the ICC Bank to continue with its successful operations supporting Irish economic growth through loan and venture capital finance, targeted specifically at the SME sector which has contributed so significantly to employment and output growth over the past few years.  The Bill is in no way related to any possible restructuring of the State banking sector.  It is simply a straightforward technical Bill designed to remove obstacles to the bank's continued growth over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The borrowings of the ICC Bank include loans and deposits from customers and other financial institutions.  Such borrowings stand at £1,230 million. This is just £70 million short of the statutory limit which was last increased in 1992 from £1,000 million to £1,300 million.  Based on current trends, the present limit is likely to be reached around the middle of this year.  Given the bank's rate of growth in recent years, it is proposed to raise the borrowing limit by £1,000 million to £2,300 million, which should accommodate the bank's expansion for a number of years.  Last year the House agreed to a similar increase in the borrowing limit of the ACC Bank.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note it is not intended to increase the limit on the amount of ICC's borrowings which are guaranteed by the Minister for Finance. The policy of reducing the proportion of the bank's liabilities guaranteed by the Minister was first introduced in 1992, when the borrowing limit was increased to £1,300 million while the guarantee limit remained at £1,000 million.  The bank's management agree with this approach and is committed over the next few years to significantly reducing the amount of borrowings guaranteed by the State in both nominal and percentage terms.</P>
    <P>Shareholders' funds &mdash; mainly share capital and retained earnings &mdash; are the basis on which a <Col N="749" /> bank's compliance with the capital adequacy requirements of the Central Bank is calculated. ICC Bank's authorised share capital of £12 million &mdash; a limit set down in legislation and last increased in 1971 &mdash; is fully subscribed and other shareholders' funds &mdash; principally retained earnings &mdash; are almost fully committed.  As a result and because of the capital adequacy requirements of the Central Bank, the ICC Bank will soon be constrained in its efforts to increase its business. Thus, to ensure the continued expansion of the bank, it is proposed to raise the statutory limit on its authorised share capital to £40 million.  This is simply an enabling provision.  The increase in the limit does not commit the Minister to any specific injection of capital.  It merely enables him to subscribe capital to the bank from time to time within the amount specified.  It is quite normal, even for very small companies, to have a very large authorised share capital.  Any decision to subscribe to further shares in the bank will be taken on the basis of an assessment of the bank's capital needs at the particular time and be subject to the State securing a satisfactory return on any such investment.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the detailed provisions of the Bill, I would like to give the House an indication of developments of the bank since 1992, when the last Bill to increase its borrowing limit was before it.  The 1992 legislation enabled the bank to expand its traditional services and to engage in modern banking and financial services.</P>
    <P>Since 1992 the bank has undertaken a number of significant initiatives in support of Irish industry and in response to developments and demands in the marketplace.  In this regard, I draw particular attention to the bank's venture capital activities which have expanded significantly over the past few years to meet the increasing demand for this type of finance.  The bank is now the leading venture capital institution in Ireland, with £14 million invested in 1996 alone. In 1994, the bank managed the first small business expansion loan scheme, handling the £100 million Government-supported fund.  This scheme was highly influential in accelerating productive investment in the SME sector through the provision of long-term fixed rated funding at preferential rates.  ICC Investment Bank, or ICCIB, ICC's specialist deposit-taking and investment subsidiary, has attracted a steadily rising level of funds since its establishment in 1993. These have been raised with a guarantee from ICC Bank rather than a State guarantee.  ICC Investment Bank's funds now amount to nearly £370 million and account for about 30 per cent of the group's overall financing.  The continuing future success of ICCIB in attracting unguaranteed funding will significantly reduce the bank's dependence on the State guarantee.  ICC International Finance, the IFSC operation of the bank, is now providing full asset financing and treasury operations for corporate customers with overseas undertakings.  The bank recently established its own consultancy unit, ICC Consulting, which will <Col N="750" /> provide international financial, banking and industrial consulting and training services.  ICC Bank is now a broadly-based financial institution providing an extensive range of financial services to the Irish business community.</P>
    <P>As well as increasing its product range and facilities over the past five years, ICC Bank has also expanded its operations within and, for the first time, without the State with the opening of a branch in Belfast in 1996.</P>
    <P>Last year, the bank put in place a voluntary early retirement and severance package with a view to improving its cost-income ratio.  To this end and in order to finance internal restructuring and the development of new systems, the bank made an exceptional provision in the 1996 accounts of £3.95 million.  The bank is currently undertaking an internal review and restructuring programme to identify new sources of income and ways of enhancing performance and profitability.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the advances the bank made over the past few years and from the actions now being taken, that it is positioning itself well to enable it to continue to operate effectively in an increasingly competitive market.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is the definitions section and is self explanatory.</P>
    <P>Section 2 amends section 5 of the ICC Bank Act, 1992, by providing for an increase in the statutory limit on the bank's borrowings from the current level of £1,300 million to £2,300 million. The last increase was in 1992.  The increase now proposed should provide for the projected growth in the bank's activities in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends section 2 of the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Act, 1971, by providing for an increase in the limit on the authorised share capital from the current level of £12 million to £40 million.  The last such increase was in 1971 when the limit was increased from £10 million.  I should point out that the increase proposed relates only to the authorised share capital and in no way commits the Exchequer to any particular equity injection.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is a standard provision with Bills of this kind.  It requires that ICC Bank plc alter its memorandum and articles of association to make them consistent with the provisions of the Bill. There is a minor typographical error in the last line of this section where it reads &ldquo;Acts, 1993 to 1997&rdquo;.  This should read &ldquo;Acts, 1933 to 1997&rdquo;, and I will be moving an amendment on Committee Stage to correct it.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives the short title, collective citation and construction.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the established practice of declaring an interest in legislation, I wish to declare an interest in ICC Bank.  The firm of accountants in which I am a partner has had dealings with that bank and my partners have been liquidators and receivers of bodies in which <Col N="751" /> ICC Bank had debentures.  In a venture with another person I have a mortgage with ICC Bank.  Perhaps some of the Minister's companies have relationships with this bank.  In these days of excessive political correctness, perhaps he should declare that interest.  With the nonsense of today's political correctness one can never be too careful.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes provisions for an increase in the borrowing limit and the authorised share capital of ICC plc.  That bank has, without doubt, entered a critical phase in its history.  It is close to its lending limit and new capital is urgently required.</P>
      <P>Ownership of the bank is also critical.  The Government has prevaricated on this crucial question.  We must go back to the early 1990s to find a starting point for the present debate on ownership.  Consultants were appointed by the Department of Finance at the start of this decade to examine the bank's future.  Ever since, a decision has been keenly awaited.  We have sought an answer on the future direction of the State banking system in every Dáil Question Time for the last 13 months.  More than a year ago the Minister for Finance said he appreciated the need to make a decision as soon as possible to allow management to plan for the future.  Not alone have banks, both domestic and international, been anticipating a conclusion to this long running saga, the employees of this and the other State banks, the ACC and the TSB, are still waiting to learn which way the cookie will crumble. Jobs, security and all other related concerns are at the heart of the game that continues to be played with the State banks.</P>
      <P>The contribution made by the employees of the State banking sector is evident in the results achieved by them in recent years.  Employees and their families do not need the persistent ownership question mark which hangs over their heads. For their welfare and that of their families, they have long deserved assurances on the future direction of the State's banks, which we in Government will give.</P>
      <P>It is ironic we are debating a State banking Bill on the last day of the 27th Dáil.  I hope this closing day debate will signal the resolution of the ownership saga by the incoming Administration. The State banks, along with their respective employees especially, can at least begin to strategically plan for the future.  Once a general election is out of the way, the political system becomes more stable and at last makes decisions. While the waiting game has gone on, ICC Bank has not been sitting back.  It decided to properly equip itself for the marketplace to get out there and do the business.  With that in mind I welcome the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ICC has been a great success and under past, but particularly, the present management it has gone into new ventures, adopted new ideas and has a progressive way of doing business.  It was a small institution, but it has played a vital role in the development of this country.  I congratulate <Col N="752" /> the people involved in ICC Bank, particularly those with whom I have associated and know well.  I hold them in very high esteem.  They have adopted a positive and progressive attitude and they have shown that State institutions can involve themselves very successfully in the open market.  I welcome the Bill before the House.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McCreevy for his comments and brevity.  The case for a third banking force, originally contained in the Programme for Government of the previous Administration, was related to the need to generate a more vibrant and competitive market in retail banking services.  At that time small and medium sized enterprises, among others, were having great difficulty in securing access to credit on reasonable terms, if at all.  Moreover, banking services for those who could avail of them were costly and possibly inefficient.</P>
      <P>To a significant extent that position was the result of the absence of alternative credit providers to the two banks which dominated the domestic market.  That position has been transformed in the past few years by developments such as the emergence of the building societies as significant providers of banking services and the move by the banks into the home mortgage market. Those trends will continue.</P>
      <P>Other developments include the liberalisation of capital markets, which removed controls and facilitated depositors and pension funds in placing their funds; the increased competition from foreign based banks under EU banking directives; the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 and the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, which have created a comprehensive and effective regulatory framework for retail banking services and competition generally.</P>
      <P>The effects of those developments will continue to be felt in the banking sector in the years ahead.  I expect we will see increasing competition in financial markets based on telecommunications, information technology and the growth of the credit union movement as a credible banking alternative.  The Credit Union Bill will spur this process along.  Moreover, Deputies will be aware of the major project in An Post to automate and computerise its counter services, a development which will provide for more accessible and modern saving, investment and other retail financial services for those who do not have access to high street banks.</P>
      <P>The circumstances in which the concept of a third banking force was developed have changed fairly substantially in recent years.  Therefore, there is need for prudence in considering how to advance the issues on which the focus should be for the future.  The Minister for Finance and his colleagues continue to examine all the options to identify the solution which best addresses the needs of all the stakeholders.  The jury is probably still out on this issue, but I hope it will be brought to a quick resolution by the incoming Government.</P>

      <P>I understand it is not unusual to have very high authorised share capital, which even the smallest companies have.  The Minister of State said it is not proposed to subscribe for any issued capital in the near future.  Has this provision been included to get over this problem when the borrowing powers are being increased? Why was the figure of £40 million chosen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we might have consulted the Deputy's practice on that matter.  As I indicated, the Central Bank requires credit institutions to have sufficient capital to guard against defaults on loans for banks such as ICC Bank and this is set at 10 per cent of risk rates assets.  The figure of £40 million matches that reasonably closely.</P>

Perhaps the Minister of State and the officials with him today will convey my thanks to <Col N="754" /> the other officials and the Secretary of the Department.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours to be re-elected.

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for finally putting everyone out of their misery and announcing this general election for which we have waited a long time.  It is for the people to give their verdict on this Government which has been an aberration for over two years.  I wish everyone well as it will be a difficult three weeks for them, their friends, families, supporters, organisations and voters.  It is a sad day for you, a Cheann Comhairle, and for many other Members, or it may be a happy day, but I am sure there is a tinge of sadness.  Many Members on all sides of the House who have served the public faithfully will leave us today and I thank them for the service they have given to the people. Regardless of their political allegiance, I consider all of them colleagues.</P>
      <P>Since many countries in the world still fight for their vote &mdash; people here fought long enough for it &mdash; I hope the electorate will use the opportunity on 6 June to cast their vote.  Needless to say, I have my preference, on which I will elaborate outside the House in the next three weeks.</P>
      <P>It is a good day's work that the Taoiseach decided to put up his hands and go to the people. The sad epithet of this rainbow Government will be: &ldquo;Here lies the rainbow, red, white and blue, which worked for itself but never for you.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am delighted we are formally commencing the election campaign, which has been under way informally for some time.  I pay tribute to the outgoing Deputies who are not <Col N="756" /> seeking re-election &mdash; there are 16 in all from the various parties.  I hope they will have many happy years in retirement.  In particular I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Clohessy.  I also pay tribute to you, a Cheann Comhairle, as you will not be with us in the 28th Dáil.  Thank you for your work in keeping order, sometimes in very difficult circumstances, in this Dáil.</P>
      <P>Politics will be on trial in the next three weeks and it behoves us all to act in a responsible way. A general election is about issues, ideas and values, nothing else.  I hope we will concentrate on dealing with the real issues that confront our people, penal levels of tax on work, high unemployment and a two-tier society.</P>
      <P>I am proud to be the first woman to lead a political party in a general election campaign.  It is ironic we have to wait until the threshold of the 21st century to bring that about.  In this election we will choose a Government that will take us into the 21st century and it is important to have a decisive result.  It is also important for voters to carefully consider the choices.  We do not wish to see a return to the position in the early 1980s when one or two people held enormous clout and extracted expensive deals from the Government of the day.  I appeal to the people to think only in terms of choosing a Government and to exercise the franchise, which is very important.  In the coming weeks we will all be under pressure, but we must remember that thousands of students will sit their examinations on 11 June and their future and that of their families must be foremost in our minds.</P>
      <P>I do not wish the Taoiseach to return to office, but I wish him well in the election campaign.  I hope the campaign dignifies politics, particularly given the unsavoury events of recent years.  If it does that, it will be a great day for democracy.</P>
