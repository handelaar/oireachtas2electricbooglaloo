      <P>It is proposed to take No. 8, the Children Bill, 1997, Committee and Remaining Stages.  It is also proposed to take No. 7, the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill, 1997, Second Stage (resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In any of the legislation the Government is considering, including the Criminal Justice Bill, does the Government intend to take steps to remedy the deficiency in the law which has been identified, whereby those apparently involved in gross negligence in regard to hepatitis C and blood transfusion cannot be the subject of any legal pursuit because of deficiencies in the law identified by the DPP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government accepts there is a need to look at the law in this area, and it <Col N="2" /> will do so.  There has been a suggestion that perhaps some of the work of the Law Reform Commission should be looked at in this regard.  I am checking that to see if any of the commission's work would fit in with that.</P>
      <P>The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, enacted earlier this year, made a significant change in the law through the creation of an offence of reckless endangerment.  This makes it an offence for anyone to intentionally or recklessly engage in conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious harm to another.  The penalty is up to seven years' imprisonment.  As with the creation of any criminal offence it can apply only to something that happens after the legislation is enacted and obviously it would not have been an offence when the DPP took into account the issues in relation to hepatitis C. However, it is an important new provision that has been enacted and that should be acknowledged.</P>
      <P>I will look at the other matters.  There is clearly a need to look at the law in this area.  This morning I asked the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to look at that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Taoiseach has said in response to Deputy Bruton.  There is an urgent demand, however, that the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should come back to the House within a short period to remedy what must be accepted as defective legislation.  I am not sure that the changes made earlier this year would, in fact, remedy the situation on their own.  I ask that the matter be brought before the House again because of public concern which has been well aired over the last 24 hours.</P>
      <P>As regards the Children Bill, 1997, I note the Government's intention to go straight from Committee Stage to the Remaining Stages.  Can the Whips consider allowing some space between the conclusion of Committee Stage and the Remaining Stages because there are quite a number of amendments on today's Order Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Government Whip to look at the second matter the Deputy raised.</P>
      <P>As regards his first question, there is the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act that I referred to in reply to Deputy Bruton.  The Law Reform Commission is carrying out some work and I want to check whether what it is doing is appropriate to this matter.  I am not sure that what the commission is currently doing would cover the areas we are talking about.  I assure the House that we will look at this area.  There is an acceptance by everybody that this matter needs to be examined.  It looks as if the present legislative position does deal with this, but we will certainly examine that case.</P>

      <P>Last week the Government accepted a Fine Gael motion on funding the Sellafield case on the basis that the Government would meet with residents' representatives.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that the Government is refusing that meeting with the residents and that the meeting that had been arranged for 5 p.m. today has been cancelled?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for the replies he gave to Deputy Bruton and Deputy Spring.  I am sure the Taoiseach will acknowledge that the general public is scandalised by the fact that no prosecutions are being brought as a result of the hepatitis C scandal.  Rather than refer this matter to the Law Reform Commission the Government should, as a matter of urgency, direct the Office of the Attorney General to produce the necessary legislation.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Spring that the Children Bill has received little attention in the House to date.  The Second Stage was brief and it would be unwise to proceed from Committee to Report Stage today.  The Bill requires more extensive discussion and it would be of benefit to the relevant Minister and to Members if there were a timespan between the completion of Committee Stage and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the Deputy's comments. Lest I misrepresented the position regarding the work of the Law Reform Commission, it is completing its work on fatal offences in the context of other matters and there is a view that this work might be useful in the current context. I will find out in the next few days if that is the case and that will be taken into account in any legislative changes proposed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Taoiseach's attention to another matter of concern.  The House cannot question the decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions and I do not intend to do so.  However, perhaps the Taoiseach or the Minister for Health and Children could clarify the status of the Garda investigation into the hepatitis C scandal.  It is noteworthy that the Director of Public Prosecutions made his decision on the basis of a preliminary Garda report.  That is somewhat confusing as I would have expected it to be based on a full and final report.  The Minister should explain to the House the extent of the investigation conducted by the Garda Síochána in order to clarify this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide if he is satisfied with the status of the report.  It is not a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  The Deputy will be aware the Minister made a statement on that matter in recent days.  The Department received a preliminary report from the Central Bank last Friday.  It was studied in the Department and was forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General to see if the Minister can, as he promised during Question Time, lay it before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to abide by the law with regard to the local elections?  He appears to be under a misapprehension about the matter.  In response to a question from my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government pointed out that under section 20 of the Local Government Act, 1994, local elections are due to be held in June 1998.  The Minister added, rather gratuitously, that no decision had been made to amend this section of the Act.  Yesterday Deputy Howlin put the same question to the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach said a decision had not been made about it.  The Taoiseach can rest easy because he need not make such a decision.  The law states that the elections should be held in 1998.  Does the Taoiseach intend to abide by that law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>I was unavoidably absent from the House last Thursday when the Taoiseach gave an undertaking on various matters concerning Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant.  He said a meeting would be held at an early date between the Dundalk residents and the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob.  I have a document from the Minister of State which states that he will not meet the residents if there is a stenographer present. Can the Taoiseach confirm that the meeting will not take place because the Minister of State is not prepared to have a stenographer present?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 28, to delete &ldquo;Children (No. 2) Act, 1997&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Children Act, 1997&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These technical amendments provide for a change in the Title of the Bill from the &ldquo;Children (No. 2) Bill, 1997&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Children Bill, 1997&rdquo;. At present there are two Bills before the House, the Children Bill, 1996, which relates to juvenile justice matters, and this Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Children Bill, 1996, which deals with the juvenile justice area, is a very comprehensive measure.  However, the Government has not yet brought it before the House.  Is it intended to bring the Bill before the House with any degree of urgency?</P>
      <P>There is a major problem with children who are unruly and beyond control and High Court proceedings are regularly brought to seek to require the authorities to provide proper facilities for them.  The delay in bringing the Children Bill, 1996, before the House is delaying the putting in place of a proper legal structure to address this problem, apart from the fact that it is putting back the day when we replace the remains of the Children Act, 1908, with a modern statutory structure.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister know what is happening in regard to this Bill?  I expected her <Col N="8" /> to be in a position to tell the House when the Bill will be restored to the Order Paper and whether it is being modified or amended by the Government. It took many years to produce this extremely important measure and it is extraordinary that the Government is delaying bringing it forward, particularly as it deals with juvenile justice matters.  Is this yet another U-turn by the Government?  There was much reference to zero tolerance but little reference to the core problems which lead to criminal offences, particularly by young children.  I expected the Bill to be reintroduced with expedition and it is extraordinary that the Minister does not seem to know what the position is in regard to it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2), line 29, to delete &ldquo;(except section 11 and Part III)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, except section 11 (in so far as it inserts sections 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 28 and 29 into the Act of 1964) and Part III&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under section 1 the Bill will come into operation one month after the date of its passing with the exception of section 11 and Part III which are subject to commencement provisions.  The Minister indicated on Second Stage that commencement orders are required in respect of these provisions to ensure that the administrative arrangements necessary for their successful application are in place.  The provisions of section 11 will have an impact on the work of the probation and welfare service, health boards and the Family Mediation Service.  These organisations will have to be consulted about the manner in which new responsibilities under section 11 can be accommodated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III may necessitate the installation in courthouses of additional facilities for evidence to be taken by live television link or by video recording.  Section 11 inserts 12 new sections, sections 19 to 30, into the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  Deputies suggested on Second Stage that some of these new sections could come into operation without the need for a commencement order, and amendments Nos. 2 and 4 have been tabled in response to these suggestions.  Under these amendments the new sections 19, 24, 25, 27 <Col N="9" /> and 30 will not be the subject of a commencement order and will come into operation one month after the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The new sections deal with the following matters. Section 19 is a definition section, while section 24 will enable agreements relating to rights of custody and access to a child to be made a rule of court.  Section 25 obliges the court to consider the wishes of a child having regard to his or her age and understanding.  Section 27 makes it clear that a child in custody or access proceedings need not be brought before the court when the court so directs, while section 30 is a jurisdiction provision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin's amendment differs from the Minister's amendment in two respects. Her amendment would result in the provisions relating to mediation coming into effect one month after the passing of the Bill.  She is also proposing that all of the provisions in section 11 and Part III be brought into effect not later than 18 months after the passing of the Bill.  The provisions being introduced by section 11 which relate to mediation and counselling, social reports and guardian <i>ad litem</i> will require consultation with the probation and welfare service, health boards, the Family Mediation Service and the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Finance.</P>
    <P>It is only following proper consultation that the provisions can be brought successfully into effect. Corresponding provisions in the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, relating to social reports, mediation and counselling have placed a very heavy burden on the organisations concerned.  The previous Government did not make the necessary resources available to enable those organisations to meet their statutory obligations. The Government is now dealing with this matter.  The provisions of the Bill cannot operate without the necessary resources.  Taking into consideration all that has happened in the various areas to which the Bill relates, it is reasonable to make the provisions subject to a commencement order which can be made when the necessary resources have been made available not only for the measures in this Bill but also for the 1995 and 1996 Acts.  I commend amendments Nos. 2 and 4 to the House and ask Deputy Moynihan-Cronin to accept my explanation.</P>

      <P>I am the first to admit that I am not very well up in terms of the law but I have discovered from research that some provisions of the Civil Liability Act, 1960, have still not been brought into force.  The period of 18 months proposed in my amendment is sufficient and anything longer is ridiculous.  I am prepared to press my amendment as the Minister must be tied to a timeframe and her amendment puts the matter on the long finger.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned at what the Minister said, some of which is rather odd and <Col N="10" /> indicates a lack of understanding of the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister wants to postpone bringing into force what will effectively be section 20 of the 1954 Guardianship of Infants Act.  That section places an obligation on solicitors, in proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act, to advise a mother or father of the alternative options available to them.  One of those options is that they seek counselling to try to resolve their difficulties.  When marriages break down District Court proceedings are brought to deal with disputes about custody of children, and counselling in that context is usually given by a marriage counsellor.  There is a large number of agencies providing marriage counselling on a voluntary basis and private counsellors providing counselling on a professional basis, and that will not change with the passage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>A second option is mediation.  The Irish Life Centre Mediation Service, which is paid for by the Government, and the mediation service in Limerick deal with disputes not only in judicial separation and divorce proceedings taken in the Circuit Court and High Court but under the Guardianship of Infants Act where parents disagree on custody, upbringing or access issues.  The other alternative of which a solicitor must advise people before they go to court is that their differences may be resolved by agreement.  The Bill refers to effecting a deed or agreement in writing executed or made by the applicant and the respondent providing for the custody of the child, right of access and so on.  That has nothing to do with the Probation and Welfare Service.  It relates to private marriage counsellors, voluntary agencies that provide marriage counselling, public and private mediation services and the work of solicitors.</P>
      <P>This section may have been devised by a previous Administration, but much of it is window dressing and nonsense.  A Private Members' Bill which I introduced in 1989 and which was passed through the House requires that where people are contemplating separation proceedings, solicitors have an obligation to explain the options of counselling, mediation and resolving difficulties by agreement.  The wording in its present form will not change the world, it will simply mean that at District Court level a solicitor must certify that he advised of the alternative options, but most good solicitors dealing with family law automatically give such advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is odd to insert this provision &mdash; I would have made the same criticism of the previous Minister for Equality and Law Reform &mdash; in the context of District Court proceedings solely brought under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  In cases of marriage breakdown the District Court deals with maintenance cases, applications for barring and protection orders and custody disputes. It also has limited powers under the Family Home Protection Act.  It would make sense to insert a provision in a courts Bill to the effect that prior to instituting court proceedings on behalf of <Col N="11" /> a party in the District Court in a family law matter, the lawyer should advise the person of these options.  There is no reason that should be an obligation in custody proceedings but not in maintenance and barring proceedings.  The lawyer is simply advising of options, which may be rejected by the recipient of the information for a variety of reasons.</P>
    <P>For example, a battered wife who wants custody of her children will not take the time to go to a mediator because she feels vulnerable and needs protection.  In so far as this provision has limited use, it should apply generally to District Court family proceedings, be they between married or unmarried parents.  It makes no sense to postpone bringing into force the proposed new section 20 of the 1964 Act and the proposed new section 21, which imposes similar obligations on a lawyer for the recipient of court proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Probation and Welfare Service.  For many years the Probation and Welfare Service has been seriously under-staffed and overburdened.  That is not the fault of the last Government but of a series of Governments. When custody cases come before the District Court, the judge often requests an assessment from the welfare officer attached to the court and seeks a report on what orders should be made in the interests of the welfare of the child about whom there is a dispute.  Regardless of whether this provision is inserted, that will remain the position.</P>
    <P>The Probation and Welfare Service needs to be reorganised and given adequate staff to deal with family problems.  Appropriate noises were made to that effect during the general election.  Will the Minister clarify the Government's policy on that? There is a need to provide specialist family courts with back-up services.  Since the Minister is tinkering around with the District Court, will she outline the Government's policy on implementing the Law Reform Commission's report on the establishment of family courts?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>Will the Minister address the open-ended nature of her proposal?  Deputy Moynihan-Cronin proposes that a limit of 18 months should be set for the implementation of certain subsections of this section.  I ask the Minister to accept that amendment.  Everybody is concerned about Bills brought through the House that are so open-ended they do not produce the results intended.  There must be a timeframe to ensure resources are put in place.  I accept there may be need for consultation, but if a timeframe is not set, resources will not be made available to ensure a commencement order is implemented.  If 18 months is not the correct period, perhaps the Minister will suggest some other timeframe.  We have all seen Bills pass through this House which state they will be implemented on such day or days as may be fixed, but they are weasel words. They do not set out the intention or how that <Col N="12" /> intention will be delivered.  The Minister should respond positively to this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Moynihan-Cronin's point about the Civil Liability Act, 1960. Her concerns on this matter are genuine, as are the points made by other Deputies.  The options available to people in such situations, through marriage counselling and mediation services all cost money.  The Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, had a huge impact in this area.  In regard to mediation and counselling they placed a huge burden on these organisations, many of which are voluntary organisations and receive grant aid here and there.</P>
      <P>In the context of this Bill it must be borne in mind the previous Government in passing the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, did not provide the necessary resources to the organisations to meet their obligations.  I accept what Deputy McManus is saying about pinning it down, but the only way to ensure services are available is to provide the necessary resources.  Having passed a Bill, we can all walk out from here, and say it is wonderful and that various things will happen.  The failure of the previous Government to provide the necessary resources for the two Acts mentioned has a significance here.  We have to bear in mind that resources were not available even for the two previous Acts and that is an important aspect of what we are talking about.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the Children Bill and I am not prepared to allow it remain open ended.  It involves children from broken homes who are already in difficulty.  If the Minister does not accept my amendment I will press it, if not now, on Report Stage.  When dealing with children in difficult situations the Minister cannot say money is not available.  Given that we hear about the Celtic tiger every day, this is one area for which the Government should provide resources.  Children in difficulty are at stake here.  By saying no money is available the Minister is attempting to put the matter on the long finger.  In this day and age when plenty of money is available this is one matter the Government should make a priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the case that essential parts of the Bill cannot be implemented because of a lack of resources, I suggest the Government's approach should be not to introduce a Bill until that problem has been sorted out.  I am conscious <Col N="13" /> that in areas relating to divorce there are strains on the system.  The free legal aid centre in Wicklow has waiting lists for up to ten or 11 months and certainly in the area of mediation none of us could be satisfied with the provision.  If that is the reason we are being offered an open-ended arrangement, which makes a nonsense of what we are doing today, I suggest the Government adopt an approach which will tackle the issue before a Bill is presented for amendment and debate.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.</P>

      <P>What are we doing introducing a Bill, the important parts of which cannot be implemented within 18 months?  Eighteen months is a reasonable time in which to provide the resources necessary for mediation and other services referred to in the Bill.  It makes a nonsense of the work being done here.  A question was asked in the Dáil some years ago about outstanding sections of Bills that had not been implemented by previous Ministers and because of the volume of noise in the Chamber it could not be answered.  If the important details of this Bill cannot be implemented and the mediation service cannot be provided within 18 months we should abandon the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin said money should be provided in this important area which deals with children.  In regard to the general point made by the Deputy, Deputy McManus and Deputy Neville that the Government should not introduce the Bill until money is provided for the various services, it is a pity the previous Government did not adopt that approach.  Had that approach been adopted in the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, we would not be in the position today where people have to wait.  That point could be made about earlier legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other important provisions.  To suggest it should not be introduced because sufficient mediation staff are not available or because of lack of funding is a nonsense.  We are facing the reality following the passage of the 1995 and 1996 Acts and now the passing of this Bill.  I am not saying this Bill will never come into operation, but that on its passing we can address the issues not only in my Department but in consultation with the Department of Finance. Deputies may not be aware the Family Mediation Service has moved from my Department to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  It is important that Department would be aware of its commitments following the passing of this Bill.  It is important to proceed with the Bill and to address the important issues before us.  In reply to Deputy Shatter who asked what organisations are involved, the Probation and Welfare Service, the health boards, the Family Mediation Service and the relevant Departments all have an involvement.  Perhaps that impact was not taken into consideration with the passing of <Col N="14" /> the 1995 and 1996 Acts but we are taking it into consideration with the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Minister's presentation quite appalling.  I do not want to take issue with the new Minister of State who is, for the first time, taking Committee Stage of a Bill but she is so ill-informed on what happens in practice.  The difficulty is we will enact legislation in one day which will impact on the lives of many people.  In other areas, I will raise issues that will create specific difficulties.  The Minister's Department in dealing with areas of family law has always lacked insight and understanding of what is happening in the real world.  The Government has compounded the problem and the Minister has exposed it by what she has just said.  By taking what was an extremely good Department of Equality and Law Reform and thrusting half its functions into the Department of Justice and another portion to the Department of Health and Children, the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing, and I am concerned that the right hand does not seem to understand what the left hand is doing.  Frankly, the Minister's level of understanding, considering her decision to take Committee Stage today, appalls me.  I will ask the Minister a specific question to which I hope she will reply without a long waffle about resources. Is the Minister telling the House that if people consider taking custody cases at District Court level they should not be encouraged to either get help from a counsellor, go to mediation or to resolve their problems by agreement?  Is the Minister saying that should not happen?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not the only one in this House who has an expert knowledge in this area.  All of us have a role to play.  All of us have an equal understanding of the facts before us.  There is no point in one person setting himself up as an expert in this area.  Whether the Deputy likes it or not, we are talking about responsible Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is avoiding this relevant question.  She is suggesting that a section of the legislation should not be brought into force at this stage.  That section places an obligation on solicitors to advise people that they can resolve their problems through counselling, mediation or by agreement through solicitors without taking the matter to court.  Is the Minister of State claiming this is not happening or should not happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply stating that resources must be provided for that type of facility.  It is correct to say that option is available to solicitors and while it is wonderful in theory, it must be paid for.  As a responsible Government, we must ensure the necessary resources are available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>

      <P>The House is entitled to information on this matter.  If this section is not brought into force we will be back here in 18 months or two years' time discussing the matter. Will the Minister of State clarify the counselling organisations she perceives require additional funding for this section to be brought into force? What additional funding does she propose to give to lawyers in private practice or in law centres to encourage people not to go to court to resolve their difficulties?  What finance should be provided for the mediation services?  The Minister of State claims she knows additional resources are necessary, but has the funding been quantified? What role, if any, have the health boards played in the resolution of custody disputes between parents at District Court level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of quantifying the amount of funding, that is what we are discussing. I presume the Deputy is aware that marriage counselling and mediation services are provided by a large range of people and organisations.  This matter was dealt with by the former Department of Equality and Law Reform, but it now comes under the remit of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The necessary funding must be quantified by that Department. Following the enactment of the legislation we will contact the relevant organisations and we hope it will not take 18 months.</P>

Has any State or private mediation agency requested her not to bring this provision into force?

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not willing to listen to my answer.  The groups that would be concerned about this section have been writing to us since I took up office about the problem of funding, predominantly because of the l995 Act. We could paper walls with the amount of correspondence we have received from people with concerns about funding.  We will ensure the necessary funding is in place before placing additional responsibility on those organisations. We have received a huge amount of correspondence, but not specifically in regard to this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not act irresponsibly by introducing this provision without taking account of resources.  That was the policy of the previous Government.  We will deal with the matter at the appropriate time and I hope that will be sooner than 18 months.</P>

      <P>That is another argument for putting an 18 month timeframe on the implementation of this provision.  While I accept the Minister of State is concerned about this matter, we depend on another Minister to make commitments about resources without having to adhere to a timeframe.  Has the Minister of State received a commitment from the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in that regard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has responsibility in this area we must discuss in detail the commitment of his Department.  While I am sure the Deputy understands I cannot make a commitment today for another Minister or Department, it is our priority to enter into discussions with the relevant people once the legislation is passed.  This is a small section of the legislation.  We must proceed to enact the legislation and then ensure the necessary resources are provided for its implementation.</P>

      <P>I despair of the Minister of State dealing with this matter in a sensible manner.  We must send out a clear message about the Government. It is actively discouraging mothers and fathers from trying to resolve their problems through counselling, mediation or by agreement rather than in the District Court.  It is opposed to the idea of a legal obligation being placed on lawyers to ensure people can explore those alternatives. It believes that all those issues should be dealt with in the under-staffed court structure. The Government is not providing additional welfare officers at District Court level.  That is an extraordinary approach.  By not maintaining the Department of Equality and Law Reform as a separate Department, the Government has fragmented the functions that were brought together under one umbrella in that Department and made it more difficult to provide a co-ordinated responsive family service for people with family difficulties.  The Minister of State does not know what might be done with regard to providing additional funding to the mediation service and has no control over the issue.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if, procedurally, we can do that now, but I will ask the Whips to get together immediately to agree to amend the Order of the House, if need be, to facilitate what the Deputy said.  I do not believe we can simply change the Order as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>We can, Sir.  With respect to the Chair, it is a function of the House to amend an Order of the House and if the Minister and the Deputies present agree I do not see the need for the Whips, who have not been party to these discussions, to be apprised of the exchanges that have taken place.  It is my understanding that the House controls its business and if Members agree to amend the Order for the day, they can do so, if it is not a matter of contention on all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> Before we go through further parts of the Bill, it is in the interest of all Members to agree this.  It may also reduce the level of discussion necessary because if we raise issues that the Minister will consider before Report Stage, we will not have to discuss them at as great a length as would be necessary if Report Stage were to be taken today. Perhaps the Minister of State could agree that by consensus we should amend the Order of the House.  I do not believe any of her other colleagues would be too put out by her doing that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is too great a tendency to produce legislation which deals with piecemeal amendments to earlier legislation to the degree that Acts are becoming completely and utterly incomprehensible.  This is not a personal criticism of the Minister; it is a criticism of successive Governments.  It is impossible for a person or a Member who is not a lawyer, or even a number of members of the legal profession, to come to terms with the legal provisions which apply in the family law area by simply looking at the Acts of the Oireachtas.  It is like putting a jigsaw puzzle together and trying to make sense of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was produced by the previous Government and the Minister is burdened with guiding it through the House.  It is a jigsaw of <Col N="21" /> interaction with a variety of other statutory measures.  The Family Law Act, 1995 could be similarly criticised, as could the adoption legislation which is basically chaotic in the manner in which it is laid out.</P>
    <P>As someone who has drafted legislation, I am well aware that when the official or law officer of the State comes to the drafting stages he or she must be intimately familiar with the legislation which he or she is amending.  It would be much simpler if we changed the practices in this House and, instead of producing amending legislation such as this, Deputies were provided with a copy of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, as it stands amended as a result of changes made in the Status of Children Act, 1987, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1986, the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  If we published legislation which contained all of the existing law together with what is to be the new law, that is, the amendments to it, in different print, Deputies when fulfilling a legislative function would see the law in one piece of legislation. That Bill when enacted would replace the 1964 Act and other relevant provisions in earlier legislation.  We should be consolidating as we are reforming.  What we are doing is creating a body of law which is virtually incomprehensible.</P>
    <P>When it came to finding out the definition of dependent child for my recent family law book, which should have been relatively simple, I had to go through seven statutes because nobody had bothered replacing a definition from one statute with a full definition in another; they had messed around with bits and pieces of it.</P>
    <P>Our legislation is becoming increasingly incomprehensible. When this Bill is passed, in so far as there is anything new in it &mdash; there are one or two new areas which are very important but much of it is window dressing &mdash; it will just add another layer of confusion.  It is reaching the stage where practising lawyers who must advise people are confused as to law.  It is impossible for the general public and social workers.  It often creates confusion even within the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Deputy Moynihan-Cronin's amendment is designed at least to put together in a Schedule the relevant legislation.  That is helpful to anybody looking at it, but we should no longer legislate in this way.  Deputies have tolerated our legislating in this way for too long.  I do not know the reason for this.  It may be just a bad habit.</P>
    <P>It also facilitates &mdash; this is not a criticism of officials in any Departments because that would not be fair &mdash; those few people in Departments who have an expert legislative knowledge of existing law in retaining control of information.  I am sure the Minister has labyrinthine notes in front of her to deal with all sorts of queries which might arise about the interaction of this Bill with other Acts.  For the Minister to deal with them herself she would have had to become an instant expert in a variety of legislation going back over 30 years.  It would be much easier for the Minister <Col N="22" /> dealing with it if she had one piece of legislation in front of her which highlighted where the changes occur.  If this House is to do its business in future, I suggest &mdash; and I will ask my Fine Gael colleagues to propose this to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges &mdash; that, when a Bill of this nature is published, an updated version of the current law containing all the amendments should be circulated to Deputies so that they, who must undertake three weeks research just to work out how some section will interact with another at present, can prepare for Committee Stage.  Such a basic information tool should be available to all Members who are taking Committee or Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the amendment proposed by the Labour Party but it does not solve our problem.  I have said to colleagues who were in Government and I am saying to the Minister that this would be helpful.  There is a need to codify the law in this way, particularly in the area of family law where the statutory provisions are becoming completely incomprehensible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle, everybody might agree with the points being made.  Deputy Shatter's point with regard to raising the issue at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is probably relevant.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendments before us is to provide for the collective citation of this Act except Part III and the 1964 Act with the Acts listed in the Schedule in so far as they relate to the guardianship of children.  In addition, they provide that relevant sections of those Acts should be construed together as one Act.</P>
      <P>The collective citation and construing together of statutes is a drafting device which requires each and every relevant part of the Acts to be construed as if they had been contained in one Act unless there is some manifest discrepancy making it necessary to hold that the latter Act has to some extent modified something found in the earlier Act.</P>
      <P>The device is usually used in relation to Acts which relate to one particular topic.  This is the point at issue here.  These amendments as currently framed attempt to encompass a wide variety of Acts dealing with various topics which may affect the guardianship of children.  Even at that, the amendments are obviously of concern because of the variety of topics.  For example, they omit any reference to the Succession Act, 1965, section 8 of which repealed section 7(7) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  The amendments include the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, which makes reference to various orders made under the 1964 Act, but exclude reference to the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991, which contains similar provisions.  That is the danger in attempting a wide-ranging provision of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem that a purpose of the amendments also is to draw to the attention of practitioners <Col N="23" /> a list of the Acts which are relevant to the Bill.  However, as can be seen from page 2 of the Bill, under the heading &ldquo;Acts Referred to&rdquo;, there is already such a list available.</P>
    <P>The question of dealing further in the Bill with collective citations was considered in the course of drafting and it was found not to be feasible to go any further at that time.  I understand the course of action Deputy Shatter has attempted to address.  Everyone concurs with his point that life would be easier if the text of legislation was more readable.  This is an important point to consider in light of the amendments under discussion because there are many issues which affect the guardianship of children.  I cannot accept the amendments but Deputy Shatter's suggestion that the matter could be raised at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is welcome.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  If this amendment achieves nothing else, it raises the issue that the wording used in legislation, particularly in Bills relating to children and family law, is not user-friendly. Many people, including a number of solicitors, have problems in dealing with this document. One can only imagine the difficulties faced by parents reading the Bill to discover what it entails.  We should attempt to be more user-friendly because the people who elected us want to know what is happening.  I tabled an amendment, which will be dealt with later, that covers a similar aspect of this problem.  I accept Deputy Shatter's proposal that this matter should be raised at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 11 to 19, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) declare that they are the father and mother of the child concerned,</P>
      <P>(c) agree to the appointment of the father as a guardian of the child,</P>
      <P>(d) have entered into arrangements regarding the custody of and, as the case may be, access to the child, and</P>
      <P>(e) have made a statutory declaration to that effect as may be prescribed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment.  Section 4 allows a father who has not married the mother of his child to be appointed a guardian of the child by agreement with the mother without the need to go to court as at present.  Subsection (4) sets out certain conditions and the effect of amendment No. 12 is to make it clear that one of those conditions must be that the parties involved must make a declaration that they are the father and mother of the child concerned.</P>
      <P>The effect of Deputy Neville's amendments would be to substitute the word &ldquo;care&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; in this Bill, in parts of the 1964 Act and in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  These amendments are not acceptable for the following reasons.</P>
      <P>The amendments tabled by Deputy Neville substitute the word &ldquo;care&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; in some but not all sections of the 1964 Act. The word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; would continue to be used in those sections of the 1964 Act which are not being amended by the Bill which would create legal and technical difficulties.  For example, section 11(2)(a) of the 1964 Act empowers the court to give directions regarding the custody of a child.  New section 11A which is inserted by the Bill is intended to clarify section 11.  However, section 11, a substantial section in the 1964 Act, contains different terminology.  Similar problems would arise with the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, as a result of the Deputy's amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> The main difficulty with the amendments is that under the law as it stands the word &ldquo;care&rdquo; has a specific meaning in the Child Care Act, 1991.  A care order as defined by section 18 of that Act has the effect of committing a child who has been ill-treated to the care of a health board, thus depriving the child's parents of custody.  On the other hand, a custody order granted under the 1964 Act has the effect of granting custody of a child to one or both parents.  It is clear that were the spirit of Deputy Neville's amendments to be followed, custody orders would also be known as care orders.  The Deputy's amendments, which are well-intentioned, would serve only to confuse the issue.</P>
    <P>I commend amendment No. 12 to the House. However, I am not in a position to accept Deputy Neville's amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled these amendments on the basis that language and perception are important when dealing with family law.  The definition of the word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; lists the terms &ldquo;confinement&rdquo;, &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo;, &ldquo;restraint of liberty&rdquo;, &ldquo;watch&rdquo;, &ldquo;guardianship&rdquo; and &ldquo;care&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;care&rdquo; has connotations of parenting while the word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; has connotations of imprisonment. The purpose of the amendments was to change the language used in dealing with matters involving the custody, parenting, etc., of children.</P>
      <P>It is significant that the Minister of State indicated that difficulties would arise if certain sections of the 1964 Act were not amended.  This confirms the view expressed by Deputies Moynihan-Cronin and Shatter on consolidation and understanding, namely, that those of us who are not lawyers are inhibited by the approach taken to reforming legislation.  I take the Minister of State's point but we should reconsider the language used in the areas of family law, children, separations, etc., because, as I understand it, the term &ldquo;custody&rdquo; refers to a person who is imprisoned. There is a contradiction in using this term to refer both to children and prisoners in jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue.  Deputy Neville is correct to state that the use of language in dealing with family disputes is extraordinarily important.  There are those, particularly lawyers, who frequently use language insensitively and do not realise its impact on people.  However, another part of the problem is that there is a widespread misunderstanding of how the law works.  I warn the Minister of State that what I will say is relevant not only to this issue but also to other sections of the Bill and it is one of the reasons it was important not to deal with Report Stage today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether one terms the arrangement put in place regarding the parent with whom a child will primarily reside as a &ldquo;custody&rdquo;, &ldquo;care&rdquo; or &ldquo;other form&rdquo; of arrangement &mdash; my example applies to instances of marriage breakdown or the break-up of stable cohabiting relationships when there is concern about the upbringing of children &mdash; difficulties <Col N="26" /> will arise about the fact that a battle for custody is seen as precisely that, and parents are perceived to be at war with each other.  Award of custody is often taken to be some sort of note of parental approval and parents, married or unmarried, often do not understand that granting a court order of custody to one parent does not mean they are excluded from being involved in the lives of their children or making important decisions about their upbringing and welfare.  The word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; has developed a bad name, particularly on the part of many fathers who do not succeed in having a custody order made in their favour in the courts.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to address that by providing that the courts can make joint custody orders, but without analysing what that means. This creates a very real problem, and it is something the courts pragmatically try to work their way through.  It was not dealt with in the Bill in its original format when published and it is not dealt with today in any of the Minister's amendments.  Effectively custody means one thing only &mdash; the parent with whom a child primarily resides.  Joint custody orders are fine in the context of resolving the psychological problems that arise when one parent is awarded custody and the other is not.  However, the only circumstances in which the courts make orders is where people are at war with each other, where parents do not live with each other and decisions must be made about a child's upbringing.  A joint custody order does not solve any problem because it does not specify with which parent a child will reside.  In the case of warring parents whose marriage has broken down and who both want custody of their child, the judge, having listened to all sorts of evidence during the course of a two hour court hearing, may decide they are both reasonable parents and make an order of joint custody.  Those two people may wonder what that means.  They live in separate houses. They have just had a dispute as to who should have custody, and now they have joint custody. Are they to divide their child in half?  Is the child to be subjected to living three and a half days with one parent and three and a half days with the other, or will the child end up spending alternate days with each parent?  How would such a child put down roots and get on with its life of getting on with schoolwork, making friends and having normal social relationships?  What adults want for children does not always work for children and is not always in the interests of their welfare.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; about which Deputy Neville is rightly concerned is a problem for many people.  That is why he suggested the concept of care.  Joint custody poses even greater problems. People think it is a panacea to resolve the issue, but it is not, and there are things that need to be done with this Bill to resolve problems in this area.  Everyone seems to have lost sight of the fact that if a marriage breaks down and there is a battle over children both parents remain joint <Col N="27" /> guardians of the child, regardless of which parent gets custody of the child.  The 1964 Act says that. The Supreme Court said that in 1951.</P>
    <P>In practice when there is a battle for custody in the courts, the judge makes a decision and one parent gets custody and the other parent thinks he or she has lost out, but the judge rarely if ever delivers an address to the people before the court to the effect that they are both parents and that, regardless of the parent to whom custody is awarded, both remain and will continue to be joint guardians and must co-operate as joint guardians in the interests of their children.  Just as we are imposing an obligation on solicitors to advise people that they can avail of mediation, counselling, etc., we should under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 impose an obligation on members of the Judiciary when determining a custody dispute to draw to the attention of the couple before the court the fact that they will continue to remain joint guardians of their child and must co-operate with each other as joint guardians.  That is not just a formula.  It should be said.  It is very important that it is understood.  In my experience people do not usually understand it.  Often lawyers, mediators and social workers do not fully explain it either.</P>
    <P>The courts cannot simply be granted power to make orders of joint custody because some judges who have difficulty in deciding family problems at some level will hear the dispute and make an order of joint custody, telling the parents that they have had their battle, that he did not like the way they battled, that they can have joint custody and that they can go off and sort out between themselves what that means.  If that happens to a dysfunctional family it is disastrous for their children. It is exasperating that the people who draft legislation do not often check what happens in practice in the courts.  They legislate in areas where they have no experience of what is happening on the ground.  The result is that they produce daft solutions such as the joint custody solution in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The courts can make general orders as to the welfare of children under section 11(1) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  Many judges, because they are aware that the word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; conjures up images that are unhelpful when there is a family dispute, make orders for joint custody but specify what the residential arrangements are to be, for example, that a child will reside with the mother for five days of the week and with the father every second weekend.  This is spoken of as residential arrangements so that the sting in the tail of the word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; as it is publicly perceived does not apply.</P>
    <P>In this House everyone thinks guardianship and custody orders are being made, and there are still plenty of formal custody orders being made, but very often it is residential orders that are being made, because judges have a general power to make any order they like in regard to the welfare of a child under section 11(1) of the Guardianship <Col N="28" /> of Infants Act, 1964.  It is time we gave statutory form to what is happening in practice.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to include in the Bill a general power to make joint custody orders without explaining that when making a joint custody order the judge has an obligation to set out with which parent the child is to primarily reside. There are excellent judges dealing with family problems at all levels of the courts who have tremendous insight and are aware of the difficulties the use of language causes.  However, we still have some awful judges who make awful decisions and deal with people who have family problems in an appalling way.  My law firm is aware of cases where, behind closed doors, people who have solved their family problems and who have gone to court looking for consent orders have found themselves subjected to verbal abuse from the judge who is asked to make the consent orders.  I do not know why that happens.</P>
    <P>I suppose that, just as not all Members of this House are perfect, neither are all members of the Judiciary.  One can assume, when passing family law legislation, that there is a solid body of people who will apply it in a sensible and sane way. However, there are, unfortunately, some who will not.  We need to resolve this problem particularly as it affects fathers, who feel particularly badly done by in custody disputes, and that they have lost out in regard to their children because it is more often the mother who is given custody.  That is an issue I will come back to at a later stage in a different context.</P>
    <P>Let us ensure that all parents who are married understand that they remain joint guardians when there is a dispute over custody.  Let us ensure that if the courts make joint custody orders the judges not alone have express statutory powers to delineate the residential arrangements but an obligation to do so in the case of those judges who may decide not to do that simply because they have been irritated by listening to the couple in the witness box.  Let us put in our legislation a definition of custody.  One of the oddities of our family law legislation is that the word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; is used all over the place but there is no definition of what it means.</P>
    <P>The definition I have given, that custody essentially means the parent with whom the child primarily resides, is the definition that as a family lawyer I take from the way the system works, that custody means the parent who has physical custody of the child for most of the time.  Why do we not define what we mean by custody in our legislation?  That would differentiate it from guardianship.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville has suggested that we replace the concept of custody with the concept of care. That is worthy of discussion here but it would not resolve all the difficulties I raise with the Minister. I hope she will look at what I am saying constructively. That is one of the reasons I did not want us to take Report Stage today.  There are a number of amendments which would not be difficult to draft and which should be incorporated in <Col N="29" /> the Bill.  They would not alone solve legal problems but ensure the courts would address the totality of the impact of a custody order when there are warring couples before them.  This is also relevant to unmarried parents in dispute where both parents are guardians.  As they feed their way through the system they would in the resolution of family problems help the parent who loses out to understand that they still have a strong legal relationship with the child who lives for more of the time with the other parent.</P>

      <P>I hope Deputy Neville who has made his suggestion about the use of language with the best of intentions will accept the point I made about care and custody orders which are an important part of the Child Care Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter made many interesting points which will be taken into consideration.  He mentioned that the parent who loses out and is not granted custody should understand that they remain their child's guardian.  This relates to people's understanding of the language used in judgments handed down in sensitive cases.</P>
      <P>While I accept Deputy Neville's point I trust he understands I cannot accept the amendments for the reasons given.  A difficulty arises in regard to the meaning of the word &ldquo;care&rdquo; in the Child Care Act as distinct from the word &ldquo;custody&rdquo;.  A further difficulty is that certain sections would be in conflict.  This highlights the need for consolidation.</P>

On the basis that difficulties would arise in regard to the Child Care Act I have reservations about pressing the amendment.  However, I note that the Minister of State accepts the points I made in regard to the use of language in family law legislation, in particular the word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; in the relationship between parents and children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the new section 2 to be inserted in the 1964 Act.  We define words in an odd way. It should be simple to know what the word &ldquo;child&rdquo; means in legislation relating to the guardianship and custody of children.  It is defined as a person who has not attained full age.  If one wants to know what &ldquo;full age&rdquo; means one has to look up the Age of Majority Act, 1985, which was subsequently <Col N="30" /> amended.  This nonsense is so mindboggling and awful that I do not know why we do it in legislation.  Why can we not say that &ldquo;child&rdquo; means a person who has not attained 18 years, if that is what the Minister means?  That would mean something to people.  As we are all aware, the age of majority is 18.  If it means something else that should be spelled out.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be told that this is the formula used in other legislation.  It is equally incomprehensible in other legislation to ordinary people. What does &ldquo;full age&rdquo; mean?  When one is 13 one has reached the full age of 13 and when one is 40 one has reached the full age of 40.  It used to be called the age of majority, I do not know from where the phrase &ldquo;full age&rdquo; came.  I do not care if it is the formula used in other legislation, it should not be used.  If we are talking about persons up to the age of 18, the Bill should state that &ldquo;child&rdquo; means a person who has not attained 18 years.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter that I raised with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  My recollection is that not much was done about it.  I will give the Minister of State a concrete example of what I am talking about.  This section re-enacts provisions inserted in the 1964 Act by the Status of Children Act, 1987.  I wish to refer to the position of parents when the courts grant decrees of annulment.  If one is granted a High Court decree of annulment it effectively means that, although one has been through a ceremony of marriage, it is null and void.  The father of children born to a couple whose marriage has been annulled is not placed in the same legal position as the father of children born to a couple who have not been through a marriage ceremony.  There are special provisions, the effect of which is to preserve the guardianship rights of the father of children born to a couple whose marriage has been annulled. One can argue that it is highly illogical to treat the father of children born to a couple whose marriage has been annulled differently from the father of children born to a couple who are cohabiting and have not bothered to go through a ceremony &mdash; in that context one can make a sound argument to which we will come later &mdash; but in the context of nullity cases there is a particular problem which could be addressed simply by a two sentence addition to the Bill.</P>
      <P>Each year 60 to 70 decrees of annulment are granted by the High Court.  On occasion decisions are appealed to the Supreme Court.  With the onset of divorce it is likely that the number of decrees of annulment being granted will reduce. However, a number will remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A couple go through a very expensive court process in getting a decree of annulment in the High Court which can become even more expensive if there has to be a Supreme Court appeal. When a decree of annulment is granted it involves a declaration that the marriage is at an end.  The couple whose marriage is annulled are often living apart but may be still living under the <Col N="31" /> one roof and they separate only when the decree of annulment is granted.</P>
    <P>In the case of many decrees of annulment there have been one, two or three children born to the couple.  The judge can decide to grant the decree of annulment but cannot, during the nullity hearing, hear evidence about the welfare of the children so as to facilitate the court also taking a decision as to with which parent the child or children should primarily reside &mdash; in other words, which parent should have custody.</P>
    <P>I have talked about this for a long time because, unfortunately, all these cases are heard behind closed doors and Members will not be aware of them unless there has been some type of protest on the part of the individuals involved. As a lawyer I was involved in a nullity case which took 18 months to be heard in the High Court and another 12 months for the Supreme Court appeal to be heard.  In the end the marriage was annulled.  There were a number of children of the family and the parents could not agree on the custody issue.  Because other matters were involved, the whole issue had to be referred back to the High Court to resolve the custody dispute. Because there were property issues to be resolved, everybody ended up in the High Court again.  I thought it was utterly insane that the High Court, when hearing the original nullity case, could not have dealt with the simple issue of which parent should be the primary custodian. It was totally insane that they both had to incur the legal expense of going over it all again.  The family history, in so far as it was relevant to the custody issue, had to be re-explained two years later to a new judge hearing the custody case.</P>
    <P>A simple amendment should be tabled to the Bill to provide that, just as at the conclusion of judicial separation or divorce proceedings, the courts can determine custody disputes between parents at the conclusion of nullity proceedings. It will not cost anyone anything to do it.  Curiously, it might even save the State legal aid system money because some of these cases are dealt with through the Government law centres.</P>
    <P>It is a mystery to me why the Minister for Equality and Law Reform within the tenure of the last Government would not change the law, as is the fact that this issue is not addressed in this Bill.  I hope this Government will address this very simple, straightforward issue because it makes a lot of sense that it be dealt with.</P>

      <P>We can certainly discuss and carefully consider the last points made by Deputy Shatter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to a child who has not attained majority, an attempt is being made to ensure overall consistency because 18 is not necessarily the accepted age of a child in that, in the case of an individual under 18 who has already married, he or she is no longer regarded as a child.  Neither is an individual over 18 in full-time education regarded as a child.  It is generally accepted that <Col N="32" />&ldquo;child&rdquo; means a person who has not attained his or her majority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the Guardianship of Infants Act applies, in the context of custody issues, only to individuals up to the age of 18.  We now have a law in force which provides one cannot marry if under 18 years of age without a special court dispensation.  The Minister might find out for Report Stage how the provisions of the Family Law Act, 1995 are working in practice. Its provisions have been in place for over a year which means that persons under 18 years of age cannot marry without exemption from the courts. Perhaps the Minister could ascertain how many have done so.  Why can we not say a child for the purposes of this Bill means a person who has not attained 18 years of age and who is not married?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 in the name of Deputy Neville.  Since amendment No. 15 is related and Nos. 16 and 17 are alternatives to No. 15, I suggest that amendments Nos. 14 to 17, inclusive, be taken together.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;The Act of 1964 is hereby amended by the insertion of the following section:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;2A.  In relation to cases to which section 2(4) would have applied but for the fact that the mother has withheld her consent, the court may order her to do so if it decides it was unreasonably withheld.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the requirement that fathers must go to court to become guardians of their child or children will no longer apply following the implementation of this Bill.  However, the Bill falls short of what is required to address the position of single fathers who wish to fulfil their role, obligations and responsibilities as a parent.  Single fathers, as of right, should have an entitlement to a relationship with their child or children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date the presumption in law has been that single fathers do not have such right and must seek and obtain agreement to that right.  The requirement to have arrangements made with regard to access to the child or children as a precondition to availing of the best benefits of the section could give rise to a catch-22 position in the case of fathers in that their not having guardianship can be detrimental to their prospects of <Col N="33" /> obtaining satisfactory custody and access rights. Yet a single father cannot obtain guardianship unless custody and access arrangements have been agreed.  The changes outlined in the Bill do not render it any easier for a single father to establish guardianship or joint guardianship in that, in cases where the mother agrees, the courts would probably grant guardianship to the father anyway.  Under the law as it stands children of single parents are discriminated against in comparison with those of a married couple in their relationship with their father, that relationship having an inferior status in the eyes of the law and of society in general.</P>
    <P>My amendment stipulates that the fact that the mother has withheld her consent should not be decisive, that the court may order her to grant consent if it decides it was unreasonably withheld. In other words, the court would take that decision rather than have the withholding of the mother's consent upheld.  We are progressing from the point at which it is the norm for fathers to be entitled to joint custody unless there is a strong reason for withholding such consent.  In other words, we are progressing from the point at which the father must make a case or apply for and justify his position in order to obtain custody rights to his child or children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment on my amendment No. 15.  This is a very important section.  Deputy Shatter mentioned the overall issue of joint guardianship being central in parenting. As the Minister of State correctly pointed out, it applies as a principle only in the case of married parents; it is not an automatic principle in relation to unmarried parents.</P>
      <P>This section seeks to modify the process whereby an unmarried father can become guardian of his child or children but does not grant it as an automatic right.  I challenge the approach adopted in the Bill to this matter.  While accepting that we have made progress generally in recognising children who are not born within a marriage and the abolition of the concept of illegitimacy, enshrined in a very progressive Act, nonetheless we must continue to recognise that families are now very different from what they were in the past, that if we continue to promote the principle that parentage is in effect solely tied up with marriage, particularly in the case of the father, we are not recognising the needs of the child or children, those of the parents or the manner in which society is reforming itself and being shaped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A quarter of babies born in Holles Street hospital are born to mothers not in the traditional marriage relationship.  When a Bill like this is put forward, it reflects the realities of life as opposed to what we would wish those realities to be.  Traditionally fathers had enormous control in families and mothers were, in effect, dependent on fathers.  I spent much of my political life fighting that principle, and I am glad we have achieved so much, but I am not happy that we have now <Col N="34" /> turned that principle around to the point where, in certain circumstances, fathers are now dependent on mothers.  That was not our aim when we fought for equality.</P>
    <P>This is an important part of the Bill.  It is not acceptable that it is solely within the gift of the mother to grant guardianship to the father of her child.  I recognise, however, that there are problems associated with automatic guardianship. Problems exist even in cases where couples are married but what we are ultimately saying &mdash; I do not have a legal background but I can recognise what is being presented in the Bill &mdash; is that the right of the mother is absolute when it comes to the guardianship issue.  She can agree to the unmarried father being a guardian to the child and, if she does so, the procedure is made much easier.  That is welcome but if we are saying, as people continue to say publicly and privately, that the role of fathers is not sufficiently developed and recognised, we must reflect that view in the Bill.  If we are saying that we are not happy with a society where so many women are rearing children on their own and where the fathers of those children are missing, either because they do not want to know their children or they have been prevented from knowing them, that issue must be addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It takes two people to make a baby and to rear a child.  The responsibilities and rights of fatherhood are not being addressed in the Bill.  We are not giving sufficient consideration to the fact that society has changed significantly and in ways that, at least in part, are cause for concern.  We must include fathers in a way that they are established as having rights and that they are challenged to take responsibility.  If we fail to do that, we are simply reinforcing a pattern that will not be good for society as a whole nor for the individuals who have the rights and responsibilities of parents, regardless of whether they are married.</P>
    <P>This amendment states that the unmarried father should have automatic guardianship unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so affecting the child's best interests.  That establishes a caveat to ensure that the child's best interests are always central to any decisions made in this regard, a view we all share, but surely it is in the child's best interests, unless there are compelling reasons otherwise, that the child should know and have a relationship with its father and that the father should recognise the relationship and be involved in parenting the child.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons parents are not good parents in certain circumstances but that does not negate the fact that, if we do not amend this section, we are not fully recognising that fatherhood is of equal status, albeit different, to motherhood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak to my amendment No. 16.  This is an important part of the Bill and I agree with previous speakers. There is a perception &mdash; which must be addressed in the Bill &mdash; that in some cases fathers do not <Col N="35" /> care about their children.  Language is important also because it is my understanding from discussions I have had with constituents over the years &mdash; and I do not have any legal training &mdash; that couples go to court because they are unable to reach agreement.  It would be better if couples could sort out their difficulties because those difficulties become greater if they are forced to go to court.</P>
      <P>My amendment, which replaces the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; with &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, will give the natural father an entitlement to claim recognition for his equal parental status.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is a direction to the court to favour joint guardianship.  It is my understanding that in many court cases guardianship is awarded to the mother but both the father and the mother have equal responsibilities to the child.  It is incumbent on the court, therefore, to award joint custody to both parents.  This is a technical area because, as Deputy Shatter stated earlier, the practicalities involved are difficult but if guardianship is not awarded to both parents, fathers may feel they cannot have an input into the rearing of their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the comments made by previous speakers.  The role of the father in the upbringing of a child is extremely important. As Deputy McManus said, the emphasis must be on the best interests of the child but we often lose sight of that.  The overriding consideration in many marriage breakdowns seems to be the convenience of the parents rather than the best interests of the child.  We cannot overestimate the importance of a father figure in a child's life. Deputy McManus gave the figure for the number of children born to single parents but I understand the most recent figure, for the first six months of this year, is approximately 28 per cent nationwide.  That would indicate that the figure may be higher in city areas.  That will have serious implications for those children in the long term if we do not give fathers a role in their upbringing.</P>
      <P>There is a void in the lives of children who do not have a father figure.  More than 80 per cent of primary school teachers are female which means that children being brought up by their mothers do not have an influential father figure in their lives.  That will have consequences for them in later life.  Others might disagree but I feel strongly that it is the case.  We might not address it in this legislation but it is a matter that should be addressed.  When considering the amendments we should take into account the importance of the father's role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come across the sad situations that can result from marriage breakdown.  Making provisions in legislation might not provide the full solution.  I recall a case in which a married couple with four children separated.  The court agreement was that the father should leave the family home but that he should have access to the children, particularly the youngest child.  However, the practicalities of organising the access meant <Col N="36" /> that the mother had total control over the child and she did not facilitate the father in allowing access.  In the periods when the child was to be with the father the mother made excuses or made the child unavailable.  They went back to court several times to resolve the matter and in the end the judge told the father that the only option he had was to jail the mother because she was in breach of the court order on access.  In fairness to the father he decided that it was not in the child's best interests to put the mother in jail.  We must examine how we can deal with such situations.</P>
    <P>It may be a matter outside the scope of this Bill but it is a consideration to be borne in mind when building a framework in legislation.  We must consider the problems of fathers' access to their children. The father's role should not be underestimated. I support the amendments and I hope the Minister of State will take our points on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGrath referred to the father's role.  I criticise the State for allowing so many fathers to escape their responsibilities. The State has nurtured and developed the unfortunately high numbers of lone parents.  I am not a paragon of virtue but I have not brought a child into the world that I could not support.  I indict the thousands of flyaway, phantom fathers who bring children into the world and expect the State to pay for their fun.  I object to that and so should every taxpayer.  I do not deny the right of a lone parent to receive support from the State for one or two children.  However, there are young people who have made an industry out of lone parenthood and I take exception to that.</P>
      <P>In addressing matters the House attempts to be caring.  However, I suggest that the pendulum has swung too far in that regard, to the point where we are underwriting promiscuity.  Has the Minister of State any indication of the numbers of fathers who are paying maintenance for their offspring and how many walk away from their responsibilities?</P>
      <P>Some years ago I addressed this matter in the House and I received varying reactions.  Many lone parents felt that I had attacked them. However, that was not my intention.  I am concerned about lone parents.  There is nothing sadder than a young pregnant woman of 16 or 17 years of age who comes to a public representative's clinic.  Some of them never see the fathers of their children again.  It is tragic.  The State provides a breeding ground for such activity.  I do not refer to the matter in its moral aspects.  I am talking about stopping the terrible extent of promiscuity. In a few years' time brothers will be marrying their sisters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In America they say there is no such thing as a free lunch.  There is virtually no social welfare in that country.  It is a land of milk and honey for some but for the inadequate it is a dreadful place because of the lack of a caring society.  In that country, if a girl becomes pregnant she has no recourse but to take a paternity suit against the man who made her pregnant.  In this country the <Col N="37" /> State stands idly by when it should pursue the unmarried fathers.</P>
    <P>There are a few responsible fathers.  The State should examine this matter seriously because we are creating a paradise for the irresponsible.  This is a matter which should concern all parties in the House.  A radical reappraisal of the situation is needed.  There are very few responsible fathers and the legislators are making it easier for the many irresponsible fathers.  If a man brings a child into the world he should be made to pay for the child until that child is able to look after itself. That should apply whether the man is a businessman or a labourer and if he is on the dole the maintenance should be taken from his social welfare payment.  The State should not be made responsible for the children brought into the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

      <P>On the issue of guardianship, if a situation arises where an unmarried father does not apply for guardianship or has been denied it and the mother dies, what is the father's status, given that he has not had guardianship, although he may be following Deputy McGahon's advice and looking after the children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case the father would have to apply to the court for guardianship. Deputy McGahon's points were interesting.  We have all had similar experiences in our clinics. This may not be the Bill in which to address the matter.  The question which arises in this context is whether giving automatic guardianship to the phantom fathers, to whom Deputy McGahon refers, will encourage them to take their responsibilities more seriously.  That is the question being posed.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath's question about access after marriage breakdown is not what we are dealing with here &mdash; we are discussing guardianship in the context of unmarried parents, whereas a married father would be the guardian of that child in any case.  If that couple went to court and one was granted custody of the child, both would have the same guardianship rights because they had been married.  The Deputy made an important point about the child's best interests and we all bear that in mind in talking of these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments are broadly similar; their effect is to provide that where an unmarried father applies to the court for guardianship he shall be made a guardian of the child jointly with the mother unless there are compelling reasons <Col N="38" /> why he should not be.  Deputy Moynihan-Cronin's point related to the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. We have given these amendments much thought. Under the law as it stands in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the married parents of a child are the guardians jointly &mdash; that relates to the case mentioned by Deputy McGrath.  In relation to unmarried parents the mother is the guardian of the child.  If the child's father subsequently marries the mother he automatically becomes joint guardian.  Where the father is not married to the mother he can apply to the courts under section 6A of the Act to become a joint guardian. In response to Deputy McManus's question, he can so apply whether or not the mother is alive at that time.  Section 6A, as inserted by the Status of Children Act, 1987, provides that where the father and mother of an infant are not married to each other the court may, on application of the father, by order appoint him to be guardian of the infant.  We are discussing the choice between &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this provision and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the amendments. In coming to all decisions on children the court must, under section 3 of the 1964 Act, regard the welfare of the child as paramount and all would support that.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister outlined the background which informed our existing law but some of that background should be repeated for the purposes of this debate.  In 1982 the Law Reform Commission's report on illegitimacy recommended a number of changes to the law, on foot of which the Government passed the Status of Children Act, 1987.  The commission was of the view that the principle of equality required that no distinction should be made in the legal rights of guardianship on the basis of marital status.  It recommended that both parents of a child should be joint guardians whether the child was born inside or outside marriage.</P>
    <P>In considering the commission's recommendations in the context of preparing the legislation which led to the Status of Children Act, 1987, the then Government had regard to the fact that the extent and character of the relationship of the father of a child born outside marriage to both the mother and the child varies greatly &mdash; this was mentioned by Deputy McGahon.  Cases vary from a child being conceived as a result of a casual relationship to a child being conceived in a stable relationship which has all the characteristics of a family.  One concern of the then Government was that to accord the father of a child born outside marriage a defeasible right would result in greater recourse to the courts, because the number of cases in which mothers would have no option but to seek the withdrawal of the father's guardian status would far exceed the relatively low number of cases where fathers would seek appointment as guardian.  The then Government considered it invidious to place the onus on the mother to have the father's guardianship rights terminated and decided that, rather than giving a father of a child born outside marriage an automatic right of guardianship, he <Col N="39" /> should be given a right to apply to court to become guardian of the child jointly with the mother.</P>
    <P>Much of the criticism of the position of unmarried fathers stems from the common belief that those who apply to the courts to be made joint guardians of their children are discriminated against and that if the mother opposes the application, the father has little chance &mdash; this is a concern of some Deputies.  However, court statistics show this is not the case.  In 1996 approximately 12,500 children were born to unmarried parents and some 700 applications for guardianship were made to the courts by unmarried fathers.  In approximately 90 per cent of these cases, the court made the unmarried father a guardian of the child jointly with the mother.  Of these 700 cases, 400 were made in agreement with the mother.  My understanding from the courts is that they will refuse guardianship to a father only in cases where he is clearly unsuitable to be a guardian.</P>
    <P>The report of the 1996 constitutional review group, in considering the position of unmarried fathers, pointed out that a natural father has no personal right to his child which the State is bound to protect under Article 43 of the Constitution, and that section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, as inserted by the Status of Children Act, 1987, has been construed by the Supreme Court as giving an unmarried father a right to apply to the court to be appointed a guardian as distinct from giving to him a right to be a guardian which is capable of being annulled &mdash; that is, a defeasible right.  The group states that any criticism of the fact that a natural father does not have a constitutionally protected, personal right in relation to his child can readily be understood as regards a natural father who lives in a stable relationship with the natural mother or who has established a relationship with that child. However, it argues that there does not appear to be justification for giving constitutional rights to every natural father simply by reason of biological links; and that, were consideration to be given to any modification of Article 40.2.1 expressly to include unmarried parents, care would have to be taken with the drafting to avoid giving rights to natural fathers who have no relationship other than a biological bond with the child.</P>
    <P>At present the courts must, in cases of dispute, decide the guardianship of the unmarried father on the basis of the best interests of the child.  The father, being the applicant, must adduce evidence to support his case and refute any evidence to the contrary.  The effect of these amendments would be to create a presumption in favour of the father in all cases, irrespective of the relationship, stable or otherwise, which exists between the parents. The mother would then have the onus of displacing or refuting that presumption.  It is a matter for strong consideration, given the vulnerable position in which many unmarried mothers find themselves, particularly where they have taken on all <Col N="40" /> responsibilities for their child, that they should be placed in that position.  The Bill as framed does not provide for any fundamental change to the law in this area &mdash; rightly, in my view.  It has been carefully measured and balanced and for that reason it is supported by the Government.  It is precisely because the law currently operates without apparent difficulty that there is no need for the fundamental, unnecessary and contentious changes proposed in the amendment.</P>
    <P>The reality which cannot be ignored is that 12,500 children are born to unmarried parents annually and only a small proportion of the fathers of those children are sufficiently concerned to apply to court for full rights of guardianship and, in effect, to mark themselves out as having full responsibility in all matters affecting their children.  Were a presumption of rights of guardianship to be accorded it would place the onus on the mother, perhaps not in all cases but certainly in those where she would consider it necessary to displace that presumption.  It is important to recognise that the Bill improves the existing position of unmarried fathers and mothers by allowing joint guardianship by agreement without the need to go to court as is the case at present.  That should, on present figures, remove 400 non-contested cases per year out of the court system and better facilitate the position of unmarried fathers where guardianship is not in dispute.  Our law on that basis would be broadly similar to that in the UK. Where the parents cannot agree on guardianship each case will be decided, as at present, on its merits by reference to what is in the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 31, which is due to be discussed later, will have a bearing on the practice of the courts in those cases where the unmarried father seeks guardianship and the mother is in dispute.  That amendment, which is inspired by the provision of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, is to the effect that in considering an application for guardianship the court shall have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relationships and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pursue certain aspects of this matter with the Minister of State.  We agree the main principle must be the welfare of children. The most important principle is that decisions made in this area regard as paramount the welfare of the children concerned.  However, the State has an interest, in the context of children's welfare, in encouraging both parents of a child born outside marriage to maintain a full relationship with the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with Deputy McGahon's view although I probably would not express myself in such flowery terms.  Too many children are born in this State whose fathers regard themselves as <Col N="41" /> having no responsibility to pay child support.  In most cases the mother is left to bring up the baby with no help from the father and certainly with no financial assistance.  We still have not solved the problem of what should be done to ensure that fathers of children born outside marriage meet their financial responsibilities to their children and to the mothers of their children.  I doubt that we will ever find the perfect solution to that problem.</P>
    <P>We do not always differentiate sufficiently between fathers in different circumstances and that will eventually get us into trouble with the European Court.  At present, if a child or children are born to a couple who are cohabiting and have been in a regular relationship for a period of time, the father of such children is not automatically the guardian of the children.  I welcome the reform in the Bill which provides for a guardianship arrangement to be established without recourse to a court order.  I have been suggesting such a reform for a long time.  People do not conduct their family relationships by going to solicitors' offices, getting legal advice and completing legal documentation but the format proposed in the Bill envisages the necessity for such formal action.  It has merit in so far as when people enter into arrangements they will, presumably, get proper legal advice on such arrangements.  However, it could create difficulties which I will draw to the attention of the Minister for State.</P>
    <P>If a mother completes a declaration and a joint guardianship arrangement is put in place by agreement, it is important the mother understands the legal consequences so that if the relationship between her and the father runs into difficulties, there will not be a series of court cases in the future in which the mother will allege she did not obtain independent legal advice or that she did not understand the consequences of what she was doing and the joint guardianship agreement should be set aside.  I am not sure to what extent the Bill addresses that problem.</P>
    <P>I favour the availability of joint guardianship, without the necessity for court proceedings, for couples who have children outside marriage. However, if the legislation provides for a procedure in that context which requires the signing of formal legal documentation, we must ensure a mother does not, under pressure and in circumstances which are contrary to the welfare of the child, enter into such a statutory declaration.  If at a later stage the mother alleges she did not agree to the joint guardianship, how is the court to deal with the issue?</P>
    <P>People live in violent relationships both inside and outside marriage and most often the woman is the victim of the violence.  Often a woman can be forced to do things under threat which she would not otherwise do.  I do not disagree with the principle of the proposal but on Report Stage we must examine how it will work in practice. The documentation that is envisaged will require legal advice.  Does the law ensure that before a joint declaration is put in place the mother is <Col N="42" /> given independent legal advice so she will understand the consequences of what she is doing?</P>
    <P>I raise this issue because of the many problems which have arisen over the years in the context of adoption legislation as a result of mothers signing agreements to place children for adoption and then changing their minds.  There has been a litany of such court cases.  That is one problem this legislation does not clearly address.  If a dispute ever arises about the validity of a declaration of joint guardianship, the legislation should confer express jurisdiction on the District Court to resolve that dispute.  Otherwise people might find themselves in the High Court and put to great expense to sort it out.</P>
    <P>There is another relevant issue.  In the context of the welfare of children the agreement proposed in the legislation might be concluded between people who have never cohabited, have no intention of cohabiting but who wish to co-operate in the interests of their child.  The other side of the coin is that children are born to many couples who are cohabiting but who do not marry.  Like marriage relationships, relationships between cohabitees break up.  As in the case of marriage, when one is cohabiting and the relationship is fine one does not conduct one's relationship by concluding legal agreements and seeking the advice of lawyers.  The last thing a couple want to do, often quite rightly, is approach a lawyer.  They are better off getting on with their relationships.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the argument as to whether fathers should have an automatic joint guardianship right, we do not differentiate between children born to families in stable cohabiting relationships outside marriage and children born as a result of perhaps a single night relationship between mother and father.  The Domestic Violence Act, 1996, includes a provision which, although I believe it has a number of defects, recognises the cohabitation relationship and provides certain protections for a cohabitee who is the victim of violence.  That victim can get barring orders or protection orders which would not apply to people who have not cohabited.  There should be a presumption of guardianship for some fathers of children born outside marriage which is in the interests of the welfare of children and should not require the signing of declarations and agreements or court orders.  For example, if a couple have been living together for four or five years, have one or two children and at the end of five or six years their relationship breaks up, the children have a good relationship with both parents. Should there not be a presumption that the father of those children is their joint guardian? That should not require the initiation of court proceedings.</P>
    <P>Under the Domestic Violence Act, if a couple have been cohabiting for 12 months, in certain circumstances a cohabitee who is the victim of violence can obtain a barring order.  It would seem that our legislation needs to recognise what I would describe as the realities of family life <Col N="43" /> which include an increasing number of cohabitees in stable relationships.</P>
    <P>If we leave fathers of children born outside marriage in a different position, in relation to guardianship issues, from fathers of children born within marriage we need to have a separate category for children born of stable relationships where the mother and father have been cohabiting for a specified period of time.  In those circumstances there should be a presumption of joint guardianship.  If we do not do that we will at some future stage be found to have been in violation of European law.  Under Article VIII of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the State has an obligation to provide respect for family life.</P>
    <P>In the Keegan case relating to the adoption area we were found not to afford respect for family life because we did not recognise properly within our legal system the rights of a father of a child born to a stable relationship in circumstances where the mother placed the child for adoption after the relationship broke up.</P>
    <P>If our legislation does not confer some presumption or automatic right of guardianship on fathers of children born to people who are cohabiting in a family relationship the European Court will force us, ultimately, to address that particular issue.  We might address it in this legislation.</P>
    <P>We should look more positively towards the concept of a presumption of joint guardianship where children are born outside marriage.  I take the point that in reality few fathers annually seek orders of guardianship, even with agreement.  It is quite extraordinary if one talks about providing parental equality in the context of the current legal position.  I did a quick calculation based on the statistics the Minster of State gave me.  She is welcome to correct me if I have got it wrong, but it seems that no more than one out of every 20 &mdash; perhaps the correct figure is 22 &mdash; fathers of children born outside marriage annually seek guardianship orders.  One would have expected more to do so.  I suspect more do not because they are concerned that if they did they would be forced to provide support for their children.</P>
    <P>Though I start from a biased position where I would like to see a presumption of joint guardianship in the context of children's welfare, I cannot take seriously demands that all fathers be given automatic joint guardianship of children born outside marriage if the vast majority of fathers of such children are so little concerned with their children's welfare that they do not provide any contributions that we are aware of by way of support payments.</P>
    <P>From my own knowledge, some fathers certainly voluntarily provide support without going to court.  While we do not know how many fathers provide support towards the upkeep of children born to unmarried mothers, we know that a large number of unmarried mothers currently receive social welfare by way of a one parent family payment. <Col N="44" /> I am not critical of that.  The State must make that provision and it is right to do so, but the State should do some research.  We cannot assume that mothers in receipt of one parent family payments never get any money by way of support from the fathers of their children.  That issue has not been adequately researched and it is something that needs to be looked at in greater detail.</P>
    <P>We also need to see what we should do as a society to encourage and ensure that fathers of children born outside marriage contribute towards the support of their children.</P>
    <P>As we are finally addressing this issue in the legislation, we must distinguish between children who have formed a secure and ongoing relationship with their fathers in a family setting where the father and mother have been cohabiting for a period of time.  In those circumstances there is no answer to the case that there should be an automatic presumption of joint guardianship. However, providing joint guardianship <i>en bloc</i> in all circumstances is an issue of great difficulty and debate based on our current knowledge and what appears to be the limited number of fathers of children born outside marriage who involve themselves in the lives of their children.</P>
    <P>Up to the mid-1960s and early 1970s the law in relation to child custody issues often seemed father centred, particularly in the marriage area but less so in relation to children born outside marriage.  There is a growing concern on the part of fathers of children born outside marriage, who want to be involved with their children's lives, that the law has now become mother centred. Rather than being based on the welfare of the child it is on occasion based more on the mother's perspective.</P>
    <P>A balance is required here and I say that as someone who has worked in the area of family law and is conscious of the fact that in the context of the vast majority of one parent families of children born outside marriage it is the mother who carries the day to day burden of caring for her child.  In far too many instances the father has no interest in involving himself in a relationship with his child.  That does not apply where a child is born to people who have cohabited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the reply of the Minister of State and I appreciate that this is a difficult area.  The original point the Minister of State made was that the Law Reform Commission proposed there should not be any differentiation.  The fear arose that if there was no differentiation between married and unmarried fathers as guardians it could lead to a growth in court actions.  Can the Minister of State say what the evidence was when that decision was made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be careful when we talk about numbers. It is extraordinary that 12,500 babies were born to unmarried couples, yet there were only 700 applications for guardianship.  We will have to carry out research in this area to know what <Col N="45" /> exactly is going on.  I accept the point that many fathers fear being caught and thus being obliged to provide finance for their children, but there may be many fathers who do not even know they could apply for guardianship.  There may also be others who are afraid to apply because the mother has clearly shown she does not want to have any involvement with the father, even through the child.</P>
    <P>We should not presume to know why there is this huge disparity between the number of babies born and the number of fathers who seek guardianship. I know of examples where they can be cohabiting and are still not guardians.  They may not feel the need to go to court in those circumstances because they are cohabiting and acting in a father's role.</P>
    <P>I have a difficulty with the idea that a father of a child is not the guardian of that child.  I have a problem with the fact that we now have a society which has not resolved the issue of fathers.  In the old days there was a clear solution to all this; it was called the shotgun wedding.  That was an answer and it meant that many children, who nowadays would be born outside marriage, were born within marriage.  Whatever about the deficiencies of the system then, it is clearly not the solution now.  This does not mean we can say that because most fathers do not care we do not have to reflect a connection between them and the child other than that channelled through the mother.  Such an approach shows we do not acknowledge the role of the father and I do not agree with it.  I do not underestimate the Minister's role in this area.  She referred to the Constitution. Presumably the same arguments were raised during the debate on illegitimacy.  We no longer discriminate between children born inside and outside marriage.  Yet we continue to discriminate against fathers whose children are born outside marriage.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look again at this issue.  We should not merely tinker with the system and accept the <i>status quo</i> where responsibility lies with the mother.  If one starts from that premise then only a few of the 12,500 unmarried fathers will acknowledge their children.  This may be because men do not care but it may also be because they are not allowed to care; in other words, they are excluded because the State supports are directed towards the mother.  I have no problem in providing mothers with support to rear their children but I have a problem with the failure to recognise in legal and social terms that every child has a father who, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary, is the natural guardian together with the mother.  I do not know the proper formula or mechanism but the Department has not looked sufficiently at this matter.  The old idea that marriage is good and that the birth of children outside marriage is bad still seems to exist.  We seem to be trundling along in the desperate hope that marriage will somehow come back into fashion.  However, this will not happen. Much as I dislike Deputy McGahon's language, I agree that it is not good for society to ignore <Col N="46" /> the connection between a father and his child.  I ask the Minister to look again at this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the points made by Deputy McManus.  There seems to be an assumption under the law that fatherhood in an unmarried context is bad and one must prove to the courts that one is a proper guardian.  This is a wrong assumption as a connection between a father and his child is good.  If we do not provide for joint custody we will deprive a child of a connection with his father and his relations.  Under the law we begin from the premise that a child should not have a connection with 50 per cent of his family.  While there may be difficulties in doing so, we should start from the premise that a father has a positive contribution to make to the rearing of his child.  We are discriminating against children by denying them access to their fathers and putting the onus on fathers to prove they can make a positive contribution to the rearing of their children in terms of morals, culture, values etc.  My amendment No. 17 seeks to achieve this.</P>
      <P>Section 9 states:</P>
      <P>For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the court, in making an order under section 11, may, if it thinks it appropriate, grant custody of a child to the child's father and mother jointly.</P>
      <P>This means the court must question the appropriateness of granting joint custody rather than assuming that both parents should have joint custody. There should be an obligation on a father to play a role in the rearing of his child.  As Deputy McManus correctly stated, the number of unmarried parents will continue to increase.  This year 28 per cent of children were born to unmarried mothers.  Given the way society is developing we are in danger of excluding fathers from playing a role in the rearing of their children.  The time has come to review the role of unmarried fathers and to challenge them about their obligations.</P>

      <P>This debate is long overdue and I am delighted we are having it.  I urge the Minister to try to ascertain why so many fathers do not apply for guardianship.  This is not to say that fathers who do not apply for guardianship are flippant and do not care but we must make them accountable and responsible.  Every father should support his child financially and otherwise.</P>
      <P>It may not come within the Minister's remit but would it be possible to require mothers to include the father's name on the birth certificate? However, that may be another day's work. Society is changing and our laws must reflect this for the betterment of children.</P>

      <P>I have taken careful note of the points made by Deputies.  Under the Bill fathers in stable relationships will not have to go to court to seek guardianship.  This is a positive <Col N="47" /> development.  There is no presumption in section 9 that a father is bad.  The section is neutral. However, it is presumed in 90 per cent of cases that it is in the best interests of the child to make the father a guardian.</P>

      <P>As in the case of the referenda on divorce and bail, an <i>ad hoc</i> commission comprising the Ombudsman, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad has been established at the invitation of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to supervise the production and publication of an information statement setting out concisely the case for and against the proposed constitutional amendment. Advertisements were placed in the media at the end of September 1997 inviting all interested parties to forward submissions to the <i>ad hoc</i> commission with a view to their being included in presentations to be prepared.  The Bar Council nominated two members, both senior counsel, to prepare statements setting out the arguments for and against the proposal.  Each counsel was assigned to produce a statement of approximately 700 words, these statements to form the basis of an information campaign.</P>
      <P>The statements will be published this week for the information of voters.  All provincial press and the major free sheets will carry the notices in their next issue on or after 20 October.  The national daily and evening newspapers will carry the feature tomorrow.  All national papers will carry the notices on Sunday, 26 October.  In these notices, the text of the proposed amendment and the two prepared statements will be printed in full.  They will appear as full page notices in broadsheets and as a two-page feature in tabloids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> The cost of this information is yet to be determined but it is estimated to be in the region of £400,000 and will be borne in the Vote for my Department.  It is not intended to give funds to any group or to underwrite any other promotion.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied these measures meet the standards of fairness and impartiality required in the use of public funds.  The outlay is sufficient to ensure an informed public understanding of the issue is achieved by polling day on 30 October 1997.</P>
    <P>A great deal of care and consideration was invested in preparing the proposal which is being submitted to the people.  That consideration sought to establish a balance between confidentiality and disclosure in the public interest, and a satisfactory balance was achieved.  I have expressed my appreciation of the excellent work of the former Attorney General in this complex issue.  I have indicated that I was not sufficiently confident of such scope to improve the wording as would justify the delay for further review.  The Government, therefore, commends the constitutional amendment to the people and asks for their endorsement of it in the forthcoming referendum.</P>

I am concerned, however, the public will not understand the issues involved on polling day.  There has been no debate apart from some comments made in this House.  If Deputy O'Malley from the Progressive Democrats had not raised the matter there would have been less public comment on it.  Will the Taoiseach consider other measures to ensure a level of understanding by the voters generally, which is warranted?  We are dealing with a major proposal to change the Constitution and there is an insufficient level of understanding among the public.</P>

      <P>From the time the Bill was published on 1 May up to the debate here in midSeptember there was not a single word about the matter in the national or provincial press, or elsewhere in the political domain.  During the past four weeks the issue was discussed on a number of programmes on the national media, and all parties contributed to those debates.  My party put forward a number of speakers to take part in debates in universities and we will continue to do that.  From the point of view of the Government and the political parties, which, under the new rules arising from the McKenna and Hanafin cases, are not as restricted in promoting such matters, we will try to promote the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Spring in that from most comments made, people still believe there are archives or records of detailed minutes of Cabinet meetings.  When I introduced the referendum legislation in the Dáil and Seanad I went to great lengths to explain that since the Ambiorix case in 1991 memoranda issued with arguments for and <Col N="49" /> against an issue may be brought into the public domain.  In addition, Cabinet decisions may be made public.  All records are kept in compliance with the National Archives Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>The issue dealt with by the former and the present Attorneys General relates to discussions, and there is no record of discussions except in rare cases.  The Secretary General of the Government may outline on the pink slips some detail to assist the Government in formulating a decision, but Sir Dermot Nally, who was in that position for some time, put forward cases on this matter at the request of the previous Government to show that rarely are records of discussions kept. While those against the amendment say that we should put discussions of the Government in the public domain, there is no record of those discussions. Under the 1937 Constitution, the principle that applies is that of collective Cabinet responsibility and, therefore, there should be no need for people to say that any one person made a decision.  The public wonder why we will not put forward the minute book, but there is no minute book.  That is the issue, in these remaining days, on which we must convince the electorate.</P>
    <P>A great amount of useful work was carried out by Mr. Gleeson on this matter, which was recorded and in time will be available in the public domain.  I decided to move on this issue without further delay in view of the McCracken tribunal and the Moriarty and planning tribunals which may require that some of these issues should be in the public domain.  For that reason it would be unwise to delay the referendum.  Even if it was delayed further, I am not sure the wording could be improved upon.</P>

Will the Taoiseach consider issuing a joint statement by the parties, a majority of whom support the referendum &mdash; although there is a difficulty in the Progressive Democrats as Deputy O'Malley has expressed a contrary view?  It might be worthwhile issuing a statement from all the party leaders so that there is a clear indication of their intentions.

In the 1920s the secretaries of Governments recorded more detailed minutes on the pink slips, but that position changed in the late 1920s or early 1930s.  The pink sheets are now available but there are times when this may not be the case.  Issues were raised about the procedures relating to the release of Cabinet documents &mdash; which would include some of these documents &mdash; to the National Archives.  This matter <Col N="50" /> was discussed after some members of the National Archives asked for clarification.</P>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I put that decision, to which there were four aspects, on the record: (a) that the archives which are already open to the public through the National Archives which may disclose references to discussions at Government can no longer be considered to attract confidentiality and should continue to be made available to the public; (b) the officers of Departments who were authorised under section 8(4) of the National Archives Act, 1986, to withhold documents under the 30 year rule should, as heretofore, continue to certify and release Cabinet documents subject to the normal provisions of the Act relating to security and only in so far as any such document purports to record references to discussions as distinct from decisions, conclusions or orientations at meetings of the Government, the authorising officer should consult the secretary general of the Government before deciding on the release of such a document; (c) the authorised officer of the Department of the Taoiseach under section 8(4) of the National Archives Act, 1986, for the purpose of consenting to a certificate withholding Cabinet documents which purport to record references to discussions at meetings of the Government should be the Secretary General of the Government and (d) the Secretary General of the Government should review at least once in every subsequent period of five years any Department records retained under section 8(4) of the National Archives Act, 1986, in so far as there may be references to discussions of meetings of the Government.  The reason for those decisions was to ensure none of the present practices which would affect the national archives under the 1986 Act would be affected.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it is not true that the proposal the House has agreed would have the effect of cementing in place an absolute confidentiality rule but rather is one which provides a specific mechanism for relaxing an absolute confidentiality rule where the interests of justice require it and far from being a closing of the door it is an opening of the door but with appropriate safeguards?  Will the Taoiseach agree it is not true that the proposal we are putting before the people is turning a valuable political convention into a dangerous constitutional ban, rather it is the case that there is an absolute confidentiality rule and an absolute ban on the basis of a Supreme Court interpretation of the existing Constitution in regard to collective responsibility and that the absolute ban exists and is being relaxed?  It is not the case that this proposal is tightening up the position, rather it is relaxing it in a way that is in the public interest in the view of the majority of Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with both those statements.  It should be recalled that in 1992 a majority in the Supreme Court upheld the principle <Col N="51" /> of absolute confidentiality of Government discussions.  The judgment did not relate to Government documents, in respect of which the courts had established the Ambiorex case in 1991. The intention behind the amendment is that the principle of Cabinet confidentiality which the Supreme Court held was implicit in the doctrine of collective responsibility of membership of the Government enshrined in the Constitution is being made explicit and provision is being made for disclosure.  The two instances are where the High Court considers that such disclosure is in the interests of the administration of justice by a court or the overriding public interest prevails and a tribunal of inquiry, appointed on the authority of the Houses of the Oireachtas, wishes to investigate a matter of public importance.  The two exceptions, which Deputy Bruton is highlighting, being provided for in the proposed amendment improve the position.  I have not yet heard an argument that can disprove that fact. There are two important exceptions.  I have no doubt in the course of time they will prove their merit.  It is desirable that the amendment be made now when there are at least two tribunals in progress and one concluding.  In its examination of the Whitaker report on the Constitution, the Constitution Review Group which urged caution about any fundamental change on Cabinet confidentiality or how it should be dealt with, signalled the High Court route.  That is precisely what this amendment does.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree there is considerable merit in the suggestion made by Deputy Spring of a joint statement by party leaders on this matter?  Will he also agree there is common sense in having a normal rule of absolute confidentiality in the sense that one will not be able to get a Cabinet working as a team if people feel they must go to Cabinet and say things simply for the record, in order to protect their position subsequently.  If we want the Government to work as a team we should be in a position where it can simply deal with the issue at hand without the necessity, because of the possibility of subsequent disclosure, to put all sorts of things on the record.  If that were to be the approach Cabinet meetings would take five to ten times as long and that would not be in the interests of good Government.  Would he agree with that proposition from the point of view of his experience as Taoiseach and as Minister?  Certainly that has been my experience as both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  I have been lucky, with many others in the House, but not the majority, to have been at the Cabinet table for on or off 15 years.  The only point on which I disagree with Deputy Bruton is not that Cabinet meetings would take hours but that they would not reach decisions.  People would continue to put their positions but would not come to conclusions because they would then have to stand by positions <Col N="52" /> which would be in the public domain.  Those who are opposed to this amendment argue there is some secrecy because the discussions never reach the public domain and nobody really knows the arguments.  The fact is the arguments do reach the public domain because Government memoranda are all about the arguments.  For example, if the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation puts forward a case about some sporting matter it is circulated to all Departments where everyone puts arguments for or against.  The Government memorandum makes the decision from the historical point of view and the historical analysis. In this and in other countries when people are writing their memoirs or an historical account on issues which took place during the course of their life in Cabinet they always relate to Government memoranda and are free to do so.  In relation to the argument that one could never get anybody to record what happened when people walked out of Government, I am unlucky enough to have been around when various people walked out of Governments and parties and I have seen Ministers resign.  Never once has any of them had a difficulty in explaining to the nation and the world precisely why they did so.  From my experience all these arguments are non arguments and certainly do not form a part of political life in this country.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable we are facing into the last week before making a decision on Cabinet confidentiality.  Has the reason for this to do with the need for the tribunals to be effective?  If this referendum is carried, will it affect the reporting of Cabinet discussions on the commissioning of an offence to the DPP or the Garda?  Will it restrict Ministers from explaining why they resigned if their resignation relates to Cabinet discussions?  Will it restrict access by historians or researchers to details of Cabinet meetings? Given the complexity of this issue, has consideration been given to installing a telephone information line in, say, the Attorney General's Office?  Has the Taoiseach discussed with the RTÉ steering committee the possibility of broadcasting a debate on the referendum so that it is not overshadowed by the presidential election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Spring and Bruton for aligning with the statement and Deputy Sargent appears to be doing likewise.  It would be helpful if we could make a clear joint statement on this matter.</P>
      <P>There will be no restriction on Ministers who resign.  The only thing they cannot do is report what particular Ministers said at a Cabinet meeting. Differences of opinion normally relate to memoranda or departmental issues.  We have had examples of this in the recent past and those concerned had no difficulty putting forward strong views on what they believed to be national issues. Some years ago I took a different line from my colleagues on a particular issue and the then Taoiseach reported what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> The question raised regarding the DPP presupposes that all members of Government would condone an abuse of power.  That is absurd.  If an abuse of power is discussed at Cabinet the matter would be referred to the Garda or other appropriate authority.  The circumstances in which a Minister might feel compelled to act on his or her initiative arising from such a discussion at Cabinet are difficult to envisage.  I do not envisage Cabinet engaging in a discussion on an abuse of power and no member taking issue with it.</P>
    <P>When Cabinet meetings are over Ministers return to their offices and explain to the Secretary General or other relevant officials the principles decided at Cabinet.  They have always been entitled to do that.  However, they are not entitled to report what particular Ministers said at those meetings.  They can only give a general outline of what was discussed at Cabinet.  Therefore, none of the arguments stands up.  I replied to a number of queries on this matter from Deputy Quinn yesterday. I also discussed the matter with Deputy O'Keeffe, the former chairperson of the all-party constitutional group.  If necessary that group can re-examine the matter at a future date.</P>
    <P>Some people believe the matter has not been discussed at length.  That is not the case.  Deputy Bruton and the Attorney General spent a great deal of time on this matter.  They examined the position in countries which have a constitution and in countries which do not and this is the best way forward.  Collective responsibility and the publication of memoranda and different orientations are an important part of how Government operates in a democracy.  I do not know why people would want to know what particular people who are part of a collective group said at meetings.</P>

That would not be so in this case and, therefore, the matter could not be dealt with by way of legislation.  The Deputy can table questions in the normal way on issues that do not relate to this amendment.  The Minister for Finance has outlined the position regarding the Ansbacher accounts.  I refute the Deputy's implication about what might take place at Cabinet. It has always been my experience that issues of concern tend to surface more from Cabinet than from hidden political organisations which may have other motives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputies for the opportunity to comment on the subject of the tourism logo and to dispel the confusion that unfortunately appears to have arisen in the matter, particularly as regards cross-Border tourism co-operation.</P>
      <P>The factual position is that shortly after taking up office as Minister, I wrote to the chairman of Bord Fáilte indicating that while I was generally impressed by the quality of the advertising and promotional material attaching to the new tourism brand, I was anxious that much greater prominence should be given to the traditional shamrock symbol.  I did not issue any formal direction to Bord Fáilte but asked for its considered views on the full implications of implementing such a change and invited it to report back to me as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>My views on the matter were heavily influenced by comments expressed to me by a range of interests, including many from within the tourism industry and among the wider public, that the new logo had failed to capture the imagination both at home and abroad.  Moreover, I was concerned that the new logo had become the subject of some debate, particularly in the media, which in my opinion was adversely affecting perceptions of an otherwise excellent campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since first expressing my reservations about the lack of prominence given to the shamrock in the new logo there has been a range of consultations and contacts with the Northern Ireland authorities. I wrote to my Northern Ireland opposite number, Mr. Adam Ingram, Minister of State at the Department of Economic Development, on l4 August indicating that I had asked Bord Fáilte for its considered views on the matter.  I added that Bord Fáilte was considering alternative design possibilities compatible with the overall <Col N="56" /> brand project and was in touch with its opposite numbers in the Northern Ireland Tourist Board on the matter.  In his reply Minister Ingram expressed the belief as regards issues relating to cross-Border co-operation that the matter of logos was best left to the business judgment of the contractually-linked investors.  This is a principle with which I have no difficulty.</P>
    <P>The outcome of Bord Fáilte's consideration is a creation by the Company Design Works, the original logo design consultants to the tourism brand project, which uses all the elements of the existing logo while giving a greater level of prominence to the shamrock, as requested.  I have been assured by Bord Fáilte that the Northern Ireland Tourist Board was kept fully apprised of this work as it progressed.  The Northern Ireland Tourist Board did, however, express a wish for further research and consultation before taking a decision in relation to its plans for future logo use in its promotions.</P>
    <P>On completion of the round of consultations, I was advised by Bord Fáilte of the revised logo formulation which it intended using in its own future promotions.  It is clear, therefore, that my announcement of 18 September regarding the phasing in of a new design formulation for the logo for the 1998 season followed consultations between the two tourist boards, a process in which the board of the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative, OTMI, was also included.  I was categorically assured by Bord Fáilte that all necessary consultation with interested parties, including the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, had by then been undertaken in a fashion which permitted the revised logo formulation to move forward.  It was also strongly put to me that a decision by me in the matter was required quickly so that the finalisation of Bord Fáilte promotional material for 1998 could proceed without delay. My subsequent announcement clearly related exclusively to Bord Fáilte.  Questions regarding the logo to be used in joint cross-Border marketing initiatives are matters for decision by the appropriate partners, in this case the board of OTMI or Bord Fáilte-Northern Ireland Tourist Board jointly.  My statement contained no indication about any agreement or decision in relation to joint cross-Border marketing and promotion programmes, which is a matter for them.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity of meeting Adam Ingram in Chicago on 6 October during a US tourism promotion visit and our discussion was very useful in removing some misconceptions which surrounded recent events.  That meeting was also highly constructive in underlining our shared commitment to doing all that we both can to further tourism promotion and marketing on an all-island basis over the coming years.</P>
    <P>Given the tenor of the recent extensive media coverage of this issue, I would like to dispel any misconceptions there might be as regards cross-Border relations on this issue.  Tourism co-operation between the North and South remains very strong.  The partnership initiatives between both <Col N="57" /> Administrations and the alliances forged between the two tourist boards have been instrumental in successfully marketing Ireland on an all-island basis in recent years.  I endorse fully this partnership co-operation now and for the future and have every confidence that the two tourist boards will continue to develop the excellent working relations for the future mutual benefit of the entire island of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The talk of co-operation is laudable, but will the Minister agree the decision last November was made as a result of exhaustive marketing work in 17 countries and was taken by experts in the marketing area of tourism?  Will he agree that a political decision by him torpedoing a cross-Border initiative launched last November gave out all the wrong signals about partnership not only in tourism but across a broad spectrum of activities in which he is involved?  Will he reconsider the use of the withered shamrock, take the advice of the marketing experts and use the logo launched last November so that this island can send a unified signal to the world that we are co-operating with each other?  Will he indicate the cost involved in replacing the logo launched last November with the withered shamrock?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not listen to my answer.  I agree that marketing Ireland should be done on an all-island basis and that it should be left up to the board of the OTMI.  My letter was sent to Bord Fáilte asking it to consider giving more prominence to the shamrock symbol and the implications of that.  I agree with the Deputy that we must market this country on an all-island basis and that is how I intend to proceed.  That was heralded by my predecessor, Deputy Andrews, and Deputy Killeen and in our manifesto and programme for Government.  It was stated publicly by the chairman of Bord Fáilte that it did not come as any surprise to him that when we took office this issue would arise.  I remind the Deputy that on 28 July I wrote to Bord Fáilte indicating that I would like the shamrock symbol to be given further consideration and the matter was referred to in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> Therefore, what we intended to do on coming into office was well heralded in advance.  I agree the matter should be left to the decision of OTMI and I intend to pursue the matter along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a milestone in North-South relations in that Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board came together to produce this logo.  What I find disappointing about it is that in the <i>Donegal People's Press</i> of 24 September the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, Mr. Ingram, stated that the Minister, Deputy McDaid had done this for political reasons.  What is the Minister's answer to that? The Minister stated he had conversations with Mr. Ingram but Mr. Ingram states that he did it for political reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> Is this the first phase of production in relation to this logo because the <i>Donegal People's Press</i> of 24 September states that according to the tourist board, the total cost of the revamp is in the region of £100,000, making it a very dear shamrock indeed and that while giving it a guarded welcome, the Minister indicated he had reservations.</P>
    <P>The Minister is still not satisfied.  Will there be a further phase of development in relation to this logo?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Any further changes, if they are to take place, will be a matter for the OTMI.</P>
      <P>As regards Minister Ingram's letter, I assure the Deputy that since I have made direct contact with him we have put this back on a proper footing. I said there were misunderstandings and a media-led aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>I am not.  Since my meeting with Mr. Ingram, we have cleared up this.  I had a very cordial constructive meeting with Mr. Ingram where we indicated that we looked to the future and would proceed together along those lines.</P>
      <P>I did not try to politicise this issue which is important to a Deputy coming from my part of the country, knowing the devastation which has happened in that part of the country, particularly in the area of tourism.  I am there every day of the week and I assure the Deputy there will be no greater exponent of co-operation with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board than me.</P>
      <P>To answer the question about costings and the current shamrock, which has been described with various adjectives, according to Bord Fáilte the cost of the change will be in the region of less than £100,000.  The reason I accepted it was that, first, I was honour bound because they wanted to continue to market the tourism logo and, second, I was informed that I was legally constrained, that the taxpayers would have a bill of approximately £3 million had I changed the actual shape of it. While it has been referred to as moth-eaten, etc., I inform the Deputy that the insecticide would have cost between £2 million and £3 million.  I was not prepared to go along with that.  I was leaving it so that the matter would evolve and I assure the Deputy that it is evolving along the right lines.</P>

He took a unilateral political decision on this which damaged the confidence and trust which was being built up with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  His decision lead to a number of reactions from political leaders in Northern Ireland.  The Minister of State, Mr. Ingram, is on record as saying that the first he learned of the Minister's decision was in <Col N="59" /> a press release.  Does the Minister agree that is not a proper way to conduct cross-Border co-operation?</P>

      <P>I have a right, as Bord Fáilte is under my auspices, to make any views known to Bord Fáilte.  I did not take any unilateral decision. I asked Bord Fáilte to take into consideration views on the matter.  Does the Deputy agree with the research process, which highlighted that the shamrock did not feature as a recognisable icon for Ireland, particularly in the European markets. It stated that even in the UK and the US, where there was a level of association with the shamrock, there was a lack of understanding of what the shamrock stood for or, indeed, what it had to do with a holiday in Ireland.  I disagreed with that. I felt people in the UK, the US and Europe had some knowledge of the shamrock.  I questioned the research and as a result, I asked Bord Fáilte to try to give more prominence to the shamrock.</P>
      <P>I was within my rights.  I did not act unilaterally. As I already stated, there would be no greater exponent of co-operation than me.  It is rather unfair of the Deputy to try to be divisive in this aspect of tourism, where there has been nothing but co-operation, and to suggest that I should try to unilaterally act to disimprove tourism in a region which has lost out more than any other.</P>

      <P>What was the Minister's reaction when the chairman of Bord Fáilte, Mr. Mark Mortell, returned to him with his deliberations from the Northern Ireland Tourist Board?  He must have seen the warning signs at that stage, that the tremendous work which had been done by Bord Fáilte in putting together this plan with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board was in danger of falling apart.  He must have seen that this initiative, which was of great concern to everybody in the tourism trade in Ireland, was going off the rails.  He must have been in a position at that stage to reconsider and not just make a decision which would have serious implications in that now there are a number of logos in use around the world and people do not know whether they represent North or South.  They do not know the general policy of Bord Fáilte.  When Mr. Mark Mortell returned to the Minister he surely should have seen the danger signs and taken action.</P>

      <P>I asked the chairman of Bord Fáilte for his considered views to give me an indication of the implications involved.  I have already provided information regarding those implications. When I asked Mark Mortell, chairman of Bord Fáilte, to investigate the matter I knew he would give consideration to the views of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  He returned with those views and informed me that, following consultation, the position of NITB is that while it understands that Bord Fáilte will be amending its own literature, advertising campaigns and promotional material, NITB will not be doing the same at this point and will continue to use the TBI mark.  The NITB has always had that prerogative and retains it in respect of the new logo. I had no problem in accepting its position.</P>
      <P>The NITB retains the right to decide which logo it prefers.  Consultation took place with the board, a unilateral decision was not taken.  I received information on both the NITB and OTMI positions but I did not make a unilateral decision.</P>

      <Quest>the current position regarding the National Conference Centre; the recent communications, if any, his Department has had with the EU regarding the centre; when a final decision will be reached regarding location; if the centre will be built by the year 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The current position with the National Conference Centre project is that, following a Government decision, a new tender procedure has commenced, administered by Bord Fáilte under the aegis of the independent management board for product development.  The new tender procedure, which will be conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, followed from consultations between the Department of Tourism, Recreation and Sport and the relevant EU officials.  It is open to private or public sector applicants and in accordance with the requirements of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99 the centre will be located in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The first step in the new tender procedure was the publication of a prior indicative notice &mdash; PIN &mdash; in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 6 September.  This was followed by the tender procedure notice, which was published in the Official Journal on 13 September.  The notice was also published in the Irish daily newspapers on 16 September.  It invited applicants to submit requests to participate in the tender procedure by 5 p.m. last Monday, 20 October.  By 31 October, invitation to tender documentation will be dispatched by Bord Fáilte to selected applicants, following which those applicants will have three months to submit their tender, i.e. by the end of January next year.  Tenders will be assessed at that time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the related issues of EU funding and the likely completion date, I refer Deputies to paragraph 4 of the tender procedure notice which points out that while the &ldquo;final date for taking account of expenditure&rdquo; for projects under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, is 31 December 2000, there is provision for a member state to request the Commission to extend the time limits by not more than one year. If an extension of more than one year is requested, a formal Commission decision is required.  No expenditure incurred after the agreed end date may be taken into account for the purposes of Structural Fund assistance.</P>
      <P>The maximum amount of that assistance is 33 million ECUs with an aid rate of up to 50 per cent for private sector projects.  In the case of a public or similar body, there is provision for the aid rate to be reviewed by the monitoring committee for the Operational Programme, with the maximum aid rate possible in this category being 75 per cent.  As I stated on a number of occasions, I personally and the Government as a whole attach a very high priority to the establishment of a national conference centre, as set out in the Government's joint programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium, and I will do everything possible to ensure that this crucial piece of tourism infrastructure is progressed to completion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the approximately 350 conferences attracted to Ireland each year bring in the region of £100 million into the Exchequer, I cannot understand why the Minister decided to scrap the process put in place by his predecessor.  That process was at an advanced stage and the indications are that it was attracting approximately 75 per cent in grant aid.  What were the Minister's specific reasons for scrapping that process and beginning the procedure again? Taking account of the tendering period and the time given over to planning, etc., will the Minister guarantee that the funds available at present will remain available when the first stone is laid on the foundations of the new centre?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that any financial backers must be satisfied, otherwise they will not provide funding.  The EU is backing this programme and it was not satisfied with the manner in which it was progressing.  I have put the programme back on the rails.  I am glad the Deputy supports the idea that conference centres are a major mechanism for attracting revenue. Had I not interceded at the point at which I did, we would have lost the conference centre forever. Unless we are able to find a solution by spring of next year and proceed with the centre under the current provisions &mdash; we have been flexible in making those provisions as acceptable as possible &mdash; I fear we will lose both the funding and the massive revenue the centre will generate.  This is the last chance.  The boat will be put out after this and we will lose the project.  Applications will go through the Product Management Board which, I hope, will be able to come to a conclusion.  I hope, for the benefit of Ireland Incorporated, that this will not proceed along the other lines, that we will get this conference centre and that the unsuccessful applicants will realise that they will benefit ultimately.</P>

Will the Minister shed more light on what he has just said, particularly his suggestion that Dublin would be the preferred location?  Has he a particular location in Dublin in mind?  Is he talking about the RDS or the Phoenix Park, or is there an alternative location in Dublin?  Having read the files and considered the work that was done over the past number of years, has the Minister formed an opinion or has he been given guidelines as to whether it is possible to have a national conference centre as a stand-alone project?  Is that feasible or viable?  Is that the basis on which we are going forward, or will the centre be part of a larger complex?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 12, 18, 46, 51, 57, 119 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's joint programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, states that, among a number of priorities in the sport and leisure area, proposals will be invited for a national 50 metre swimming pool.</P>
      <P>In view of the level of consideration to which this project has been subjected over the last several years, it is my intention to, first of all, complete a comprehensive appraisal of the position as it currently stands and then to examine the full range of realistic options that are available to the Government.</P>
      <P>Over the past ten years valuable lessons have been learnt and information usefully secured, particularly as a result of the Design/ Construct/Finance/Manage competition held in 1992 and the feasibility study carried out by external consultants, which was completed in 1994.</P>
      <P>Among the key factors which the Government will have to consider are the cost of the project, capital and current, and the extent, if any, of Exchequer involvement; the location; and the extent of complementarity with a developing high performance sports programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident that the Minister is dodging the issue.  Feasibility studies have been <Col N="67" /> carried out and all the necessary information has been given to the Department.  Surely it is not too much to ask whether the Minister can give a firm date for this project to be put to tender.  The Minister and his Department are dilly-dallying and forgetting the achievements of Michelle Smith.  I would like more definite information on when this project will be allowed to go to tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy accuses me of dodging the issue.  I have been here approximately 100 days and this issue has been ongoing for the past ten years.  I am putting the information together. I accept, in view of what Michelle Smith has done, that the country deserves a 50 metre swimming pool.  I am trying to weigh up the information I have in order to come to a conclusion. Recently it was noted that £60 million is required for ordinary pools as a result of the consultation process in 1994.  There were 12 applicants in that consultation process and each came up with one common denominator, that £15 million would be the Exchequer input and that £500,000 a year would be required on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>In other words, I would have to provide almost twice the amount Deputy Allen handed out in May in national lottery grants to construct a 50 metre swimming pool.  I have to weigh up all these factors and reach a balanced decision.  I expect to find a solution before May 2002 when I hope I will still be in this position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the cost of the pool be included in the Estimates for l998?  How many applications for grants for 50 metre swimming pools under the recreational facilities scheme have been received by the sports section of his Department?  Will the Minister meet a deputation from Graiguecullen, County Carlow to discuss the provision of a swimming pool at that location?</P>

      <P>I will meet anybody who has a reasonable proposition to put to me.  I have indicated to the Deputy's colleague from Fine Gael that I will meet a deputation from Graiguecullen. I do not propose to include the cost of a 50 metre swimming pool in the Estimates for the reasons given.  My Department does not have responsibility for swimming pools.  Currently they are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local authorities.  Moves are afoot however to transfer responsibility to the sports section of my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £60 million mentioned by the Minister is a daunting one.  I agree with him that he has to balance the need to provide 25 metre swimming pools throughout the country with the demand for a 50 metre swimming pool. He is adopting the correct approach.  In considering <Col N="68" /> the needs of communities, will the Minister bear in mind one of the key recommendations of the national plan for sport published last year, the provision of a national centre of excellence incorporating a 50 metre training pool?  The University of Limerick has submitted a laudable proposal in respect of which it is prepared to meet 50 per cent of the capital costs involved and all of the running costs thereafter.  In other words, there would be a once off allocation from the Exchequer.  The major worry is that a 50 metre swimming pool of the type referred to in the l994 report would inevitably be a drain on the Exchequer and incur ongoing losses.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said in the House yesterday that he was in consultation with the relevant Ministers on the appropriate way to commemorate the millennium.  Has the Minister submitted a millennium project to the Taoiseach and, if so, what form does it take?  Has the Minister been in contact with the Department of the Environment and Local Government about the overrun of £6 million on four swimming pools?  I hope he assumes responsibility for swimming pools because it appears the Department of the Environment and Local Government is throwing money around like confetti.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot comment on that matter as it falls outside my remit.  I have established a committee within the Department to devise a major millennium project, particularly in the tourism area.  The Taoiseach has indicated that other Ministers will submit proposals and that a Cabinet sub-committee will be established to consider them.  In Ireland we have always had the advantage of being different.  In the year 2000 there will be many worthy projects in other countries which might entice Irish people domiciled there to remain.  We intend therefore to have a programme in place in l999 to encourage Irish people to come home to say goodbye to the old rather than celebrate the new.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>URBAN is a Community-wide initiative under the aegis of the EU Commission.  It is not a programme unique to Ireland.  URBAN focuses on disadvantaged areas in cities with a population of 100,000 or more.  The future of URBAN and indeed of all Community initiatives will be considered in the context of the Commission's Agenda 2000 package, published last July which, incidentally, envisages the consolidation of existing Community Initiatives under three headings &mdash; Inter-Regional <Col N="71" /> Co-operation, that is INTERREG; Rural Development &mdash; Leader and Human Resources &mdash; ADAPT, etc.</P>
      <P>The future of EU Structural Funds, Cohesion Funds and Community initiatives and Ireland's share of them will be the object of lengthy and complex negotiations.  I expect it will be late 1998 or early 1999 before a clear picture emerges.  In Ireland, the URBAN Initiative is just getting off the ground so it is a little early to give detailed consideration to a follow-on programme.  Nevertheless, a focus on urban areas of greatest disadvantage is one of the Government's main priorities which will not be lost sight of in discussions on future EU funding.</P>

      <P>In the last Government I was charged with responsibility for local development which I found enormously interesting and challenging. I am glad to see it in the capable hands of the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, who I know will make a very good job of it and I wish him well in his new task.</P>
      <P>In relation to URBAN does the Minister agree since the last urban initiative centred on north Cork and on Dublin, specifically on west Tallaght, Clondalkin, Ballymun, Darndale and Finglas, that given the population requirement of 100,000 and the great need in the south inner city, and in parts of the north inner city not covered by any other scheme, such as the Dublin Docklands Authority, Temple Bar or the like, that lung of the south and north inner city is very badly deprived and should be top of the list in any new urban initiative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for extending his good wishes to me and look forward to building on the work already done in this area.</P>
      <P>In the context of disadvantage I agree it is very important that we examine all these areas which are of very considerable interest.  The Government at the Taoiseach's instigation, by means of a Cabinet Subcommittee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, decided to tackle in a co-ordinated manner the underlying causes of major disadvantage in these areas.</P>
      <P>The URBAN Initiative obviously makes a considerable contribution to the areas mentioned by Deputy Mitchell.  However, in December 1995 the European Council asked the Commission to prepare a composite paper setting out, among other things, a strategy for future enlargement of the European Union and proposals for a new multi-annual budget to bring EU policies and its finances into the 21st century.  The Commission responded in July with Agenda 2000 which is a starting point for a wide-ranging debate.  Final decisions on that agenda will have to be taken by the European Council and Parliament.  As the Deputy said, it is extremely important to examine additional areas when the opportunity arises.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree there is a tendency in official thinking to believe that anywhere south of the River Liffey is relatively well off, that poverty is confined to other areas such as north or west Dublin?  Given that parts of the south inner city has unemployment levels approaching 75 per cent, poor housing conditions, a poor environment, a participation rate in third level education as low as 15 per cent, and given the work done by the South West Inner City Network, crossing three constituencies, from Dublin South, South Central into Dublin Central, crossing the River Liffey in that part of Dublin North not involved in any project at present, does the Minister agree it is very difficult to envisage any area more deprived or in need of an urban initiative, in which more preparatory work has been undertaken, than in that one, bearing in mind the work undertaken by SWICN and public representatives collectively in an endeavour to have that area included in the next URBAN Initiative?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give priority consideration to that very needy area in the next URBAN Initiative programme and urge the European Commission to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very familiar with the work of the South West Inner City Network and of the exceptional progress made by it in highlighting issues affecting people in that area.  Deputy Gay Mitchell and his colleagues, representing the three constituencies involved, have made a significant contribution to highlighting the issues of disadvantage in the area to which he referred.</P>
      <P>While this is one significant area, there are others of considerable disadvantage way above what might be deemed to be the national average.  Disadvantage in those areas is absolutely unacceptable to Government whose intention it is to tackle areas, such as that referred to by Deputy Mitchell, in a intensive, co-ordinated, manner involving the provision of services, the allocation of resources to a significant extent on a planned basis so that, within a reasonable period, it will become obvious to the Deputy and his colleagues in these constituencies &mdash; and particularly to the residents of these areas of major disadvantage &mdash; that progress has been made over a wide range of issues including employment, facilities delivered by local authorities and those expected to be delivered by statutory agencies and authorities.  It is part of my function to ensure that co-ordination is brought to bear in tackling the issues of disadvantage in that part of our capital city referred to by the Deputy in addition to others.</P>

      <P>There are no votes in this issue for anybody but, given the criterion of the URBAN Initiative relates to a population of 100,000 or more and the great need in the inner city lung to which I referred &mdash; the network group there having prepared the way &mdash; will the Minister ensure that this area is included?  That whole lung of the city, mainly south of the Liffey, is one <Col N="73" /> of the most deprived areas.  If this URBAN initiative could be secured it would make the area attractive not only to the people who reside there but also to people visiting and working in it.  We have a long way to go to achieve that.  I appeal to the Minister of State, in the interests of justice and fairness, to give this particular lung, which meets the population requirement, top priority and to urge the European Commission to consider it favourably for the next URBAN initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured I will take his well-informed comments on board in any future negotiations with the EU on an expansion of this particular scheme.  I assure the House that areas of the type referred to by the Deputy are suffering major disadvantage and it is the intention of the Government, and part of my own responsibility, to tackle the underlying causes of that disadvantage which extend over a wide range of issues, including the question of drug misuse, etc.  The issues referred to by the Deputy are complex but they have arisen as a result of long periods of neglect.  As the Deputy said, we are in agreement on the need to tackle the underlying causes of disadvantage and neglect.  In a relatively short period we hope to make a significant and visible impact on these areas where the people who are entitled to the best services will receive them and where communities, such as those referred to by the Deputy, will play an important part in developing facilities to meet their own needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>Cross-Border tourism links have been forged over many years through close co-operation between the Department of Economic Development in Belfast and my Department and between the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>These links have already culminated in a number of major joint marketing initiatives such as the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative and Tourism Brand Ireland.  In addition, Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board have collaborated successfully in a number of other areas and forged close operational alliances in a variety of markets undertaking a series of joint campaigns. They also work together on tourism working groups such as the International Fund for Ireland and the INTERREG programme.  The benefits of such collaboration are most welcome and can be clearly seen in the development of the tourism sector in both parts of the island.</P>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for tourism, it is my intention to ensure that such collaboration grows and improves in the years ahead.  The development, therefore, of closer working relationships between Ministers, Departments and tourism agencies, North and South, will be a continuing priority objective for the future. Indeed, I met Adam Ingram, the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Department of Economic Development, in Chicago earlier this month, during a tourism promotion visit to the US.  That meeting was highly constructive in underlining our shared commitment and vision to further tourism promotion and marketing on an all-island basis over the coming years.</P>
      <P>I sincerely believe that by co-operating whenever an appropriate opportunity presents itself we can help to increase our impact in the international marketplace, thereby delivering substantial growth to the tourism industry in Ireland, North and South.</P>

They had to travel to Chicago to discuss co-operation and other business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider one meeting in 117 days adequate?  Will he agree that if regular contacts had been made between himself and his northern counterpart, the fiasco <Col N="76" /> involving the logo, for example, could have been avoided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  I intend to make regular contact with the Minister, Mr. Ingram.  The more we can meet on a one to one basis, the better and the less confusion there will be on various matters.  I have already written to the Minister inviting him to Dublin at his convenience and I look forward to meeting him on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know the number of occasions the regional authority met the Northern Ireland Tourist Board?  Has any consideration been given to developing regional airports as a means of creating tourism by way of short-term breaks?  Much of the tourism generated in Dublin is due to the provision of weekend breaks, etc.  Has the Northern Ireland Tourist Board or the regional boards any plans in that regard for the Border areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>There is continuing communication between the two tourist boards and I envisage that there will be many more meetings.  The Deputy will appreciate that the question relates to cross-Border tourism co-operation but he mentioned the regional airports.  We must pay particular attention to the regions.  I hope we will be able to do what we can for regional airports in the coming months.  I would like to see the regions benefit.</P>
      <P>There is a perception that the regions are doing less well than the east coast area.  The east coast is developing at a fast rate and the regions are not able to keep up.  It is not a question of the regions underperforming.  The east coast region, Dublin in particular, has progressed outstandingly well in the past few years, thanks to good marketing and good product investment.  I will focus attention on the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As chairman of the Meath tourism promotion company I have a great interest in cross-Border co-operation.  In his meetings with the Northern Ireland Minister, Mr. Ingram, will the Minister seek to put together a package to develop the promotion of the tourism product cooperatively? Given our proximity we could save money in marketing while building bridges and helping to improve links.  The east coast has developed dramatically in recent years but it was many years behind other areas of the country which had depended on tourism.  I ask the Minister to report to the House on his meetings on the basis that he will agree a package with NITB on promoting tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed.  I have stated that the South and the North are only working at a percentage of their potential in many regards.  The Deputy is aware that the Border area has suffered as a result, particularly the southern Border counties.  I cannot <Col N="77" /> over-emphasise how much the ceasefire has done for the Border counties.</P>
      <P>INTERREG provides funding for the tourism sector in that area.  Approximately £13.8 million is being provided with the hope of attracting up to £25 million or £26 million in funds.  There are 130 projects for the Border region under INTERREG alone which are being discussed. Our budget is £6.7 million and the projects are worth approximately £38 million.  Great entrepreneurial endeavours are being made in the Border region.  I will report back to the Deputy and he may wish to raise the matter again with another question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wished to put a question about the imbalance in growth in Dublin and the regions but I was told it was not a matter for the Minister and that he could not give a view on the matter. Given that the issue has been raised, does the Minister agree that the imbalance between double figure percentage growth in Dublin as against 2 to 3 per cent in the regions is due partly to problems of access to the regions?  What proposals has he to ensure that the regions enjoy the same level of growth as Dublin?</P>

      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that the policies pursued by previous Ministers have resulted in the country enjoying a 70 per cent increase in visitor numbers from the US compared to 17 per cent in all the other countries in Europe.  The investment has been worthwhile. We have a good product and excellent marketing initiatives in the US.  We are creating a demand in the US and we must try to meet it.  The Deputy will be aware that another airline has indicated interest in flying routes to Ireland.  We are trying to meet the demands created by our excellent promotional activity.  I hope to be able to secure further funding shortly and Bord Fáilte will be able to use the funds to assist the regions to market themselves.  The regions will be able to better promote themselves in the face of the huge influx into Dublin &mdash; not to the east coast generally because there are areas in the east which have not developed as yet.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter emphasised that the interests of the child are paramount and we all agree with him.  He welcomed the provision of the Bill which will mean many people who have reached agreement on joint guardianship will not now have to go to court, and I thank him for that.  He expressed concern about the need to distinguish between children born to cohabiting couples and those born as a result of one night or casual relationships.  He drew a comparison with the domestic violence legislation but I do not think that is fair.  In that case.  before the legislation was changed, mostly women were victims and if they were married to the person inflicting violence they were unable to apply for a barring order. In that case the change had to be introduced for cohabiting couples whereas in this case there is no such prohibition on a father making an application for guardianship, he can do so under current legislation.  The Deputy did not compare like with like.  He queried the figures but I can confirm them &mdash; some 12,500 children were born outside marriage last year and roughly 6 per cent of unmarried fathers apply for guardianship, which is quite low.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus appreciated the many difficulties. She drew a comparison with illegitimacy but I do not think that is appropriate either &mdash; in such cases the best interests of the child were central, whereas here we are considering the interests of the parents.  She referred to the old idea that birth inside marriage was good but birth outside marriage was not &mdash; we cannot go along with that but we must be able to define the position in some way.  She queried the figure of 12,500 and asked why so few unmarried fathers look for guardianship.  Under the new arrangements, if the couple reach agreement there is no need to go to court and I hope that will help these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Neville said fatherhood was good for children and that we are discriminating against those children who do not have access to their fathers.  I agree that fatherhood is good for children but all these fathers have the option of applying for guardianship.  It is a matter of whether they should apply for it or if it should be automatic.  There is no presumption in section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act that a father is bad &mdash; the section is neutral.  The manner in which the law operates is that in 90 per cent of cases going before court, where all details are available, it is decided that it is in the best interests of the child that the father be made a guardian.  Those statistics should clarify matters <Col N="80" />&mdash; 90 per cent of cases brought to court are successful. I thank Deputies for their comments and I hope I have answered all queries.</P>

      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 31 to 35 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;11A.&mdash;For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the court, in making an order under section 11 shall grant custody of a child to the child's father and mother jointly unless there are compelling reasons <Col N="81" /> affecting the child's best interest, for not doing so.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a danger of repetition on this matter because we had an extensive debate on guardianship. However, I reiterate the principle that we must establish equality in parenting and new norms, which should be joint custody and guardianship. In this instance joint custody is at issue. I listened with great interest to Deputy Shatter differentiating between custody and residential responsibility or care and I appreciate that it is difficult for parents in dispute to resolve problems if a judge is not willing to deal with the residential aspect of custody when he or she decided joint custody would apply.  However, that is not necessarily a sound argument for not having joint custody as the base or the norm from which alternative forms of custody can be established, allowing for compelling needs which may arise in particular circumstances.  We must reinforce the principle that both parents have a responsibility for the care of their child and if we start from that norm we present a much better framework from which people can live up to their responsibilities. I recognise that many fathers do not do so but they are not unique &mdash; there are also mothers who are unable or unwilling to care for the children, although they are much less numerous.  The law must establish basic principles and the principle of joint custody is appropriate to our day, as is joint guardianship.  Parentage can no longer be established purely on the basis of marriage or, failing that, be the sole responsibility of one parent who is almost inevitably the mother.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak to amendment No. 22.  While this section aims to promote joint custody, it does the opposite.  On cursory reading, the provision appears to be a legislative recognition of powers the courts already possess and will have neither a positive nor negative effect on efforts to promote joint custody.  If the section becomes law it will prove a major impediment to parents trying to retain their custodial rights and obligations.  As such it will further delay the slow but growing tendency in society and even within the Judiciary to believe that joint custody serves the child's best interests.</P>
      <P>The provision arises from the premise that it is not appropriate for a father to have guardianship of the child when the parents are unmarried.  The court must decide it is appropriate before granting joint custody.  The addition of amendment No. 22 would provide that the court could grant sole custody to the father or the mother if it considers it appropriate.  In other words, the amendment gives equal recognition to the father and the mother and, if it is appropriate, the father might be the sole custodian of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still unhappy with the section because it is based on the premise that the court must decide if it is appropriate to grant even joint custody to both parents.  Our earlier discussion was based on the premise that joint custody be considered the norm and that the court would have to decide <Col N="82" /> whether such custody was appropriate.  However, we must deal with the situation as we find it and it would strengthen the father's position if it were recognised that in exceptional circumstances the court could decide that the best situation for the child would be in the father's sole custody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The three amendments seek to achieve the same objective although each is worded differently.  My interpretation of the amendments is that they seek to provide that the courts grant joint custody except in exceptional circumstances and that the onus of explaining why joint custody would not be appropriate would rest with the court rather than, as happens in most cases, the father being obliged to justify his claim for joint custody.</P>
      <P>Our court system has for many years favoured the mother in such situations.  It is not provided for in legislation but, because of our history, the generation from which our judges are drawn and the structure of Irish society, custody of the children is invariably awarded to the mother.  In many cases that is grossly unfair.  The objective of the amendments is to provide for joint custody unless there are exceptional reasons to decide otherwise.  If the Bill is not amended, the father will have to prove he is entitled to joint custody, otherwise the court will have to decide there cannot be joint custody because of certain circumstances. That would remove the onus on the father to prove his case and that would be worthwhile.</P>
      <P>Strange decisions have been made by the courts over many years and to a large extent men have been badly treated.  In our earlier discussions we said the best interests of the children should be the overriding consideration in these matters.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case in the development of family law.  I can offer a relevant example which involves a person I met recently.  My heart went out to the man concerned. He is from the west and has a modest job in a State company.  His take-home pay is a little over £200 per week.  As a result of marital difficulties he and his wife went before the court to sort out their problems.  The judge decreed that the man should leave the family home but continue to pay the mortgage on that home.  The mortgage is approximately £50 per week.  He must pay £100 per week maintenance for his wife and children.  He has access to his three children, a 15 year old girl and two younger boys, every second weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remainder of his wages only enabled him to rent a one bedroom flat a few miles away from the family home.  His children come to stay with him on alternate weekends but after a few weekends the teenage girl was not very happy to live in a one bedroomed flat with her father and two younger boys.  The children were away from their friends and from the facilities in the family home, such as access to television and a computer.  They were cut off from their usual surroundings, but the flat was the only facility available to the <Col N="83" /> father to look after his children.  Is that not a recipe for isolating the father from the care of his children?  Shortly the children will turn against their father because he cannot give them anything. They believe they are living in terrible conditions for the weekend and consider that unfair. I foresee major difficulty arising in that situation.</P>
    <P>Separation of families can be facilitated when the family is well off and can afford a second house and its attendant facilities.  Indeed it can make separation easier.  However, in the case of the man whose story I outlined, he feels shut out from the system.  What generates the greatest sadness in him is his belief that the marriage breakdown was not his fault.  He attributes it to his wife's difficulties.</P>
    <P>We need to give direction to the courts as to how they should address such problems.  These amendments are, in effect, telling the courts that the father should have a say in the care of the children.  I made a suggestion some time ago which relates to the overriding consideration mentioned by Deputy McManus, that the primary concern should be the care of the children.  If our primary concern is the care and well being of those children we should do everything possible to make life better for them and to ease the trauma of separation and breakdown.  Parents should have consideration for that.  The courts should be asked to examine a situation whereby, instead of children moving out to stay with their father at the weekend in terrible conditions, the parents rotate within the family home.  When the children are in the mother's custody she looks after them.  When it is time for the father's visits, he should take possession of the family home and live there.  In that way the children are not discommoded. This has already happened in Denmark and, while it is a difficult system for parents to operate, it is perfect for the children. If our overriding consideration is the children's well being we should ask the courts whether this possibility could work.</P>
    <P>I can see the difficulties involved.  I can imagine that a mother would not be too happy having to pack her bags and move elsewhere for the weekend, while her estranged husband moves in and has the run of the house.  When she comes back on Sunday night she is bound to say that he did not do the hoovering or the washing up.  It might even be the other way around, with the man saying the same thing.</P>
    <P>That has to be an option, however, if we come back to what should be our guiding principle &mdash; the children's welfare.  I do not know how we can ask the courts to look at this as a possible option, but it is something we have to do.  As legislators we should be able to ask judges whether they consider this option would work.  It will take much adjustment and sacrifice by the parents involved but our focus is on the children, so surely it can work.</P>
    <P>The thrust of these three amendments is similar and I am happy to support them.</P>

      <P>All three subsections of my amendment No. 20 deal with the new section 11A which has been widely discussed.  My subsection (a) seeks to create a situation where joint custody will be the natural assumption unless the judge has reasonable grounds to decide otherwise.  We have had sufficient debate on that.</P>
      <P>Subsection (b) of my amendment states &ldquo;may, on the application of a guardian, order that access to a child be given to a relative or spouse of the guardian, on such terms and conditions as the court may order&rdquo;.  That means that the guardian may be permitted to apply for an order giving access to a relative rather than having the relative apply separately on his or her own behalf to the court.  I inserted this subsection because it would save valuable time and money.</P>
      <P>If a relative, a grandparent for example, applies for access the guardian can apply to the courts for that facility rather than the person having to go to court themselves.  The Minister of State should consider accepting this measure.</P>
      <P>Subsection (c) of my amendment states &ldquo;may order that mediation or counselling services be provided for the benefit of the child to whom the proceedings relate&rdquo;.  That is self-explanatory. Children suffer terribly in a marriage break-up. Some children are luckier than others because their parents are able to sort out their difficulties before going to court.  In many cases which go to court, however, parents are at loggerheads and, thus, the children are under severe pressure.  It is important for such children to receive counselling. The Minister of State should consider accepting these amendments.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister of State replies, I want to refer to amendment No. 26, which is an addition to the proposed section 11B. This amendment states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In page 7, line 41, after &ldquo;order.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;In deciding any issue under this section the court shall have particular regard to the ability and willingness of each parent to encourage and facilitate the continued involvement of the other parent in the upbringing of the children.&rdquo; This introduces the concept that the law recognises that a parent encourages the involvement of the other parent where they are separated or single parents, or where the parents are not married to each other.  It indicates to the couple that there is an expectation that they will encourage and facilitate the other parent's involvement in the parenting and care of the child.  It would give a strong signal to the parents involved in 28 per cent of births this year that one of the first things they should consider after a birth is the role of both parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The involvement of both parents should be facilitated rather than at present where a decision is made to grant custody to the mother while the father must fight for joint custody through the courts if agreement is not reached.  The mother has an upper hand in a case where the father is <Col N="85" /> trying to become involved with the child.  This amendment would give a signal to both parents that they should encourage and facilitate the involvement of the other spouse in the joint relationship with the children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">

      <P>Section 9 of the Bill inserts three new sections, 11A, 11B and 11C into the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  As it stands, section 11 empowers the court to give any direction it thinks proper in disputes concerning custody or access to children.  In making any such orders the court must regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
      <P>Everything would be wonderful if all this were straightforward, but it is not so when one is talking about situations in dispute.  I was amused by Deputy McGrath's suggestion with regard to hoovering because in the best of marriages such problems cause difficulties, even without being in the situation he described.</P>
      <P>With regard to the new section 11A, it is intended to make clear that a court may award custody of a child to a father and mother jointly. The new section provides that for the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that the court in making an order under section 11 may, if it thinks it is appropriate, grant custody of a child to the child's father and mother jointly.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 22 and 26 from Deputy Neville purport to declare for the avoidance of doubt that the court, in making an order under section 11, may, if it thinks appropriate, grant custody of a child to the child's father or mother solely if exceptional circumstances warrant it.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 19 from Deputy McManus and paragraph (a) of amendment No. 20 from Deputy Moynihan-Cronin are somewhat similar. The amendments seem to be an attempt to fundamentally alter the court's powers to give directions under section 11 on who, in the best interests of the child, should have custody of the child.  The court, it seems, would be required as a matter of course to award custody to the father and mother jointly.  The court would only award sole custody to the father or mother in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments are flawed in declaring for the avoidance of doubt that the court may operate on that basis.  The plain fact is that the court does not operate on that basis because the 1964 Act is not framed to operate on that basis.  It is wrong to suggest that it does by attempting to remove doubts on the matter.  In making custody orders under the 1964 Act the courts are guided by the circumstances of each case and the best interests of the child.  In the absence of agreement between parents the court will inevitably make hard and difficult decisions based on the evidence. If, on the basis of the evidence, sole custody is the best solution in terms of the welfare of the child the court will make an order giving custody to one parent and access to the other.  If it is considered that joint custody is in the interests of the child the court will make the <Col N="86" /> order for the parents to share custody.  At present the courts do not usually make joint custody orders; normally the mother is awarded custody. This feature of the practice of the courts has little to do with the law and has much to do with the circumstances of each individual case.</P>
    <P>The amendments tabled by Deputies Neville, McManus and Moynihan-Cronin propose that the present practice should be stopped and that joint custody orders should be the rule rather than the exception.  The amendments would substantially change the rules of evidence in custody proceedings. However, the new rules could be more divisive and fault-based in practice than the existing ones and could be counterproductive in so far as the welfare of the child is concerned.  I am not in a position to accept the amendments and the Minister's amendment No. 31 should go some way to meet the point which underlines their concerns and those of certain interest groups without sacrificing the fundamental principle of the 1964 Act, namely, what is in the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 31 proposes that in considering whether to make an order relating to guardianship, custody or access under section 6A, 11, 14, or 16 of the 1964 Act, the court shall have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with his or her father or mother on a regular basis.  This amendment is inspired by a provision in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The fact that this aspect must be taken into consideration will alleviate many concerns.  The amendment is intended to direct the court's attention, in making guardianship, custody and access orders, to the desirability of ensuring that children have ongoing and close contact with both their parents.  The Minister said on Second Stage that he intended to strengthen the law in this area and his amendment is the most appropriate way of bringing about change under the 1964 Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus's amendment No. 23 is similar to amendment No. 31 in some respects. However, there are some technical legal difficulties with amendment No. 23 as it appears to apply to orders made under section 11 of the 1964 Act. The Minister's amendment is wider in that it applies not only to section 11 but also to sections 6A, 14 and 16 which are also relevant.  I hope Deputy McManus is satisfied with the Minister's amendment, which is the better option.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of amendment No. 20 which provides that a court may order that access to a child be given to a relative of a child or guardian is not necessary as the High Court decided in the case of D. <i>v.</i> D. that a court is entitled to make an access order under section 11(1) of the 1964 Act to allow a child access to persons other than the natural parents.  The Minister's amendment No. 28 provides that persons other than the natural parents may apply to the courts in their own right for access to the child.  Hopefully this covers the Deputy's concerns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> Paragraph (c) of amendment No. 20 provides that a court may order the provision of counselling and mediation services for a child.  Section 20 of the Child Care Act, 1991, already provides that where it appears appropriate in proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, for a care or supervision order to be made in respect of the child the court may, of its own motion or on the application of any person, adjourn the proceedings and direct the health board for the area in which the child resides or is for the time being to undertake an investigation of the child's circumstances. The Minister's amendment No. 49 amends this section by extending its provisions to the new section 11B and the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law Divorce Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Deputy's amendment would be to introduce compulsory mediation.  In view of the adverse effect which court proceedings can have on children it has been suggested that the parties to guardianship, custody and access proceedings should be compelled to use the services of a mediator to help effect a reconciliation of the issues before engaging in court proceedings.  The Bill does not compel the parties to use the services of a mediator and only requires a solicitor to discuss with them the possibility of a reconciliation and to give them the names of a mediator. When a solicitor has brought the option to their attention the parents must be considered to be mature enough to be the best judges as to whether they need to use the services of a skilled mediator or some other person qualified to help effect a reconciliation.  I have no doubt that if parents, the majority of whom are concerned to ensure their child's best interests are protected, believe there is a hope of reaching agreement with the help of the mediation services they will avail of them.  To compel parties to use these services against their will could have a negative effect and lead to further disharmony and the prolonging of an already difficult situation.  For all these reasons I am not in a position to accept amendment No. 20.</P>

      <P>I used the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; so that it would not be compulsory.  The Minister said that in the majority of cases parents are in the best position to know whether they needed mediation services. However, people involved in court proceedings can be very irate and if they were able to solve their differences there would be no need to take the case to court.  I take the Minister's point that this matter is dealt with in section 20 of the Child Care Act.  This brings me back to my point about the Bill being all over the place, so to speak, because of the citation of all the Acts.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the norm is to grant the mother custody.  That is the point I made.  These amendments were tabled because many people are unhappy with the norm in the courts.  I would prefer joint custody to be awarded in most cases and for custody to be awarded to either the mother or father only in cases where it is not possible to award joint custody.  The purpose of these amendments is to change the norm.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the 1964 Act does not provide that the mother should be granted custody. However, the practice in the courts over many years has been to grant custody to the mother.  I and my colleagues want that practice changed so that joint custody will be the norm.  A mother is normally granted custody of the children unless the father puts forward a compelling case why he should also be granted custody.  Why should the father have to do that?  He should be entitled to joint custody as of right.  If there is a difficulty where he must be excluded because he abused the children, because of his lifestyle or whatever, that should come into play then, but under normal circumstances joint custody should be granted.</P>
      <P>The Minister set out the present position, but the purpose of the amendments is to bring about change and if we do not do so in this Bill the present position will continue for years.  We do not readily have statistics &mdash; most cases are held <i>in camera</i> and sometimes there are no stenographers present &mdash; to show that in 95 per cent of cases sole custody is awarded to the mother.  Will the Minister consider this matter before Report Stage?  Perhaps she will consider submissions by groups such as Parental Equality, which carried out much work in this area.  I met that group on a number of occasions.  It made presentations to the Joint Committee on the Family, which I chaired, and outlined horrendous cases to show that fathers are excluded in normal circumstances. The compelling case we are making today is that fathers should be included.  The Minister should bear in mind the correspondence and submissions received, particularly from Parental Equality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I met the Parental Equality group and discussed the detail of the cases referred to.  As regards awarding joint custody, the interests of the child must be paramount. All the facts are put before the court and in a majority of cases custody is granted to the mother.  As regards the father having a say in the upbringing of a child, that is a matter of guardianship as distinct from custody.  There should be a distinction between custody and guardianship rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McManus made a point referred to by Deputy Shatter this morning.  Section 9, which inserts a new section 11 into the 1964 Act, provides that for the avoidance of doubt the court, in making an order under section 11, may, if it thinks it is appropriate, grant custody of a child to the child's mother and father jointly.  The Minister <Col N="89" /> said on Second Stage that the purpose of this new section is to allay the perception that the law does not permit the making of such orders. Courts make orders for what they term joint custody. There is, however, no clear definition of joint custody, nor does the Bill attempt to give one.  The court sometimes awards what it terms joint custody where the arrangements provided for can range from a child spending a certain number of overnights separately with each parent during the week to cases where parents, although formally separated, continue to live in the same household and are in a position to operate a joint custody arrangement.  Much of the confusion in this area stems from the mistaken belief that where custody is granted to one parent the other parent loses all say in the upbringing of the child. In general where one parent is granted sole custody the other parent continues to have joint guardianship of the child and a right to a say in the upbringing of the child.</P>
    <P>Guardianship describes a group of rights and responsibilities automatically vested in guardians. Specifically, guardianship encompasses the duty to maintain and properly care for a child and the right to make decisions about a child's religious and secular education, health requirements and general welfare.  Regardless of whether a parent who is a guardian of a child is granted custody, those rights are not affected unless a court specifically makes an order to that effect.  A custodial parent cannot remove such rights.  Where a court makes an order for custody it is important to be as specific as possible in regard to the arrangements to be made in the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>I have taken careful note of the points made by Deputy Shatter this morning.  It is important that where there is doubt about the court's intention, counsel for the parties can have the matter clarified.  Deputy Neville said the section is aimed at promoting joint custody, but that is not the case.  It is intended to clarify the existing law where joint custody, sole custody or any other arrangements are given equal effect in the legislation.</P>

    <P>Amendments Nos. 24 and 28 extend the categories of persons under section 9 who may apply for access to a child.  The Bill as it stands allows blood relatives of a child or of the parents of a child to apply for access to that child.  The Minister said on Second Stage that the section as framed, appeared to be unduly restrictive and that there are other circumstances where it might be in the child's best interests that persons who are not related to a child by blood may be given access. Accordingly amendments Nos. 24 and 28 provide that a person who has acted in <i>loco parentis</i> to a child or a person related to a child through adoption may also apply for access to a child.

      <P>I do not understand why it cannot be done.  I am asking that an application be made and for the court to decide to accept that application <Col N="93" /> before considering it.  Even though the application is with the court, it can decide to accept or reject that application which satisfies the first part.  The same court can then decide, if it accepts the application, to make a decision on joint custody rather than obtaining permission to apply for joint custody and returning six, eight or 12 months later to obtain joint custody.</P>

      <P>I ask the Deputy to refer to the Minister's contribution on Second Stage which may help clarify the position.  Subsection (2) provides that a party must first apply for the leave of the court to bring an application under section 11B and subsection (3) specifies various matters to be taken into account by the court in deciding whether to grant leave.  These include the wishes of the child's guardian or parents, the applicant's connection with the child and the risk, if any, of the application disrupting the child's life to the extent that the child would be harmed by it.  The purpose of this filter process is to ensure unmeritorious or vexatious claims are prevented from proceeding to a full hearing.  This is in the child's interest and it also protects the parents' constitutional rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not objecting to the principle or the procedure outlined.</P>
      <P>Having gone through the process outlined by the Minister of State, why can the court not decide the application is permissible?  Having made a decision to accept the application, the court would be in possession of many of the facts and in a better position to make a final decision on the matter.  I have no difficulty with what the Minister of State said, but the court should accept further evidence on the basis of the application and then decide whether joint custody is acceptable. Otherwise two court cases, two sets of lawyers and two sets of legal fees would be involved in the final decision.  Is it not possible for one court case to deal with the procedures outlined?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Deputy's point, the filter process is important.  It includes the constitutional right of parents to make their views known on the application.  There would be constitutional and legal difficulties in dealing with the entire matter on the same day.  I accept the section is cumbersome, but we do not have an option.  It has to be done in this way.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> If a person makes a vexatious claim and both procedures are taken on the same day, the child or children would have to be dragged along as well.

      <P>In page 12, line 14, after &ldquo;appropriate.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;A custodial parent who breaches an access order may lose sole custody.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said earlier that while the sanctions are in place, they are seldom applied because the majority of fathers would not push a case to commit the mother to prison.  An example of this was outlined this morning.  My amendment proposes that &ldquo;A custodial parent who breaches an access order may lose sole custody.&rdquo;.  The courts should have discretion to grant joint custody to both parents if the custodial parent consistently breaches an access order.  When fathers are continually denied access many of them opt out of the relationship with their children because of the frustrations involved and damage that might be caused to the children.  The court should have a right to deny sole custody to a parent who breaches an access order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">

      <P>Section 5 of the Courts (No. 2) Act, l986 provides for the enforcement of custody and access orders under the Guardianship of Infants Act, l964.  It provides that any person failing to comply with the terms of such orders shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £200 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both.  Deputy McGrath stated this morning that in such circumstances the father usually makes a decision in the interest of the child or children.  The necessary penalties are in place.  However, as the maximum penalty and term of imprisonment is out of line with the jurisdiction in the District Court, the Minister has tabled amendment No. 46 to strengthen the position. It amends section 14 to provide for an increase in the penalties for breaches of custody and access orders to bring them into line with the current jurisdiction of the District Court.  The sanction that may be imposed by the Circuit and High Courts for breaches of custody and access orders is imprisonment for contempt of court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> Deputy Neville's amendment would add a further layer of penalties for breaches of access orders and would mean loss of custody for the parent in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily, it could mean joint custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It would mean loss of custody for the person who has sole custody.  Deputy McGrath said it would be in the best interests of the child or children if the parent did not fight the issue.  The fines are being strengthened.  The amendment purports to penalise a custodial parent for breach of an access order, but it does not attempt to do so for breach of an access order by a parent who has access.  The amendment is not appropriate because the courts impose severe penalties for breaches of orders made by them. As Deputy McGrath suggested, it is good policy to direct court sanctions for breaches of access in the direction of the child whose welfare might be in question if a parent's right of custody is removed.  For that reason I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment.  I suggest amendment No. 46 which provides for updating the penalties for breaches of access and custody orders contained in section 5 of the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1986, is the way to proceed.  The Minister's amendment strengthens the position by substituting a fine of £1,500 for the £200 fine and 12 months instead of six months imprisonment. The Deputy's amendment is not the most appropriate in the interests of the welfare of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Minister of State said.  She said my amendment would add a new layer of penalty, but I argue that layer of penalty seeks to overcome the difficulty created when access is denied.  It is more important to base penalties so as to ensure a father has access where the courts decide he should have access.  It should be possible to ensure such access is available to the father.  That is provided in amendment No. 39.  I have doubts about the Minister's amendment No. 46 which provides for putting a mother in jail for 12 months rather than six months.  She claims that is preferable to introducing a clause which would give the parents joint guardianship where the court has decided that the father should have access and that access is denied.  I accept my amendment introduces a new layer of penalty, but I challenge the Minister of State to say that increasing the fine to £1,500 and putting a mother in prison for 12 months is a better solution than giving the parents joint custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The courts will rarely imprison a person for breaches of an order, but the increase in the fine from £200 to £1,500 is a substantial deterrent.  My amendment provides for that and that option will be available to the courts.  I would prefer the person concerned to face a fine of £1,500, which would impact on the <Col N="96" /> person causing the problem, rather than to remove custody from the parent solely on the basis that he or she is in breach of an order.  To remove such custody would not only penalise the parent involved, it would also penalise the child. The imposition of a £1,500 fine would be a direct penalty on the parent concerned, while the removal of custody would impact on the rights of the child.  A balance must be struck in that regard. The removal of custody rights from the child would have a major impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has misinterpreted my amendment.  It does not seek to remove custody of the child from the mother, but provides for joint custody because it removes sole custody from a parent.  Its intent is not to remove custody, but to remove sole custody and to replace it with joint custody.  I may have worded the amendment badly and I can table another on Report Stage. My amendment, which states that a custodial parent who breaches an access order may lose sole custody, means that sole custody can be replaced by joint custody.  The courts have decided it is in the child's interest to have access to the father and in this situation the mother is denying something the courts decided is in the best interest of the child.  It is the view of the Minister of State that the solution is to put the mother in prison for 12 months rather than allow the father have joint custody of the child with the mother.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">

      <P>That is not how I interpret the Deputy's amendment.  His amendment only mentions the custodial parent who breaches an access order may lose sole custody.  It does not refer to the conversion of sole custody to joint custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy could table an amendment to cover that on Report Stage.  This amendment does not reflect the point he made.  I am only now coming to terms with the Deputy view that his amendment will provide for the conversion of sole custody to joint custody, but it will not provide that.  Rather than removing sole custody from the custodial parent which this amendment proposes, it would be better to impose a fine of £1,500.  The Deputy wants to go one step further and convert sole custody to joint custody, but that is another day's work.  That is not <Col N="97" /> covered in his amendment and for that reason amendment No. 46 should be accepted.  The increase in the fine will be a deterrent.  No more than removing custody from a parent and the effect that would have on the child, I am not all that interested in putting parents in prison&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be, but that option exists.  Amendment No. 46 provides for increasing the period of imprisonment from six months to 12 months which would be a deterrent.  Amendment No. 39 adds another layer of penalty.  I cannot accept it and I highly commend amendment No. 46.</P>

      <P>I have some concerns about the Minister's amendment.  I do not know if indicating to the courts that a person who breaches an access order should be imprisoned for 12 months is the right way to proceed.  If we insert the Minister's amendment we will indicate to the courts that it is the view of the Oireachtas, representing the people, that the penalty for such breaches should be imprisonment for 12 months.  That would remove custody of the child from the mother.  I will not press the amendment, but I will table another on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No 43:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform shall, within 12 months from the date of passing of this Act, make and publish a consolidated version of the Guardianship of Infants Acts, 1964 and 1997, (&lsquo;the Acts&rsquo;) and judicial notice shall be taken of a document certified to be a true and accurate copy of the Acts so published.</P>
      <P>(3) A consolidated version of the Acts published under <i>subsection (1)</i> may contain such modifications or amendments to the Acts designed for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the substitution of the terms &lsquo;parental responsibility&rsquo; for &lsquo;guardianship&rsquo; and &lsquo;residence order&rsquo; for &lsquo;custody order&rsquo;,</P>
      <P>(b) the removal of ambiguities and inconsistencies and the achievement of uniformity of expression, and</P>
      <P>(c) ancillary or consequential matters, as to the Minister seems necessary or expedient; and every such amendment shall take and have effect as if included in an Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We discussed this matter earlier.  The Minister should consolidate all these Acts and make them user friendly.  If nothing else, it would provide that when we are dealing with legislation we would not have to look up nine or ten Acts which are affected by amendments.  Earlier the Minister agreed with me that such a consolidation would be helpful to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of those who read these Acts are in difficulty and do not have substantial financial means <Col N="99" /> at their disposal.  They like to be able to read and understand the Acts and I ask the Minister to consolidate them.</P>
    <P>In subsections (3)(a), (3)(b) and (3)(c) I am asking for changes in the wording.  It was said earlier that language is very important.  I ask the Minister to think seriously about this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would, by way of a new subsection (2), compel the Minister within 12 months of the date of passing the Bill to publish, it appears, a consolidated text of the statutory law on guardianship of children.  The text envisaged by the amendment would also apparently allow the Minister, under new subsection (3), to amend the law on guardianship in some respects by the introduction of new concepts to replace the concepts of guardianship and custody.  Those amendments would have effect as if included in an Act.</P>
      <P>Under the amendment judicial notice would require to be taken of the text that is published by the Minister.  First, the Minister has no departmental function in relation to publication of texts of Acts of the Oireachtas, including texts which would somehow combine the statutory law on a particular subject matter.  I am aware that some commercial publishers have published such texts on English law and it may be that the same could be done by publishers in relation to aspects of Irish law.  I doubt, however, that judicial notice could be required to be taken of any such texts.</P>
      <P>Second, the Deputy will appreciate that the passage of legislation must be in accordance with the constitutional requirements and that there cannot be a primary legislative process outside of that system.  In effect, that is what the wording of the amendment proposes.  There could be no question whatever of giving the Minister power to circumvent the legislative process &mdash; I do not think that was the intention but that is the effect of the wording of the amendment.</P>
      <P>Third, the bizarre notion of the amendment as it is worded is further highlighted in subsection (3) where it would allow the Minister to change the law without going through the legislative process. I do not think that was the Deputy's intention but that is what we take from the wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all of those reasons the amendment is obviously totally unacceptable and cannot be supported on any basis.  I appreciate that certain aspects of the law, including family law, would benefit from some consolidation, and we talked about this earlier.  The approach of my Department on the matter is as set out by me in reply to a question in the House yesterday from Deputy Wall.  I said that the legislative priorities of the Department in the civil law area are as announced on 25 September 1997 by the Chief Whip in the Government's programme of legislation for the current session and that none of those measures are confined solely to consolidation. I said, however, that in the context, for example, of the promised Jurisdiction of Courts <Col N="100" /> and Enforcement of Judgments Bill the Minister is taking the opportunity to consolidate all the statutory law in this area.  The Employment Equality Bill will also, among other matters, consolidate statute law.  I indicated that, in the course of preparing reforming legislation, it is the intention of the Department to consolidate aspects of the law in such legislation where this is feasible and warranted, and that while there are no proposals at present for legislation which is confined solely to consolidation of civil law the matter will be kept under review having regard to the need to dispose of urgent reforming measures.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 51:</P>
      <P>In page 15, before section 18, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>18.&mdash;In any case where a solicitor proposes to act for a person in circumstances where that person could have recourse to the services of the Central Authority under the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1991, the solicitor shall without charge inform the person of the availability of those services.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important new section.  Every day we read in the newspapers about child abduction, which is a serious offence.  When a child is abducted, the parent must act swiftly.  The first place the parent goes for help is to a solicitor and it is often the case that the parent does not have any money.  The reason I tabled this amendment is the solicitor should be obliged to advise the applicant that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform provides these services free of charge.  People whose children are abducted undergo terrible trauma and do not know what to do.  Will the Minister of State include the proposed new section in the Bill so that people will be at ease when they are advised by their solicitors that they will incur no charge and that the State will look after their affairs?</P>

      <P>While I accept the principle the Deputy is attempting to address, the amendment as it is worded would compel members of the legal profession to inform, without charge, persons who seek legal advice in respect of cases of abduction of a child into or out of the State of the services available in my Department through the central authority for child abduction.  That central authority acts on the basis of the Hague and Council of Europe Conventions on Child Abduction which are given the force of law in the State by the Child Abduction and Enforcement Court Orders Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>My assumption is that members of the legal profession would act in the manner required by their profession and the code of practice which applies in such cases.  If individuals have cause for complaint about solicitors who act improperly or overcharge, such complaints can be brought to the attention of the Law Society.  The proposed amendment seeks to prohibit solicitors from charging for certain legal advice but fails to state what will happen if such a charge is made.  In effect, the amendment cannot achieve any purpose by the manner in which it is framed.  I regret that I am not in a position to accept it.</P>

The Deputy made the point that individuals might not be aware of the service and, on consulting a solicitor, they might not be informed of its existence.  The only course of action open to them is to take the matter up with the Law Society when they subsequently become aware of the service.

      <P>I move amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P>In page 18, after line 39, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)(a) A person who, in relation to the giving of evidence by a child, whether in accordance with subsection (1) or otherwise, counsels or procures the making by the child of a statement material in the proceedings concerned which that person knows to be false or does not believe to be true, shall be guilty of an offence and on conviction shall be liable to be dealt with as if guilty of subornation of perjury.</P>
      <P>(b) For the avoidance of doubt, an offence is committed under paragraph (a) regardless as to whether&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) the statement counselled or procured to be made was or was not given in evidence by the child, or</P>
      <P>(ii) if the statement was made, the child knew or did not know it to be false, or believed it to be true or untrue.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is necessary because there is an English authority to the effect that if a child witness does not know that what he or she is saying is untrue, and is, therefore, not guilty of perjury, <Col N="105" /> the person who persuaded them to give false evidence cannot be guilty of this offence either.  The amendment attempts to close that gap by making the person who coaches a child to give false evidence guilty of an offence even when the child is innocent.</P>
    <P>I have severe difficulty with cases where children enter court in such circumstances.  As I stated earlier, in many cases parents are able to deal with their difficulties outside the courts.  However, children often become pawns when cases go to court and, in certain instances, they are advised to give false evidence.  A child who is advised to give false evidence cannot be guilty of perjury, but the person who advised the child should be guilty of perjury because it would be very wrong of any adult to advise a child to tell lies, and particularly to tell lies in court.  We are talking about the welfare of children.  In rearing children, basic honesty should be the first thing parents think about. However, when parents go into court and things get hot and heavy children may be told to say anything.  Children who are told to tell lies find it very difficult to do so, but that is what is happening, and I ask the Minister to take it on board because it is a very serious problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 27 of the Bill enables the court in civil cases to receive the evidence of children under the age of 14 years otherwise than on oath or affirmation.  The section also provides that a child who gives false evidence in civil proceedings otherwise than on oath or affirmation by virtue of section 27 shall be guilty of an offence and on conviction shall be liable to be dealt with as if guilty of perjury.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of amendment No. 52 is to ensure that a person who counsels or procures the making of a false statement by a child who gives evidence under section 27 of the Bill shall be guilty of an offence and on conviction shall be liable to be dealt with as if guilty of subornation of perjury.  Under the law as it stands, perjury is an offence when it is committed by a person who asserts upon oath the truth of some matter or fact, which assertion he or she does not believe to be true.  Subornation of perjury is the offence of procuring a person to commit perjury which he or she commits in consequence of such procurement.</P>
      <P>Under the law as it stands in section 7 of the Criminal Law Act, 1997, any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an indictable offence shall be liable to be indicted, tried and punished as the principal offender.  That provision in the Act of 1997 would apply to the type of case intended to be covered by Deputy Moynihan-Cronin's amendment.  In other words, there are already sanctions in place to deal with a person who encourages a child to give false evidence of the kind referred to in section 27 of the Bill.  For that reason there is no need for the amendment.</P>

Under section 27 a child who gives false evidence in civil proceedings otherwise than on oath or affirmation by virtue of section 27 shall be guilty of an offence and on conviction shall be liable to be dealt with as if guilty of perjury.  Are children being criminalised in that section of the Bill?  What penalties would a 15 year old be subject to if found guilty under this section of the Bill?  Under subsection (4), the unsworn evidence of a child may corroborate evidence sworn or unsworn given by another person.  Can the unsworn evidence given by a child stand on its own without corroboration and be considered by the court?</P>

      <P>A child under 15 would obviously not be imprisoned but would be sent to a relevant institution.  The provisions are similar to those in the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992.  The crime of perjury is very serious.  A child under 15 could be committed to a relevant institution and, if over 15, will be treated as an adult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is a serious crime, but I would be concerned that a child of 15 might be found guilty of perjury and sent to an institution for a considerable period of time, especially where that child is experiencing family difficulties, where his or her custody is being considered and both parents are arguing about who shall have custodial rights and putting pressure on the child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's question on subsection (4) in relation to unsworn evidence, subsection (4) provides that the unsworn evidence of a child may corroborate evidence, sworn or unsworn, given by another person. Certain types of evidence are regarded as being inherently weak or suspect and so deemed to require additional support or corroborative evidence.  This could arise, for example, in a case <Col N="107" /> that is dependent on visual identification evidence.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that if a child under 15 is found to have given misleading evidence on oath, that child shall be considered to be guilty of perjury or subornation of perjury and could therefore be sentenced, and in the case of a child under 15, it could be to one of several kinds of institutions.  Is the Minister saying that, for example, in the case of a child under 15 who is induced to make a statement that is false that child, as well as the person who induced the child, could be found guilty in this way?  Does the Minister really think it is appropriate in a case where a child under 15 is induced to give false evidence that a penalty should be applied to the child?  In a case such as this children are under severe pressure.  I doubt whether it could be held in such circumstances that a child under the age of 15 would be a knowing party to perjury.  If that is what the Minister of State is saying I ask her to reconsider the matter between now and Report Stage.  It amounts to extraordinarily harsh treatment, apart from the question of whether there are institutions to which children can be committed on conviction.  That is another day's work.</P>

      <P>Judges are well aware of the dangers inherent in the coaching of children giving evidence by parents. This has been adverted to in many High Court cases.  It is unusual for a judge to take the matter further than that.  It is not the child who will suffer but the adult, in this case probably the parent, who induces them to give false evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State started off by saying that if a child is found to have given false evidence he or she can be convicted.  If an adult, in this case a parent, is found to have induced or obliged a child to give false evidence he or she can also be convicted.  Nothing that the Minister of State said indicates that a child found to have given false evidence will be convicted without an inquiry being held to discover whether they were induced to do so.  If it is found that a child has given false evidence, is there a provision in existing legislation which would require the court to ascertain whether they were induced or obliged <Col N="108" /> to do so?  If not, there should be.  As we are talking about children under the age of 15 in highly stressed circumstances it appears utterly disproportionate and harsh to provide for the application of penalties to that child.  One cannot reasonably claim that a child under the age of 15 would be a willing or knowing actor in giving false evidence in a case such as this.  Almost without exception they would be acting under an inducement from an adult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In a case such as this where everybody involved is stressed, no child under the age of 15 will give false evidence unless they are put under pressure to do so.  The Minister of State has informed me that if a child is found to have given false evidence he or she can be convicted. She has not said that children will be convicted only where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the court that no inducement was offered and no pressure put on them.  It is absurd &mdash; Dickensian &mdash; to provide for the application of penalties to a child under the age of 15 who is found to have given false evidence in a case such as this.  At the very least, the court should ascertain whether pressure was put on the child to do so.  It is not appropriate in our legal system to convict a child of perjury in a case such as this.  If the Minister of State is not in a position to suggest a change, will she reconsider the matter between now and Report Stage?  To send a child to prison or a place of detention for acting in this way goes against the spirit of what we are trying to achieve for children.</P>

      <P>I have read the subsection twice and the language is clear and distinct.  It states that any child who makes a statement which he or she know to be false or does not believe to be true shall be guilty of an offence.  In a custody case a ten year old child will make statements knowing them to be false to gain access to the parent, probably the father, who has left the family home.  The Minister of State is saying that the child is guilty of perjury and should be sentenced. As Deputy Dukes said, that is ridiculous.  The Minister of State should reconsider the matter. Although I asked three times, she has not informed us of the penalties.  They are listed in the Criminal Law Act, 1992.

      <P>I listened last evening to Deputy Haughey and felt as if I was in the presence of the dawn breaking.  I do not claim to see the dawn break very often or that, when I do, I am in a condition in which I can appreciate its more aesthetic aspects but it is a wonderful sight.  There I see the dawn breaking over the Fianna Fáil benches, light coming upon them and beginning to realise what has been hidden from them up to now.  Deputy Haughey spoke last evening, in a manner with which I agree on the whole, about the Luas project and what the Minister for Public Enterprise had in store for us.  It may not have seemed directly relevant to the Bill but he did make the link, if I may coin a phrase, between the Luas and Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>Although the dawn breaking is a lovely sight to behold the cold light of dawn can show us some very ugly things.  Deputy Haughey saw the dawn breaking when he spoke, revealing to us that the Minister for Public Enterprise had in store putting off the prospect of a rail link of a particular kind to Dublin Airport.  However, I do not think he was thinking about it in the right context, about what she proposes <i>vis-a -vis</i> Luas which in effect will kill that project as we know it.</P>
      <P>Another bit of the dawn that is breaking is somewhat more hopeful.  The dawn is now breaking on the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, the Taoiseach and members of the Fianna Fáil Party, revealing to them how wrong the Taoiseach was in 1991 and 1992 when, as Minister for Finance, he agreed to a European Union Council of Ministers' decision to end duty free sales in the middle of 1999.  I am delighted that the light has finally broken on them.  If I am not mistaken, Deputy Daly was present when I had the honour earlier this year of celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the first duty free shop in the world at Shannon Airport, Rineanna as it was known then.  I think Deputy Daly agreed with me then that it was time we bestirred ourselves to ensure that this duty free facility, a very important part of airport and airline operations, to say nothing of sea transport operations, is preserved from the stupidity about to be visited on us as a result of a unanimous decision taken by the Council of Ministers in 1992 to put an end to duty free sales in 1999.  I am delighted that the dawn has finally broken over that side of the House, that they now realise how wrong that decision was and how mischievous it could be for the interests of people who travel by air and sea and for those who work in our airports, airlines and duty free operations.</P>
      <P>I was amused to hear Deputy Haughey last evening quote some of the lines used by the Minister for Public Enterprise.  I was amused and had a fond feeling of paternity about some of his remarks because she was using some of the best lines from a speech I made in June last on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Shannon Airport and from two speeches I made since then in Brussels in assisting the campaign to maintain duty free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> I am glad the Government is acting in that way and hope it will continue in that vein because there is far more riding on this than has become apparent so far.  In that regard, I am somewhat disappointed that the campaign has not been as vigorous as I had hoped it would be when I first spoke about it in June last.  I was told then that we would see over the summer in airports, on airlines and ferries a vigorous campaign to sensitise public opinion to the implications of what had been decided so that we could get public opinion moving and, by dealing with legislation here and in other member states, ensure we could continue to make the kind of progress now been made in getting the governments of other member states to reverse engines on that fallacious and stupid proposition that led to the 1992 decision.</P>
    <P>So far I have seen very little evidence of that campaign.  In the course of the past summer I travelled by ferry once only on a return journey between Ireland and France.  In the intervening period, in the many things I do, I travelled by air many times.  Only once did I see any airline, any activity, designed to bring this problem to the attention of the public.  That was on a British airline, Monarch Airlines, which as far as I understand is mainly a charter airline, which had painted on the side of at least one of its aircraft &ldquo;Keep Duty Free&rdquo;.  That is the only sign I have seen in a fair number of air journeys during the period.  I have not seen any leaflets being handed out in the cabins of aircraft or in duty free shops in airports.  Nor did I see leaflets being handed out on a ferry between Ireland and France.  If I can presume as a legislator to advise those who are working on wider public opinion, they will have to encourage the people involved to become more active if they are really serious about this matter.  We have gone from a position where the then Minister for Finance found it difficult to get support in December 1996 for the retention of duty free sales to a position where at least two other member states have joined the campaign.  I hope others follow because that will be important for the company we are setting up in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Bill coming before the House.  I had hoped in more favourable circumstances to bring the Bill through the House myself but these matters pass beyond our individual control.  The Bill is welcome nevertheless because it is important that Aer Rianta should be put on a basis that gives it the kind of commercial mandate and freedom required to operate airports in this increasingly competitive environment. Aer Rianta needs the kind of structure being given by the Bill to get the commercial freedom to respond to the position in which it finds itself.  That is not to criticise any of the people who have been Ministers for Transport.  I wish the Taoiseach would stop renaming Departments; it is tedious to have to remember a new name every time a new Government comes into power.  With the best will in the world, a Minister is not the best placed person to set down policy for an operation <Col N="112" /> that must live in a commercial, competitive and trading environment.  It is a tribute to Aer Rianta that it has been so successful while operating under a rather anomalous set of rules and regulations, and it is past the time that we should give it the type of corporate structure to allow it adapt itself to the realities of the market in which it must operate.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has been successful.  It runs three State airports.  It makes a profit at a sufficient level to allow it sustain the kind of investment to allow our airports compete.  It has made a profit, particularly in the last year, while at the same time introducing various creative formulae in relation to landing charges &mdash; an important part of encouraging airlines to increase the amount of business they do &mdash; and increasing the rate of services they offer, thereby improving both business and tourism links for this country.</P>
    <P>My many friends in Aer Rianta will not feel I am being harsh when I say that we should not go overboard in our praise of Aer Rianta's profitability. I would like to see Aer Rianta being even more profitable.  It has successfully spread its wings, to coin a phrase, in running duty free shops and in advising people on the running of these shops.  That is a significant part of the business on which it is to be congratulated.  I hope we do not clip Aer Rianta's wings by sticking to this nonsensical decision in which the current Taoiseach participated in 1992.  As a company Aer Rianta has also decided to follow its own core business, which is running airports, and diversify into airports elsewhere; Birmingham Airport has been the first of these.  Approaches have been made to other ventures which have not been as fruitful as the one in Birmingham but the company is on the right track in seeking to spread the range of its interests in the operation of airports, and it should be encouraged to do so.  The mandate given to the company in sections 22 to 25 is one that is properly suited to its operation.  I stress it is a commercial mandate for a company involved in a very competitive business.  A mandate of any other kind, especially a Marxist mandate, would be doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on several areas of the Bill in the hope that answers will be given at the end of Second Stage and that it will not be necessary to deal with them in too much detail on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reflect on whether the definition of aircraft in section 2 covers helicopters.  We had this debate on the Irish Aviation Authority Bill and I am not sure if it has been properly resolved.  This definition defines aircraft as machines that can do certain things from the reactions of the air, other than the reactions of the air against the earth's surface. The reaction of the air against the earth's surface is an important part of the aerodynamics of flying helicopters and I ask the Minister, therefore, to examine that definition again.</P>
      <P>There is a definition in the Bill of pilot in command which I ask the Minister to examine also because it is defined as being the person who is for the time being lawfully in charge of piloting the aircraft without being under the direction of any other pilot in the aircraft.  There may be a fault in that definition because a pilot in command will sometimes find himself carrying out what is called a check ride.  He is under supervision from somebody else who is not in command of the aircraft.  Some reconsideration might be required in regard to that definition.</P>
      <P>Coming to more weighty matters, section 16 sets out the powers of the company to manage, develop and establish airports.  It provides in subsection (4) for the company to take over the functions of the Irish Aviation Authority in cases where the IAA ceases to provide terminal services. It would be useful if, in reply to the Second Stage debate, the Minister would indicate the circumstances in which he believes the authority might do this because that could have some implications for the way the company goes about the provision of the services.  These are not the kinds of services that are central to the operation of the company, although I understand the reason for the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a curious provision in section 21(7) to do with the construction of new roads or approaches to the airports by the airport company. It is that the company may have to make a contribution to the maintenance of certain kinds of works where they involve the construction of an embankment, a bridge, a tunnel or similar <Col N="114" /> works.  That may well be a sensible provision but it is not clear from the text whether what is envisaged is a once-off capital contribution or a series of ongoing current contributions.  There may be an argument about the appropriateness of making a contribution but, for the sake of the running of an airport company, it may be desirable to have such a contribution sorted out once and for all, so that the company will know where it stands rather than having to make recurring contributions subject to some uncertainty.</P>
    <P>I am concerned the Minister has not given full consideration to the implications of another provision in the Bill.  Once the company is set up the immunity of the State airports from local authority rates will be abolished.  The airports at Dublin, Cork and Shannon will become liable for rates.  I had the experience many years ago of bringing a valuation Bill to the House and there would be much entertainment to be had in deciding the rateable valuation of any of those airports and even more entertainment in deciding how the rates would be paid on their substantial physical installations.  Rates would add considerably to the cost of running the airports.</P>
    <P>I do not see a compelling reason for making a gift to the local authorities in question &mdash; Fingal, Cork and Clare county councils.  I have nothing against those excellent bodies but I am not persuaded that it is right to give them a present of a large amount of money if the result is to add costs to the running of the three State airports, at a time when we want those airports to be in a position to offer more competitive services to the airlines and their passengers.</P>
    <P>The provisions in sections 22 to 25 about the operations of the company empower it to provide services and facilities.  Is there anything in these provisions which will prevent the airports from getting others to provide these services or facilities on a contract basis?  This is already being done in some instances &mdash; for example, some of the services in Shannon Airport are provided by contractors.  It would be important for the three airports that the company continued to have the ability to have services provided in that way.  I will be happy if the Minister indicates that the Bill permits that to continue. If not, I recommend that he formulates an appropriate amendment for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister, and compliment myself in doing so, for the way in which the Bill provides for making various orders.  One kind of order in the Bill cannot be made unless it is actively approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The others which operate under the 21 day system are appropriate to that system.</P>
    <P>Section 33 provides for airport charges, particularly charges by the company with the approval of the Minister.  Is it intended to make provision for the grounds on which the Minister of the day might refuse to approve those charges?  That would be an important matter in the context of the commercial freedom of the company.</P>
    <P>Section 64 provides for the recovery of charges by the Irish Aviation Authority in the event of <Col N="115" /> the detention and sale of an aircraft.  Sections 34 and 35 deal with a similar issue.  It is not clear whether in the event that section 64 applies it prevails over sections 34 and 35.  Will the Minister indicate in his reply how the sections function together and whether they are properly consonant?</P>
    <P>This Bill is long overdue.  Subject to the questions I have raised being answered satisfactorily, I am sure it will give the company the freedom it will need to carry out its business.  I hope we will see the company continue to expand and to provide the services needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State on their appointments and wish them every success.  The Bill gives us an opportunity to look back over the history of Aer Rianta since its establishment and to look forward to the challenges and opportunities ahead.  It will give statutory effect to what has been developing in recent years.</P>
      <P>I will direct my comments to Shannon Airport mainly and its importance to the region.  Since its establishment Shannon Airport has been the focal point of great development in the mid-west region, an area which was almost static for many years.  It has created many jobs in direct employment in the airport and has had a great economic impact in the region.  It has brought in large numbers of tourists thus offering opportunities to those in hotel, leisure, car hire and other businesses. A great deal of the economic activity in the region centres on the activity at the airport and the work of Aer Rianta and the other State agencies involved.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta has been turned around in recent years.  In many debates in the House we had opportunities to discuss what we felt was necessary for the airport to generate business, employment and economic prosperity.  I pay tribute to the contributions made by Aer Rianta board members over the past 25 years, regardless of their political affiliations.  During Mr. Frank Boland's time as chairman of Aer Rianta &mdash; he was appointed by Fine Gael &mdash; I dealt with him on various issues.  I always found him to be impartial and straightforward in his dealings and totally committed to the development of the airport business.  Whenever I discussed issues of the day with him I found him forthcoming and helpful. He did a magnificent job during his time as chairman. I also pay tribute to the late Mr. Peter Hanley who, at a difficult time for the economy, gave wholehearted dedication to Aer Rianta.  Similarly, people like Mr. Jack Daly and Mr. Dermot Desmond, who deserve credit, are enormously successful in business and regardless of their political affiliations it is good that successful business people are available to work in the national interest.</P>

I am also glad to have the opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Derek Keogh, who is now retiring.  He managed airports at a critical time when many businesses were going out of operation and changes were being made to international aviation policy and the type of aircraft being used.  This presented formidable challenges to airports like Shannon.  The board of Aer Rianta developed links through Aer Rianta International, whose achievements should be recognised. Before there was any relaxation of attitudes to the Soviet Union, Aer Rianta forged links with that country through the development of Aeroflot flights through Shannon and the promotion of traffic and business through other central European states.</P>

      <P>Those were difficult days but the board charted a course which has proved lucrative and has provided not only benefit to Aer Rianta but also job opportunities to many young Irish people who went to work in Moscow and other parts of the Soviet Union and made a major contribution to the overall success of the company.</P>
      <P>That success over the last 60 years can be seen in the mid-west, where the economy is thriving. More tourists come every year and those involved in that sector &mdash; in bed and breakfasts, guest houses, hotels and a range of other activities &mdash; make a major contribution to the economic life of the region.  The board and staff of Aer Rianta must be congratulated.  As Deputy Dukes said, Aer Rianta forged new ways of developing business, some of which are to be commended.  For instance, its involvement in the hotel school in Shannon and with Great Southern Hotels and Shannon Hotels has introduced something which was urgently needed &mdash; basic training in top quality hotel management through the hotel school and accommodation adjacent to the airport.  All this is central to the successful operation of Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only was Aer Rianta successful in creating job opportunities through Aer Rianta International, the hotel school, the sales and catering college and the mail order departments, through its involvement with the development company <Col N="117" /> and the community, it also introduced new aircraft maintenance industries, thus opening up opportunities for young people to obtain training and skills in aircraft maintenance.  The Shannon aviation park has also been successful in attracting overseas aviation companies willing to create technical employment that will provide more jobs and revenue for the region in the future.</P>
    <P>I have queries about some of the restrictions in the Bill.  These relate mainly to the provisions of section 4, which concerns the disposal of moneys. This is a typical Civil Service section which is included in almost every Bill, providing that the Minister for Finance will use any revenues accruing from this legislation for the benefit of the Exchequer.  The former Minister for Finance is smiling because he is fully aware that the procedure in the past has been that any moneys accruing will go to the Exchequer.  This section should be amended so that any revenue accruing to the Minister as a result of this legislation &mdash; which could be substantial, perhaps £200 million &mdash; should be used for the direct benefit of the airports.</P>

      <P>The same applies to any dividends accruing under section 12, which will go to the Exchequer.  All dividends accruing from this legislation should be used to develop, expand and promote the airports themselves.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about section 16, which concerns the power to manage and develop the airports.  Another section deals with marketing and there is a particular problem in Shannon in that for many years we have felt it necessary to have a strong marketing section in either Aer Rianta, Shannon Development or the aviation companies like Aer Lingus.  Everyone knows the difficulty which has arisen from each body conducting its own marketing.  We in Shannon felt it was necessary to co-ordinate, which is why we introduced the marketing initiative involving Aer Rianta, the county council, the regional authorities, SIPTU and Shannon Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SFADCo was established in 1959 because of changes in the pattern of aviation.  People felt Shannon might overflow and it would be necessary to introduce a counter mechanism which would develop industry in the region.  The customs free zone was set up and Shannon was successful in attracting new industries.  That is still advancing; there will be 1,000 more people working in Shannon this time next year than there are at present and this is due in no small measure to the success of the development company.  In this regard, section 16 should be strengthened to include a provision for the promotion of airports, <Col N="118" /> especially Shannon.  This would strengthen the marketing drive for Shannon Airport and would give a clearer indication of how it would be marketed in the future.  The airport will face difficulties, as it is facing at present in the changes of operation in the aviation business.  There will be a constant need for further marketing strategies and to have finances directed to that end.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides that the company will have the power to sell water.  I presume this gives it the power to buy water also.  Valuations will not be as difficult as Deputy Dukes think.  In effect they exist already.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Quinn on Tuesday, 21 October 1997:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, bearing in mind the long established principle, first adopted by the Government in 1969 and confirmed to this House repeatedly since then, that public service pensions should be related to current rates of pay, considering that recently negotiated increases in public sector pay should therefore be reflected by proportionate increases in the pensions paid to already retired employees, and recalling the pledge of the Government parties outlined in the Action Programme for the Millennium to protect public service pensions, calls on the Government to implement improvements to the pension entitlements of retired nurses, teachers, gardaí, civil servants and employees of local authorities and health boards, in order to re-establish parity with increases obtained by serving employees under recent pay agreements.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, recalling the pledge of the Government parties outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium to protect public service pensions, notes that it is the intention of the Government to honour this commitment.  Accordingly, the manner in which this commitment will be implemented is being considered in the course of the current Estimates/budgetary process.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Labour Party for sharing its time so generously.  I welcome the <Col N="119" /> opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Like many Members, I am appalled the Government has yet again made a U-turn on a commitment given by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on 4 June during the general election campaign to grant parity to public service pensioners.  It should be easy for the Minister for Finance to honour that commitment in view of that election promise.  However, honour has been scarce during the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to refuse parity to public service pensioners.  They comprise teachers, nursing staff, health board and local authority workers.  All have paid their 6.5 per cent contribution to their pensions. The tactics adopted by the Department of Finance in this matter are wrong and unjust.  It is also wrong to include this issue in the context of the long-term obligation to public service pensions. Today's <i>Irish Independent</i> quoted the Minister for Finance as saying that a pension bill of £1.7 billion today will mean a bill of £11 billion by the year 2036.  This figure misrepresents the reality and must be corrected by the Minister.  The percentage of GDP paid now is greater than it will be in the year 2036.  Last night the Minister listed percentages and figures but they do not represent the real situation and are, as was said in another context, &ldquo;lies, damned lies and statistics&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is no economic reason to cut pensions as envisaged.  An average Civil Service pension in 1993 was £115 per week, a little more than the social welfare contributory pension.  Are we asking public service pensioners of the future to accept a pension that will put them on the poverty line?  Is it a means of getting rid of them? Sometimes I wonder.  There has been a grand plan since 1987 on the part of the Department of Finance to bring about a reduction of the State contribution towards pension funds.  We are entitled to those pensions because we contributed 6.5 per cent of our income to them in the past. As a result of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, teachers with allowances for posts with responsibility will lose £750 per annum.  A principal teacher in a 30 teacher school could lose £2,750 per annum as a result of the scheme designed by the Minister for Finance.  That is not and cannot be acceptable.  There is the same <i>pro rata</i> impact on all other pensioners in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfair to deny parity to people who have given so loyally to the State throughout the various sectors of our community, often in difficult circumstances.  We have not heard the last of this matter.  I will, with my colleagues, do whatever is necessary to ensure this plan of the Department of Finance does not proceed.  Are we to call the current Minister for Finance the Scrooge of the new millenium and compare him with a previous Minister, often spoken of by the Fianna Fáil party, who reduced old age pensions?  It would be unfair to the Minister to do that but it will happen if he continues on this road.  I ask the Minister to <Col N="120" /> grant parity now and not to prolong implementation by asking a commission to examine it.</P>

      <P>Parity in public service pensions has been established since 1969.  Ministers for Finance have affirmed that custom in their Budget Statements of 1972, 1984 and 1986.  When a public servant, nurse, teacher or local authority official entered the public service he or she paid a pension contribution of 6.5 per cent on the firm understanding that parity would continue to give a <i>pro rata</i> increase in their pensions on retirement in line with increases to serving workers.  Now the pensioners have learned this is not so.  A postprimary teacher will lose on average £1,250 per annum if parity is breached.  Spouses on half pension are even worse off.</P>
      <P>A report prepared by the management and services unit of the Department of Finance in 1993 revealed that 70 per cent of Civil Service pensioners had pensions of less than £500 per month or £115 per week.  The Scott report in 1981 said it was highly desirable that the standards of living of those in retirement should be protected.  This principle is recognised in countries such as France and Germany.</P>
      <P>There is no economic basis for reducing public service pensions.  The projected pension fund, cashflow and assets as a percentage of GDP will improve from 46 per cent in 1996 to 115 per cent in the year 2036.  The Government, in a statement on 4 June, committed itself to maintaining the standard of living of public service pensioners relative to serving officers.  Public service pensioners have a legitimate expectation that parity of pensions should be respected.  No attempt should, therefore, be made to modify the State's obligation to maintain parity of pensions.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Finance to honour the pledge to restore parity to the former nurses, teachers, gardaí and local authority and health board workers.  They have served the State well. A resolution of the European Parliament on 24 February 1994, states that national governments should refrain from applying measures to reduce benefits in pension schemes.  Let us not let our public service down.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government parties will honour their commitment to protect public service pensions as outlined in the Action Programme for the Millenium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The retired pensioners were justifiably angry when they held their rally outside the Dáil two weeks ago.  They were angry with all politicians but particularly with the previous Government and the lack of action on the part of the former Minister for Finance.  When I met the retired nurses outside the Dáil they spoke about the unique position of nurses which was confirmed <Col N="121" /> earlier this year when they almost went on strike. The Labour Court decided nurses were in a unique position with regard to their pay and working conditions.  The retired nurses and I found it hard to understand why retired nurses are not regarded as having a unique position.</P>
    <P>They were not the only retired public servants who felt aggrieved.  The retired pensioners are particularly aggrieved that benefits do not apply to public servants who retired prior to 1 June 1996.  What consultations and negotiations did the previous Minister conduct about parity of pensions and what negotiations, if any, did he conduct with the retired public servants?  The retired pensioners I met outside the Dáil two weeks ago were annoyed at all the discussion about payments to politicians and tribunals that follow the money trail, while they felt discriminated against and let down.</P>
    <P>We must emphasise the principle of parity.  The pensions parity principle of increasing public service occupational pensions in line with pay was agreed in 1969.  It was phased in over three years to 1972.  In the 1984 budget it was announced that general pay increases would apply to pensioners with effect from the date of the increases.  The 1986 budget extended full pension parity to special increases with effect from 1 July 1986.</P>
    <P>Over the past decade parity has been applied on the basis that pensioners would continue to have their pensions related to the salaries they would have had if they had continued to serve.  In fact, there was a time when pension increases were paid some time after general pay increases.</P>
    <P>We must examine what would arise if traditional parity applied and what the impact would be on various pensioners' groups.  Many of the deals concentrated increases on the pay scale, whereas others concentrated some or much of the increases on non scale improvements.  Some deals were worth substantially more than others. Consequently, if parity as currently understood was applied a substantial number of pensioners would get increases of the order of 15 per cent with others getting 7 or 8 per cent.  At the other extreme, substantial numbers of pensioners would either get no increase at all or would benefit only from the 1 per cent advance pay increase paid to some groups with effect from 1 April 1994.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance has had a series of meetings with the public services committee of congress and the Retired Civil and Public Servants' association.  The predominant demand of these parties was for the retention of parity but with some provision for groups who would not benefit from parity.  The congress group's agreed position is parity with a floor of 3 per cent.  In effect, while it is most anxious to maintain the principle of parity for the future, it seeks a minimum level of increase for pensioners who would not otherwise benefit, or would benefit only marginally, from the PCW deals.  The effect of the latter would add substantially to the cost of public sector pensions, particularly if future special pay <Col N="122" /> increases were modelled on the PCW restructuring deals or based on increases in productivity or pay-related performance.</P>
    <P>During the recent general election campaign pension increases for public servants became a live issue.  The joint Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats press statement of 4 June 1997 said &ldquo;in Government we will resolve the problems surrounding the pensions of retired public service staff and we are committed to restoring the link between pensions and increases in current rates of public sector pay&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Government's joint programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, states that key priorities will include &ldquo;protection of public service pensions&rdquo;.  It is mentioned in tonight's motion.</P>
      <P>The general issue of pension increases is among those being considered by the Commission on Public Service Pensions.  The commission's preliminary view is that pensions should be increased to provide a fair and secure level of retirement income to pensioners.  The commission suggests that three principal pension increase options are available: in line with pay, in line with the consumer priced index or in line with some other index appropriate to pensioners.  The commission will consider each of these in its final report.</P>
      <P>We are told the cost of public service pensions will increase from £540 million in 1995 to £2.2 billion in the year 2025.  This represents a fourfold increase over a 30 year period and these figures are based on conservative assumptions.</P>
      <P>The system of parity cannot be changed.  From 1 July increases due under Partnership 2000 have been applied to pensioners and further increases due under that agreement will also be applied. The Government has been dealing with the matter since June and despite the fact that deals have been in negotiation for a number of years, the previous Government did not finalise the matter.</P>
      <P>Congress has been involved in trying to resolve this.  The bottom line sought by Congress would represent a significant improvement in the existing system of parity.  The groups of retired public servants have received benefit from the parity principle.  They have already received the 1 July increase and will get further increases due under Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>This has been a frustrating time for retired public servants.  It is only from a sense of frustration that they came to the Dáil on 8 October to meet Deputies and Senators.  They were sincere when they made it clear they would return for a similar rally if they are not successful in obtaining the significant benefits to which they are entitled.  I call on the Minister to sort out the manner in which the Government's commitment will be implemented.  I also call on him to meet the retired public servants and assure them they will not be forgotten and will receive their full pension entitlements.</P>

      <P>We are lucky to have so many experts in this House.  No matter what the problem is we will always have a supply of people with the right answers.  The more complicated the problem the more certain we can be that someone will come up with a simple solution.  We can equally be guaranteed that such a solution will not work.  That is obvious given the contributions from the Opposition both yesterday and today. The problem of public service pensions is a complicated one that requires serious study before a final decision is made.  Pension increases for public servants became a major issue during the recent general election campaign.  Even though we all acknowledge it was also a big issue before the election, it received much attention during the campaign.</P>
      <P>Before the election both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats issued a statement saying that &ldquo;in Government we will resolve the problems surrounding the pensions of retired public service staff and we are committed to restoring the link between pensions and increases in current rates of public sector pay&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the programme for Government, which was published after the election, we stated that the protection of public service pensions would be treated as a priority.  That is as true today as when the Programme for Government was agreed.  This matter is being watched closely by many people and a number of them have been in touch with me to express their concern at the lack of progress. This problem, however, is not one that has just arisen.  It was an issue during the term of the Rainbow Government but no real action was taken to solve it.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has only just left office and it might not be back for a good while.  However, more than any other party, it should be aware of the complexities involved.  Since this Fianna Fáil led Government took office the matter is being dealt with and we can show those concerned that we want to put in place a secure and fair level of retirement income for public service pensioners.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will honour the commitment given to the people before the general election.  The Minister summed it up well yesterday when he said &ldquo;the question at issue is how to apply the restructuring deals negotiated under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to pensioners&rdquo;. In dealing with this question it is vital that serious consideration be given to the increased costs that will emerge later.  The growing concern over the emerging costs of existing public service pension terms is understandable when one looks at the projected figures.  It is expected the cost of public service occupational pensions will increase from £540 million in 1995 to £2.2 billion in 30 years time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> We have witnessed many changes in the public service during the past 20 years.  Some of these changes were introduced with little regard to the long-term costs.  The major recruitment which took place during the late l970s will result in an increased number of retirements in 25 years.  The Commission on Public Service Pensions recently submitted an interim report to the Minister for Finance.  It would be helpful if that report were made available to us.  The commission identified some of the contributing factors to the growth in Exchequer pensions costs, for example, the increase in the number of female public servants who will qualify for a pension.  The fact that people are living longer means pensions will have to be paid over a longer period.</P>
    <P>The pensions parity principle was agreed in l969.  This meant public service occupational pensions were increased in line with pay.  It was decided in the l984 budget that general pay increases would apply to pensions with effect from the date of the increases.  The l986 budget extended full pension parity to special increases with effect from 1 July of that year.  During the past ten years parity has been applied on the basis that pensioners will continue to have their pensions related to the salaries they would receive if they were employed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the restructuring deals negotiated under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> do not fit comfortably within the traditional pattern of special pay increases.  In most cases the deals were negotiated under option A of the restructuring clause in the PCW. This requires &ldquo;changes in structures, work practices or other conditions of service&rdquo; and &ldquo;must have regard to the need for flexibility and change and the contribution to be made by employees to such change and must result in savings and an improved quality of public service&rdquo;.  Alternatively option B allows a single cost increasing claim for an amount not exceeding 3 per cent of the basic pay cost which would take into account the need for efficiency, flexibility and change and the contribution to be made by employees to such change.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the various option A deals differ widely in their structure and, as a result, if traditional parity applied the effect on public service pensioner groups would be very different.  Many of the deals concentrated increases on the pay scale while others concentrated much of the increases on non-scale improvements.  Some deals are worth substantially more than others and it is obvious that the system is neither fair nor equitable and needs to be changed.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance held meetings with the public services committee of congress and the Retired Civil and Public Servants Association. These parties have requested the retention of parity but with provision for groups which would not benefit from it.  The congress group's agreed position is parity with a floor of 3 per cent.  It is very anxious to maintain the principle of parity <Col N="125" /> for the future and is seeking an increase for pensioners who would not otherwise benefit from PCW deals.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not the only country which faces a major increase in the cost of pensions.  Many of our European colleagues have had to deal with a similar problem.  In an effort to reduce the overall cost to the State some countries have increased the retirement age for public servants.  While we can learn lessons from the experiences of these countries, any move to increase the retirement age for public servants should be knocked on the head.  We still have a very serious unemployment problem and every assistance must be given to unemployed people to find employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will introduce the budget in a few weeks.  The old age contributory pension was increased by £3 from £75 to £78 in the last budget.  However, this increase did not come into effect until 1 July.  It is begrudging of Governments not to give immediate effect to pension increases.  Successive Ministers, including Fianna Fáil Ministers, have operated this system for many years.  Increases in beer, fuel and cigarettes announced in the budget come into effect at midnight on budget day and there is no reason social welfare increases should not come into effect at the same time or within a week or two. Pensioners should not have to wait for six months to enjoy the benefit of the increase in their pension.</P>
    <P>The escalating cost of pensions is a serious problem which must be addressed.  The pay-asyou-go system is no longer the way to deal with the issue.  Further pension liabilities must be identified and advance funding put in place to deal with the issue.  This is a very complex area which requires much examination.  I hope the Minister avails of the opportunity in the forthcoming budget to address the fears of the people concerned.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Labour Party motion in so far as it gives us an opportunity to debate public service pensions.  The distress and upset caused to pensioners who gave a lifetime of public service to the State was obvious during the general election campaign.  I am glad the Minister proposes to amend the motion as follows:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, recalling the pledge of the Government parties outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium to protect public service pensions, notes that it is the intention of the Government to honour this commitment. Accordingly, the manner in which this commitment will be implemented is being considered in the course of the current Estimatesbudgetary process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party was in Government with Democratic Left and Fine Gael when the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was negotiated and it is very much their programme.  Part of their manifesto was that the PCW would be presented to the people as a kind of final instalment <Col N="126" /> of advantage prior to the election.  Yet they failed to provide in the programme for the very circumstance we are obliged to consider in the House this evening.</P>
    <P>The programme provided for new restructuring options within the public service.  A key part of this was the creation of a new option in relation to structural adjustments, special pay increases and productivity improvements in the public service. There was no difficulty with the old arrangement reflected in option B which allows a single cost increasing claim for an amount not exceeding 3 per cent of the basic pay cost which takes into account the need for efficiency, flexibility and change.  It is similar to the old special increases which obtained in previous programmes.  There was no difficulty in passing this type of increase on to pensioners.</P>
    <P>Option A in the PCW requires changes in structures, work practices or other conditions of service and savings and an improved quality of public service.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to refer to those days that is fair enough but we should begin with the l960s, l970s and l980s and the programmes of the modern era.  The mistake made by the previous Government was that when option A was introduced &mdash; I have no problem with option A, it is a legitimate arrangement &mdash; it neglected to provide for the consequential effect on pensions.  The problem was then presented to us in the recent general election.  In fairness to Deputy Broughan, I am sure he was as sympathetic to the people about this matter as I was, but the Deputy's party in Government failed to make special provision for pensions. This is another example of a cheque drawn before an election which bounces afterwards, and which we have to deal with in Government.</P>

Whatever the complexities and difficulties &mdash; one difficulty outlined by the Minister is the anticipated demographic change in the decades ahead &mdash; I urge the Minister to provide for this group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a fair point when he said that some elements will lose out if we insist on a rigid link between option A improvements and increases in pay.  Groups that have not benefited such as gardaí and teachers will accrue no <Col N="127" /> additional benefits in their pension arrangements. I urge the Minister, as a gesture of goodwill, to have regard in the budget to those groups and ensure the basic principle of parity is honoured in the spirit as well as in the letter.  It is the spirit of the principle that is important.  In the public sector pension arrangements, we must recognise the contribution made by public servants down the years.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Deputy's party has always had a close relationship with the trade union movement, and I wonder whether pensioners should have a voice in the negotiation of programmes.  It is fundamentally unjust, inequitable and unsound that arrangements are negotiated by the existing workforce which can prejudice the interests and entitlements of the retired workforce.  That matter must be addressed in negotiation of future programmes.  It is unjust that bodies which represent pensioners do not have an equal voice with bodies that represent the existing workforce.  That is clearly a defect in the present negotiation arrangements, which led us to the present position.  I urge the Minister to make generous provision for pensioners in the budget.</P>

      <P>I listened with special interest to last night's contribution by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, because the issue of future pension provision, by the social welfare system, private provision and public service provision, is serious. Thankfully, our demographic position puts us at an advantage compared to many of our European neighbours who are forced to deal with this crisis 20 years or more before us.  In recent discussion of this matter in Germany and Holland the phrase &ldquo;a pension timebomb&rdquo; was appropriate.</P>
      <P>During the last Dáil I took a particular interest in this subject.  With a number of colleagues, I helped to establish an all-party backbench committee on pensioners, including those in the public service, and retired workers.  There was much support from the seniors' committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions led by senior officials of recent decades such as Mattie Merrigan, Michael O'Halloran and Bobby Rice.  We organised many meetings of the pensioners' committee and there was support from Deputies Wallace and Hughes, Fianna Fáil, Deputy Flaherty, Fine Gael, Deputy Byrne, Democratic Left, Deputy Sargent, the Green Party and Deputy Costello and myself from the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our discussions led to two fundamental conclusions. Pensioners had been unfairly excluded down the years from negotiations on the PCW and other partnership agreements.  They were to some extent the ghost at the table, similar to representatives <Col N="128" /> of the unemployed.  There was a general feeling in our discussions that that should not happen again, that Governments and trade unions should be determined that the development to which Deputy Lenihan alluded should not recur.</P>
    <P>We discussed future pension provision with representatives of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I was glad pensioners' representatives met officials of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and strong representations were made to the Minister for Finance.  I hope the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will carry on the work which we began in this regard in the 27th Dáil.  The Minister said that in regard to public service pensions parity was not an issue when this Government took office.  He is correct in that the matter was already under discussion between the public service committee of ICTU and officials from the Department of Finance.  The previous Government committed itself to implementing any agreements arising from those discussions.</P>
    <P>Some matters are clearer now than they were in June.  In a recent debate in this House the Minister suggested that there were three Charlie McCreevys speaking in that evening's debate. Multiplicity is one of the Government's strong points, and in recent weeks we discovered there are two kinds of promise in the Government's lexicon, a promise and an election promise.  After a very short period in office, we are witnessing an increasing litany of broken promises by the Government, on Sellafield, mandatory reporting, zero tolerance, corporation tax rates and public service pensions.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil and, at a later stage, Fine Gael helped us to deliver the manifesto of 1992.  The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats manifesto has been cynically torn up by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  As my colleague Deputy McDowell said, there has been almost a U-turn per week since the Dáil resumed.  The Estimates campaign seems to be, as rumours suggest, a brutal campaign, with agonising discussions on various mornings, even on the floor of the Dáil, between the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen.</P>

      <P>This process will undoubtedly mean the number of broken promises on spending issues will run into double figures.  While some <Col N="129" /> issues are clearer now than in June other issues remain complicated, including the public service pension time bomb alluded to by the Minister. Is this the beginning of a scare campaign on the issue?</P>
      <P>I have always had respect for the Minister for Finance and I was one of the first to congratulate him on his new portfolio.  I am confident this issue was not new to him when it arrived on his desk in June and neither was he unaware of it when the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste issued a joint statement two days in advance of the election saying they were committed to restoring the link between pensions and increases in current rates of public service pay.  That statement was more about votes, winning the ten additional seats and scraping into Government than about public service pensioners.</P>
      <P>There is also a second side to the broken promise. The statement by the leader on 4 June promised to address the issue urgently.  The Minister may not think 118 days is an undue delay.  I am confident the 78,000 people whose hopes were raised and subsequently dashed hold a different view.  Some of them are in the public gallery.  The irony of the matter is that at the last meeting between the Government and the Public Service Committee the latter put forward concrete proposals aimed at resolving the problem but it has not had the courtesy of another meeting to discuss those proposals.</P>
      <P>As a Labour Party candidate I was under pressure on this issue during the election.  Along with the crime issue, public service pensions was one of the two major issues on the doorsteps and clearly very important to all sectors of the community. Even though the Labour Party was committed to honouring the results of the negotiations between the two parties, pressure was no doubt escalated by the false promises of Fianna Fáil.  Politicians of all parties have been partially scapegoated as the people responsible for the problem arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The negotiations were conducted under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  As a former teacher I know that sometimes teachers' leaders, such as Senator Joe O'Toole, were not sufficiently cognisant of the claims of their pensioners when negotiating in relation to option A and did not look sufficiently at the huge sacrifices made in earlier decades by our retired teaching colleagues.  Last night my colleagues referred to various public sector professions such as nursing. Most economists would ascribe our economic growth to our education system.  Teachers taught classes of 40, 50 and 60 pupils prior to restructuring and strategic programmes.  This week one of my constituents is retiring on the magnificent sum of £200 per week on which to eke out a living for himself and his wife.  There is a huge case to be answered here.  As my colleague Deputy Penrose said, the sum needed to meet our obligations towards our colleagues in the public service pension area is a modest amount of about £30 million or £35 million.  The Government is honour bound <Col N="130" /> to address this matter in the next couple of weeks as final preparations are made for the Estimates. I support the motion.</P>

Unless this is achieved we will not have a motivated, efficient and competitive public service.  The Government by its attitude and lack of clarity is distancing itself from its election promises.  This has the potential to do enormous damage to our public service.  It is no harm to remind the Government of its commitment to 77,000 pensioners two days before the election that their pensions would be 50 per cent of their salaries, that the parity link between salary and pensions would be maintained. Nothing has happened since.  Four months later the Government obviously believes election promises can be forgotten.  It shows it is patently unaware of its precarious position and that broken election promises will prove fatal in this unstable partnership and will inevitably lead to an early election.</P>
      <P>It is appalling for any party to mislead anyone, but to mislead those who have retired after many years of long and faithful service to the public is unforgivable.  The Government has misled those who have worked hard in difficult times in the public service and betrayed them when they were most vulnerable before the election.  The commitment to ensure parity between salary and pensions was not given in innocence and the Government was not unaware of the cost implications. The election had to be won at any price, even at the price of its own integrity.  These are the people who worked long hours for low pay when it was difficult to develop our services.  The real worry for those of us who are supporting the motion is that the Government has proven, just four months later, it has no difficulty in doing U-turns on its election promises.  The last thing the Government should do is a U-turn regarding the retired who have additional expenses and who, because of the service they have given over the years, deserve that pension.</P>
      <P>It is sad to recall the number who have retired from the public service and who come to my clinic and put forward a case for justice.  Irrespective of when the next election takes place if the Government betrays its promise on this important issue of parity between salary and pensions it will not be forgotten by the people.  It does none of us a favour that on an issue as important as this the Government will not honour its promise.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to support the motion tabled by the Labour Party.  I hope, following contributions in the House, if not by its own good will, the Government will honour its election promises or, at least, be embarrassed into doing so and that those who have given long service will be able to enjoy their retirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and compliment the Labour Party on tabling this timely motion and for sharing time with us.</P>
      <P>Many people who consider they are entitled to pension increases in keeping with those enjoyed by their working colleagues have served the State well for decades.  Some of them have 40 years' service in the public service as nurses, teachers, etc.  They have now reached their twilight years and expect their share of the State's goodwill.  In this case goodwill would be parity of pensions. Parity in relation to public service pensions goes back to the first agreement in 1969.  It was confirmed in 1984 and reconfirmed in 1986.  Given the recent increases to serving nurses, pensioners expected to receive increases in keeping with those enjoyed by their working colleagues. Recently I spoke to a retired psychiatric male nurse.  The pension increase to which he thinks he is entitled is £1,500.  That is a large sum to a pensioner who worked as a nurse for 40 years.  That £1,500 could mean the difference between sparing and being able to live a little better.  That is owed to him.</P>
      <P>I was particularly struck by the commitments given by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil in their pre-election literature and letters to various organisations.  My reading of those commitments was that they would look after pensioners and tonight's motion will test that.  Will the Government renege on the commitments it gave in good faith to those people before the election?  It must be difficult for you as an honourable member of the Fianna Fáil Party to face pensioners knowing the commitments your party made in its manifesto.  It must be extremely difficult for you to tell them you were in Opposition when the promises were made and your party did not intend to deliver on them.  Honourable people would not behave in that manner and I hope the Government will not.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech pointed to the fact that he could not pay the pensions.  He almost used the term &ldquo;pensions time bomb&rdquo;.  Deputy Coughlan will know from the work of the Joint Committee on the Family last year that we do not have a pensions time bomb.  While the demographic population and trends are changing, we are not in the same mould as the rest of Europe.  Many people, particularly insurance companies, when selling their products or addressing conferences talk about the pensions time bomb facing us.  The report on the elderly published by the Joint Committee on the Family illustrates that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, stated that the unfavourable cost outlook for public service pensions will materialise at a time when the general ageing of the population is placing everincreasing demands on the State's resources, particularly in the form of social welfare pensions and health care costs.  The population is ageing and the number of people over 65 will increase, but that is not the whole picture.  There are two <Col N="132" /> groups of dependants, the elderly over 65 and school children.  The number of elderly over 65 will increase substantially over the next 25 years, but the number of children will decrease.  Therefore, the total number of dependants will remain stable.  The working group will also increase significantly in the years ahead.  Unemployment figures are reducing and the numbers at work are increasing.  While our ageing population will increase, the number of dependants will remain stable and the economically active will increase.</P>
    <P>I vigorously support the motion, we owe it to our pensioners.  We must live up to our commitments and acknowledge the service those people gave to the State.  I have no difficulty supporting the motion and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I support the motion which calls on the Government to honour pension parity for public service pensioners and to increase the pensions of public servants in line with the increases in pay for public service employees.  The right of public service pensioners to be paid increases in line with pay increases is long established.  A departure from the principle of pension parity would undermine the fundamental pension rights of pensioners and the employment rights of existing public servants who have yet to retire on pension.</P>
      <P>Most retired public servants receive a small pension.  Retired gardaí, nurses, teachers, civil servants and employees of health boards, vocational education committees and local authorities who have given their entire working life to public service retire on a maximum pension of 50 per cent of salary.  In practice, this means that after 40 years service to the country a public servant retires on a pension of between £10,000 and £15,000 per annum.  Many public servants do not have full service and will retire on a much smaller pension.  Many thousands of public service pensioners are living in a pensioners poverty trap. The saddest cases I meet are elderly retired public servants who have given a life time of work to the State and are trying desperately to keep up appearances on their small pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A pension of 50 per cent of salary compares unfavourably with the norm for funded schemes which normally gives full pension at two-thirds of salary.  The one entitlement from which retired public servants could draw some comfort was that their pensions would increase in line with the pay for the job from which they retired, but the Government appears to be undermining this.  I echo the call for the Government to increase pensions in line with pay increases.  I do not accept the Minister for Finance's argument that the agreements made under option A of the PCW change the position.  I understand there may be administrative difficulties in calculating pensions and that this may cause some delay in their payment. However, the Minister's suggestion that some existing public servants made agreements for increased pay on the basis of flexibility and productivity and that this might not be passed on <Col N="133" /> to pensioners who retired in those grades is not tenable.  If that principle is upheld there will be an increasing erosion of public service pensioners' rights.  We live in an era when pay movement is increasingly based on flexibility and productivity. To suggest that pensioners cannot benefit from that is denying them recognition for the productivity and flexibility they gave in a different time and in a different ways.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the recent signals in relation to pensions.  I am not comforted by what the Minster for Finance said yesterday.  He appears to be signalling that the Government intends to reduce the public service pension bill. He is certainly not talking about increasing pensions. Existing pensioners and public servants would do well to examine closely what is being proposed in regard to their pensions.  The cost of public service and social welfare pensions will increase in the future.  We pride ourselves on being a civilised society and the mark of such a society is how it cares for its retired and elderly. People who have given their working life to the service of the State are entitled to have their pensions honoured and paid in full.</P>

      <P>It is reprehensible that at a time when the State coffers are bulging, retired public servants have had to take to the streets to protect their pension rights.  The removal of parity between pensions and wage increases in the public service was a backward step for all workers and retired people.  Retired public servants were given a pre-election promise which has come back to the door of the Government. In a joint statement on 4 June the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, made an unambiguous promise that they were committed to restoring the link between pensions and increases in current rates of public service pay.  They must honour that commitment without delay.  The deterioration in the position of retired public servants came in a period when we saw golden handshakes, like that given to the discredited chief executive of Bord na Móna who got a £1 million farewell for his services.  We also saw increased salaries for top executives in the semi-State sector which were in breach of Government guidelines.  That is in sharp contrast to the treatment of those public servants at the other end of the scale who took to the streets to seek their rights.  Unless this major anomaly and ill-treatment is dealt with immediately, they will have to take to the streets again.  They have signposted 5 November to once again appear at the gates of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer in particular to the position of retired nurses because it is to be deplored.  They <Col N="134" /> were undervalued, underpaid and overworked during their careers and they now see their well earned pensions deteriorating.  That must not be allowed to continue.  There must be no more prevarication. The Government must act immediately. I fully support the motion without amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not want to detract from the tenor of the discussion, but I am most disturbed the Opposition is suffering from an incurable disease called political amnesia.  If I recall correctly, at the time of the nurses' dispute the then Opposition pressurised the then Government into honouring a commitment to examine nurses' pay.  There was adequate time at that stage to deal with the link between the warranted pay increases and pension rights.</P>
      <P>Like other Members, I represent a constituency in which there are a large number of retired public servants, be they teachers, nurses or whatever, who have given a tremendous amount of their energy and commitment to this State and their jobs.  I agree it is important to recognise their contribution and that can only be done when they retire, in their pensions.  It is unjust that if a person were due to retire next year he or she would have different pension rights from a person who retired in June of this year.</P>
      <P>It is mischievous for the Opposition to say the Government has made a U-turn on the commitment given in the election campaign.  It is the job of the Opposition to be mischievous, but I hope it will not detract from people's serious concern about this issue.  There was a protest about this matter outside the House some time ago and we all took the opportunity to meet those people whose concerns were genuine.  We are all supportive of their concerns.  I reiterate the concern of my constituents that there should parity of pension rights.  Having been a Member of this House for ten years, I am pragmatic and realise that one cannot make decisions on pensions or other monetary matters until the Estimates have been agreed.  We are in the process of dealing with them.  I reiterate the call to ensure that as part of the budget and Estimates that public service pensions will be looked after and the commitment, as stated in the Government amendment, will be adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Our retired public servants have a justifiable case.  Given that we have been a short time in Government, I believe we will be able to honour our commitment in the context of the Government amendment.  I hope the Minister and Minister of State will be given enough support <Col N="135" /> to ensure that this justifiable case is addressed as soon as possible within the confines of the Estimates with which the Minister for Finance is dealing.  Given the seriousness of this matter, I am hopeful it will be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate what my colleague, the Minister for Finance, said yesterday when he tabled an amendment to this motion to ensure there is no misunderstanding in this regard in the House.  He said that Dáil Éireann, recalling the pledge of the Government parties outlined in the Action Programme for the Millennium to protect public service pensions, notes that it is the intention of the Government to honour this commitment. There is no ambiguity in the language used by the Government in that regard.  It is wrong of Opposition Deputies to mischievously upset and undermine those who are concerned about this issue, many of whom I spoke to when they protested outside Dáil Éireann some weeks ago.</P>
      <P>When introducing the motion Deputy Quinn said that the Government had 117 days to resolve this problem.  He also said that it had done nothing to meet its commitments, but the Government has been actively dealing with this problem.  Therefore, I therefore reject Deputy Quinn's suggestions.  There has been contact with the Commission on Public Service Pensions and, as the Minister for Finance said, the matter will be resolved in the near future in the context of the current Estimates and budgetary process.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn also said that the previous Government, despite the matter being within its remit for two years or more, could not resolve it because all the restructuring deals had not been finalised.  That is a spurious argument.  The general nature, thrust and cost of most of the deals were well known for at least a year before the previous Government went out of office.  Many of them had been finalised.  It would have been possible for the previous Government to come to a conclusion on the pensions aspect, but it was not prepared to do so because of the complexity of the problem and for other reasons.</P>
      <P>This was a live issue during most, if not all, the period of office of the previous Government, but it did not take action on it.  Under the circumstances it ill behoves them now to make a song and dance about the fact that the Government is taking a couple of months to dispose of such a difficult and complex matter, and it will dispose of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House can be assured that the Government will honour its commitments to ensure a fair and reasonable outcome to this matter and will arrange for a secure and fair level of retirement income for public service pensioners.  The Government will decide the manner in which the commitment to protect public service pensions will be implemented as part of the current Estimates <Col N="136" /> and budgetary process.  The budget is due on 2 December.</P>
    <P>I want to make it crystal clear that the Government has never rejected the system of pensions parity and has applied it in the context of the first phase pay increase of Partnership 2000.  I also reiterate that the restructuring deals, which has given rise to this problem, vary widely in nature and they commit staff to deliver genuine productivity and flexibility which would not have been delivered by the previous pensioners.  They are, therefore, very difficult to knit into the rationale underlying the Irish system of pension increases.  It was never the intention that pensions parity would apply to pensioners changes in the grading of their posts which occurred after retirement or changes in pay resulting from productivity. The intention was rather to ensure that a pension would be related to the pay a pensioner would have had if he or she had remained in a post doing the same work at the same level of productivity as applied while he was in service.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of the motion would, by applying traditional parity to the deals, produce widely differing results for various groups of public service pensioners, with some benefiting very substantially and others getting little or no benefit.</P>
    <P>I direct the attention of Deputies to the fact that, even assuming no further improvement in public service pensions terms, there will be a huge increase in the cost of public service pensions over the coming years.  The cost could increase more than fivefold in the next 30 years.  For example, if it were assumed that average pay increased by about 5 per cent annually and prices by about 2.5 per cent annually &mdash; everybody would agree that those figures are conservative &mdash; the bill in the year 2025 would total £2.9 billion in constant price terms.  Great care must be taken in deciding on any cost-increasing changes in the existing system.</P>
    <P>The unfavourable cost outlook for public service pensions will materialise at a time of greatly increasing social welfare pensions and health care costs.  It is estimated that total social welfare pension payments will increase from £1.7 billion currently to £3.2 billion in 2026 and £4.3 billion in 2046, on the basis that pensions are increased in line with inflation.  If increased in line with earnings, the bill would rise to £5.6 billion in 2026 and £11.3 billion in 2046.</P>
    <P>It does not diminish our concern to treat public service pensioners in a fair and equitable way that the Government considers it our duty to take full account of the emerging costs of the Exchequer pensions bill.  The Government has given considerable attention to the issue of applying pensions increases to pensioners under the restructuring clause of the PCW.  To help it in this area, it referred the matter to the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>
    <P>The commission in its reply said it would face difficulties in articulating a definitive view on this problem at this juncture.  It considered the issue in its interim report but stressed that any comments <Col N="137" /> are necessarily incomplete and preliminary. It emphasised that it would consider this issue within the broad range of pension issues coming within its remit and on which it is scheduled to report to Government in 1998.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, its preliminary view on the pension increases issue, as set out in the interim report, was that pensions should be increased to provide a secure and fair level of retirement income to pensioners.  The commission went on to suggest there are three principal pension increase options available &mdash; in line with pay, the CPI or some other index appropriate to pensioners &mdash; and it will consider each of these in its final report.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has been to the forefront in introducing significant improvements in the position of public service pensioners &mdash; for example, the introduction of parity for pensioners and the pension scheme for the spouses and children of public servants.  With our partners in this Government, we are equally committed to protecting public service pensioners as outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  Our commitment is clear in the programme.  The Labour Party position, however, was never clarified when it was in Government.  The Minister for Finance has stated he will ensure that pensioners in general are dealt with equitably.</P>
    <P>I stand over the view that the Labour Party motion would give little or nothing to many groups of public servants.  If that is the effective position of the Labour Party, it is a very strange approach from a group professing to have great concern for public service pensioners.  The present Government is trying to achieve a comprehensive solution to this matter which will be fair and equitable to all parties.</P>
    <P>As the Minister clearly stated, having full regard to the emerging costs, he is committed to devising a solution which marries the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> with the rationale underlying the concept of pensions parity.  The Government will decide the manner in which the commitment to protect public service pensions will be implemented as part of the current Estimates-budgetary process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to reply to the debate on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I get into the substance of what I want to say, I will comment on the Minister of State's last remarks.  Nobody in the Labour Party would ever support a proposition which would leave pensioners worse off and the Minister of State knows that.  A number of options have been put by the public service committee of congress to the Minister's official, one of which is that there should be a basic floor of 3 per cent or perhaps 5 per cent.  I am not in the business of prescribing the eventual solution for this, but everybody is agreed that no pensioner will be worse off as a result of any deal done and there is nothing in <Col N="138" /> this Labour Party motion which would have that effect.</P>
    <P>There are two issues before the House.  First, and most importantly, there is the question of public service pensions.  Second, there is the related question of the credibility of Government and the integrity of the political process.</P>
    <P>Since 1969, successive Governments have accepted the need to guarantee the value of public service pensions.  That need was particularly pressing during the years of hyper-inflation in the mid-and late 1970s.  The reasoning and the justice of the case was obvious then as it is now; it was in all conscience simply not possible to contemplate a position where pensioners were on a fixed income while wages and prices were rising at a rate of 20 per cent, 25 per cent and, at one stage, at an even higher rate.</P>
    <P>There are several ways in which this can be done.  Pensions can be linked to the consumer price index, wage inflation generally or the salaries of public servants still in office, and it is the latter practice which is the one which has been traditionally followed.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest earlier to Deputy Lenihan and, indeed, the Minister of State as they sought to distinguish between options A and B in the PCW.  There is a distinction to be made, but the suggestion appears to be that if one goes for or looks at the restructuring option it is somehow not possible in principle or in practice to apply an increase which is granted under that option to retired pensioners.  That defies logic.</P>
    <P>It may be something of a cliché, but we have been, and are, well served by our public servants. This is a small peripheral European country.  The State was required in its early years as a matter of practical necessity to set up infrastructure and provide services which in other countries are often provided by the private sector.  Many of the services we now take for granted were built up from a very low base and it is worth remembering the appalling conditions in which today's pensioners worked.  Even when I went to school some 20 years ago in the early 1970s, it was quite common to have more than 50 pupils in a primary school class, circumstances which today's teachers would never accept and rightly so.  Public servants, such as gardaí, teachers and nurses, until recent years where paid a salary which was a good deal less than adequate.  It is also fair to say that in recent years many of those workers have caught up with private sector pay rates and that is all to the good.  We cannot retrospectively increase the salary of those who gave service in the past but we can and must recognise that service by making due provision for these people in their old age.</P>
    <P>The current position is unusual but it is not unprecedented.  Since 1986, it has been the practice to extend so-called special increases which are granted to serving workers to pensioners who served previously in the same grade or the nearest equivalent.  The logic here is simple and compelling <Col N="139" /> and is driven by a simple appreciation of the facts.</P>
    <P>A report was circulated last year to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs which sets out the extent of special pay increases in the public service from 1979 to date.  The report drew largely on material which had been compiled by the NESC.  This report shows that every grade in the Civil Service benefited to some extent during the period to which I refer, that is 1979 to 1992, from some sort of special award ranging from 6 and 9 per cent for clerical officers and clerical assistants up to 36 per cent for the secretary and the assistant secretary.  Special awards are by no means new.  On the contrary, they are a well established way in which we remunerate civil servants.  It is my understanding, this is the nub of the debate, that all or at least most of these increases were applied <i>pro rata</i> to the pensions of people who retired from the same grade.  How could it be otherwise?</P>
    <P>Job descriptions and demarcations are constantly changing.  The job done by a nurse today is quite different from that done ten to 20 years ago.  It must be remembered that 20 years ago the vast majority of nurses retired when and if they married.  At that time nurses were expected to work no longer than five to ten years and the pay scale reflected that presumption.  Now, the position could hardly be more different.  Most nurses carry out clinical duty on a regular basis, are highly trained and make use of sophisticated equipment virtually all the time.  The previous Government established a Commission on Nursing to consider the role of nurses in the future. The commission's interim report was published at the beginning of the month and it acknowledges that many nurses seek and acquire qualifications above and beyond the basic nursing qualification. It stands to reason that this should be taken into consideration when setting pay rates.</P>
    <P>More training, greater flexibility and higher productivity are increasingly becoming features of the labour market.  It is correct that workers should be remunerated accordingly but it is also correct that pensioners should receive <i>pro rata</i> increases.  If we do not go down the road towards parity, or if we do not preserve that road, we will inevitably create a two tier or multi-tier pension system.  Surely it cannot be right that one retired nurse is on one rate of pension while another retired nurse with the same service in the same grade receives a different rate of pension by virtue of the fact that they retired on different days. Any such system should rightly be seen to be unfair and discriminatory and it will lead to great resentment.  This is something we should seek to avoid at all costs.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to two matters of detail in respect of which the Minister of State may be able to provide information.  Since 1995 newly recruited civil servants pay the full rate of PRSI. As I understand it, they are paid a higher rate of gross pay to compensate for this fact.  Equally, I <Col N="140" /> understand that the pension rates are calculated by reference to gross pay.  Does that imply that civil servants paying the higher rate will be entitled to a higher pension when they retire?  If that is so, surely it is invidious.  My second point relates to performance-related pay which is an important element of the SMI and the Minister of State is interested in introducing reforms in this area.  In time, I hope a large number of civil servants will be entitled to an element of performance-related pay.  Am I correct in assuming that this will be discounted for the purpose of assessing parity?  I do not know if these matters have received attention as yet.  Will the Minister of State clarify the position at a later date?</P>
    <P>In his contribution, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, made a number of interesting remarks in respect of the funding of public service pensions.  He referred at length to the interim report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which unfortunately has not been placed in the public domain.  This makes it difficult for me and other Members on this side of the House to comment on its contents in detail.  However, I read the actuarial review of social welfare pensions published recently by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to which the Minister of State referred.  Some of the contents of that report, particularly its projections and statistics, are startling.  For example, it is projected that the number of persons over 65 years of age will increase from the current figure of 414,000 &mdash; 11 per cent of the population &mdash; to 1.018 million &mdash; 27 per cent of the population &mdash; in the year 2056.  Part of this will result from changes in the birth rate but, in the main, it will be due to longer life expectancy.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party recognises that this will present us with an important challenge.  It was with this in mind that Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Finance, asked the Commission on Public Service Pensions to undertake the valuable work in which it is currently engaged.  My party will be happy to play its part in any public discussion of the issues.  Having said that, I find a number of the Minister's comments disturbing.  He stated that the priority must be that additional pension scheme improvements are not introduced which would impose significant additional pension liabilities.</P>
    <P>During a discussion on the 1997 Estimates, at which I believe the Minister of State was present, the current Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, made it clear in his inimitable way that he was prepared to think the unthinkable on this issue, even if that upset many public servants. Many public servants will be upset by the approach the Minister is thinking of adopting.  We must make it clear that the State will meet its liabilities to retired public servants.  More than that, in as much as we can, we must ensure that retired persons share the benefits of current economic growth.</P>
    <P>For many years the Progressive Democrats and, to a lesser extent, Fianna Fáil have cribbed <Col N="141" /> about the number of public servants, the work they do and the level of public sector pay.  This culminated in the Progressive Democrats' infamous election pledge to reduce Civil Service numbers by 25,000.  The last thing we need is for this carping and cribbing to be translated into carping and cribbing about public service pensioners. These people have served us well and deserve our unqualified thanks and support in the future.</P>
    <P>My party acknowledges that there is a challenge which must be met.  Consideration must be given to meeting future liabilities.  In these days of budget surplus there is an argument in favour of setting aside moneys in a pension fund which would at least partially finance public service pensions in the future.  We are willing to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the politics of the current situation. In a press statement dated 4 June last, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste stated that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government would request the central review committee of Partnership 2000 to resolve the claim for pension parity for retired public service staff as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil candidates made it clear to pensioners that they would &ldquo;see them right&rdquo; if they were returned to Government.  They were returned to Government and have been in power for four months.  What has happened in the interim?  The simple answer is &ldquo;not very much&rdquo;. Officials of the public service committee of congress met with officials of the Department of Finance on June 23 last, three days before the Government was formed.  They have not met since and, as far as I am aware, the Minister has no plans for such a meeting.  From the tone of the contributions of the Minister and the Minister of State, this is now regarded as a matter for decision of Government.  It is no longer a matter for negotiation or the CRC.  If that is the case, perhaps the Minister or Minister of State can clarify the position.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks we have witnessed the disturbing sight of pensioners demonstrating outside this House.  Understandably, these people feel badly let down and abused.  Who can blame them?  The sense of urgency which the Taoiseach and Tánaiste felt on 4 June has apparently evaporated in the afterglow in the election victory.</P>

      <P>Last night, the Minister stated that this is a complex matter.  The Minister of State repeated it this evening Of course it is <Col N="142" /> important.  However, the Minister and his party were aware of that on 4 June when they undertook to deal with this issue as a matter of urgency. In Opposition, Fianna Fáil offered a quick fix when it ought to have known that it could not or would not deliver.</P>
      <P>The past weeks have been bad for politics in Ireland.  The Government has performed more U-turns in the first weeks of this session than any Administration in recent memory.  The programme for Government committed the Government to introducing mandatory reporting of child abuse.  On 9 October the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, informed us that the Government would do nothing of the kind.  The programme for Government committed the Government to a 10 per cent of corporation tax.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Tánaiste travelled to Brussels and informed us they could deliver nothing of the kind.  In its programme for Government the Government undertook to fully fund the case against Sellafield being taken by the residents of County Louth, up to and including an appeal if needed.  The Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, later announced that the funding would be capped, the Independent Deputies intervened and no one now knows the actual position.</P>
      <P>The Government has done violence to the integrity of the political system.  How can we expect people to believe what we say when we do not apparently seem to believe it ourselves?  The Government will not be forgiven if it attempts a U-turn on the issue before the House.  Deputy Healy-Rae and other Independent Deputies were quick to embrace the pensioners when they came to this House.  Now is the time for the Deputy and others to demonstrate their persuasive power.  I look forward to their supporting the motion.</P>
      <P>There are 78,000 public service pensioners.  The maximum total cost of applying the parity principle would be in the region of £30 million.  It is worth putting that figure in context.  The total cost of public service pensions this year will be £540 million.  The Department of Finance underestimated this year's tax revenue by at least £.5 billion.  Growth this year will be pushing double figures.  We will run an overall budget surplus, not just a current budget surplus, for the first time in decades.  If things are so rosy &mdash; and they are &mdash; how can this Government possibly justify the sort of penny pinching in which it is currently engaged?  Pensioners should not be made the victims of this Government's ideological hang-ups about spending, nor should they become the victims of yet another Government U-turn.  I welcome the Minister's confirmation, albeit belated, that the matter will be dealt with.  We on this side of the House will hold him to it.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Adjournment Debate." RHead="- Herring Prices">
    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Herring Prices.</Title>
    <Col N="147" />
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of raising this important matter on the Adjournment. I want to acquaint the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources of the serious collapse in the prices paid to Irish fishermen along the south and south-western seaboard for herring netted in the Celtic Sea.  I ask the Minister to consider paying a subsidy to the fishermen concerned on a short-term basis, say, up to the end of December 1997 or Christmas week; no fishing is done in the last ten days of that month.</P>
      <P>The Irish herring quota from the Celtic Sea is only 20,000 tonnes, according to EU regulations, with 60 fishing vessels sharing that quota on a twinning system.  Norway got a concession to supply 30,000 to 50,000 tonnes to the EU market recently resulting in the collapse of the prices paid to Irish fishermen for herring fillets exported to the German and other markets.</P>
      <P>The prices of Irish herring have now been reduced to £80 per tonne or approximately £3.50 per box.  Last year and in previous years Irish fishermen were getting £200 per tonne for their fish. The Japanese market for herring roe has collapsed from £5 per kilo to £2 per kilo this year. That situation was brought about by Canada which flooded the market with herring roe at rock bottom prices.</P>
      <P>I need not remind the Minister that the Norwegian and Canadian fishermen are heavily subsidised, and unless Irish fishermen are subsidised likewise our herring fishing fleet will become bankrupt this year.  I urge the Minister to accede to my request and subsidise our herring catch by at least £50 per tonne, thereby allowing our fishermen to survive the critical period up to the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Such action by the Minister will not create a precedent.  The Government recently announced a subsidised package for cereal growers seriously affected by the recent bad weather and rightly so. The Minister should give a subsidy of £50 per tonne to our beleaguered herring fishermen, thereby allowing them to earn a living for themselves and their families.</P>
      <P>I implore the Minister to take action because the fishermen have already suffered as a result of the herring quota from the Celtic Sea being reduced to 20,000 tonnes.  With all the quotas and restrictions in place, the herring in the Celtic Sea are in danger of dying of old age.  I hope the Minister will lend a compassionate ear to my request on behalf of the beleaguered fishermen around our southern and western coasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern and the concern of the Celtic Sea and north-western <Col N="148" /> herring fishermen about the current state of the herring markets.</P>
      <P>The two main herring fisheries in Ireland, the Celtic Sea and the North West fishery, are now in peak production and significant quantities of herring are being caught for processing and export.  The prices in the autumn fisheries have been low, particularly when compared with the historically high prices which were available last year.  This is a cause of major concern to the fishermen and to fish processors and exporters and is a matter I have been monitoring closely.</P>
      <P>To understand the present position in the Irish herring fisheries it is necessary to explain the nature of the markets to which we export our herring products.  The most valuable herring product is the herring roe which is primarily exported to Japan and the Far East.  The other main product is whole herring and herring flaps which are exported primarily to the European markets.</P>
      <P>The position in both these markets has been affected by the high volumes of supply which have entered the herring markets from the new Atlanto-Scandic herring fishery and from the major Canadian and United States fisheries.  High levels of supply of herring roe to Japan from the North American herring fishery earlier this year, coupled with a carry over of herring roe in Japanese cold stores, has resulted in low demand and relatively low prices for herring roe coming from the Irish autumn fisheries.  It is reported the Canadian roe fishery, which predates our autumn fishery, had a very good season and produced 3,000 tonnes of roe.  This, combined with a reported 15,000 tonnes of roe in stock in Japan due to over supply last season, has resulted in Japan reducing the price of herring roe worldwide.</P>
      <P>In addition, the recovery of the huge AtlantoScandic herring stock to the west and north of Norway has resulted in almost one and a half million tonnes of herring being fished in that fishery this year by Russia, Norway, Iceland, Faroe Islands and a number of EU countries, including Ireland.  For the first time ever Ireland had a quota of 12,000 tonnes in this fishery, which is almost totally fished.  This volume of supply from the Atlanto Scandic herring fishery, which is over a million tonnes greater than it was three years ago, is having a depressing effect on global herring markets.  Large volumes of Atlanto Scandic herring are finding their way into Dutch, German, Danish and eastern European markets and are reducing demand and price for herring.  These factors are combining to impact on the returns to the fishermen in the Celtic Sea herring fishery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in the Celtic Sea is that the autumn fishery was opened at the request of the industry on 5 October, with a remaining quota of 11,500 tonnes to be fished before the end of the year.  It is being managed on a day to day basis by my Department's sea fishery officers.  The total landings to date in the fishery, which is primarily a roe fishery, are about 1,800 tonnes.  The quality of the roe in the fishery has improved this week <Col N="149" /> and I hope that this will lead to improved prices. The total withdrawals of herring under the existing EU market support schemes has amounted to 81 tonnes since the opening of the autumn fishery. This means that 4.5 per cent of the landings have needed to use the withdrawal system.  Given that withdrawals can run up to 14 per cent of the landings and that the maximum 6 per cent of landings which can be carried over has not been fully reached by all the producer organisations, there is still some scope for further use of the existing market support schemes if necessary. However, I hope that this will not be necessary.</P>
    <P>My Department is monitoring the fishery and will impose a temporary closure if there is a temporary market collapse or if the fish landed is of poor quality.  In this way, I intend that we will continue to manage the fishery to ensure maximum returns to the fishing industry from the available quotas.  In addition to the management of the fishery, I would like to see continuing close co-operation between the catching and processing sectors to ensure that nationally we do all in our power to maximise the benefit of the industry to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan has requested that I consider allocating a subsidy payable to the fishermen concerned on a short-term basis up to the end of each year.  The position on this mater is that the payment of subsidies is governed by EU law.  The guidelines for the examination of state aid to fisheries and aquaculture state clearly:</P>
    <P>State aid that is calculated on the quantity produced or marketed, product prices, units produced or the means of production, and which has the effect of reducing the recipients' production costs or improving the recipients' income is, as operating aid, incompatible with the common market.</P>
    <P>In short, this kind of income subsidy is ruled out under EU law and, therefore, it is not within my ambit to consider such a scheme.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I am most anxious that, as I indicated, to the extent it is necessary, we should make maximum use of existing market support schemes for herring.  These allow for the withdrawal from the market of herring where it is offered for sale and does not make the minimum withdrawal price and the payment of a carry over subsidy where product is held over to be reintroduced to the market at a later stage.  I am instructing my officials to assist the industry in relation to the utilisation of the existing schemes. In addition I intend to work intensively with Bord Iascaigh Mhara to open up markets for Irish herring products to ensure that a variety of market opportunities exist for Irish exporters.  In this regard I will pay particular attention to the scope for increased exports to far eastern markets.</P>
    <P>I will continue to press at European level to reduce the current level of preferential access to European markets which non-member states enjoy, as Deputy Sheehan pointed out, through the autonomous tariff quotas and tariff suspension <Col N="150" /> schemes.  Ireland has consistently opposed the opening of autonomous tariff quotas for herring imports and I intend to continue and strengthen this opposition at every opportunity. It is only through this co-ordinated series of actions at national and international level that this temporary downturn in prices for herring can be gradually reversed and the returns to the fishing industry restored.</P>

      <P>Last week the Government accepted a motion to urgently support the legal case of the County Louth residents' group against BNFL through the provision of the necessary financial assistance towards research and legal costs, as well as appropriate technical expertise and information.  Accepting the motion the Minister of State undertook to meet the residents.  That meeting has not taken place and the arrangements for a meeting which was due to be held this evening were cancelled by the Minister of State who refused to agree to allow the STAD group to take a verbatim record of the meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>A letter from the group's legal representatives sent to the Minister this morning states:</P>
      <P>It was confirmed to us last evening by [an identified official] that you would not be prepared to proceed with the meeting scheduled for 5 p.m. today if our clients had in attendance a note-taker.  Our clients do not accept the stated reason that it was a matter of protocol having regard to the fact that the previous meeting of 6th October was in the presence of a note-taker.</P>
      <P>It is an interesting comment on the collapse of the trust between the STAD group and the Government that it feels it is necessary to have a stenographer present at the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government communicated by letter with the group this evening and, no doubt, the Minister of State will put much of that letter on the record in his reply.  The letter represents yet another change in the Government's position on this issue.  Indeed its position changes so often that its policy on Sellafield has gone into a spin. The response sees the Government distancing itself from the residents' case.  It is putting responsibility back on them.  The letter states: &ldquo; . any State assistance which would be offered to <Col N="151" /> them would be in the context of their responsibility to pursue the case.&rdquo; There is no sense in the letter that the case is being taken on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>It is a case of the Government telling the residents that it will provide them with £350,000 and wishing them good luck with the case while it pulls out.  There is no evidence in the letter that the Government believes in the case or that the case has any validity.  Regrettably, the opposite appears to be the case.  The research proposals put forward by the residents' group are rubbished, although the previous Government had agreed to accept the research proposals put forward.</P>

      <P>Which of them will be funded? No commitment has been given in the letter sent this evening that a specific proposal will be funded.  No provision is made for legal costs, although the motion in the House explicitly included that aspect.</P>
      <P>BNFL must be delighted that it has a Government which is only half-hearted in its opposition to Sellafield and which fails to give the support to which the STAD group is entitled.  It is in contrast to the anti-Sellafield rhetoric we heard last month from the former Minister for Foreign Affairs at the UN.  The Government has refused to stand up and be counted when asked to do so. It is a case of being Mighty Mouse at the UN and miser mouse when it comes to supporting the County Louth residents.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for sharing his time.  I support the points he has made.  This is an unbelievable and bizarre state of affairs. There has been a series of U-turns on the issue of funding the Dundalk residents.  First we had the Fianna Fáil election manifesto, which stated that full funding would be provided; then there was the first offer, which was supposed to be a full and final settlement; then the Taoiseach said in the House he would provide full funding; and today the Minister of State made a slightly improved offer in a fax to the group.  The Minister has effectively undermined the case against British Nuclear Fuels and Sellafield and we now see a demand for secret meetings of which no reporting will be allowed.</P>
      <P>I demand that we stop messing about on this issue.  The main Government party has made a clear commitment and I demand that the Minister of State use his influence with his senior colleagues to see that this commitment is met in full. I ask him to meet the residents and to allow a note taker if that is their wish.  The Government should meet its obligations in this matter and fully fund the case, as was clearly promised before the election.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Stagg for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to discuss it and to clarify to the House the present position &mdash; it appears this needs to be done.  The House is aware, from the discussions last week on the Private Members' motion tabled by Deputy John Bruton and Deputy Yates, that I offered to meet the County Louth residents in the near future to discuss the Government's revised offer of financial assistance and other support.  I have been in constant contact with the residents since last week and I offered to meet them today to discuss the enhanced proposals which the Government has authorised me to offer them.</P>
      <P>We had mutually agreed the format for the meeting.  I had in addition recommended that an official report of our meeting be drawn up so that there would be clarity about the scope of the Government's proposals and the conclusions to emerge following the residents' response to them. Any amendments proposed by the residents to the official report would form part of an agreed record of the meeting.  It was my intention that these arrangements would allay the residents' concerns about any misinterpretation of positions or doubts in relation to the Government's offer of assistance.  I also hoped my suggestion of agreed reporting would foster a spirit of co-operation which the Government and I are anxious to encourage.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed that the residents insisted on having a stenographer present to produce a verbatim record of the meeting.  I had hoped we would be in a position to proceed on the basis of co-operation and mutual trust and be able to agree, together, the record of our meeting.  I have no objection to the residents making their own notes of any of our meetings and of course I would expect it.  Reluctantly, I accepted the presence of a stenographer at our first meeting.  At the beginning of that meeting I expressed my aversion to having a stenographer present and I gave my reasons for that.  However, I wanted the meeting to continue, which is why I accepted it.  I believed then and still do that this is not the normal way to conduct business between the residents and myself.  I am sure the two former Ministers who have just spoken would also take that view.  It would not be the conventional approach to a Minister's meeting with representative groups.  Despite my best efforts, the residents declined the agreed reporting approach which I hoped would remove any risk of misunderstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be helpful to the residents and I want this matter to progress as quickly as possible.  The residents have indicated that they would be equally happy to receive the Government's enhanced offer of assistance in writing.  This afternoon, therefore, I issued a detailed letter to the residents setting out the scope and level of assistance which the Government now proposes.  I intend to treat these proposals as confidential and <Col N="153" /> will continue to do so until my communications with the residents enable me to comment further. I hope to hear from them as soon as they have had time to consider this offer.</P>
    <P>I hope they will be in a position to accept the enhanced offer.  I am prepared, at any stage, to discuss the matter further with them and to answer and clarify any questions they may have. I will endeavour to ensure that there will be no unnecessary delays and prompt responses will issue to any queries that I receive from the residents.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I would have preferred to have discussed these matters face to face with the residents and I am sorry that it was not possible to do so this time.  I hope to build a good working relationship with the residents and I sincerely wish to put this matter behind us.  I want us to move forward together in a spirit of co-operation and mutual trust.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Adjournment Matter concerns stage four of the Listowel regional water supply scheme which is intended to supply the head works for group scheme development in the general area of Asdee, County Kerry.  This is also referred to as the north-east Kerry regional water supply scheme.</P>
      <P>Full contract documentation was forwarded to the Department of the Environment in May 1991 with a request for approval to go to tender.  To date no approval has been received.  Over 500 householders are involved, including farmers, small business people, shopkeepers, publicans, public servants, industrial workers, guest house operators and old age pensioners.  Asdee is the only village in Kerry without a mains water supply and this is not acceptable.  The Asdee area is one of the most highly populated areas in the country without a mains supply.  This is holding back development in the locality, especially in tourism.  The area is on the bank of the Shannon and is close to resorts like Ballybunion with its golf course, etc.  Many tourists are attracted to the area and they would stay locally if accommodation was provided.  However, the lack of an adequate water supply has held the area back in recent times and if such a supply is not provided it will restrict it in the future.</P>
      <P>The alternative source of water supply is from wells but the local supply is of poor quality &mdash; it has a high concentration of iron and lime, it has proven expensive to filter and even then the supply is poor.  This also leads to widespread corrosion of water pipes and householders are losing a considerable amount of money because of the lack of a mains supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the scheme has been proposed during the past two and a half years and when I was part of the last Government I brought it to the attention of the then Minister for the Environment on several occasions.  Unfortunately the scheme was not approved in that period but I <Col N="154" /> appeal to the Minister of State to do so.  Not long ago I remember answering Adjournment Matters tabled by him on group water schemes.  He has been in the Department of the Environment before and more than anyone he realises the importance of mains supply to rural areas, such as this one.  I ask him and his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to prioritise this scheme.  It is critical for the people living in the locality and for the surrounding community that a decision is made as soon as possible.  It would add greatly to the confidence of an area that is losing its population and its small businesses.  This is the type of morale booster the area needs.</P>
    <P>I hope provision for the scheme has been made in the Estimates.  It would cost about £2.5 million to provide the necessary headworks at Farranastack and Lacca at Lisselton to provide the water for Asdee.  I appeal to the Minister of State to be as positive as possible.</P>

      <P>My colleague and Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, regrets he is unable to be present in the House this evening to reply and he has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I will speak in a moment about the north west Kerry regional water supply scheme, but first I will address the wider issue of rural water supplies. It has been recognised by all sides of the House that rural water supplies are under threat. Recent reports indicate that a sizeable proportion of rural water supply systems, especially among the smaller private group schemes, are substandard and require substantial investment to bring them to an acceptable level in terms of water quality, the amount of water supplied and water lost through leakage.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the greatest possible amount of capital funding will be made available to support rural water supplies. Such investment is needed not only to provide for new public schemes but to assist the groups scheme sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year a number of measures were introduced to secure the improvement of rural water supplies through the provision of grants and subsidies to private group schemes and grants for the improvement or provision of new water supplies to houses not already connected to either a group or a public water supply scheme.  Of equal importance, however, is the need for local authorities to prepare comprehensive strategic <Col N="155" /> rural water plans which will provide a blueprint for the development of water services for rural areas in partnership with the voluntary group scheme sector.  Local authorities have been asked to prepare such plans over the next three years and, in the meantime, to submit to the Department before the end of this month a multi-annual programme of prioritised schemes for funding to cover the period 1998-2000.</P>
    <P>The Listowel regional water supply scheme, stage 4, proposes to provide water to an area largely served by individual well and rainwater tanks and provide the headworks for group development in the general area of Asdee and the north west of the county.  Contract documents for the scheme were submitted in May 1991 and are currently being held in the Department.  The estimated cost of the scheme at the time of preparation of the documents was £2.1 million.  It has not been possible given the high level of commitments under the water and sewerage investment programme to provide funding for this scheme.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister is not in a position at this stage to give a commitment to the funding of the scheme.  This will depend in large measure on the priority to be awarded to the scheme in the context of Kerry County Council's overall strategy for rural water supplies.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Hepatitis C Prosecutions.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions has stated that under current criminal law he is satisfied it is not possible to initiate a criminal prosecution in respect of the hepatitis C scandal.  He made his decision on the basis of the report of the tribunal of inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board and on the basis of what he described as a preliminary Garda investigation. The vast majority of the public believes criminal prosecutions should be brought against those responsible for the worst public health scandal in the history of the State.  I share that belief and am concerned about the basis upon which the Director of Public Prosecutions arrived at his decision.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children should clarify the nature of the preliminary investigations conducted by the Garda.  Were these sufficient to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to make an informed decision on whether a prosecution should be brought?  Did the Garda Síochána seek to question those named in the Finlay report as culpable for what occurred and did they co-operate in the investigation that was conducted?  Why was only a preliminary investigation conducted?  Why was it not a full investigation?  Why is the investigation qualified as being a preliminary investigation? Was the investigation a political optical illusion? These questions demand answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I anticipated the possibility that the Director of Public Prosecutions might determine it was not possible under present criminal law to institute <Col N="156" /> proceedings against those responsible for the failings so graphically described in the Finlay report. I said it might be necessary to fill a gap in the law in this area and to enact specific criminal law legislation to provide that where a person vested with a public duty behaves with such recklessness or gross negligence as to endanger the life or health of others, such dereliction of duty should constitute a criminal offence.  Such legislation is in force in a number of European Union countries.  I refer to the examples of the laws in force in both France and Spain.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said this morning the introduction of new legislation to address this area should be considered by the Law Reform Commission. That is not a satisfactory response.  We must urgently introduce new legislation to ensure the full rigours of criminal law can apply in the future to any person responsible for another tragedy of this nature.  It is the hope of all Members that the events at the BTSB are never repeated.  If by the end of November the Government has not produced the necessary legislation, I intend to bring a Private Members' Bill before the House to address the issue in full.</P>
    <P>We should not simply wring our hands with regard to the hepatitis C scandal and accept that no prosecutions can be brought.  The late Mrs. Brigid McCole tragically died in October last year as a result of liver failure due to hepatitis C as a result of receiving batch 250 of anti-D.  Gross or criminal negligence leading to the death of an individual can result in a charge of manslaughter being brought against those responsible for such conduct.  The Minister must clarify whether the Garda Síochána investigated and considered in detail the circumstances surrounding the death of the late Mrs. McCole in the context of bringing criminal charges for manslaughter as a consequence of her death.  If the investigation did not do so it should be reopened immediately with a view to allowing the Director of Public Prosecutions, on the basis of the additional information that might be furnished to him, to make a further determination as to whether a prosecution for manslaughter can be brought.</P>
    <P>I deeply regret the absence of the Minister for Health and Children for this debate.  This is an extremely serious issue.  It is the worst public health scandal in the history of the State.  This is the first time we have had an opportunity to consider in detail the recommendation of the Director of Public Prosecutions and I fail to understand why the Minister is not doing his parliamentary duty by being present in the House tonight.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a particular issue which demands the Minister's response.  It appears that on 6 October, over two weeks ago, the Director of Public Prosecutions advised the Minister that he did not propose to initiate prosecutions as a result of the BTSB scandal.  The Minister must tell the House why he withheld that information from the public for two weeks.  He must also explain what he was doing in Longfield House a week ago having dinner with Fintan Drury, the public relations <Col N="157" /> adviser of the BTSB.  Was the Minister advising Fintan Drury of the fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions did not intend to proceed to criminal charges and was he considering and discussing with Mr. Drury how best to release that information to the public?  Was he considering with him whether in a public relations context this issue was delicate in the context of the forthcoming presidential election?  The Minister for Health has tried to make the lunchtime engagement of another Member of this House, in Longfield House on that very day, a matter of public controversy.  When this Minister had that lunch he knew the DPP would not prosecute.  He gave that information to the public relations consultant to the BTSB.  I believe he discussed with that public relations consultant how to deal with this from a public relations perspective.  I want the Minister to explain why he withheld that information from the public for a period of two weeks.  That in itself is scandalous.  This House was entitled to know what approach the DPP was taking.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Taoiseach, earlier in this House, and a junior Minister in the Department of Foreign Affairs, on the television news, to have feigned surprise at these events when they were known to Government for two weeks.  The Minister should give the House an explanation for his conduct.  It should not befall his colleague Deputy Woods to be put in a position where he has to deal with this issue.</P>

      <P>I am replying to this debate on behalf of the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who cannot be with us because of the death of his mother.  I offer my sympathy to the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This request for an adjournment debate is inspired by the recent tragic events surrounding the BTSB, which had such horrific consequences for the many women who became infected with the hepatitis C virus.  Our heartfelt sympathies go out to all the victims in this sad and tragic affair. It behoves us to do everything in our power to <Col N="158" /> ensure that nothing of the sort will ever happen again.</P>
    <P>Following his consideration of the events surrounding the BTSB, the Director of Public Prosecutions decided that it was not possible for him to initiate a criminal prosecution under the law as it applied at the time the acts complained of occurred.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that the Director is fully independent in the performance of his duties.  It would not be proper for me to pass any further comment on his decision in this matter.</P>
    <P>There has been a development of the law since these tragic events occurred which is relevant to the sort of situation with which this debate is concerned. The recently enacted Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997, introduced a new offence of endangerment which provides that a person shall be guilty of an offence who intentionally or recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious harm to another.  The offence, if prosecuted on indictment, would make a convicted person liable to an unlimited fine and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years.</P>
    <P>While there are many endangerment offences in our law dealing with specific acts, there was no general endangerment provision nor is there such a general offence in English law.  The provision followed a recommendation made by the Law Reform Commission in its report on non-fatal offences against the person.  The commission pointed out that offences of endangerment of this type were found in the law of the United States and Australian jurisdictions and were in course of creation or being contemplated in Canada and New Zealand.</P>
    <P>The new provision in our 1997 Act cannot be applied retrospectively and, accordingly, the Director of Public Prosecutions was precluded from considering this provision in the context of coming to his decision in the BTSB case.  If conduct of the type mentioned by the proposer of this debate were to happen in the future it would undoubtedly fall to be considered in the light of the creation of this new offence.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, is urgently considering what further initiatives may be required. The most obvious initiative that can be considered is whether further changes in the law are called for and, if so, of what nature.  Obviously, the framing of special laws to deal with the different situations that could arise is a complex matter requiring careful consideration.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Taoiseach indicated on the Order of Business this morning that the Government accepts there is a need to look at the law in this area and that it will do so.  He also mentioned that he would check whether work currently being done by the Law Reform Commission would cover the area in question. The Law Reform Commission is at present considering what changes in the law on fatal offences against the person, the law relating to homicide, <Col N="159" /> are needed to complete its review of the law dealt with in the Offences against the Person Act, 1861.</P>
    <P>I understand that in their consideration of the matter, which is well advanced, they are dealing with the question of negligence as a ground for criminal liability.  The commission is a most appropriate forum in which to consider and make recommendations on whether the law needs further changes to deal with the sort of reckless or negligent behaviour that is in question in this debate.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that any changes that <Col N="160" /> may be made to the law in this area cannot apply to past events.  The House will also recognise the dangers of rushing into complex legislation, which might in practice prove to have been ill considered and ill conceived, particularly in view of the fact that the Oireachtas has so recently amended the law to deal with endangerment.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the Taoiseach indicated this morning that the Government accepts that there is a need to look at the law in this area and that the Government will do so.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23 October 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 28, 29, 47 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>In July last, World Equestrian Games (Ireland) Ltd (WEG) announced that the 1998 World Equestrian Games would not take place in Ireland.  WEG stated that the reason for their decision was that negotiations to secure funding for the games had concluded unsuccessfully.  A liquidator was subsequently appointed to the company.</P>
      <P>This followed the withdrawal of the title sponsor for the games in April 1997 and the decision the following month by the previous Government to cease further Exchequer funding.  Over the period 1994-96, WEG received a total of £820,000 from the Exchequer and a £1.25 million guarantee from Bord Fáilte in respect of the fee payable by WEG to the Federation Equestre Internationale in the event of the games taking place in Ireland in 1998.</P>
      <P>WEG presented me, on coming into office in June, with proposals that the Government should provide a grant of £2.5 million over and above the support already made available.  They also proposed that the State should carry the cost of services provided in connection with the games, such as those of the Army and the Garda.  Following a thorough assessment of the proposals, and having consulted colleagues, including the Minister for Finance, I concluded that the previous Government's decision to cease funding should stand.</P>

      <P>The development aims of the Northern Ireland/Ireland INTERREG II programme, 1994-1999, are:</P>
      <P>(a) to promote the creation and development of networks of cross-Border co-operation and, where relevant, the linking of these networks to wider community networks, in the context of the completion of the internal market of 1992; and</P>
      <P>(b) to assist the eligible area in overcoming the special development problems arising from its relative isolation within national economies and within the European Union as a whole, in the interests of the local population and in a matter compatible with the protection of the environment.</P>
      <P>I agree that the principles mentioned by the Deputy form a key part of the rationale behind the Northern Ireland/Ireland INTERREG II programme, 1994-99.  In this context, the tourism measure is one of a number of economic measures designed to achieve the objectives set.</P>
      <P>The tourism measure has, to date assisted a wide range of projects which has enhanced tourist facilities and amenities in the Border area.  A total of 37 projects have been approved to date for assistance, mostly being capital development, with a number of marketing projects also.  Details of these projects were provided in my written reply to Deputy Bernard Allen, on 16 October 1997.</P>
      <P>Projects assisted under the tourism measure of INTERREG II complement others in the Border region benefiting under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, and the tourism programme of the International Fund for Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 33 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>Specific targets have been set under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 for improving tourism activity in the shoulder and off-peak seasons.  At the beginning of the programme 70 per cent of visitors came to Ireland during the off-peak season and the aim is to increase this figure to 75 per cent by 1999.  The mid-term target set out in the programme is for 72 per cent of visitors to arrive outside the peak period and I am happy to say that this target was reached during 1996.</P>
      <P>On the product development side, the addition to the range and quality of weather independent facilities in recent years is helping to improve the seasonal profile of the tourism product range. The assistance which the industry has received under the Tourism Operational Programme has been of considerable benefit in this regard.</P>
      <P>On the marketing side, the overseas tourism marketing initiative, which is a State-industry partnership marketing initiative, promotes Ireland on a year round basis in the key tourism markets of the US, Britain, France and Germany. Many of its campaigns are directed at attracting visitors outside the peak season.  Tourism Brand Ireland is a key part of a new strategic approach to marketing designed to address major issues such as yield, regional spread and seasonality. The advertising emphasis is on aspects of the Irish holiday experience such as human interaction, culture and historical heritage which are not season-dependent.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Council has been very active over recent years in developing new projects and ideas to extend the tourist season.  The Celtic Flame Music festival is an initiative which emerged from a recommendation of the Tourism Council.  Last week at the first Tourism Council meeting under my chairmanship, it was agreed that £100,000 would be provided towards the costs of the Celtic Flame Festival for the early season next year. This proposal is specially aimed at attracting visitors from Britain and Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another initiative to help address the seasonality issue is the reinvigorated St. Patrick's festival in Dublin which I am convinced has the potential to become a major attraction in the shoulder period. The 1997 festival was allocated £200,000 in Exchequer moneys and further funding will be provided for the 1998 festival.  I am currently talking to the chairman of the St. Patrick's festival company in relation to developing a national millennium celebration which will have a strong seasonality profile.  Finally, the domestic tourism marketing campaign has a particular focus on <Col N="165" /> developing the off-season market and is providing an important boost to the domestic market this year.  With an eye towards 1998, I will be looking carefully at how the overall tourism budget can better be used to extend the season. This will be one of my priorities for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 68 together.  Both myself and representatives of Bord Fáilte have met on a number of occasions key representatives from the European Tour and the PGA to promote Ireland's ability and desire to host the Ryder Cup.  Arising from these meetings, and building on the work of the previous Government, I had the pleasure, on 25 September 1997, of announcing details of a unique partnership between the PGA and Bord Fáilte which will involve a major new joint eight year marketing strategy for Irish golf holidays. This strategy will culminate in the Ryder Cup being staged in Ireland in the year 2005.</P>
      <P>With a view to advancing the technical aspects of this unique partnership, I will soon be establishing a negotiating team whose job will be to profile the best kind of national promotional strategy, formalise arrangements with commercial sponsors and then to work with the Ryder Cup committee on the best ways and means to deliver the various elements of the marketing package agreed.  Overall, the total Exchequer cost will not exceed £4 million over the full eight years of the strategy.</P>
      <P>The organisation of the Ryder Cup competition itself is essentially the responsibility of the European Ryder Cup committee.  However, the House can be assured that every effort will be made both to ensure the success of the event itself and to maximise the benefits it brings to Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Northern Ireland-Ireland INTERREG II Programme, 1994-99, was agreed between the two member states concerned and the European Commission.  The programme is administered jointly by the Department of Finance in Ireland and the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under the Tourism Measure of the Programme, an amount of funding remains to be formally allocated to tourism projects, although, as is usual in such circumstances the aggregate of applications on hand exceeds the amount available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I would welcome the provision of additional resources for the Tourism Measure of INTERREG II, the overall funding for the initiative was agreed at the outset by the three parties concerned and was confirmed by Government decision.  The principal obstacle faced when <Col N="168" /> seeking additional funding is that transfers would have to be made at the expense of other economic measures within the programme.  Transfers at this stage in the lifetime of the programme are not expected, as all measures are projecting that their allocations will be fully committed by the end of 1999.</P>

      <P>The Government recognises the value of sport and recreation activities and the important part such activities can play in fostering a sense of community identity and personal selfesteem, especially for those living in disadvantaged communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government acknowledges that tackling such problems requires a broad response across a <Col N="170" /> number of key policy areas, including environment, education, health and social welfare. This board based approach is fully reflected in the role of the national drugs strategy team, the local development programme and the sports capital programme, all of which come within the remit of my own Department.</P>
    <P>It is important to focus our policies on areas of most need when it comes to allocating scarce resources.  In this context, the plans submitted by the local drugs task forces, while concentrating primarily on treatment and rehabilitation, include a number of proposals for the development of youth and sport amenities, recognising their importance as a major prevention strategy.</P>
    <P>Over the coming months I intend to review our approach to the provision of sport and recreation facilities for vulnerable young people in order to provide a more focused, co-ordinated and coherent response to tackling disadvantage at a local community level.  In this context, Deputy Flood, Minister of State at my Department, will be discussing these issues with all relevant players, including the Garda and the local authorities, as well as ensuring that the people in these communities have a real input to the development of solutions to problems in their areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 31, 53 and 64 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 June last, the Taoiseach announced his intention to make some changes in departmental responsibilities and organisation to reflect and emphasise new priorities in Government.  These included the establishment of a new Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, which also <Col N="171" /> includes responsibility for local development and the national drugs strategy team.</P>
    <P>The establishment of my new Department essentially involved:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the transfer of the trade division and associated staff from the former Department of Tourism and Trade to the new Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the transfer of the sports and local development sections, and associated staff, to my Department from the Departments of Education and the Department of the Taoiseach respectively.</P>
    <P>Over the past few months, I have been working with my officials, in consultation with the other Departments affected by the changes, to ensure a smooth transition of work, to provide suitable accommodation and resources for the new staff and functions and to ensure a coherent internal organisational structure which will adequately reflect the importance which the Government attaches to tourism, sport and recreation.  Most of this work has now been completed.</P>
    <P>The Strategic Management Initiative is already under way in the Department and priority is being given to improving quality of customer service and on a strategy statement incorporating, <i>inter alia</i>, a mission statement.  In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, work has already commenced in this regard.  This strategy statement will be furnished to me by 1 March 1998 so that I may lay it before each House of the Oireachtas within 60 days thereafter in the form approved by me.  At this stage it would clearly be inappropriate for me to speculate as to the likely contents of the new strategy statement, particularly as the formulation of the statement is, in the first instance, a matter for the Secretary-General, of my Department under section 4 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997.</P>

They receive Exchequer funding by way of annual subvention from Bord Fáilte who determine levels of subvention each year for the authorities.  They also derive income from a number <Col N="172" /> of other sources including the local authorities; membership subscriptions and commercial revenue generating activities such as the sale of literature.</P>

In that reply, I indicated that, &ldquo;there are no funds at the disposal of my Department which could facilitate the allocation of special resources towards costs incurred by organisers of hosting specific events such as the commemorative game at the Polo Grounds in New York.  However, my Department does, of course, allocate funds annually, on the basis of recommendations from the Sports Council, to national governing bodies including the GAA. The grant to the GAA this year will amount to almost £130,000 for the purpose of assisting in the promotion and development of the national games&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid) James McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position with the national conference centre project is that, following <Col N="173" /> a Government decision, a new tender procedure has commenced, administered by Bord Fáilte under the aegis of the independent management board for product development.</P>
      <P>The new tender procedure which will be conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC followed on consultations between my Department and the relevant EU officials.  It is open to private or public sector applicants and in accordance with the requirements of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99 the location of the centre will be Dublin.</P>
      <P>The first step in the new tender procedure was the publication of a Prior Indicative Notice, or PIN, in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 6 September.  This was followed by the tender procedure notice, which was published in the Official Journal on 13 September. The notice was also published in the Irish daily newspapers on 16 September.</P>
      <P>This notice invited applicants to submit requests to participate in the tender procedure by 5 p.m. last Monday, 20 October.  By 31 October, &ldquo;Invitation to Tender&rdquo; documentation will be dispatched by Bord Fáilte to selected applicants, following which those applicants will have three months to submit their tender i.e. by the end of January next year following which the tenders will be assessed.</P>
      <P>In relation to the related issues of EU funding and the likely completion date, I would refer Deputies to paragraph 4 of the tender procedure notice which points out that while the final date for taking account of expenditure for projects under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99 is 31 December 2000, there is provision for a member state to request the Commission to extend the time limits by not more than one year. If an extension of more than one year is requested, a formal Commission decision is required.  No expenditure incurred after the agreed end date may be taken into account for the purposes of Structural Fund assistance.</P>
      <P>The maximum amount of that assistance is 33 million ECUs with an aid rate of up to 50 per cent for private sector projects.  In the case of a public or similar body, there is provision for the aid rate to be reviewed by the monitoring committee for the Operational Programme, with the maximum aid rate possible in this category being 75 per cent.</P>
      <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions, I personally, and the Government as a whole, attach a very high priority to the establishment of a national conference centre, as set out in the Government's joint programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium and I will do everything possible to ensure that this crucial piece of tourism infrastructure is progressed to completion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>In its two reports, the ministerial task force made a series of recommendations across a range of areas to tackle the problem of drugs demand.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most notable of these was the establishment of structures at national and local level to target for priority action the areas worst affected by the drugs scourge and co-ordinate the activities of the various agencies &mdash; both statutory and community based.  An essential component of this strategy is to engage local communities in a real and meaningful way in the development and implementation of strategies to combat drug misuse in their areas.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a Cabinet drugs committee, the national drugs strategy team and thirteen local drugs task forces were established on foot of recommendations in the first report of the ministerial task force.</P>
      <P>The priority of this Government is not only to tackle the drugs problem, as manifested in the numbers of drugs misusers in need of treatment and rehabilitation, but also to address the underlying causes of the problem.  In pursuance of this strategy, we have decided to reconstitute the Cabinet drugs committee into a wider Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs (including local development), to reflect the fact that drug abuse is a symptom of a wider problem of social and economic exclusion.  This committee will pull together the various strategies to combat social exclusion (and resultant problems such as drug abuse) into a co-ordinated, targeted response.</P>
      <P>The 13 local drugs task forces, which were established in Dublin and Cork, were mandated to prepare action plans to tackle the demand for drugs in their areas of operation and funding of £10 million was set aside to implement these plans.  Funding is being allocated on the basis of the quality of the plans and the needs of individual task force areas, rather than on a strict geographic distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, 12 task forces have submitted their plans, while the outstanding one is expected shortly.  The Government, on the advice of the national drugs strategy team, has approved initial <Col N="175" /> funding &mdash; totalling £4.89 million &mdash; to 11 task forces to enable them to implement the more straightforward elements of their plans.</P>
    <P>When all the plans have been received and evaluated, the national drugs strategy team will be in a position to make recommendations to Government in relation to the final allocation of funding to implement each of the plans.</P>
    <P>In evaluating the plans, the team is maintaining contact with the task forces regarding any proposals which require further development or clarification.</P>
    <P>As provided in their terms of reference, the task forces have submitted plans which take an integrated approach towards tackling the problem of drugs demand in their areas.  The plans, therefore, include proposals in relation to treatment, rehabilitation and education-prevention. The proposals which are being funded mainly related to the development and support of community based projects and their integration into a coherent anti-drugs strategy, which also incorporates the programmes and services currently provided or planned by the statutory agencies.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to the effort to reduce demand for drugs.  Funding towards the development of the task forces and the ongoing implementation of their plans will be considered by the Government in the context of next year's Estimates.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, there are, as I already mentioned, a range of recommendations in the two reports to tackle the drugs demand problem.  These are being progressed by the Minister responsible for their implementation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will already be aware that the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative (OTMI) is an industry led initiative which represents a joint venture between tourism interests, North and South, whose priority objective is to promote Ireland in the US, British, French and German markets.  The initiative is funded from a variety of sources including the Exchequer, the European Regional Development Fund, Northern Ireland and tourism industry investors, who will all together in 1997, invest in the region of £6.8 million in overseas marketing programmes in these markets.</P>
      <P>Government support this year amounts to £4.15 million which includes direct Exchequer funding of £1.04 million and a matching £3.11 million which is recovered from the EU under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99.  I am satisfied that, given the resources which are in place, the OTMI will make an important contribution to national tourism growth this year.</P>

      <P>All new buildings must comply with buildings regulations, introduced in 1991 by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which state that people with disabilities must be catered for.  These regulations contain provisions for people with disabilities in <Col N="178" /> relation to access to, and circulation within, all new buildings and old buildings which are being renovated.</P>
      <P>In line with the commitment of both the Government and the European Commission to improve the position of the socially disadvantaged, the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, which is the main vehicle for tourism development in Ireland up to the end of this decade, includes provision for funding where appropriate, for support to help meet the additional costs of providing suitable access-friendly facilities for the disabled when submitted to Bord Fáilte or Shannon Development as part of EU grant approved developments.  In interdepartmental discussions aimed at ensuring consistency and complementarity between the tourism and other operational programmes, my Department has stressed the importance of improved access for disabled tourists.  The industry has been circulated widely with a handbook specially prepared by the European Commission for the tourism industry on Making Europe accessible for tourists with disabilities.  Ultimately, of course, it is the industry itself which must adapt its facilities and product if it is to appeal to this market and avail of the sales opportunities which it offers.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should also mention that Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism authorities make every effort to inform disabled tourists, through promotional literature and other means, of the suitability or otherwise of the full range of tourism facilities, including accommodation.  Against this background of increased awareness and action, my Department has not seen any need so far for an audit on the lines mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been policy, for some time, not to provide support for tourist accommodation projects, on the basis of the proven ability of the commercial accommodation sector to respond, without grant assistance to growth in visitor numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This approach was incorporated into the Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-93 agreed with the European Commission and, by and large, carried forward into the current operational programme.  However, the current programme does make an exception in the case of a number of specific market segments where the quality of existing accommodation was recognised to be deficient.  Hence, it includes a provision to assist, on a selective basis, investment in such areas as accommodation-related conference <Col N="179" /> and leisure facilities, a limited scheme of accommodation improvements to existing small and medium-sized hotels with a current capacity of up to 100 bedrooms and graded up to and including three star, limited grant aid for certain specialist accommodation needs such as caravan and camping park facilities; upgrading and improvement of existing buildings for hostel or other specialist accommodation and associated facilities on branded walking routes; provision of new and improved accommodation at approved outdoor pursuits centres in remote areas currently without appropriate accommodation; improvement of existing accommodation at approved residential equestrian centres; horse-drawn caravan and motor-home investments; the additional cost of providing, in existing hotels, suitable access-friendly accommodation for people with disabilities; and improved access for people with disabilities at hotels and major visitor centres.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the overall strategy in the programme, such support is aimed primarily at the enhancement of existing investment rather than supporting new development and all accommodation supported must be registered or approved, as appropriate.  Already, all funds in this regard under the programme are fully committed.</P>
    <P>Currently, the mid-term review of the tourism operational programme is being completed, as part of the overall mid-term review of the Community Support Framework for Ireland and outstanding issues will be dealt with at the Tourism Monitoring Committee meeting scheduled for November, including the matters of possible financial transfers within the programme, re-organisation of priorities and selection criteria.</P>
    <P>Other EU-funded programmes which provide support for smaller tourism initiatives, including accommodation, are the Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry and the Leader II Programme administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Local, Urban and Rural Development Operational Programme under which, <i>inter alia</i>, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's County Enterprise Boards operate.  In the Border counties, limited assistance is also available under the IFI and INTERREG Programmes and the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Additionally, all registered and approved tourism accommodation was eligible for low interest loans under the Access to Finance Scheme launched in September 1995 under the Small Business Operational Programme.  Some £52 million of this £208 million fund was specially earmarked for tourism projects throughout the country but the target was actually exceeded with the allocation of over £56 million, 27 per cent of the fund, to tourism.  A similar scheme especially for the Border counties was introduced under the Peace and Reconciliation Fund and all of it has now been committed.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, investment in registered or approved tourist accommodation in any of the <Col N="180" /> resort areas designated under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas may also qualify for generous tax reliefs under the scheme.  It can be seen, therefore, that there is a very wide range of supports available for those parts of the accommodation sector which are perceived to be in need of some assistance.  In overall terms, the national accommodation stock is sufficient to meet demand.  At present, there are over 3,000 self-catering units available with a good geographical spread and, generally speaking, the supply situation is already regarded as satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The allocation of tickets is a matter for the Football Association of Ireland (FAI). The FAI operates a distribution system which seeks to ensure an equitable distribution of tickets to their affiliated groups and to people who have previously and consistently purchased tickets for Irish international matches.</P>
      <P>The Code of Practice for Safety at Sportsgrounds published in January 1996 emphasises the need to have proper ticket circulation arrangements in place so as to minimise the possibility of tickets falling into the hands of ticket touts.  The code of practice was finalised following detailed consultation with the major sporting organisations, including the FAI.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in touch with FAI who have stated that out of the ground capacity of 34,240, around 31,500 tickets will be available to Irish spectators at the match at Lansdowne Road.</P>

      <P>As a result of the recent mid-term review of the Tourism Operational Programme, European Union grant assistance to the tourism industry in 1999 is expected to be in the region of £82.61 million.</P>
      <P>As to the situation arising after 1999, future EU funding for Ireland arises in the context of the Commission's Agenda 2000 package, which was published last July.  The level of funding post-1999 from Structural Funds for tourism, as with all other sectors, will depend on the overall level of funding available for the country and the regulations governing the spending of such funds.  This will not be known until possibly late 1998 or even early 1999.  This matter will clearly be the subject of complex and lengthy negotiations with the Commission and our EU partners.  Ireland's overall approach to these negotiations is still under consideration but the House can be assured that when the negotiations commence, the Government will ensure that Ireland's interests are vigorously and effectively pursued.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to plan properly for the development of the tourism industry post 1999, and my Department will soon be initiating preparatory discussions with the relevant State bodies and the industry in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, sets out the principal objectives of Ireland's tourism policy and sets strategic targets for the development of the sector up to the end of the century.  The programme includes objectives, strategies and targets across such key areas as product development, marketing and training.  Progress in achieving key targets has been good to date and the industry is on track to reach foreign exchange earnings of £2.25 billion and total employment of 120,000 by 1999.  The programme provided for a mid-term review of its performance, and in July of this year the CSF Monitoring Committee made certain decisions in relation to it.  These decisions will be followed up by the Tourism Monitoring Committee with refinements regarding the allocation of remaining funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Development of the tourism sector is supplemented by tourism related expenditure under other EU co-funded programmes such as those for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry &mdash; agri-tourism scheme &mdash; for Local Urban and Rural Development, INTERREG and the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, and <Col N="184" /> Leader.  The tourism sector also currently benefits from subsidised fixed interest loans, business expansion scheme, urban renewal tax relief, the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas and other tax incentives.</P>
    <P>Preliminary work is already under way and planning for the post-1999 period will begin in earnest from the end of this year.  I understand from the Minister for Finance that the negotiations on the future financing of the European Union, including the Structural Funds, will not commence until the conclusion of the intergovernmental conference when the European Commission will submit a communication on the future financial framework of the Union as from 31 December 1999.  This process and the continued improvement in performance, and strengthening, of the Irish tourism industry itself, will form critical starting off points for the tourism sector in future planned expansion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86, 87, 88, 89 and 90 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be helpful if I were to outline the background to the Charitable Lotteries Fund.  When the national lottery was being established in 1987, the Government accepted that it might prove desirable, in the light of experience, to provide <Col N="190" /> some support for private charitable lotteries, the income from which could be adversely affected by the operation of the national lottery.  In practice, it is difficult to assess the impact of the national lottery on charitable fundraising or to separate the national lottery impact from other effects, such as the decline of popular appeal of some charitable purposes.  Some evidence suggests that public contributions to charitable bodies generally have continued to grow since the introduction of the national lottery.  Charities and the voluntary sector generally have been significant beneficiaries of lottery funding.  For example, over the period 1987 to 1996 over £240 million of lottery funds were spent in the health and welfare areas and the beneficiaries included a large number of charitable bodies.</P>
    <P>However, the promoters of charitable lotteries have consistently maintained that they have lost income to the national lottery and I am satisfied that a well targeted initiative aimed at assisting those charitable lotteries who are competing directly with the national lottery is justified.  A fund of £5 million has been established for this purpose in 1997.  It is intended to provide further allocations of £5 million in 1998 and 1999.  The operation of the scheme will be reviewed before the end of the third year.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that this is a very focused initiative which is intended to address the circumstances of those private lotteries which have products in the marketplace in direct competition with the national lottery.  It has never been intended that this fund would be a vehicle for supporting charitable fund-raising generally. This is not the intent of the scheme and such a measure would require funding very greatly in excess of what is being provided.</P>
    <P>The scheme was advertised in the newspapers on 8 October 1997.  Applications were invited from the promoters of private charitable lotteries conducted under the provisions of existing gaming and lotteries legislation which were in operation on 1 July 1997.  The closing date for receipt of applications is 31 October 1997.  The applications will be evaluated by an independent committee, which will advise as to whether they meet the eligibility criteria laid down for the scheme. Subject to the availability of funds and to the other conditions of the scheme being met, it is intended that eligible charitable lotteries will be assisted in proportion to the volume of their average annual turnover in the three most recent years of account as certified by the organisation's auditors.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to provide funding for private charitable lotteries established after 31 October 1997.  While the establishment of the fund does not arise specifically as a result of the Green Paper on Voluntary Activity, it is consistent with the aims and objectives for voluntary activity which are set out in that paper.

      <P>The grievance procedure for civil servants arises from an agreement between my Department and the <Col N="192" /> Civil Service panel of unions operating under the framework of the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service.  The procedure is promulgated by circular which is made pursuant to my powers under the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 and therefore applies cross the Civil Service including of course in my own Deparment and the Revenue Commissioners.  The procedure is designed to provide a facility whereby staff can pursue issues affecting their official position which are not appropriate for discussion under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  I believe that the inclusion of an independent mediation mechanism is an important feature of these arrangements.</P>
      <P>The grievance procedure provides for explanations of management decisions, and for an appeal to the personnel officer in cases where an employee is not satisfied with the manner in which the grievance is handled by local management. In addition certain grievance issues can be referred to a mediation officer appointed by me if they cannot be resolved at earlier stages of the procedure.  The procedure provides for certain types of grievance to be excluded from the mediation officer e.g., selection for promotion, for others to be referrable by the aggrieved officer as of right, i.e., where the action complained of has resulted in an immediate and direct loss of earnings and for all other types of grievance to be referrable with the agreement of the personnel officer in the Department or Office concerned.</P>
      <P>In my Department and the Revenue Commissioners there has been one request for access to mediation in a case involving non-payment of an increment.  The overall number of cases in Revenue which were permitted to mediation is four.  There have not been any requests for mediation of grievance disputes in my Department. The philosophy underlying the grievance procedure is that grievances should, to the greatest extent possible, be settled locally.  Consistent with that approach there is no role for either the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Finance in the processing of grievances which is conducted entirely at official level.  All aspects of the grievance procedure, including access to mediation, are currently being reviewed by my Department in consultation with the Civil Service unions.</P>

      <P>There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, I <Col N="193" /> would point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage.  The basis on which the married person's tax free allowance and double rate bands is given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v.</i> the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
      <P>While the social welfare treatment of married and cohabiting couples is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, I should explain that in the Hyland case in 1989 the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional for the relevant social welfare provisions to treat a married couple living together less favourably than an unmarried cohabiting couple.  This judgment has been given effect by treating cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples for social welfare purposes.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances. An interdepartmental working group has recently been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affiars to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and oneparent households under the tax and social welfare codes.  This group is due to report by March 1998.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available since prescriptions for methadone can be prescribed on the general medical services scheme or by private prescription and to ascertain this information would require an examination of the records of every pharmacy in Dublin and elsewhere.  Information is, however, available on pharmacies dispensing methadone in accordance with the protocol for prescribing methadone and the number involved is 58.</P>
      <P>I have approved of the recommendations of a review group on methadone treatment services. One of the key recommendations made by the group is that methadone should only be prescribed on a special prescription form.  This would allow for the monitoring of all prescriptions for methadone.  My Department is currently in the process of implementing the group's recommendations in consultation with the Eastern Health</P>
      <P>Board and the appropriate professional bodies. A pharmacist is required to dispense a legally completed prescription and the decision as to whether a patient should be required to have his or her methadone dispensed on a daily basis is a clinical decision by the patient's doctor and is not at the discretion of the pharmacist concerned.</P>
      <P>I note the Deputy's comments about alleged active trading in the vicinity of the premises in question and I am referring the matter to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, to consider whether the Garda might be asked to investigate.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act 1970 health boards are required to make available, without charge, a general practitioner medical and surgical service to persons with full eligibility, that is, medical card holders.  In accordance with the provisions of the Act, health boards enter into contracts with general practitioners for the provision of these services under the general medical services (GMS) scheme.</P>
      <P>The terms of the general practitioners' contract, which includes a fee schedule for the services provided, are the subject of negotiation and agreement between my Department, the health boards and the Irish Medical Organisation.  Fee payments to general practitioners under the GMS scheme comprehend the issuing of normal sickness certificates which are required by an adult or by an infant/child who is a dependent of the adult who is covered by the medical card scheme and those examinations carried out prior to the issue of the first and final social welfare certificates. The issue of other certificates by a general practitioner, for example, those related to driving licences, insurance and assurance policies, or free schemes operated by the Department of Social Welfare, is not comprehended under the GMS doctors' fee schedule.</P>
      <P>Neither I, nor the health boards, have any function in relation to charges by general practitioners for services not covered by the GMS scheme.

      <P>The health allocation of national lottery funds for 1997 is £23.355 million.  This includes £4 million which forms part of the funding for the capital programme.  The remaining £19.355 includes £13.064 million which funds on-going services administered by health boards or by bodies which have a close relationship with my Department.  A further £4.253 million is allocated to health agencies to fund the respite care grants scheme, the schemes of grants to voluntary organisations and the disadvantaged youth scheme.  The amount of discretionary funding available for 1997 from the proceeds of the national lottery is £2.038 million. Details of the grants allocated are set out in the following schedule.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the provision by local authorities, as part of their annual housing programmes, of houses in rural areas on sites provided by applicants on the housing list of the authority.  My Department's guidelines to housing authorities on the provision of local authority housing apply, as appropriate, to the provision of these houses and include specific requirements that the building of isolated houses in rural areas should be limited to those special categories whose needs can be met satisfactorily only by the provision of such houses e.g. farmers and small-holders etc.  who desire to live on their holdings and agricultural workers who must live near their place of employment and the housing authority should be satisfied that there will be a continuing need for the house during its useful life.</P>
      <P>Subject to the guidelines, the extent to which isolated rural houses are included in their annual housing programme is a matter for individual housing authorities having regard to the priority of those applicants whose needs are to be met by the provision of such houses.  Where the estimated all-in-cost of a house comes within a cost ceiling notified to each county council annually, the approval of the Department is not required to the seeking of tenders or to the acceptance of a tender where it is the lowest valid tender.  Funding is provided from the annual capital allocation made available to authorities each year by my Department for their local authority housing programme.</P>
      <P>Details of isolated rural houses provided in 1996 are set out in the following table.</P>

      <P>The only scheme involving tax incentives for development for which my Department has responsibility is the urban renewal scheme. The Government has approved a framework for a new, more planned and targeted scheme which will come into effect on 1 August 1998 when the qualified extension of the current scheme terminates. Cases for designation under the new scheme will be considered on the basis of integrated area plans prepared for priority areas selected by local authorities.</P>
      <P>Given that it is concerned with urban renewal, the scheme will be focusing on areas in cities and towns in greatest need of renewal.  The relevant legislation would not allow large scale areas, such as the Shannon basin, to be designated.  Of course, an individual town within the Shannon basin could be included under the new scheme should the relevant local authority consider, on the basis of criteria now being finalised, that the town, or part of the town, is an area for which an integrated area plan should be prepared.</P>

      <P>The planning and construction of projects affecting the national road network is a matter for the National Roads Authority, in co-operation with the road authority concerned.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no involvement in this process.</P>
      <P>I understand however that the proposed link between the improved national road network and Baldoyle Industrial Estate is intended as a non-national road and will comprise two sections.  One part has been built by a private developer and requires further work before it can be taken in charge by Dublin Corporation; the further work involved is currently the subject of negotiation between the corporation and the developer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part is the Grange Road project for which Dublin Corporation have been allocated grants of varying amounts since 1994.  Because of difficulties in land acquisition, progress so far has been limited.  I understand, however, that the corporation intend to advance the project in 1998 <Col N="210" /> and have recently applied to my Department for £1.5 million funding in 1998 under the EU cofinanced grants scheme.  This application is being considered and my Department will convey a decision to the corporation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Non-national road grants to the Dublin local auhtorities reflect needs of the kind referred to in the question.  Dublin Corporation and Fingal County Council were allocated grants of £3,912,000 and £2,422,000, respectively, in 1997.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is currently payable in respect of all children up to age 16 and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education or are physically or mentally challenged.  Child benefit is payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children are born together.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the significant additional costs involved for parents of twins, there is provision for the payment of a £500 grant at the birth of twins and for two further grants of £500 payable when the twins reach the ages of four and 12. Over 1,400 families have benefited from these grants at an annual cost of almost £700,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> In line with the recommendations contained in various reports, including the report of the expert working group on integrating tax and social welfare, the interim report of the commission on the family and the ESRI report on poverty in the 1990s, the improvements in child income support introduced this year are designed to benefit low income families and, in particular, larger families. This has been achieved by increasing the higher rate of child benefit, payable in respect of third and subsequent children, by £5 and by increasing the lower rate of child benefit, payable in respect of the first and second child, by £1.</P>
    <P>There are an estimated 12,500 sets of twins for whom child benefit is payable at the normal monthly rate.  The estimated annual extra cost of paying a supplement at half the normal monthly rate is £4.8 million.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to protecting and enhancing the role of the family in Irish society.  In that context, one of my priorities is the continued development of child benefit as a key support for every child in the state.  The question of introducing specific measures in respect of twins will be examined in the light of overall budgetary priorities.</P>

      <P>Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years, or over, and also to certain disabled people under the age of 66.  The other free schemes are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition, widows and widowers between the age of 60 and 65 whose late spouses had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>

      <Quest>the specific administrative criteria laid down for applications for naturalisation based on Irish association or investment during the period from December 1988 until the introduction of the terms of reference of the advisory group established in October 1994.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a Dáil Question from the Deputy last week I stated:</P>
      <P>In December 1988, the Government decided that, in cases where substantial investment in the manufacturing or sevices sectors of the economy had been made by overseas investors, the Minister for Justice should interpret such investment as falling within the interpretation of Irish associations set out in section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, and that if the person had purchased a substantial residence, and had resided in Ireland for a period of 60 days in the preceding two years, naturalisation could be granted.</P>
      <P>I went on to explain that, over time, these conditions began to loosen and that, for example, &ldquo;some property and forestry developments were taken as qualifying and the 60 day residence requirement was not applied in all cases&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As records are maintained on an individual basis and, as I said in my reply of last week, those individual records have only recently been comprehensively identified as part of the review I am conducting, it is not possible, without detailed examination of each case, to say precisely what specific criteria were followed in each individual case.</P>
      <P>In my reply of last week I indicated that I had asked my officials to examine each case and, as part of this exercise, the precise history in relation to the administrative practice and criteria followed will be charted.  I will then be in a better position to respond more fully to the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>A document containing guidelines headed &ldquo;Statement of Intent&rdquo; was drawn up, early on in the life of the scheme but I cannot say whether the guidelines it contains were applied in particular cases pending the outcome of the review to which I have referred.  Versions of that document were certainly in existence as early as 1988.  Following is a copy of the document in use in April 1989 though I stress that the detailed examination now under way may show there were earlier or indeed later versions of the document or indeed that other material will emerge which would be relevant in terms of comprehensively replying to the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>Statement of Intent (in relation to the exercise by the Minister for Justice of his discretion under section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, to waive the provisions of section 15 (c) of the Act in the case of persons establishing certain businesses in the State).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> The Minister will accept as fulfilling the requirements of &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; in section 16(a) the guidelines set out in (a), (b) and (c) hereunder so as to grant an application which does not comply with the condition at 15(c) of the Act, but only that condition.</P>
    <P>(a) The applicant will have acquired a residence in the State, will have been resident in the State for two years and will have spent a reasonable amount of time here over the two years.</P>
    <P>(b) The Minister will be satisfied, on the advice of a Minister of the Government, that the applicant has established a manufacturing or international services or other acceptable wealth and job creating project here that is viable and involves a substantial investment by the applicant.</P>
    <P>(c) All other requirements of the Act have been complied with.  (Copies of sections 15 and 16 of the Act are attached).</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notes:</i>
    </P>
    <P>(1) &ldquo;Residence&rdquo; for the purpose of paragraph (a) involves the establishment here of a residence consistent with the circumstances of the applicant and any of his family allowed to reside here by law and in which he (they) have their home.  The question as to whether any accommodation is or is not a &ldquo;residence&rdquo; will be decided on the criteria applicable to the grant of naturalisation generally and the decision of the Minister thereon shall be final.</P>
    <P>(2) For the purposes of &ldquo;a reasonable amount of time here over the two years&rdquo; in (a) the minimum number of days acceptable would be 60.</P>
    <P>(3) The &ldquo;project&rdquo; referred to at (b) will be one resulting from the applicant's investment and which would not otherwise have occurred.</P>
    <P>(4) The application may include a spouse and children under 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986</P>
    <P>Conditions for issue of certificate</P>
    <P>4.&mdash;The following section is hereby substituted for section 15 of the Act of 1956:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;15.&mdash;(1) Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of naturalisation, the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant the application, if satisfied that the applicant&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) is of full age;</P>
    <P>(b) is of good character;</P>
    <P>(c) has had a period of one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and, <Col N="215" /> during the eight years immediately preceding that period has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years;</P>
    <P>(d) intends in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and</P>
    <P>(e) has made, either before a Justice of the District Court in open court or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
    <P>(2) The conditions specified in paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection (1) are referred to in this Act as conditions for naturalisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Power to dispense with conditions of naturalisation in certain cases</P>
    <P>5.&mdash;The following section is hereby substituted for section 16 of the Act of 1956:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;The Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation in the following cases, although the conditions for naturalisation (or any of them) are not complied with:</P>
    <P>(a) where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations;</P>
    <P>(b) where the applicant is a parent or guardian acting on behalf of a minor of Irish descent or Irish associations;</P>
    <P>(c) where the applicant is a naturalised Irish citizen acting on behalf of a minor child of the applicant;</P>
    <P>(d) where the applicant is married to a naturalised Irish citizen;</P>
    <P>(e) where the applicant is married to a person who is an Irish citizen (otherwise than by naturalisation);</P>
    <P>(f) where the applicant is or has been resident abroad in the public service;</P>
    <P>(g) where the applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of the 28th day of July, 1951 and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees of the 31st day of January, 1967, or is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons of the 28th day of September, 1954.&rdquo;</P>

However, local Garda management are satisfied that, although this may be the case, the policing service is still maintained in the Donaghmede area by regular patrols provided by both uniform and plain clothes personnel.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities wish to point out that the number of callers to the Garda clinic during opening times is quite small.  They have informed me that the local district officer held a meeting recently with the Donaghmede residents association during which satisfaction with the Garda service provided in the area was expressed.

      <P>The current quota of 35 for admissions to physical education teacher training was set by my Department in consultation with the Higher Education Authority and the University of Limerick. As part of its statutory functions the Higher Education Authority advises me on the demand and the need for courses in the university sector. In this regard, the Higher Education Authority has not received any proposals to increase the current intake of students to physical education teacher training.  However, I would mention that a working group, under the aegis of the HEA, is undertaking an in-depth review of future needs for second level teachers.  This review is focusing both on total needs and on needs by subject group, where feasible.  In the course of its work, the working group will consider the need for physical education teachers.</P>
      <P>In relation to the points level required for admission, the Deputy will be aware, that the commission on the points system which I established to review the present system of entry to third level institutions, has recently commenced its work.</P>

      <Quest>when the concept of adjacent rate was first introduced; the circumstances in which it was introduced; the way in which 15 miles as distinct from 14 or 16 was chosen as the differential point between the two levels of grant aid in relation to full rate and adjacent rate payments of higher education grants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the higher education grants scheme was originally introduced in 1968, provision was made for the payment of maintenance grants at the adjacent and non-adjacent rates.  The adjacent rate of maintenance was paid to a candidate whose normal family residence was adjacent to the college being attended.  In all other cases the non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant was payable.  No specific mileage criterion was applied and the decision on whether grants would be paid at the adjacent or non-adjacent rate was a matter solely for decision by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>In 1978, a new provision was introduced which required a local authority to decide (i) whether a candidate's normal family residence was in or adjacent to a university town, or (ii) whether the candidate's course was provided in an educational institution adjacent to his or her normal family residence, in the light of the distance and the local public transport services.  The adjacent rate of grant was applied in the case of every candidate who could reasonably be expected to travel daily between his or her home and college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 15 mile criterion for determining which rate of grant was payable was introduced in 1979, to standardise the approach taken by local authorities. This followed an examination by the Public Accounts Committee of the way in which some local authorities were administering the adjacency provision.  In addition to the 15 mile criterion, the local authority also had regard as to whether the candidate could reasonably be expected to travel on a daily basis to college where the candidate's family residence was more <Col N="222" /> than 15 miles from the college.  If the local authority determined that the candidate could so reasonably travel, the adjacent rate of grant only was payable.  This provision was omitted with effect from 1995 as differences in interpretation had led to difficulties.</P>

      <P>Since 1987 £10.5 million approximately has been expended on capital developments, including the provision of furniture and equipment, at Waterford Institute of Technology.  In addition a total of £4 million remains available for phase I of a new library/information technology project.</P>
      <P>An application was made by the college authorities in 1993 seeking approval under the 1994-99 European Regional Development Fund Programme for a broad range of projects estimated to cost some £93 million.  It included proposals relating to projects such as building extensions, information technology building, science and technology buildings, student accommodation, refurbishment of main building and east wing, music technology building, industry innovation centre, sports/examination hall, art and design technology building, student centre and restaurant, architectural design building, CERT restaurant and the research and development building.</P>
      <P>While the Department of Education at that time considered the overall proposal to be excessive it is continuing, in consultation with the college authorities, to approve the implementation of a substantive rolling capital programme within the framework of available resources.</P>
      <P>A number of projects have been approved for the college since 1987 and a list of the projects which have been completed, with the estimated cost, follows.  As the Deputy is aware, however, payments in respect of each project are made on a rolling basis on foot of architects' certificates furnished by the institute, as the project progresses. The detailed list of payments for the past ten years is not readily available.</P>
      <P>The planning of the new library information technology building is now at an advanced stage and building works for phase I will be commenced as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>My Department has more recently received a programme from the institute which sets out proposals for future developments.  The proposals indicate that £23.2 million is required immediately for capital investment with an additional £16.3 million required in the medium to long-term. The proposed programme, in so far as capital investment is concerned, will be considered in the context of future available funding and the number of students to be catered for in the institute.</P>

      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year and included the allocation of 51 remedial posts to primary schools with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for remedial tuition.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am not in a position at present <Col N="228" /> to allocate additional remedial teacher posts to primary schools.</P>
    <P>I am at present reviewing provision across the special needs area, including current responses to remedial needs, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools to which he refers will be fully considered in the context of any additional allocation of special supports which may be undertaken.</P>
