      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of related notices of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Owen, Sargent and Ferris.  I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  I now call on Deputy Owen to state the matter of which she has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 31 I wish to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss a matter of grave importance, the announcement of the imminent closure of the Seagate company in Clonmel, County Tipperary, with the loss of 1,400 jobs without any warning, the implications of this closure for the proposed Seagate facility in Cork; what plan do the Government and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have to replace these jobs and why was the Minister not forewarned of this closure given the Government promised an early warning system to identify emerging industrial difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 31, I wish to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to inquire into the closure of the Seagate company in Clonmel, County Tipperary, with the loss of more than 1,400 jobs, the role of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the fiasco and to allow the House to set out an economic strategy which will provide a safety net and placement of jobs for communities where trans-national companies renege on their commitments to Ireland.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. 13 &mdash; Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance (<i>resumed</i>).  Statements on the closure of Seagate Technology Plant shall be taken today, following the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the statements: (1) that the statements of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party and of each other Member to be called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case.  Members may share time and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment shall be called upon not later than 4.40 p.m. to make a statement in reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem that led to the unfortunate suspension of Deputy Ferris from the House is related to the timing of this debate. Given the urgency of this and its enormous impact in Clonmel, which depends on this one plant for a large proportion of its employment, the feeling on this side of the House, as expressed strongly by Deputy Ferris, is that this debate should take place this morning.  I appreciate that the Tánaiste would wish to participate in the debate and that she is currently in Clonmel. Obviously we would want her to take part in the debate.  Would it be possible bring this debate forward with a view to ensuring that the House expresses its views on this issue at the earliest possible moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Bruton. However, irrespective of the timing, the format here is inadequate to ventilate a crisis of this scale.  The usual procedure whereby the Minister responsible submits to questioning in the House is necessary.  We need, therefore, to extend the time and to provide for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to take questions at the end of the formal contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express the strongest sentiments of the Labour Party in relation to this matter, for two reasons.  First and foremost, the Order of Business as proposed until 10 o'clock this morning was for the continuation of a rambling debate on a budget that is deemed by a majority of people to be a budget in favour of the rich.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the opinion poll.  Deputies on all sides of the House know what the mood on a Thursday is.  To suggest that we would have this order at this time in face of a crisis of such an <Col N="6" /> urgent nature is an insult to all involved.  There is no reason we cannot have this debate as the first item of business.  I accept that the Tánaiste is somewhere else.  She is in Clonmel telling lies about my colleague.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <P>I withdraw the statement that Deputy Harney is telling lies.  In her panic she accused Deputy Ferris, on the record in front of workers, including the sister of Deputy Ferris's daughter-in-law, of being responsible for releasing this news.  The Tánaiste knew three months ago that there was a problem in this factory but did nothing about it.  What we are looking for is a debate now with questions and answers from a member of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of what has been said before, I ask the Taoiseach to give the Seagate matter priority over the budget debate.  It is worthy of a much fuller statement than can be made in the time allocated, and it needs to be made because it goes to the heart of a policy on which we have depended, namely, the good will of transnational corporations which is not guaranteed. We have to recognise that and make provision for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the will on this side of the House is that there should be a more adequate debate, that there should be greater time allowed and provision for questions and answers.  I propose either that the Taoiseach extend the debate to 6 p.m. this evening or bring it forward to 12 noon.  There is no good reason, as has already been said, we should continue with a budget debate when there is a crisis in Tipperary. It is essential that, in any change to the <Col N="7" /> order, we provide for questions and answers by the Ministers concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>She made arrangements today to meet staff and management of Seagate and leaders of the local community in Clonmel.  Naturally she wants to be here for the debate.  Unfortunately, nothing will change in the course of this day that will make any difference.  The Tánaiste has been involved in this and, on three occasions in recent months, has spoken to the company, in contrast to what happened in previous crises of this nature over the years, and she would like to be able to inform the House of those meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to the Whips discussing the extension and format of the debate.  I just would not like to agree to it without talking to the Tánaiste.  It is important, before the Dáil rises today that we have as full a debate as possible. It was mainly the workers who have tried so hard to make this plant a success, notwithstanding horrendous losses of $27 million last year and rising losses this year to the extent of $60 million.  I reiterate what the Tánaiste and I said last night, that not only should we have a debate, we must, with community and business leaders take constructive action to assist the workers by setting up the task force and getting a new operator into the plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach realise that speculation and rumour are rife and that the people who will lose their jobs want to know the precise position?  The sooner statements are made in the House the sooner the full facts will be known about the closure and the Tánaiste's plans to replace these jobs.  I urge the Taoiseach not to delay the statements.  The Tánaiste is talking to the workers as we speak but if she uses a helicopter she can be present in the House at 12 o'clock or 12.30 p.m. I stress the necessity of having an open debate and giving Members an opportunity to question the Tánaiste following statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that the Tánaiste misled the House of 6 November.  It is clear she knew about <Col N="8" /> the problems at this plant three months ago, yet on 6 November she told the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <P>You, Sir, are in charge of the House.  On 6 November the Tánaiste told us that the Cork project was very much part of the company's plans for the future.  If she knew then that the Clonmel plant was in trouble she must also have known that the Cork plant was in trouble.</P>

Will the Taoiseach ensure it is introduced quickly because, in the light of the Seagate closure, we must examine the effect on employment here of the fall in currency values in East Asia?  We must ensure the euro is managed in such a way that such a sudden impact on jobs does not recur.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise the matter with the Minister for Finance.  What the Deputy has said is obviously a factor in what happened.  Overnight I read the memorandums, which I am not saying were meticulously prepared in the past six months, on the assessment of the matter to which the Deputy referred.  People thought there was an under supply in the market and that it would be difficult to meet demand, but that was turned on its head in a matter of six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A budget debate consisting of a sequence of statements which do not relate to each other is hardly the type of dialogue the House needs to deal with this matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I am simply saying it is not sufficient for the Taoiseach to say <Col N="15" /> the matter can be dealt with in the context of an ongoing debate on the budget.  Will he review the commitment to the budget debate and substitute a debate on this issue, which would include an exchange of views, including questions, before the House rises for the Christmas recess?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all very well, but the House has voted on the matter and has a right to be involved in it.</P>
      <P>Will the offer he made regarding statements today include provision for questions to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or will it be confined to statements from Members consisting of no more than ten minutes each?  When Deputy Rabbitte was in Government he took questions for an hour on the problems associated with Packard and the charge was led by the current Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>I tried to avoid a vote on the issue.  When I was asked by Deputies Rabbitte, De Rossa and Owen to extend the time, I said I would discuss the matter with the Tánaiste, but the House has divided on the matter.  However, I will convey the views of the House to the Tánaiste.</P>

      <P>I want to raise two matters, one of which relates to a point of order and the other to legislation.  I want your guidance, Sir, on this matter.  A number of questions were raised under Standing Order 31 this morning and refused on the basis that there would be a debate on the Seagate closure in the House today.  It is clear that such a Standing Order would apply to that issue which arose suddenly.  It is a matter of national interest which cannot be dealt with in any other way in the House.  A full debate on this issue has been denied on the basis that the Government would bring forward a motion to be debated in the House.  A proposal has been carried which restricts the rights of Members of this House to debate this issue and which sets aside Standing Orders which give every Deputy the right to comment by way of statements on this issue.  The Ceann Comhairle should look seriously at the actions he has taken today which have denied the Members of the House an opportunity to participate fully in a debate on this serious national issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point concerns abortion legislation. Today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> has published an opinion poll which shows that 75 per cent of the people believe that abortion should be legislated for in this State in certain circumstances.  In view of that, and of the appalling circumstances in <Col N="16" /> which a 13 year old girl found herself in recent months, will the Taoiseach agree to bring forward urgently legislation which would implement the effects of the Supreme Court decision in the X case?  It is clear there is a public demand for such legislation and this House would be failing in its duty if it did not bring forward such legislation as a matter of urgency.  Democratic Left will support the Taoiseach and the Progressive Democrats in bringing forward such legislation.  The Taoiseach will not have to depend on the vicarious vote of the three Independent Deputies who are currently keeping the Government in power and who are opposed to such a move.</P>

      <P>I concur with what you have stated, a Cheann Comhairle.  In my recollection, Standing Order 30 has been used regularly in this House over the years as a mechanism for raising issues, but it has never been conceded.  Deputy De Rossa will remember that the last time this happened in February 1995, when he was a Minister, he followed exactly this procedure.  Since he obviously does not remember, I will remind him that on that day, when it was also a matter of a serious national issue, the time he picked for the debate was exactly the same as the time chosen today.  The reason today was that the Tánaiste would not be back in the House, although that was not the reason on the last occasion.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second issue, the Minister for Health and Children recently set out in the House how the Government hopes to proceed with the issue of abortion.  We propose to work immediately on a Green Paper, after which there will be consultation with the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  If legislation is then required I hope the Deputy will keep his promise to support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the budget debate which has such important ramifications for the economy, including those sectors for which I have ministerial responsibility at the Department of Public Enterprise.  The budget contains initiatives of relevance to those sectors. I welcome the fact it successfully delivers on the commitments made in An Action Programme for the Millennium to exercise careful control over Government spending and borrowing to protect and develop Ireland's burgeoning economy over the longer term taking account of developments internationally, including the challenge of EMU participation and the status of EU Structural Funds after 1999.</P>
      <P>The economy is experiencing a period of sustained economic growth on an unprecedented scale which, with continued prudent management by Government, will provide a prosperous future for people well into the new millennium.  The Government is committed to supplying the necessary stability throughout its time in office and this budget is evidence of that commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> The live register is probably the single most important barometer of economic performance for most people.  However, while the ever shrinking dole queues are to be whole-heartedly welcomed, we must not forget that dole queues in many areas are still long and will only be further reduced through a continuation of the tight management of the economy and finances to which the Government is committed.  Above all we must guard against any sense of complacency which the prevailing economic climate might otherwise encourage.</P>
    <P>I have a special interest in how the budget impacts on my responsibilities and it is this aspect to which I turn.  My ministerial responsibilities extend across a diverse range of areas in the transport and energy sectors, including road freight haulage, travel trade bonding and licensing, nuclear safety issues as well as the gas and renewable energy markets and energy conservation. In addition I have responsibility for Met Éireann, the Irish Aviation Authority and Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>
    <P>The road haulage industry will be satisfied with the decision of the Minister for Finance not to raise the level of excise duty on diesel which comprises a significant element of road freight costs. This decision will maintain competitiveness in an important industry which plays a key role in the movement of goods nationally and internationally. Unfortunately, as recent events on the other side of the Irish Sea have again underlined, this industry and Ireland's import and export trade are subject to unauthorised obstruction and disruption on an increasingly frequent basis.  It is a most unsatisfactory and unacceptable situation.</P>
    <P>Once more an internal dispute in another country has concentrated on road freight transport to highlight the grievances of those concerned. Deputies will not need long memories to recall a significant number of such disruptions in the very recent past.  I refer to some of them &mdash; French farmers destroyed perishable cargoes bound for Paris markets on a number of occasions during 1993, 1994 and 1995; French fishermen blockaded ferry ports in the north of France during 1996; the French lorry drivers' strike in November 1996; Danish lorry drivers blocked roads on the German border in support of claims in 1996; Greek farmers blocked roads seeking higher prices for their produce in December 1996; the French drivers' strike last month and the current situation at Holyhead and other ferry ports serving the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely disturbing trend, particularly for Ireland.  In a country so dependent on trade for its economic lifeblood, the ability to move exports to our main markets is of paramount concern and imports of raw materials are also vital.  As a small island nation, we are very reliant on road freight transport to enable us to trade successfully.  The recent trend towards disrupting transport links is very serious as road transport is seen as an easy target in all manner of disputes and it is becoming increasingly difficult <Col N="21" /> for Ireland to benefit from the internal market. The combination of driving bans throughout Europe and third party internal disputes is making it more difficult to move freight by road freely.</P>
    <P>The frequency of these disputes in recent times constitutes a crisis for the internal market.  If the Single Market is to mean anything, a way of ensuring free movement of goods must be found. We cannot continue to allow a central principle of the EU to be violated in this way.  The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and I have made this point very forcefully to Commissioner Kinnock on a number of occasions during the French lorry drivers' strike and the current situation in the UK.  The Minister will use today's Transport Council in Brussels to express our serious concerns to the Commissioner and other transport Ministers.</P>
    <P>Apart from the contacts the Minister and I made on the current dispute, the Government is making every effort to impress on the UK Government the need for a speedy resolution. The Taoiseach raised the matter with Prime Minister Blair and the Minister for Agriculture and Food went to London to speak to Mr. Jack Cunningham, Minister for Agriculture in the UK.  I am pleased that there are some indications that the Government's efforts are beginning to meet with success and that Irish beef exports are getting through UK ferry ports.  It is gratifying that goods moved freely during the past two nights and the British police appear to be doing their job.</P>
    <P>There has been one other development of relevance to this situation.  The European Court of Justice, in a recent judgment, confirmed that member states must adopt all necessary and proportionate measures to ensure the free movement of goods.  I hope other member states have noted the judgment and will meet their obligations in this regard.</P>
    <P>I refer to energy issues.  Few people can have failed to notice the media coverage of the climate change conference in Kyoto over the past two or three weeks.  It will have affected us at many different levels.  For some it simply holds a passing interest but, for others, its outcome is key to the global environment to be bequeathed to the next generation.  I have specific responsibility for the development of Ireland's renewable energy resources and for our energy efficiency programme and, therefore, I have maintained a close watching brief on developments at Kyoto.</P>
    <P>Sustainability is a byword which encapsulates what Kyoto is trying to achieve.  Sustainable development is not a &ldquo;no growth&rdquo; policy, but one which seeks alternative ways to grow.  The goal of sustainable development cannot be realised without some changes in the world's energy system. Sustainable energy development cannot be achieved without new thinking, policies and programmes to increase the contribution of environmentally benign, cost effective energy systems, <Col N="22" /> especially renewable ones or without Governments taking the right policy decisions.</P>
    <P>The generation of electricity from fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas, produces a range of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases which can cause environmental damage.  The most significant of these pollutants is carbon dioxide.  Approximately 1 kilogram of it is produced when 1 kilowatt hour of electricity is generated from fossil fuels.  The generation of electricity from renewable energy sources produces no harmful emissions.  A considerable proportion of existing electricity supply from fossil fuel electricity stations could be replaced with renewable energy with an associated decrease in carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
    <P>In the context of the ongoing Kyoto discussions, the EU set a 15 per cent carbon dioxide emissions reduction objective as a negotiating position.  Recently the European Commission published a White Paper on renewable energy.  It is an ambitious strategy to double the amount of renewable energy in the EU by 2010 considering that at present the contribution of renewable energy is 6 per cent.  The White Paper also contains estimates of the carbon dioxide emissions reductions resulting from targeted renewable energy development.  The estimated figure of 402 million tonnes per year represents almost 50 per cent of the reduction in emissions required to achieve the 15 per cent reduction target.  The White Paper also quantifies job creation in the renewable energy sector of 910,000 new jobs and annual savings of 3 billion ecu in imported fuels are also quantified.</P>
    <P>The target of 12 per cent is eminently realisable in Ireland which has significant renewable energy resources but the sector needs to be stimulated into action.  There is considerable inertia resulting from a number of factors which have been identified by various EU funded studies and by the renewable energy information office.  One of the most important barriers is the attitude of financial investors to the sector.  Renewable energy is a relatively new business area in Ireland and a certain aversion to risk is understandable.  The initiative announced in the budget will address the financiability of frontier energy technology and will assist Ireland to contribute towards achieving that European wide goal of harnessing renewable energy sources and carbon dioxide reduction.  It will also help to strategically position Ireland to get its share of the employment potential of renewables.  The budget provides that tax relief will be introduced in the Finance Bill for corporate equity investment in wind energy and biomass projects which are approved by the Minister for Public Enterprise.  Under this scheme of tax relief, up to 50 per cent of the total cost of a project may be financed under the scheme.  This is subject to an overall cap of £7.5 million for the project and a limit of £10 million per annum will apply to the amount which any one company, or group of companies, can invest in all qualifying projects in a year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> Energy use is without doubt a significant contributor to global warming and climate change. Renewable energy is one of the few forms of energy whose continuous use is sustainable. Ireland has a large reservoir of renewable energy, such as wind energy.  This scheme is timely in a week when the attention of the world is rightly focused on the Kyoto Conference.  This initiative is a loud and clear statement of Ireland's intention to play its role in addressing the global problem of climate change, probably the single biggest environmental challenge facing the world.</P>
    <P>In view of the four alternative energy requirement competitions already in place, there can be no doubt about the Government's commitment to sustainable energy development.  The £5 million which it is estimated this initiative will cost in 1998 is, in every sense, an ethical investment in the energy future of the next generation.</P>
    <P>While we continue to strive to develop alternative energy sources we are highly dependent on fossil fuels to meet our energy requirements.  One of the most important indigenous fossil fuels is natural gas which accounts for 20 per cent of our total primary energy requirements.  The Irish natural gas industry is a dynamic one.  A total of 285,000 customers are served with natural gas, including 10,000 customers in the commercial and industrial sectors.  Gas demand grew by 5 per cent in 1997 and next year a growth of 4.5 per cent is projected.</P>
    <P>Because of the growth in gas demand, I have initiated a study into future gas needs up to the year 2025 to ensure that any necessary infrastructural development is identified and put in place in good time.  The study is a joint project between my Department and Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>
    <P>This study is timely because our only indigenous gas reserves at the Kinsale Head-Ballycotton field are expected to expire in five or six years' time.  In the absence of further indigenous gas finds, Ireland would then be totally dependent on imported gas from a single supply source &mdash; the undersea interconnector from Scotland.  Imported gas through the interconnector accounts for some 30 per cent of our total gas consumption.  This percentage will increase as the depletion date of the Kinsale Head-Ballycotton field approaches.</P>
    <P>A joint North-South study of the feasibility of providing a natural gas interconnector between Dublin and Belfast was completed a few months ago.  The report concluded that such an interconnector is technically possible and represents the most cost-effective solution in relation to gas supply issues for both sides of the Border.  The report is a valuable contribution towards policy making in relation to gas infrastructure requirements.  It represents an excellent example of cross-Border co-operation in the energy sector involving officials from my Department, the Northern Ireland Department of Economic Development, Bord Gáis Éireann and Phoenix Natural Gas Limited.  Its findings are being studied by all parties concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> One of the key priorities for the energy sector in the Government programme is to extend natural gas as far as practicable to major towns and cities.  I am happy that the following towns which do not have a natural gas service are included in Bord Gáis Éireann's study for the extension of supply; Kinsale, Bandon, Fermoy, Carrick-onShannon, Navan, Portlaoise, Athy, BallinaKillaloe and in north County Wicklow, Kilcoole-Newtownmountkennedy.</P>
    <P>Surveys of the load potential for the residential and commercial markets in these towns are ongoing and should sufficient loads be identified for each extension to be economically viable, the project will be included in the Bord Gáis programme. Some other towns may be included in the programme should the extensions to them be identified as economically viable.  Bord Gáis is arranging also gas supplies to the towns of Mitchelstown, Mallow, Cobh, Annacotty, Ashbourne, Bettystown, Clane, Kildare, Dunshaughlin and Ratoath.</P>
    <P>A proposal for a major extension of the gas network to the midlands and the west to provide gas to Trim, Mullingar, Athlone, Ballinasloe, Galway, Ennis and Shannon, with the support of Exchequer funding, is under consideration.  The necessary notification to the EU's Commission's Competition Directorate in relation to the State aids aspect is still being examined in Brussels and my Department is in contact with the EU Commission in that regard.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week I participated in a meeting of the EU Council of Energy Ministers at which the principal item under consideration was the establishment of common rules for the internal market in natural gas.  Agreement was reached on the terms of a directive which introduces competition into the natural gas industry in the form of third party access to gas networks throughout the European Union.  As a result consumers of large volumes of gas will, in future, have the choice of buying their gas supplies direct from gas undertakings as at present or in buying their gas from other suppliers and having it transmitted through the network for a fee.  Ireland has already provided for this form of competition and the necessary detailed operating and pricing rules are being developed.  The EU Directive is broadly in line with Ireland's domestic legislation.</P>
    <P>The directive also provides a mechanism to encourage investment in the development and extension of the gas network to new areas. Ireland had insisted on this provision from the outset.  The provision will be of relevance to areas such as the midlands and the west, which have as yet no natural gas service.</P>
    <P>The environmental and public safety implications of the UK's nuclear industry, and British Nuclear Fuels operations at Sellafield in particular, have been a cause of serious concern to successive Governments as well as this House. Recently I met my UK counterpart, Mr. Michael Meacher, MP, Minister for the Environment, for an exchange of views of Sellafield and related <Col N="25" /> matters.  Mr. Meacher acknowledged the longstanding concerns about nuclear matters and stated that the UK Government shared many of these concerns.  I look forward to further contacts with him and I will watch with interest the evolution of the new UK Government's thinking on the nuclear industry and radiological protection.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the wideranging operations carried out at the Sellafield plant. These include reprocessing, high level waste storage and fuel fabrication activities.  This number of activities on a single site increases the possibility of an accident occurring and, due to its proximity to Ireland, represents an unnecessary risk to the health and safety of the Irish population.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor nuclear proposals and developments in the UK. Some immediate issues of concern are BNFL's application for a variation to Sellafield's discharge authorisations; recent reports of steep increases in the levels of radionuclide technetium-99 in lobsters and other shellfish in areas of the Irish Sea close to Sellafield; BNFL's proposals to commission its mixed oxide fuel fabrication plant at Sellafield; the four ageing magnox reactors at the Calder Hall plants and the storage of highly radioactive liquid waste in tanks at Sellafield.  I will continue to use every opportunity to articulate to the UK authorities, Ireland's views on these specific issues of concern.</P>
    <P>I congratulate my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, for a measured and equitable budget.  The 1998 budget provides a solid foundation on which the economy can successfully build in the year ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The closure of the Seagate operation and the loss of 1,400 jobs in Clonmel comes as a great shock to us all.  My sympathies go out to all who have entered into a period of painful uncertainty about their future because of this tragic and sudden decision.  I join the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in assuring all concerned that the Government will do everything possible to put in place new opportunities for employment and bring back confidence in the future for all those who are facing the trauma of sudden unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suddenness of the decision to close is a shock to us all.  It will inevitably create unease among employees across the country that they might be exposed to similarly sudden closures with decisions being made elsewhere and having regard to global factors beyond our control. While these fears are essentially unfounded, the closure reinforces the view that we must strive to balance the necessary reliance on big inward investment projects with greater efforts to create well anchored employment through developing indigenous resources whenever and wherever we can identify the opportunities.  There are opportunities in abundance.  The marine and natural resources sector alone employs almost 70,000 people in relatively stable and well grounded <Col N="26" /> jobs.  There is potential for much more.  Bringing these jobs into being is painstaking and difficult but once in place they are often grounded in a highly marketable resource and strongly committed people.  I intend to address during the next six months or so how we, as owners of valuable and largely untapped marine, coastal and other natural resources, can create jobs anchored and embedded in vibrant communities and individuals.</P>
    <P>There are major developments in the forestry sector which will create 11,000 jobs.  These are outlined in the Government's programme for the development of the sector.  The issues and challenges in carrying through these developments will be dealt with by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne.</P>
    <P>The budget has three basic themes.  All three represent objectives outlined to the electorate in the election last June as priorities.  They are control of public spending, reducing the tax burden and acknowledging the contribution of older people to society.  The budget is a significant contributor to these aims.  Taken with Partnership 2000 and the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, we are positioning ourselves for prosperity into the 21st century.  The budget is the first step in a five year strategy to deliver on our key economic priorities. Next year will see further progress on the Government's action programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction of 2 per cent in the standard and higher rates of taxation to 24 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively.  Gone are the days of the 35 per cent and 58 per cent income tax rates.  We will reduce them further.  These reductions, with other measures relating to exemptions, allowances and PRSI, underline the Government's determination to reach a ceiling of no more than 50 per cent for all deductions.  The budget has made significant progress in meeting the personal tax reduction commitments in Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The budget gives long overdue recognition to the contribution older people have made to the economic success we are experiencing.  The £5 increase in pensions, as well as substantial increases in tax exemption thresholds, will help to ensure older people enjoy their retirement with fewer financial worries.  A free travel pass will be provided to all recipients of carer's allowance and eligibility for the companion travel pass has been extended to people over 75 years who are unable to travel alone.</P>
    <P>No Government can ignore the fact that, despite our buoyant economy, there are people in society who are not reaping the rewards of our economic success.  The significant social inclusion measures announced by the Minister for Finance, with ongoing initiatives across a range of Departments, are evidence of the Government's determination to combat disadvantage and build strong, confident local communities.</P>
    <P>From 6 April there will be a new tax relief on personal and corporate donations to disadvantaged <Col N="27" /> schools.  There are other improvements in the area of sports and recreational facilities to combat disadvantage.  An increase of £7 in the family income thresholds from June and the removal of income tax from the basis of assessment with effect from October are major improvements which further strengthen income support for families in low paid work.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that from September child benefit for twins will be paid at 150 per cent of the usual rate.  I argued strongly for this in Opposition and am glad to see that commitment being met early in the Government's term of office.  It will deliver on its promises in future budgets.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to set out, in the context of the budget, the action I am taking and the investment support strategies under way to deliver on the Government's commitments to the fishing industry.  The thrust of policy is to secure and enhance the livelihoods of coastal communities which depend on the sea for their future.  In line with the Government's commitments, my key priorities include maximising quota and non-quota fishing opportunities for the fleet, protecting fish stocks, modernising the whitefish fleet, attracting investment in the whitefish fleet, expanding the fish processing sector and ensuring the necessary investment in fishery harbour infrastructure.  My overall policy objective is to strengthen the contribution of the fish and fish processing sectors to the economy and their contribution to job creation and growth in coastal communities.</P>
    <P>Since taking office I have been working to deliver on the Government's commitment to modernise the fishing fleet.  I recently announced a new round of Exchequer and EU supported investment of £11 million in modernisation of the fleet.  This investment is aimed primarily at the whitefish fleet to enhance safety as well as quality and competitiveness.  I am finalising a new capital grant aid scheme to support investment in a number of new whitefish boats.  The available funding under the fisheries operational programme up to 1999 will be utilised to maximum effect.</P>
    <P>I am pursuing other measures to facilitate investment in the fleet in line with the Government's specific commitment to make the industry attractive to providers of capital by examining the provision of tax based incentives.  I am working with the Minister for Finance, in the context of the Finance Bill, on proposals to deliver feasible measures which will provide the much needed incentives for investment in the fishing fleet with particular emphasis on the investment needs of the white fish fleet.</P>
    <P>In line with the Government's commitments to the fishing industry and rural development, I am reviewing urgently the funding requirements for capital investment in key fishery harbours.  I will bring detailed proposals to Government shortly. I will shortly announce a new round of grant aid for fish processing development projects.  The <Col N="28" /> remaining funds for fish processing under the fisheries operational programme will not be sufficient to fund all projects in the pipeline.  I will pursue the scope for additional funding to support capacity expansion in the processing sector which will deliver tangible jobs, value added, exports and revenue.</P>
    <P>Within the sea fisheries sector aquaculture is a key component of growing importance.  It is a growing industry and accounts for almost 30 per cent of the total value of fish production.  Its contribution to the economy continues to grow.  The total value of output increased from £49 million in 1995 to £55 million in 1996, an increase of 12 per cent.  The future development of aquaculture is critically dependent on modernising and streamlining the licensing and regulation of this valuable natural resource.  Work in this area is under way.</P>
    <P>There is great potential for the development of our unique inland fisheries.  To capitalise on this our superior angling product must be developed and protected.  Last week I launched the Central Fisheries Board's five year strategic development plan which sets clear management, development, protection and conservation objectives for our inland fisheries during the period 1998-2002.  I particularly welcome the emphasis on maximising jobs and economic activity through further targeted, well spread development of the game, coarse and sea angling components.  I look forward to working with the board in delivering on that agenda.</P>
    <P>This is an exciting and challenging time for all those involved in maritime transport.  The economy is booming.  We have brought the standard of ports' infrastructures into the 21st century through well thought out and planned investments. We have seen the quality and volume of shipping services improve beyond recognition on Irish Sea routes.  Our shipping companies are seizing good commercial opportunities in international markets.  Most importantly, we have provided eight ports with structures and investments which will underpin the continuation of vital high quality transport services to and from the island.</P>
    <P>The Government will support and facilitate, in the interest of national economic and commercial development, competitive sea transport and port services.  In this context, my Department has set in train a number of important strategic actions. It has set about the initiation of a systematic review of the efficiency and relative costs and charges for maritime transport services at commercial seaports.  The purpose is to reach a cumulative minimum of 15 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to developing a comprehensive policy for the shipping industry. This policy must be about Irish jobs, that is, jobs on Irish vessels registered under the Irish flag, jobs on other vessels, jobs onshore servicing the sector and, importantly, jobs in expanded maritime activity around the coast whether for leisure, commercial or industrial purposes.  For such a <Col N="29" /> policy to be effective in delivering jobs it is essential that the size of the Irish flagged fleet is maximised. A number of measures have been introduced in recent years in the areas of training, corporation tax reliefs and employers' PRSI.  I am conscious that the PRSI concession is a particularly valuable one to employers of seafarers within our taxation system.  This scheme has been submitted to the European Union Commission and I hope to be able to announce its approval very shortly.</P>
    <P>Enhancing the supply of competitive and welltrained Irish seafarers is the key to a successful shipping policy.  I have secured the agreement of my ministerial colleague, the Minister for Finance, to consider an income tax concession for inclusion in the forthcoming Finance Bill, aimed at making seafaring, especially on Irish-flagged vessels, more attractive as well as competitive. Thus, the steady encroachment on the seafarers' labour market of low-cost, non-Irish, especially non-EU, seafarers would be reversed.  However, a supply of seafarers is one side of the coin only; the other is training.</P>
    <P>A task force on seafarer training will commence its work very shortly under the chairmanship of Mr. Brian Kerr, a member of the Council of Shipping, at present holding the prestigious position of chairman of the European Communities Shipowners' Association.</P>
    <P>In the area of oil and gas exploration and development there are very significant things taking place, and we expect the present level of research, development and exploration in that area will continue.  The year 1997 has been the busiest one for acquisition of new offshore seismic data with in excess of 25,000 kilometres having been acquired to date.</P>
    <P>Not only do we have a large number of licences but licensees include most of the major exploration companies.  Of course, having indigenous production would provide security of supply, help our balance of payments and contribute to reduced unemployment.</P>
    <P>The offshore exploration and production industry is of great importance to Ireland.  Its economic benefits &mdash; royalties, tax, jobs, opportunities for support services and so on &mdash; resulting from our existing gasfields in Kinsale and Ballycotton illustrate the importance of indigenous supplies apart altogether from the intrinsic value of the resource itself.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure real commitment by exploration licence-holders to provide opportunities for Irish goods and services at all stages of exploration and development in Irish waters.  I have asked them to ensure that such opportunities are provided and that contracts are designed not to preclude smaller suppliers.</P>
    <P>We are also making considerable advances in minerals exploration and development.  For example, there will be some 700 jobs forthcoming in the initial construction phase of the new large mine at Lisheen, County Tipperary, with some 300 permanent jobs being provided in that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> There is much potential and a lot of good news in this area, research exceeding anything experienced in the past.  It is my belief that we shall have a very successful, well-grounded marine and natural resources sector, which is where our medium to long-term future lies, and must be developed.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the marine emergency services engaged in providing total national cover, which is appreciated by everybody.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party spokesman on Finance, Deputy Quinn, appeared to consider this is not an important debate.  I consider it to be a particularly important one, on which there will be much to be said, of value to future policy, by all Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the important features of any budget, particularly at a time when the Minister for Finance has a substantial amount of money at his disposal for disbursal, is a clear indication of the manner in which it will be disbursed to the best advantage of economic development and social cohesion.  In that respect, the Minister and Government have chosen the wrong option.</P>
      <P>In the course of the last general election we were told that, if returned to power, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats would take a considerable number of people off the top rate of income tax, placing them on the standard rate. Yet the effect of what the Minister has done in this budget is that, whereas up to 1997, 37 per cent of taxpayers were subjected to the higher rate of income tax, 48 per cent, henceforth there will be 38.7 per cent subjected to the new higher rate of 46 per cent.  Contrary to the Minister's stated objective &mdash; which was to take a large number of taxpayers out of the high tax rate net &mdash; the taxation measures of this budget will ensure there will be greater numbers of taxpayers and PAYE workers subjected to the higher rate. Clearly that is in breach of all commitments in the taxation area given by the Minister and all the parties in this Government in the course of the last general election.  They have not honoured their commitment to the electorate in relation to tax rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has built up a reputation with regard to his attitude to public expenditure over many years.  He ridiculed the previous Administration on having slightly exceeded its target on public expenditure, yet he has endeavoured to pull a three-card confidence trick on the electorate, giving the impression he is controlling public expenditure, when he is not.  Deputy McCreevy, who has spoken in this House on many occasions as Opposition spokesman on Finance, admonished the previous Administration for spending too much money.  Yet the first <Col N="31" /> opportunity he has, as Minister for Finance, he will have spent more money this year, to the tune of £700 million, while simultaneously informing everybody that he is controlling public expenditure. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>The planning about which the Minister speaks, of what is required of our national finances, in particular post-1999, is not being done by him or his Department.  All we have got is a lecture from the Minister on the difficulties he will encounter in future in respect of the public service pay and pensions bill, totally ignoring the fact that he raised public expenditure substantially this year on many unnecessary measures.</P>
    <P>The breach of faith in respect of Partnership 2000, by the manner in which funds have been allocated in this budget, is unforgivable.  At a time when everybody could see clearly that less well-off, lower paid workers could get out of their poverty trap by taking up employment, the Minister has compounded their enormous difficulties. For example, a threshold of £14,000 annual income in the case of a single person reaching the higher rate of tax is very low indeed.  What the Minister has done in this budget has nothing to do with removing those poverty traps, or creating an incentive to work at lower wage levels, instead the well-off are being catered for, without any statement by the Minister on how he intends to tackle the problem of the incentive to work at that lower wage level.  The roaring Celtic tiger does not stand easily with low wage earners, those who want to be extracted from the welfare net and gain employment.  In fact this budget accentuates the gap between the rich and poor.</P>
    <P>I welcome two budgetary provisions which will give some people the incentive to work, that is treating the family income supplement on a net basis, signalled by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Quinn.  I am delighted the Minister has seen fit to do that because there had been an anomaly in that many who should have been benefiting were unable to do so because of the limit being too low at the lower wage level.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the increased allowance for the long-term unemployed.  However, I was very disappointed the Minister failed to take other action, the hallmark of the previous Administration, to tackle the huge hospital waiting lists in our health services.  Over the past four years successive Ministers for Health have made substantial inroads in these waiting lists across a range of health services to alleviate the appalling circumstances of so many people awaiting admission to hospital.  I am glad that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children is present.  Hopefully, in the future, he will be able to indicate that his Minister will address this problem in 1998, by shifting, as he has done in the budget, from capital to current expenditure in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, has long been a proponent of the difficulties of the agricultural community, particularly when he <Col N="32" /> was in Opposition, but he has become silent recently.  Perhaps office sits uneasily with him. We are more familiar with his tactics over the past two and a half years of telling everybody what Fianna Fáil would do for the farming community when it returned to office.  I will tell the Minister of State what Fianna Fáil has done.  It has abandoned the charter for farmers' rights and he and I know, from the number of representations we make on behalf of the farmers of Wexford, that the charter may as well be torn up. People are not getting their entitlements from the European Union due to the ineffectiveness of the Minister for Agriculture and Food in ensuring the charter is upheld.</P>

      <P>We were also told by the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and Fianna Fáil that we would have a new control of farmyard pollution scheme and a new dairy hygiene scheme, but where are they?  We have not heard a squeak from the Minister of State about these matters. There has not been any commitment to installation aid for young farmers.  When the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, got his hands on that portfolio, he abandoned the installation aid grant for young farmers for the second time on 7 August.  All we are getting in this budget is a payment to meet outstanding commitments. I am sure the Minister of State will have a good explanation of that for the Macra na Feirme members in Wexford.</P>
      <P>Another three card trick was attempted in headage payments where the Minister cut £35 million in the Estimate and gave back £23 million in the budget.  He expects people to say he gave them £23 million but he ignores the fact that we have already had a cut in the Estimate of £35 million.</P>
      <P>The agricultural community is not too happy with the performance of this Government, to put it mildly, and the promises made about live cattle exports and other issues sound hollow now.  This Government will have an uneasy relationship with the agricultural community, and deservedly so, because of the expectations it generated before the election.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister for Finance and the Government in general to address some of the important infrastructural problems in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny particularly in regard to roads, which are inhibiting industrial progress in Kilkenny.  The road from Waterford to Kilkenny and the road network around the city of Kilkenny is very deficient and I hope the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will address some of those issues in the near future.  I understand he will visit Kilkenny soon and we expect some good news on those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> I am disappointed the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, announced studies for natural gas for almost every town in the country except one that has been on the stocks for a considerable period, namely, Callan, County Kilkenny.  The previous chairman of the regional authority, Councillor Brett, made a big play on this issue some years ago but he has been silent on it recently.  I intend to ask the Minister of State to reconsider carrying out a feasibility study on behalf of the people of Callan with a view to having the town connected to the national gas grid as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in the context of the so-called regional policy of employment distribution, to take particular cognisance of the fact that we now have an IDA business park of 60 acres in Kilkenny city which is ripe for development.  We hope it will be properly marketed by the IDA and the Department with a view to attracting a major manufacturing facility to Kilkenny as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Finance consider designating the Barrow and Suir rivers with a view to providing tourist and angling facilities which would help to enhance the tourism potential of those undeveloped rivers.</P>
    <P>Despite the promises made before the election, the Minister for Finance has lost the opportunity of doing something for the lower wage earners. He has not achieved the objectives he set out, particularly in the taxation area.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister of State will forgive me if I am rather parochial in my comments rather than considering the general economic benefits of the budget.  The Government missed an opportunity in the budget to give more money to the less well off in our society. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, made his name as a politician who was opposed to public expenditure, yet when he had the opportunity to include strict guidelines on public expenditure, he was unwilling to take the difficult decision.  He has increased public expenditure, which is easy to do in good times, but when the Celtic tiger boom subsides, public expenditure will become a difficult issue.  The Minister missed an opportunity to put a rein on that aspect of our economic policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the tax relief pilot scheme being introduced for the upper Shannon region.  I understand the Minister must obtain permission from the European Commission for this but I do not see a problem arising about that.  I hope this scheme will go ahead.  I presume the reason the Minister has introduced this scheme is because the upper Shannon region is being denuded of <Col N="34" /> its population.  This scheme will work well if the Department of Finance takes an innovative approach to its implementation.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Finance, in its wisdom, decides to establish a tax renewal scheme for the upper Shannon region based on the previous urban renewal schemes, which were successful in many provincial towns and cities in recent years, it will not work.  The Department must consider innovative ways to give investors the incentive to invest in this area.</P>
    <P>I referred to the area I represent as being denuded of its people.  The population in Leitrim is decreasing at a slower rate now than in previous years but it is continuing to decrease.  The same applies to the population in Roscommon, Sligo and Longford.  Those counties will be included in the upper Shannon catchment area. When the Department of Finance examines the implementation of the scheme, I ask that serious consideration be given to the concept of creating a new town in this county.  A number of years ago, the British Government allocated an enormous amount of money to the development of a new city called Milton Keynes.  We should examine the possibility of creating a new town here which should be sited in the upper Shannon region under the tax relief proposals.  Obviously, a third level institute would have to be provided as well as high tech industries, proper infrastructure and numerous other capital expenditures which would allow a population increase of 20,000 to 30,000 to take place.</P>
    <P>The reason I propose such a concept is that everybody is aware of the dramatic increase in house prices in the greater Dublin area.  If we continue to develop economically in the greater Dublin area, young people will be unable to sustain their current mortgages.  It would be of much greater economic benefit to the community if there was diversification and the new town concept was applied to counties, such as the one from which I come, in which the population is declining. That concept involves people moving from over populated areas to areas where property is not as expensive.  People could buy homes in such areas without having to mortgages their incomes for the next 25 to 30 years.</P>
    <P>Another innovative idea the Department of Finance should consider in regard to the upper Shannon tax incentive scheme is to give a £10,000 new house grant to one member of a farm family. The number of people leaving farms in the west is increasing dramatically daily.  If such an incentive was provided to enable one member of a farm family to build a house on an existing farm of 30 to 40 acres it would encourage many people to stay at home.  They may not engage in full-time farming, but in part-time farming and other employment in the region which may necessitate their commuting 20, 30 or 40 miles.  Ireland has become a nation of commuters and people, regardless of where they reside, do not have any difficulty spending an hour commuting to work. Such innovative ideas would be very beneficial to <Col N="35" /> the area I represent.  If the Department of Finance in its wisdom selects a number of lines on a map and decides that investors can be given tax breaks if they invest in an area north of the upper Shannon region, such a scheme would not be of any great benefit to the people living in that area. It would benefit wealthy businessmen and those who have the money to invest in such schemes but that strategy will not benefit the upper Shannon region in the long-term.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax relief given in respect of three star hotels in County Leitrim and other counties in that region.  That assistance is needed and I compliment the Minister on taking that initiative.</P>
    <P>I have raised the contentious issue of corporation tax here on a number of occasions when I had the opportunity to do so.  The Government has continued the work of the previous Government by reducing corporation tax.  However, there is an anomaly in the scheme which has not been considered by any Government and I hope the Minister for Finance will address it.  Small business people are paying £380 million per year in rates to local authorities.  When business people in any county show potential by developing their businesses a rateable revaluation of their property is taken.  I know of instances in my county and others where people have spent in the region of £250,000 on the capital development of their premises and created extra jobs. However, many have had a visit from a representative of the Valuation Commission and in some instances their rates have been increased from £1,500 up to as much as £12,000.  That is a major disincentive and is stifling business.  The country is dependent on small family run businesses.  The incentives given in the budget to those types of businesses have been slim.  In the Finance Bill I hope the Minister will redress the imbalance in regard to rates and commercial rates that apply to small family run businesses.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, agrees with what my colleague, Deputy Hogan, said about the agricultural industry which is facing its greatest crisis in the history of this State.  It is the largest employer and is experiencing major difficulties.  The Government parties when in Opposition, particularly Fianna Fáil, stated they would reintroduce the control of farmyard pollution scheme, but that has not happened.  The chances of it being reintroduced are extremely unlikely given the 9 per cent or £35 million cut in the Department's expenses.  The installation aid scheme for young farmers will not be reintroduced, which does not provide any incentive for young farmers to remain in agriculture.  Another difficulty is the amount of time taken by the Department of Agriculture and Food to process headage payments.  That is disgraceful.  The Department has not lived up to the farmers' charter established by the previous Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates.  I would also like to raise other issues but I wish <Col N="36" /> to share the remainder of my time with Deputy D'Arcy.  There are some good measures in the budget which I welcome and some missed opportunities, but I will not condemn it outright.  I will wait to see if the Minister for Finance will make adjustments in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Less and less time is available to Deputies to contribute to debates.  I have more time to make a point at a meeting of Wexford County Council than I have in this House.  A committee system has been established, but when I was a Member of this House four years ago Deputies were allocated a half hour to make their contributions to the budget debate, now we do not have enough time.  That is a mistake because it would be helpful for the Government to hear the issues debated properly and at length.  The only way a Deputy has to make his contribution in eight minutes is to rush through a prepared statement, which I tend to do.</P>
      <P>There are good measures in the budget. However, in regard to the low paid workers the point has been made time and again, and I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will agree, that even in our constituency where there is a demand for workers in hotels and meat factories, which pay their workers only £4.50 an hour, such businesses cannot recruit enough staff. That applies to all low paid sectors in that area.</P>
      <P>I tend to speak mainly on one area, agriculture. In the short time available I wish to make a few important points about it.  The Government is pitiful in its unwillingness to recognise the consistent core of our economy is the earnings farmers derive from production on their farms.  It will be a long time before a Celtic tiger can match an Irish cow in its ability to protect the long-term interests of our nation.  The reality is that while jobs associated with imported industries are of value, they do not represent solid contributions to the creation of and increases in national wealth.  They represent income tax, revenue, a low level manufacturing tax and a contribution to reduce dole queues and emigration.  However, as we have seen they do not represent anything like the performance and employment national income represents in respect of agriculture and agri-business.  All one need do is ask the people from Mayo and Galway about problems they had with Digital and the people from Tallaght about the problems they had with Packard Electric. Concentrating on such industries is to some degree building the nation on unstable ground.  I welcome inward investment and I would like a large foreign industry to invest in Wexford, but that should not happen at the expense of agriculture. The foreign industries sector can be contrasted with the agricultural sector and the contributions of our farm families which every year contribute to increased exports and foreign earnings vital to our national interests in reducing our national debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish agriculture and the spin off sectors have consistently proven their importance to our <Col N="37" /> national well-being.  Why is the Government progressively demeaning the role of agriculture?  It refuses equitable tax treatment to farmers.  I do not understand why farmers should pay a different rate of tax.  The Government has removed incentives for young farmers, which is a great mistake. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will agree that young farmers have been given the wrong message in regard to tax.</P>
    <P>Only 6,500 places were provided under the installation aid scheme.  I understand the Minister said yesterday that he intends to introduce the scheme in a different form.  That is only tinkering with the issue; this scheme is an important incentive to young farmers and sends them the message that they are wanted in agriculture.  Agricultural colleges cannot fill their places and numerous farmers cannot get their sons to stay home on the farm.</P>
    <P>A very serious situation is developing as far as tax is concerned.  No excuse can be accepted from the Minister for Agriculture and Food for failure to protect the vital national interest represented by the agricultural sector.  It is obvious from the Estimates that the influence of the Minister, Deputy Walsh, at the Cabinet table is minimal and that the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach are those really in command.  That is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>It has already been stated that the Estimates have been cut by £35 million and only £23 million has been introduced.  It has now been stated that £11 million or £13 million must be found in some other area.  It will be necessary to cut some other service to provide this.  It is very serious to cut back on services at a time when agriculture is going through its most difficult period since the time I first entered this House.  We saw a decrease in net incomes in 1996 of 3 per cent and I expect that the decrease for 1997 will be of the order of 4 to 7 per cent, depending on the type of farming involved.</P>
    <P>I sought an answer from the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the issue of grants payable by his Department.  I received a reply from a higher executive officer, a Ms Catherine Foley, dated 28 November.  In it Ms Foley acknowledges my request for data in Parliamentary Question No. 218 of Wednesday, 12 November 1997 and the information is shown on an attached table. The main reasons applications were refused is also outlined.  I could not believe so many people had been refused grant payments.  I brought the issue to the attention of the Fine Gael agriculture group last night but they said the information must be wrong.  However, this letter was issued by the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>The number of applications refused payment under the livestock, headage and premium schemes from 1993 to 1996 are as follows: in 1993 there were 5,487 refusals; 7,705 in 1994; 7,362 in 1995 and, in 1996, the figure had risen to 9,191.  I am sure every Member of these Houses is dealing with 20 or 30 cases in which payment has been refused.  I have brought these cases to the attention <Col N="38" /> of the current and former Ministers.  Deputy Walsh was also the Minister for Agriculture in 1993.  Have we created a monster in the Department?  An over-efficient Department is the greatest threat to democracy as bureaucrats set themselves up as experts on everything.</P>
    <P>I brought four cases to the attention of the Ombudsman although I was not successful.  It is unbelievable that 9,191 people were refused payment in 1996.  How many will be refused in 1997?  I feel the Department of Agriculture and Food, like the English Department of Agriculture and the EU, could be brought to court on this issue. It seems that the English Government and the EU lost every case brought against them.  On 6 March 1997 Advocate General Leger delivered his opinion on the NFU's annual challenge to ICIACS penalties for innocent errors of 20 per cent or more of setaside.  Under the scheme, prior to its amendment in July 1995, such errors were taken as resulting in total loss of any area linkage payments to beef premiums for the farmers concerned. The Advocate General considered the MAFF correctly understood the effect of the regulation in force at the relevant time but that the penalty was illegal because it breached the requirement of proportionality.</P>
    <P>Has the Department of Agriculture and Food ever understood what is meant by proportionality?  Does it arise where a farmer innocently has one ewe too many and loses £4,000 as a result?  In some cases, when errors are discovered, farmers are disallowed payment for the following year.  I will not let this issue lie, I will take it up with the Department and with farmers' organisations. The extent of the refusal of payments over the past four years was unknown before I asked a question on it.</P>
    <P>Payments have been refused to 30,000 farmers. In certain cases, these payments represent 100 per cent of a farmer's net income.  The Ombudsman does not seem to understand the concept of proportionality either.  His report was discussed in this House recently and it stated issues should be looked at proportionately.  He is not following that advice and neither is the Department of Agriculture.  This is an intolerable situation.  I am not asserting that the entire 9,000 farmers involved are without blame.  I have, however, seen borderline cases and the Ombudsman and the Department of Agriculture and Food should seek to strike a balance between proportionality and benefit of the doubt.</P>

      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Hogan's comments, which I thought lacked some conviction, that those who are better off are being pushed into the higher tax bracket and paying <Col N="39" /> more tax.  In the next breath he said that the rich are getting richer.  It is difficult to understand what precisely he meant as his comments were contradictory.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gerry Reynolds welcomed most of the budget's contents.  The Deputy mentioned the farmers' charter introduced by the previous Minister in a blaze of publicity.  I do not believe anyone believed the farmers' charter actually worked and I fail to see why such an argument is being made for it.  My understanding is that headage payments are being paid at a much faster rate now than heretofore, probably due to computerisation. We should attempt to be accurate about these matters.</P>
      <P>I agree with many of the comments made by Deputy D'Arcy.  His colleague, Deputy Yates, was responsible for closing the installation aid and other schemes.  The issue of installation aid was examined by two groups, one of which was commissioned by the rainbow coalition some years ago.  Both reports suggested that change was required to the installation aid scheme and that is what the Minister for Agriculture and Food is proposing to do in order that the lower paid should reap the benefit rather than those who are well off.  I met farmers' organisations in recent days and they want to see installation aid restored to help those who need it most.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a contribution to this year's budget debate. Details of the budget have already been outlined by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  The aims of the budget are clear.  The Government intends to reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity.</P>
      <P>The performance of the economy has been impressive in recent years and our economic growth is generating jobs for our people at an unprecedented rate.  We must continue to build on this strong foundation through proper and prudent management of the nation's finances. The budget for 1998 is a significant step towards achieving that goal.</P>
      <P>Everybody has a responsibility to make a substantial contribution towards sustaining economic development.  My Department, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, also has an important role to play in this process.  It is a relatively new Department established by this Government to maximise the strategic development and management of natural resources in a cohesive and pro-active way.  The Department's brief is a wide one and covers shipping, ports, fisheries, safety at sea, the marine environment, research, coast protection, mining, petroleum, forestry and aquaculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister of State with special responsibility for aquaculture and forestry, I will confine my comments to these two important areas.  Within the sea fisheries sector, aquaculture is a key component of growing importance.  The industry is on a firm growth path and is making a contribution to the economy.  Almost 30 per cent of the total <Col N="40" /> value of fish production now comes from the aquaculture industry.  The industry employs about 3,000 people directly, with as many more in downstream jobs.  When one considers that these jobs are substantially located in regions where employment opportunities are often few and far between, it further emphasises the importance of the industry to rural Ireland's social and economic well being.  We must protect the rural fabric of this country.</P>
    <P>The industry's contribution to the economy continues to grow with the volume of aquaculture production increasing from over 27,000 tonnes in 1995 to an estimated 35,000 tonnes during 1996, an increase of 28 per cent.  The total value of aquaculture output increased from £49 million in 1995 to over £55 million in 1996, an increase of 12 per cent.  The potential exists for further sustainable expansion and development of the industry.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate the future development of the industry, the need for a new statutory framework for the licensing and regulation of aquaculture has been widely acknowledged.  The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997 will provide an effective, legally secure and transparent licensing process which will command the confidence of the fish farming industry and all other relevant interests, including environmental and angling groups.  It is a priority of my Department to get the new system up and running as soon as possible. The new licensing and regulatory system, when in place, will legally underpin the further development of the industry.</P>
    <P>In achieving this we will, of course, take full account of environmental considerations and the concerns of other interested parties.  Full and open consultative systems and an appropriate appeals mechanism will be introduced, and we will ensure that both licence applicants and objectors will have equal entitlement to all information involved in the licencing process.  Our development strategy will also focus on the need for research and development of new species as well as providing targeted support services, including financial and technical support and training and quality assurances.</P>
    <P>In order to further enhance the development of the sector, I recently announced two initiatives in relation to aquaculture.  The first relates to the establishment of a customer focused aquaculture forum to improve communications between the aquaculture industry and the State agencies delivering services to it.  The second initiative which I intend to bring to fruition is a root and branch analysis of the future direction for the aquaculture industry.  Some would suggest that heretofore it has been scattered.  During 1998 progress will be made on both these initiatives to ensure that this industry which is based on Ireland's most prolific natural resource, the sea, will be well placed to meet future challenges.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by the industry in relation to the imposition of rates on fish farms.  This primarily affects salmon smolt <Col N="41" /> and trout producers.  With the ongoing development of the industry, new land-based projects such as holding and purification facilities for shellfish as well as eel and turbot facilities are coming into the net as well.  I am sympathetically disposed to the case made by the industry to be given parity of treatment with the agriculture sector. Since my appointment, I have been pursuing the issue with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, with a view to obtaining a satisfactory resolution.</P>
    <P>Under existing valuation legislation, fish farms are considered rateable and amending legislation would be required to remove the burden.  The draft heads of a valuation Bill are at an advanced stage of preparation in the Department of Finance. The purpose of the proposed Bill is to modernise and streamline the valuation code.  The Minister for Finance has assured me that he will consider the issue of rates on fish and shellfish farms when the draft heads of the Bill are being finalised.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the very substantial increases in forestry grant and premium rates which I announced recently.  The grants and premium payments, which are made under the forestry accompanying measure of the CAP programme, have been increased by an average of 13.5 per cent from 15 October 1997 in the case of planting grants and will cover the current planting season.  The premium level increases will apply to all payments from January 1998.  There is a commitment in Partnership 2000 that the Government would review the levels of premium and maximise the premium payable to farmers on the first 20 hectares planted.  The recent package which I announced meets that commitment.  The new rates include a top-up of £10 per hectare on the premium for sites between six and 12 hectares and a top-up of £20 per hectare for larger sites. These top-ups apply only to farmers planting on enclosed land and have been approved by the European Commission.  I have always held the view that, to be effective in encouraging farmers to plant, the premium rates must remain comparable with other agricultural returns.</P>
    <P>Planting levels in the current year will be substantially below the 25,000 hectare target set in the strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector published last year.  The shortfall this year is due in part to farmers postponing planting decisions pending news of the increased rates. Unfortunately, discussions with the European Commission took much longer than anticipated. The new package of rates should play a significant role in getting planting levels back on track.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed within the forestry sector that changes in planning controls on planting are inhibiting our forestry programme. This is obviously a matter to which I will pay attention.</P>
    <P>With regard to the mix of species being planted, the modifications included in the package are a recognition of the need to promote greater diversity.  In that context, the bias towards <Col N="42" /> diverse planting of conifers and of broadleafs included in the new grant and premium rates is particularly relevant.  An increase in the diversity of species being planted is vital, not alone to provide a greater range of downstream processing opportunities but also for environmental reasons and to protect forest health.</P>
    <P>The need to promote greater use of timber is another important priority.  To this end, the Department is making available grant assistance of £178,500 to the Wood Marketing Federation for the purpose of producing an Irish Specifiers' Timber Guide.  Some 75 per cent of the grant assistance is being provided by the European Union under the downstream development support measure of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry.</P>
    <P>The specifiers' guide will provide a major boost to the timber industry.  As timber is a natural material, specifiers view it as a material area requiring specialised advice.  For timber and timber-based products to compete effectively with other materials it is essential that a comprehensive timber specification manual be provided to architects, engineers and quantity surveyors.  The new guide will be just that.  It will be user friendly, authoritative and up-to-the-minute, and will assist specifiers while simultaneously promoting and encouraging the use of timber and timber-based materials.</P>
    <P>The Department is also very much at the frontier of technological advancement in developing a unique and innovative computerised information and planning tool, known as the forest inventory and planning system.  The function of the new system will be to locate, classify, quantify and forecast future volume production as well as planning the location of future afforestation.  The new system comprises three main components: a national forest inventory, a redevelopment of the forestry grants administration system and an indicative forest strategy.</P>
    <P>Investment in the new system, which is receiving substantial financial support from the European Union, will result in a state-of-the-art technological framework for the future development of the forestry sector.</P>
    <P>With a real increase in the investment in forestry &mdash; it is now almost a £200 million industry &mdash; it is essential that there is a focused and structured research and development programme. New challenges are being posed for the industry and solid research is of vital importance.  With the expansion of the private forestry sector it is of particular importance to that sector that research is available on the technical aspects of forestry.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the Council for Forestry Research and Development, COFORD, set up in 1993 to advise on forestry and research development matters, the forest service is preparing a costed programme for a phased and prioritised upgrading of national research and development effort.  This will take account of the increased private sector involvement and the need for balance between fundamental and applied research <Col N="43" /> and development.  It will also place particular emphasis on market demands, industrial needs, environmental concerns and cost efficiency. Investment by my Department on forest research and development in currently running at about £1.5 million per annum and future expenditure on research will be directed in line with this new programme.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my personal commitment to the development of forestry.  I am satisfied that the outlook for forestry is very bright and believe the objectives of our strategic plan will be met.  The overall aim of the plan is to develop the sector to a scale which maximises its contribution to economic and social well-being and in the process creates 11,000 new jobs.  There is a commitment from the European Commission to continued support for forestry in Ireland and forestry is set to become a major sector in the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for sharing his time.  It is welcome that the budget was introduced in the autumn this year, a change from previous years when it was introduced in the spring.  This was also the policy of the previous Government, which is to be commended.  Introducing the budget at this time of year will be of great benefit to the State agencies who depend on Exchequer funding.  They will be in a better position to manage their finances and do their job appropriately as a result of this change.</P>
      <P>Last year I referred to the need to avoid borrowing, to treat workers fairly and target funding to those on social welfare.  I am glad the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has done this in a prudent way.  We know the lessons that were learned in the late 1970s and the early 1980s and the discipline and difficulties we experienced in 1987 and 1989 in trying to correct our finances.  I hope future Ministers for Finance will not forget this.  I am pleased the Minister plans a surplus in 1999 and 2000.  The net current spending, including central funds, will be controlled at 3.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Minister treated workers fairly and honoured the agreement made in the programme for Government.  He reduced the 26 per cent and 48 per cent tax rates by 2 per cent.  I do not understand those who argue that 2 per cent should not have been taken off.  Many of those I meet pay 48 per cent tax but are on a relatively modest income.  They have to provide housing for themselves, education for their children and meet their health needs.  They do not benefit from the facilities in place.  It is right they should be recognised because like everyone in our workforce they are making a major contribution to our successful economy.  I compliment the Minister on his taxation relief measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment my colleague from the neighbouring constituency, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on his contribution to the budget.  On the £5 increase in the old age pension, it is right that <Col N="44" /> when the economy is doing so well that those who contributed to this success in the past are recognised. The £5 increase for all old age pensioners and those over 66 years with a disability on a social welfare allowance is the largest given by any Minister in the history of the State.  The £3 increase per week is ahead of inflation and will benefit those who depend on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to process claims for family income supplement on net income.  This will benefit 7,200 families.  Many people do not receive the family income supplement because they do not know they are entitled to it.  The Minister might address how one ensures that those in the workforce entitled to family income supplement are aware of it.  It can be a substantial benefit.  It is unfortunate that there are people who have been in the workforce for a number of years with three, four or more children who would have benefited but were unaware of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of those who will benefit from the back-to-work allowance by 5,000 to 27,000 and the new tax allowance initiatives for the long-term unemployed are also welcome.  The £3,000 allowance, £1,000 per child and the double tax deduction for employers for three years are welcome measures.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the cases of those who are caring for persons who are totally incapacitated and perhaps to do something about the income limit for the carer's allowance.  The income assessment should be removed where someone is totally incapacitated.  The number of carers who do not receive the allowance is not large. However, in most cases the woman of the house takes care of her mother-in-law or father-in-law who is totally incapacitated, bedridden and needs to be fed three times a day.  The husband's income should not be taken into account in those circumstances.  I would like an increase in the carer's allowance based on the degree of dependency. There will be four more budgets in the tenure of this Government and I am sure this issue will be addressed.  It is important to state, because some Members do not seem to be aware of it, that we will spend £9.5 million on child benefit this year, compared with the previous Government's £8.3 million.  This will amount to £28.4 million in a full year compared with the previous Government's £25 million.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in farmers' tax, the extension of the limit on capital allowance for the control of farmyard pollution from £20,000 to £30,000, the fact that the current 100 per cent stock relief for young qualifying farmers will apply for four years instead of two years, the £3.5 million extra for capital gains tax retirement relief, the £3.5 for outstanding applications for installation aid for young farmers, and the £23 million extra for headage payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided £20 million from the lottery for the GAA over three years.  That will be a contribution towards the £138 million investment <Col N="45" /> by the GAA in Croke Park.  It is very welcome because the GAA is our national sporting organisation and it would be impossible to estimate the value of its contribution to players and spectators over 100 years.  Gaelic games are represented in the community, the parish, the county, the province.  They instil a spirit of honour for those who play and pride in communities when their teams play in a championship and particularly when they win.  Involvement in sport and healthy recreation must contribute to a healthier society.  If more young people had the opportunity to partake in sport perhaps we would not see so many dysfunctional children, or so much misuse of drugs, etc.  I commend the Minister for Finance for this contribution to the GAA.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to look at a means of addressing an anomaly that exists for workers on this side of the Border who work in the North.  I also welcome the new unrestricted availability of capital allowances for individuals in the seven counties, including the two counties, Cavan and Monaghan, in my constituency.  This will benefit the constituency greatly.  It recognises the deficiency in the number of tourists being attracted to areas with no tradition of tourism. Having recognised that, the Minister might look further to see what else can be done to ensure that every county benefits from the current boom in tourism.</P>
    <P>I always welcomed excise duty on cigarettes, no matter what Government was in power.  I am pleased that the Minister did not increase excise duty on unleaded petrol and diesel.  That will benefit everybody, particularly those in the Border counties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax relief on donations to charities. That is a worthwhile initiative because we have many voluntary organisations that are complementary to the State.  Together, the voluntary organisations and the State provide a level of service that compares favourably with anything available in Europe and around the world, and it is something we should cherish.  I hope we never see the day that the State provides everything for everybody, and that we will always have voluntary commitment.</P>
    <P>The innovation on information technology in schools is a major one which will bring credit to this Government for many years to come, and ensure that all our children are computer literate.</P>
    <P>We should always be looking for ways of reducing Government spending and getting value for money.  We should ask ourselves whether some of our schemes are redundant, and whether some services could be improved or delivered more efficiently.  Ministers in various Departments might look at the question of transport.  The Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs all spend large amounts of money on transport.  The time has come to look at the possibility of an integrated transport network.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share ten minutes of my time with my colleague, Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my constituency colleague on this, his first budget, and wish him well as Minister for Finance.  The rest of what I have to say, however, will not be so complimentary.</P>
      <P>The options available this year were never before available to a Minister for Finance.  Never was there such an abundance of resources to be disbursed in such a way as to have a major impact not only on the country generally but on the social and economic lives of its people for the foreseeable future.  This may or may not be the first of four budgets of this administration.  Only time will tell.</P>
      <P>The direction and administration taken at an early stage often has an impact long into the future.  The Government could have adopted an inclusive policy by rewarding those who provide opportunities for people who are currently excluded.  Such a policy would include encouraging those already in the labour force to remain there.  My reason for saying this is simply that in other jurisdictions policies such as those in this budget have turned out disastrously.  It may be different here, nobody knows yet.  However, throughout Europe such policies rewarded better off people who were not looking for a reward, and ignored the less well off.  Commentators have said that this is what the public voted for, that it was greed on the part of the public.  I do not believe that.  The public are often led by certain media publications and some politicians who tell them what they should be looking for, and extol the virtues of proceeding in that way.  That is how we arrived at this juncture.  I have never seen greed manifested to the extent that is being suggested. People very often look for more when they are told they should receive more.  This is the reason this is an unwise budget.</P>
      <P>Social requirements must be measured against the needs in the areas of housing, taxation, employment, health and education services, all of which impact directly on the day to day lives of families.  The budget has ignored people on the average industrial wage who are expected to provide housing for themselves.  Local authorities do not provide houses for people in this income category and it would not be advisable to encourage them to borrow to buy a £100,000 house.  The budget has done little for them in the area of housing.  We must encourage people to remain at work through our financial and fiscal policies.  If we do not do this then we have little chance of encouraging the unemployed to take up work.</P>
      <P>There is ample evidence in my constituency and other constituencies that people on an average industrial wage are being ignored.  They are expected to provide their own housing but have not been given tax concessions in the budget to enable them to do this.  The budget is of greater benefit to people on higher incomes and it excludes this group.  We must address this issue as everyone is entitled to housing.</P>

      <Col N="47" /> The needs in the area of public authority housing have been neglected for many years.  Evidence of this can be seen in the amount spent by health boards in subsidising rented accommodation. This is bad value for money and creates hardship for many people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be political but in the run up to the election the Minister for Health and Children was very outspoken about hospital services and other aspects of the health services.  He visited hospitals and other institutions and highlighted their problems.  However, these problems have not been addressed in the context of the budget.  It is often said that the public has a short memory but politicians also have short memories when it suits them.</P>
    <P>On waiting lists, an 80 year old person in my constituency was told that if she contributed £3,000 she could have a hip operation carried out within a matter of weeks.  It is a scandal that a person who has contributed to society all her working life should have scant recognition given to her efforts.  She has been asked to contribute £3,000 to the cost of the operation despite the fact that she is a medical card holder, receives a non-contributory pension and has a limited income. This is only one of many such cases.  It is a disgrace that people in this category should be excluded from receiving treatment.</P>
    <P>The budget does not address this and many other issues.  For example, it does not recognise the existence of waiting lists.  The reason waiting lists have been reduced is that the means of assessment and evaluation have been changed.  I could give many examples where a person deemed by the State not to be in need of category one or urgent treatment was also deemed by a private orthodontist to be in need of urgent surgery. The victims in such cases are the children. Unfortunately the budget does not address this issue.</P>
    <P>The issue of special hospital services has occupied the time of some commentators recently.  I am referring to psychiatric and psycho-geriatric services and services for people with a physical, mental or sensory disability.  I will not name individual institutions but the conditions in some institutions are disgraceful.  The buildings are old fashioned and have no heating, while the system of administering care to patients is inadequate.  I could say it is Victorian but that would be a sad reflection on that era.  The facilities may have been adequate 100 years ago but time does not stand still and they are totally inadequate today. If we are a caring society we must give serious consideration to this issue.  This has nothing to do with the Celtic tiger; it has to do with recognising problems which have existed for a long time.</P>
    <P>Some commentators referred to St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.  When I was a member of the visiting committee ten or 15 years ago conditions in the hospital were not good then.  While there have been some improvements in the meantime the conditions are still bad.  The same applies to <Col N="48" /> many other similar institutions.  We must seek to improve the way we deal with such problems. However, there is little evidence in the budget that this will be done.</P>
    <P>Many other areas of the health services which impact directly on patients also need to be improved.  In some hospitals patients are left waiting on trolleys.  In some cases this may be due to an emergency or extenuating circumstances.  Last summer the Minister set himself up as an inspector and visited numerous hospitals.  I presumed he was formulating some sort of super plan to resolve problems but this was not the case.  Most disturbing is that the public are let down because the promises made before the election are not being met.  The so-called care and concern that existed beforehand is not evident when people get into Government.</P>
    <P>That our population, particularly our ageing population, is increasing and medicine is advancing must be taken into account to ensure maximum benefit to the taxpayer on the one hand and maximum benefit in terms of delivery of services to the consumer on the other.  That is important in terms of the strategic management initiative taken by the Government.  If that is not taken into account, we are ignoring reality.</P>
    <P>There is need for modern technology in hospitals, particularly in training hospitals.  Young medical professionals do not wish to serve their internships in hospitals that do not have access to modern facilities because when they seek appointment elsewhere there is immediate reference to whether those facilities were available where they served their internship and whether they are <i>au fait</i> with modern technology and modern practices.  That is a serious issue in the administration of medical and surgical services and it should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Recent reports show that, while our education system is reasonably good, the pupil-teacher ratio is one of the worst in modern economies.  If we are serious about targeting people in need and enabling them to compete in the marketplace for jobs, we must ensure they have a good grounding in education at an early age.  Otherwise, developments at a later stage will be of little significance.</P>
    <P>There is no indication in the budget of what the Government plans to do about agriculture, and perhaps that is not unusual.  The Government must be aware of the serious difficulties facing the agriculture industry and the agri-sector in general.  Thousands of jobs depend on that industry. Difficulties have arisen recently in terms of the operation of the Single Market and the health status of products from the industry.  If those matters are not addressed urgently there will be a huge price to pay.  Failure to deal with them will have negative knock-on effects.  I am concerned we are attempting to equate the health status of our meat products with those of another jurisdiction which is experiencing a serious problem. Association of that nature will do serious damage to our product.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> There has been much discussion about the £20 million made available to the GAA.  If I was the Minister, Deputy McDaid, I would be very upset at the transfer of £20 million from the national lottery fund to another area, but that is a matter for him.  The GAA caters for a huge section of society and I laud it for the work it has done, but I have one reservation about the money allocated to it.  Was it a good idea to give £20 million to central headquarters?  Would it not be better to give £15 million to individual clubs and organisations which deal directly with the public?  Perhaps the money would have been better spent in that way.</P>
    <P>In regard to pensions, widows received some concession by way of taxation, but widow's pension, particularly for younger widows, has not been addressed.  In the case of two old aged pensioners living in a household, when one dies the other receives a concessional rate of pension for only a short period.  That is a matter which must be addressed.  In regard to <i>pro rata</i> pensions for the self-employed and those with a mixture of contributions, there is also a problem that needs to be addressed.  If a court case is taken on this matter in the future the Minister would lose. Once the principle of <i>pro rata</i> payments is established it must be applied.</P>
    <P>Many positive comments could be made about this budget, but unfortunately one could also make many negative comments.  I hope we will not be back here in a year's time pointing out the failures in the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I appreciate the time sharing arrangements.  The budget amounts to a calculated insult to working people, unemployed people and senior citizens.  They have been the foundation of the wealth created in the State, but the Government rewards them with contempt.  That contempt is nowhere more evident than in the extraordinary cuts in tax on corporation profits.  The Government gave a paltry few pounds per week in the form of tax reduction to low paid workers and they are supposed to be grateful.  It gave £3 and £5 respectively to social welfare recipients and older people and that is supposed to be a great step forward.  By contrast, however, tens of millions of pounds were handed to leading banks, which have been very profitable for many years, in savings on corporation tax. Likewise, millions of pounds were handed to the big business sector whose profitability has been massive in recent times.</P>
      <P>During the ten years of the so-called partnership agreements since l987, business profits have increased by 70 per cent in real terms.  By contrast, wage increases of working people remain at 1 per cent per year in real terms.  Clearly the big corporations and banks, which have funded the coffers of the major political parties, must feel they got value in the budget for their political investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time the Government stands over a position where taxpaying householders, the <Col N="50" /> backbone of the taxpaying system, are dragged into courts for arrears of the discredited double tax on water, which was forced out of existence by a massive number of people.  The myth that the more that is handed in tax cuts to big corporations and big business, the more jobs they will create in the economy, has been blown sky high by the devastating announcement of the closure of Seagate Technology in Clonmel.  Successive Governments have placed the fate of tens of thousands of workers in the hands of multinational corporations and reduced the economy to subservient dependence on them.  This is policy. The recklessness of the Minister for Finance and of Government representatives was obvious when in the pre-budget discussions only a few weeks ago they blithely asserted the crisis in South East Asia was a little local difficulty which would not impact on the Irish economy.  How can working class people have confidence in a Government that walks with closed eyes into disaster?</P>
    <P>Tragically, Seagate will be only the first of such disasters.  With all the cold calculation of Mafia dons, the multinational bosses in Seagate massacred 1,400 Irish workers' jobs under cover of the festive season only a few months after they threw champagne around the place for all the family, with gullible Government Ministers in attendance. Yet, successive Governments and the major conservative parties will continue to kiss the boots of multinationals, putting their trust in them to provide secure jobs, when it is patently obvious that when their profits begin to decline they will abandon the country with the contempt we saw yesterday.</P>
    <P>The budget ignored the fact that the collapse of the stock exchanges in South East Asia and the drastic currency devaluations in that region spelt the end of the propaganda about those economies which were built on massive borrowing, speculation in stocks and shares, massive speculation in property, outright corruption in some cases and low wages and the exploitation of workers.  Ominously, they were called the Asian tigers.  The same propaganda about the so-called Celtic tiger has blinded this Government and other commentators to the cycles of the capitalist market which inevitably, driven by the irrational and competitive lust for private profit, run headlong into the problems of overproduction and overcapacity and then keel into recession with devastating consequences for the working people. That is what has begun to happen in South East Asia and, tragically, it has impacted on thousands of workers in Tipperary and will work its way into the world and European economies.  However, the pendulum will swing from market madness to the ideas of democratic socialism under which natural, industrial and human resources will be utilised rationally to meet the needs of humanity here and internationally.  In that manner we can create secure jobs, homes, clothes, dignity and freedom for all and eliminate the chaos of the capitalist market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> The Minister for Finance insists the budget is a preparation for EMU.  In the light of the Seagate disaster and of the South East Asian crisis, EMU will be a disastrous straitjacket, particularly for the small European economies, including Ireland. One of the Seagate bosses said this morning the currency devaluation in South East Asia was one of the problems that affected the company.  If sterling weakens when this Republic is in the EMU, does anyone believe the economy could resist the pressure that would put on exports?</P>
    <P>The Minister lost a major opportunity in the budget to provide significant investment for public enterprise which could be solidly built on the basis of our natural resources, farming and other sectors.  It is a shame the Government is apparently prepared to privatise and sell off one of the top State-owned companies, TEAM Aer Lingus. In view of yesterday's bolt from the blue at Seagate, would it not be criminally irresponsible to hand over TEAM Aer Lingus to another multinational whose ruthlessness will be equal in ferocity to those who savaged the jobs in Tipperary?  The Government must answer.</P>
    <P>It is bitterly disappointing that an emergency provision was not provided in the budget for the thousands of individuals and families who are on the housing and hospital waiting lists.  A sum of £20 million was provided to refurbish a football stadium at GAA headquarters and tens of millions were provided for the banks and big corporations. What about those suffering terrible distress on the housing lists which, as a public representative, I hear about every week?  Why not set aside an emergency provision to end the housing and hospital waiting lists in two or three years?</P>
    <P>The people gave their verdict in an opinion poll published today.  One cannot fool all the people all the time.  The people know the budget prioritised the super rich, not middle income workers. The super rich and the big corporations will benefit. I hope the people will give their verdict on the Government's priorities in the by-elections next March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, put an excellent overall package of proposals before the House in the budget. When one looks at the overall shape of his proposals and a number of excellent individual components, it is nothing short of miraculous to observe the profound recovery which has been achieved in the State's finances in the past ten years.  In 1987, the country's economic condition was nothing short of alarming, with almost every <Col N="52" /> measure of financial well-being suggesting an economy in deep crisis.  A mere decade later a tremendous transformation for the better has been achieved as a result of courageous, informed and consistent economic planning.</P>
      <P>While a number of initiatives have contributed to this incredible recovery, there is one single outstanding feature at the root of both the nature and scale of the improvements which have been rapidly achieved, the recognition of the vital necessity for partnership and consensus as opposed to discord and sectional interests.  Excellent political leadership has contributed substantially to this process.  However, without widespread support across society for the core concept of partnership, it would not have been possible to achieve the level and rate of progress seen over the last decade.</P>
      <P>In many instances, significant sacrifices were made by individuals and families through their support for a slow but systematic process of economic recovery.  Successive Governments since l987 have recognised the central importance of balance in planning our economy.  Like any modern society, we have a wide range of interests across our community.  At one extreme, there are those who are financially well off and consequently have their own priorities in relation to the central management of the economy.  Issues such as lower taxation, controlled Exchequer spending, the control of crime and improved educational facilities figure highly on their priorities. The majority of people are in the middle income bracket.  While they share many of the concerns of the more affluent sector, issues such as employment creation, health services and bank interest rates are of vital importance.</P>
      <P>The most vulnerable in society are those on the lowest income levels.  Despite the sustained growth levels achieved consistently during the last decade, and a range of social cohesion measures sponsored by the Government and the European Union, a large percentage of people remain at or below the poverty line.  In many cases, individuals and families are trapped in a circle of deprivation from one generation to the next.  While a number of issues contribute to this reality, two particular issues are major contributory factors to sustained social deprivation.  The obvious matter of long-term unemployment is the first issue.  Irrespective of the level and range of social support measures in place, it is virtually impossible for a family without at least one employed member, to make ends meet.  In particular, it is extremely rare for such a social unit to accumulate any substantial level of financial resource.  As a result, a pattern of resignation and lack of hope is only too common.  The second major factor contributing to persistent social deprivation is closely related to unemployment, the question of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that study after study has shown a high level of educational attainment is the single most important key to improved employment potential, we continue to see the <Col N="53" /> depressing pattern of the lowest uptake of advanced education among those sectors of our society with greatest economic needs.  It must be admitted that, while it is relatively easy to define this problem, it is far more difficult to obtain an effective solution.  Recent initiatives by the Department of Education are certain to make a major difference in this regard.  In particular, the increased level of access to computer training is vital to facilitate the necessary level of educational and social gain among the most economically deprived sectors of society.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, however, the most immediate and frequently expressed needs of those with the lowest levels of income relate to social support provisions.  Thus, as the current Minister designed his budgetary proposals he had to attempt to reconcile the major differences in emphasis placed on various issues by diverse sectors of the community.  In carrying out this extremely difficult task the Minister had to keep clearly in mind the fact that seemingly major differences between various interest groups may in fact reflect the actual underlying realities.  For example, the level of interdependence between different sectors is extremely clear.</P>
    <P>Take the core issue of job creation.  Unless those who are most affluent in our society decide to invest some of their resources in sometimes risky economic ventures, the vital lift-off in terms of substantial and sustained job creation levels is very unlikely to materialise.  Similarly, if progress is not made in terms of removing the various poverty traps in our socio-economic structures, then the necessary level of manpower is unlikely to become available in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to my opening theme of the need for balance in economic and social support measures within the budget.  It would have been all too easy for the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to take the easy way out as he planned this budget.  He could have selected any one of a number of possible easy and populist ways out. In other words, he could have concentrated on a few sectors for very short-term gain, while ignoring the overall vital need to carefully grow the Irish economy for the benefit of all citizens, but particularly those most in need.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, he did not lose this vital sense of balance in the construction of his budget.  He did indeed take a number of important steps in dealing with immediate priorities, particularly in the area of social cohesion and justice.  Similarly, he clearly recognised the special problems being encountered by groups such as small and middlesized farmers.  Accepting the fact that our vital agricultural industry is coming under increasing pressure from a range of factors &mdash; such as lower world market prices, the likely enlargement of the EU to include countries with large agricultural bases and a worrying level of market uncertainty regarding vital agricultural products &mdash; the Minister has decisively responded to the sector's urgent needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> Therefore, before considering some of the many excellent individual features of the Minister's budget, I congratulate him on the overall level of balance he has managed to achieve in his provisions.  With a combination of exciting initiatives and economic prudence, he has ensured that a substantial proportion of the benefits of the current economic boom are spread across the wide range of interests in our society, while at the same time taking care to maintain the vital current momentum in growth and market confidence.  I firmly believe that the excellent work of the Minister will reap substantial rewards in terms of sustained economic growth in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific provisions of the budget, my main priorities continue to be in relation to two key issues, namely improving the range and quality of social cohesion provisions and reducing the burden of taxation on the PAYE employee.  I am pleased to see the level of investment in both these areas by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has made a number of excellent changes in terms of social support payments.  Of course, the increase of £5 per week for those receiving old age pensions and retirement, invalidity, widow's and widower's pensions aged 65 years or over, was particularly welcome.  Our senior citizens have unselfishly laid the foundation for our economic growth through many decades of work and effort.  It is only fair and just that they should now receive appropriate recognition. Indeed, the ongoing commitment of both the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties to this cherished sector of society has been clearly stated.</P>
    <P>I equally welcome the other measures in this budget which assist our older citizens.  For example, we have seen substantial improvements in terms of income tax.  I am particularly happy with the extension of the free travel pass provisions in the case of companions of those aged 75 years or more.  This initiative is certain to allow far greater freedom of movement to older people who, despite some level of illness or infirmity, wish to continue their social involvement to the greatest possible degree.</P>
    <P>A particular feature of the income tax provisions is the major increase in the level of allowance provided for the widowed bereaved parent. The level of improvement is clearly evident from the first year provision which has jumped from £1,500 to £5,000.  The improvement is sustained up to five years.  At a time of family crisis this provision will provide a welcome practical indication of support and solidarity on the part of the State.</P>
    <P>This Government's commitment to the taxpayer is abundantly clear from the many outstanding features of the budget.  The evidence is clear and explicit.  Five leading elements in this regard clearly illustrate the scope and level of <Col N="55" /> improvement achieved in year one by the Minister. The major reduction of 2 per cent in the standard income tax rate represents an investment of £211 million per annum.  Can anybody seriously complain about this excellent change?  This is followed up by an increase of £250 in the personal allowance for a single person, or £500 for a couple.  This measure involves the allocation of £125 million each year and represents a major relief in terms of PAYE income tax liabilities. The measure is further complemented by the increase in weekly PRSI allowance by £20 at an annual cost of £38 million.  This progress is further reinforced by a widening of the standard bands at a cost of £15 million.</P>
    <P>This interlinked range of measures by the Minister represents the greatest ever meaningful gesture by a Government towards the hard pressed PAYE sector.  Their plight has been addressed at practically every level with a commitment to further radical improvements in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also ensured that the incentive to invest in the economy is further increased by a number of steps.  I would like to highlight the certain benefits of his decision to reduce the standard rate of corporation tax by 4 per cent.  To survive and grow in an increasingly competitive international climate, business enterprise needs every possible level of practical relief.  In particular, reinvestment levels need to be substantially increased in areas such as research and development, product development and marketing.  This substantial reduction in the rate of corporation tax will mean that profits achieved in good times can be invested to a greater degree in a company's consolidation and growth.  The major investment of £4 million per annum in reducing the top income tax rate by 2 per cent will add to the level of capital available for investment in a variety of job creation enterprises.</P>
    <P>I warmly congratulate the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who has skilfully built on the achievements of his predecessors since 1987, each of whom made a major contribution to the current state of the economy.  The Minister has shown a tremendous sense of awareness of the need to combine compassion with prudence for the long-term benefit of all in society.  His excellent start in the key ministry of Finance augurs well for the future growth and development of the to the benefit of all our citizens.</P>

      <P>The budget provides further impetus for great changes already under way in the role of my Department which affect the operation of many constituent elements of the criminal justice system and the equality infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the cases of the courts service and prisons authority, new Statutes will outline the accountability structure.  The position in regard to Garda legislation will be reviewed in the light of accountability changes which emerge in the implementation phase of the SMI review.  In all <Col N="56" /> cases, a key principle will be the devolution of authority, responsibility and accountability to the lowest appropriate level possible while maintaining the essential controls which, in a democratic society, must rest with the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>Within the context of this unprecedented organisational change a number of concrete developments have already taken place and I will outline these briefly.  The Courts Service Bill is before the Seanad and will be debated in this House early in the new year.  I recently announced that I will appoint an interim board to prepare for the early establishment of the prisons authority and will announce its membership in the next few weeks.  The report of the Steering Group on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Garda Síochána was published in November.  A major review of the probation and welfare service as to its future role, needs and appropriate management structure has been commenced by an expert group.  A major investment programme in computerised management systems in the Garda, prisons, courts, probation and welfare service and other agencies is under way.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Bill, providing for the establishment of the equality authority and the director of equality investigations, is before the House.  I announced last month that it is intended to establish the national disability authority. An establishment group will prepare detailed proposals for setting up the authority for submission to Government within six months.</P>
    <P>A sum of £4.168 million has been set aside in this year's revised Estimate at subhead G of Vote 19 for the refugee determination process.  I expect we will see a noticeable improvement in processing of asylum claims with the introduction of new procedures and the recruitment of additional staff.  Provision is included in this amount for the establishment of a scheme of legal assistance to assist asylum seekers in the processing of their claims for refugee status.  In addition, work has commenced on the provision of new premises at a cost of £2.5 million for staff processing asylum claims.  The new building will act as a one stop shop for asylum seekers and will house not only the staff involved with the asylum determination process, but also the refugee unit of the Eastern Health Board, the UNHCR and the proposed legal assistance office.</P>
    <P>My Department has made a great deal of progress on a wide range of equality issues since the merging of the Department of Justice and the Department of Equality and Law Reform in July. The publication of the Employment Equality Bill last week, reactivates the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, which fell, following the Supreme Courts' judgment of last May that aspects of it were repugnant to the Constitution.  It represents the most important legislative development in combating discrimination in the workforce for 20 years.  For the first time in Irish legislation, the Bill contains specific provisions to outlaw sexual harassment in the workplace and in the course <Col N="57" /> of employment whether by an employer, a fellow employee or by clients, customers or business contacts.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the realisation of equality across society.  In this context, I intend to establish a new infrastructure for equality.  Statutory provision has been made for this initiative in the Employment Equality Bill, 1997.  The Estimate for the employment equality agency has been increased to £2.1 million in 1998. Moreover, the Government is concerned to ensure the fruits of the economic prosperity the country is experiencing are prudently availed of to foster a truly caring society where the needs of all who are vulnerable are paramount.  It has made considerable provisions for improving the lives of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the seemingly widespread belief that people with disabilities are largely ignored, substantial funding has been provided across Government Departments, State boards and voluntary organisations.  Between the Estimates for 1998 and budget provisions, £24.4 million extra is being provided in 1998 by the Minister for Health and Children.  He has provided £7 million revenue and £5.25 million capital for the development of services for the mentally handicapped in 1998 with £3 million capital and £3 million revenue for the development of physical and sensory disability services in 1998.  A sum of £6.15 million is already provided in the Department for these services in 1998.</P>
    <P>Since the Government took office in June, a further £10 million has been invested in services to persons with physical and sensory disabilities. This includes £4.325 million made available in October by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs for the purchase of aids and equipment for people with disabilities.  A further £5 million has been provided by the Department of Health and Children for physical and sensory disability services.  This will be used to help agencies providing services in the sector to eliminate accumulated deficits, for the purchase of essential equipment and for other urgent once off expenditure by non Government agencies and health boards.  In addition, capital grants totalling £675,000 were given for the purpose of increasing the number of respite and residential places for people with severe physical disabilities. l was successful in getting the 1998 Estimate allocations for disability in my Department increased by more than 50 per cent to a total of £875,000.  I provided £700,000 in the Estimate to fund the work of the Irish Council of People with Disabilities in 1998, which is more than double the 1997 Estimate provision of £300,000.  I provided £160,000 in the Estimate to ensure that there is no reduction in momentum in the operation of the pilot community development projects for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his budget provisions, allocated £2.615 million to my Department for equal opportunity child care measures to facilitate the work of the expert working group <Col N="58" /> on child care, established under Partnership 2000. Funding for equal opportunity child care measures in 1995 and 1996 was £800,000.  The allocation of £2.615 million in 1998 represents an increase of more than 200 per cent and is an indication of the Government's intention to actively facilitate the development of a child care infrastructure in Ireland as an equal opportunity measure.  A sum of £200,000 is provided for the National Women's Council in the Department's Estimate for 1998, which represents an increase on the allocation of £170,000 for 1997.</P>
    <P>A further signal of the Government's commitment to equality is the action for equality awards scheme.  The purpose of the scheme is to give recognition to good equality practices in society and while details of the 1998 scheme are not yet finalised, £40,000 has been allocated in the 1998 Estimate.</P>
    <P>Family law cases account for approximately 90 per cent of cases dealt with by the Legal Aid Board.  Legislation on domestic violence and divorce, which came into effect during 1996 and 1997, has resulted in much increased demand on the services of the board.  To assist it in meeting the ever increasing demands on its services I increased its 1998 allocation to £9.495 million, which represents a 14 per cent increase on the 1997 allocation of £8.319 million at a time when expenditure on other services is being restrained to very modest growth.</P>
    <P>I turn to the very important area of crime and the measures being taken to tackle the various aspects of crime affecting society. The provision for the Garda Síochána Vote for 1998 is £482.407 million, an increase of £25.5 million on the 1997 allocation. This includes extra funding to cover the cost of the recruitment of additional gardaí as part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to increase Garda numbers and bring the strength of the force to 12,000 over a period of years. Allowing for natural wastage this will require the recruitment of an estimated 2,200 gardaí.  The first intake of these additional recruits will commence early next year.  The recent report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána includes a significant number of recommendations as well as a comprehensive programme for their implementation.  It represents a far reaching assessment of how the force should be managed and will lead to very significant changes.  The Government has approved in principle most of the recommendations and has established the mechanism for their implementation in the coming years.  One of the most significant recommendations was the proposal for carrying out of a &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; review of the force to determine the optimum number, structure and deployment of the Garda and the mix between gardaí and civilians.</P>
    <P>Provision of £12.82 million has been made for expenditure next year on Garda computer projects such as the PULSE project.  When this system is in place gardaí will have access to a centralised <Col N="59" /> and integrated information base which will produce information in a timely and effective manner to facilitate the investigation of crime.</P>
    <P>Almost £15 million is provided in the Garda Vote next year towards the cost of developing Garda IT systems.  Most of this money will be spent on the current phase of the Garda IT strategy, the PULSE project.  The total cost of the project, which will be completed over the next three years, will be in excess of £36 million.  Almost all aspects of Garda operations will be affected by this far reaching project.</P>
    <P>Of the £2.712 million capital allocation provided in the Garda Vote for the purchase of communications equipment next year, approximately £1.2 million has been provided for the completion of a new voice and data network to serve the Dublin metropolitan area.  Service to the public will be greatly improved as a result of this investment.  For example it will be possible to be put through to any Dublin station simply by ringing one centralised number.</P>
    <P>The new witness security programme is part of the Government's commitment to tackling organised crime and will be put in place in situations where, as a result of evidence given in court, a threat to the safety of a witness is perceived to exist.  I have made provision of £250,000 for it in the Garda Vote in 1998.</P>
    <P>Funding for the Irish Association for Victim Support has increased to £645,000 for 1998, an increase of £365,000 on last year.  I am hosting a conference on victims of crime which concludes today in Dublin Castle.  In the new year I propose to develop a new charter for victims of crime which will reflect the Government's commitment in this area.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau has proven, in the short time it has been in place, to be an effective weapon in denying drug dealers and organised criminals the benefits of their ill-gotten gains and has seriously disrupted the activities of criminal gangs.  For 1998, £3.8 million has been allocated to facilitate the very important work of the Criminal Assets Bureau and ensure its continued effective operation.</P>
    <P>From 1 January 1997 to 24 October last, the Criminal Assets Bureau obtained 20 interim orders for assets in excess of £2 million and 12 interlocutory orders for assets in excess of £1.3 million.  Revenue officers of the Criminal Assets Bureau have investigated, assessed and made demands for payment of income tax, with interest, on persons suspected of criminal activity, to the value of £8.2 million.  The bureau has also assessed social welfare overpayments of £0.15 million.  I pay tribute to the Criminal Assets Bureau for its excellent work and also to the Garda for their perseverance and commitment to the fight against drugs, organised crime and crime generally.</P>
    <P>Next year more than £9 million is to be allocated to the Garda building programme.  The other side of the Government's response to crime <Col N="60" /> is providing adequate prison accommodation. The Government's prison building programme will have a major impact on the level of available prison places in the State &mdash; a 45 per cent increase in the first two years and an overall increase in capacity of over 80 per cent in five years.  At a time of major development of our courts system, the Government has increased the allocation for the Courts Vote from £30,475 million in 1997 to just over £40 million in 1998.  This represents a substantial increase of 31 per cent over last year's allocation.</P>
    <P>The Government is providing over £16.5 million in the Estimates for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds this year which will maintain the considerable progress already made by the Registrar of Titles in modernising this essential service.  It is expected that the final phase of the decentralisation of the Land Registry to Waterford will be completed in April of next year and at that stage a total of 140 member of staff will be decentralised there.</P>
    <P>The provision of over £12.8 million for works on courthouses will enable a number of projects to be completed.  These include Tallaght, Abbeyfeale, Cork Circuit Court &mdash; Phase 1, Ennis &mdash; Phase 1, Waterford, Portlaoise, Listowel, Roscrea, Castlerea, Templemore and Rathdowney. Work will commence on the refurbishment of Trim, Carlow &mdash; Phase 2, Ennis &mdash; Phase 2, and Mallow courthouses next year and I will approve further projects at other court venues in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Plans for the registries include development of a new integrated title registration computer system and ongoing support of existing technology in both the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.  Proposals for a change in the status of the registries are at the final stages of examination and I expect to bring proposals to Government in this regard early in the new year.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the budget debate.  While I welcome some aspects of the budget, as spokesperson for social, community and family affairs I am disappointed as many people have been let down.  For example, the Carers' Association anticipated major improvements for its members.  Is the Minister aware that just 50 extra carers will benefit from the changes announced in the budget?  The sum total allocated is about £1.5 million when they expected about £10 million.  The Carers' Association asks if the Government is out of touch with its work. The association which is ten years old today has claimed this is the worst budget ever for them.  It was led to believe at pre-budget meetings that there would be significant increases in the number of carers receiving the allowance, following the budget.  I would not consider an extra 50 as a significant number.  Recipients over 66 years of age will get an increase of £5 per week while those under 66 years of age will get an increase of £3 per week.  Will the Minister advise on the number of people over 66 who will benefit from the increase of £5 per week?</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision to allocate the free travel pass to carers.  To qualify for a carer's allowance one has to care for another person on a full-time basis.  Are carers being given a free travel pass they cannot use?  Does this mean the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is relaxing the full-time care and attention rule?</P>
      <P>The Minister stated he has changed the rules regarding UK disability pensions which will be disregarded in the carer's allowance means test. Is the Minister aware that 0.5 per cent of the total number of recipients will benefit?  Why did the Minister not do the decent thing and ease the means test to the benefit of a significant number of carers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Health and Children will deal with the issue of rates of pay for home <Col N="62" /> helps in a fairer manner.  It will be a disgrace if they do not receive a significant increase in a time of plenty.  The gap between the haves and the have nots has widened following the budget. Those who do tremendous work have been forgotten.</P>
    <P>Another group who will not benefit is disabled people.  The funding allocated will go nowhere near reducing the more than 3,000 on the waiting lists for residential and day care places.  The Minister said people with a disability and carers are receiving the recognition they deserve but the people concerned and the groups which represent them would not agree with this sentiment.</P>
    <P>Family income supplement is vital to families on low incomes.  While I welcome the Minister's decision to base the assessment on net rather than gross income, I cannot understand why families will have to wait until October 1998 to benefit from the changes announced in the budget.  I understood the reason for a December budget was that changes announced could be introduced by the beginning of the new tax year.  The families concerned cannot afford to wait and I ask the Minister to reconsider.</P>
    <P>The increase in child benefit amounts to £18 per year or less than 35p per week per child.  Is that the response of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to the cost of rearing children?  An increase of 35p per week is unacceptable.  The Government states it is developing family support services.  Child benefit is often the only source of income of the woman in the home.  Prior to the general election Fianna Fáil promised to introduce a payment for women in the home.  Is this what it had in mind?  Nearly one-third of children will spend Christmas in poverty.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase of £5 per week for pensioners. Not all pensioners, however, will receive this amount.  The spouse of a pensioner considered to be a dependant will receive an increase of £1.50 per week, giving a total increase of £6.50 or £3.25 each.</P>
    <P>The living alone allowance and the over 80 allowance have not been increased.  They should be increased in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>Non-contributory pensioners have been let down.  The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs takes interest on savings into account in the assessment of means.  If old age pensioners were earning the amounts the Department believes they are earning in interest they would have no need to apply for old age pension.</P>
    <P>The proposals announced in the budget will not lead to a reduction in the number of long-term unemployed.  The £3,000 tax free allowance for the long-term unemployed will be in conflict with existing schemes such as the back-to-work allowance and Jobstart.  The Minister said the new schemes will not be available concurrently with other employment incentive schemes.  This means that the long-term unemployed, in taking up employment, will be faced by competing rather than complementary State supports.  The new <Col N="63" /> scheme is unworkable in the form announced. The Minister should look at it again.</P>
    <P>The extra £5 granted to old age pensioners represents an increase of between 6.4 per cent and 7.4 per cent.  The extra £3 granted to everybody else represents an increase of between 4.2 per cent and 4.6 per cent.  A couple on long-term unemployment assistance with two children will receive an increase of 3.1 per cent.  Why have they been granted a lower increase?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider extending the free schemes to include women in receipt of widow's pension?  I am aware of many young widows who have to rear their families on a widows pension. It would not cost much money to include them. It could mean the difference between having or not having a telephone.  The extra electricity units and fuel vouchers would make things a little easier in times of need.  The free schemes should be available to all old age pensioners.  The restrictions are unacceptable in a time of plenty.</P>
    <P>Young people can no longer afford to buy their own houses.  In my home town of Killarney they find it virtually impossible to buy houses.  When I bought my house a mortgage of £30,000 was sufficient but nowadays that would not cover the deposit.  The average mortgage in Killarney is approximately £90,000.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should seriously look at this issue.  Young people are being driven towards local authority housing lists. Five or six years ago they would not have contemplated this.  As their incomes are too high they do not qualify for local authority housing and they cannot take out a mortgage as they cannot afford the repayments.  What are they to do?</P>
    <P>There are many old houses young people could buy cheaply and refurbish if there was a refurbishment grant.  Alternatively, the new house grant available to first time buyers should be increased.  We will fail in our duty if we do not help young couples for whom the first four of five years of marriage are the most difficult.  The position in the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, may not be as serious but in Killarney and south Kerry which depends on tourism, house prices are as high as those in Dublin. I have raised points affecting only the genuinely needy in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for sharing her time.</P>
      <P>The annual budget affords the Government an opportunity to take critical decisions in relation to how we, as a society, function economically and socially.  In recent years much emphasis has been placed on getting our economy right, in terms of creating the right conditions for growth, the generation of wealth and increasing employment opportunities.  We have been very successful in that regard, to the point at which our economy is now the envy of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having got our economy right, we need now to concentrate on getting our society right.  It is true <Col N="64" /> that, in spite of a booming economy, for many there has been no resultant &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor, the reasons for which are twofold.  First, many people have not been touched directly by the upswing in our economy and remain trapped in poverty.  In relative terms, this poverty has been compounded because of the increased affluence in other sectors.  Second, the rapid rate of economic growth over recent years &mdash; which has led to unbridled materialism in society &mdash; has left many people feeling decidedly uneasy with the way our country is going.  Most people are very uncomfortable with a society which encourages sectional interest and greed and have a basic sense of justice and fairness.  They do not want a society divided between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;.  As we observed from a recent opinion poll, most people recognise that this budget benefits the better off; there is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>This year, because of the healthy state of our national finances, the Government had an ideal opportunity to seriously tackle those divisions within our society.  It had the requisite funds to take the kinds of imaginative initiatives which would genuinely have afforded equality of opportunity to all citizens but, sadly, that opportunity was squandered.  Instead the Government availed of that opportunity to deepen the divisions within our society, to foment greed and materialism and further marginalise the poor and excluded.</P>
    <P>While the Government may talk the language of &ldquo;inclusiveness&rdquo;, its actions, by means of this budget, render those words fairly meaningless.  In addition to ignoring the poor and low-income earners, it has reneged on its commitment to social inclusion under Partnership 2000 and, in failing to honour those commitments, has seriously jeopardised the social partnership built up and maintained so carefully and critically over recent years.</P>
    <P>Most Members are in no doubt that our social welfare system is seriously outdated and full of anomalies.  For that reason it is no longer acceptable to continue to tinker with that system annually while we are well aware of the anomalies and many poverty traps within it.  Unfortunately, no attempt was made to move toward a basic income system in this budget, to which the Government paid lip service, indicating that it would produce a paper on the subject at some point in the future. However, in terms of the here and now it has done nothing to improve or streamline our social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The reason we need to move toward a basic income system is that a number of categories of people are seriously disadvantaged by the manner in which our social welfare system is operated. The whole principle of dependency underpinning our social welfare system, is totally and utterly unacceptable to women.  Because that dependency principle applies &mdash; and of course, the rates for dependants are so much lower than basic rates &mdash; women receive no recognition in their own right.  That is just not acceptable.  In the last general election I met many elderly women, <Col N="65" /> pensioners, who felt very aggrieved.  It was their belief that, having reared the Celtic tiger, they were entitled to recognition in their own right and to have their contribution to our very successful economy acknowledged.  For that reason, at the very least, provision should be made for individual payments, another very good argument for having a basic income system.</P>
    <P>In spite of the Government's pre-election promises &mdash; which, I suppose, in many ways, duped women in the home &mdash; it has not honoured them . Again, a basic income system would cater for women, rearing children, who have chosen to remain in the home.  Regardless of whether their husbands or spouses are working, or dependent on social welfare, the woman in the home is entitled to recognition of her contribution and, therefore, entitled to a basic income.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary regulation still prevails, that the means of young unemployed people are assessed on the basis of their parents' income and, because there is no facility for providing them with a basic income, whenever their parents' income exceeds the eligibility limit, they are deemed to be ineligible for any assistance.  In this way, we encourage them to leave the family home, indicating that all they have to do is leave it, when they will then receive full employment assistance with a rent allowance.  That allowance was introduced to meet emergency circumstances but it has now grown out of all proportion to the point at which it is costing the State vast sums of money.  Obviously, in those circumstances, the pro-family thing to do is provide those young people with unemployment assistance or, my preference, with a basic income while living at home so that they can continue to do so while seeking employment.</P>
    <P>Equally, the advantages of a basic income for young people under 18 years of age would enable many of them to remain within the educational system.  I have many constituents whose children cannot remain at school beyond the age of 12 or 13 simply because they cannot afford to allow them do so.  Nothing has been done in this budget to help teenagers of poorer families to remain in school, whose parents simply do not have adequate funds to purchase uniforms, school books or the many other demands made on them at second-level.</P>
    <P>Indeed those young people who struggle to remain in school, against all the odds, having obtained their leaving certificate and continue to study for their post-leaving certificate receive no assistance in spite of pre-election and other vague promises that something would be done in that respect.  Nothing is being done to provide some support for those participating in PLC courses. A basic income system would address many such problems also.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we agree the very purpose or <i>raison d'e tre</i> of our taxation system.  It must be viewed as an instrument for the redistribution of wealth, for generating the kinds of funds which will enable us provide good quality services for <Col N="66" /> all our citizens.  What is the point in having more income in our pockets if, whenever a child becomes ill, we encounter long hospital waiting lists, insufficient numbers of doctors available in casualty departments, or our elderly parents cannot gain access to residential care?  That is not what society is about.  Therefore, we must examine what it is we are endeavouring to achieve through our taxation system.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately there has been no major tax reforming action taken in this budget.  Here I might revert to election promises, to attempts made at that time by the Government parties to encourage greed among young people, to sell the simple message of reduction in the top rate of income tax, in an effort to persuade people to vote for them on the basis that they would be better off themselves.</P>
    <P>We must remember that life is a lot more than just about having more money in one's pocket; it is about providing a decent society that can accommodate all of its people's needs.  Clearly the approach taken by this Government favours the better-off whereas our taxation system should be seen as a means of creating a cohesive, fairer society.  Unfortunately, the Government has taken a regressive approach to our whole tax system. Nobody likes to pay tax but in order for our tax system to gain acceptance among the general public, it must be seen to apply fairly to everyone and all sectors.  Everyone must be seen to pay his fair share of tax, but that will not be the case as a result of this budget.  Regrettably, the reduction in corporation tax moves the burden of tax towards the PAYE sector.  That is grossly unfair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the question of the illegal blockade of Irish goods at British ports with the British Foreign Secretary when I met with him in Brussels on Monday, 8 December.  I expressed the Government's deep concern over the serious impact of the blockade on Ireland's agricultural exports to Britain and the Continent.  I pointed out that the Irish farming community was experiencing considerable difficulties and pressures on their incomes and could ill afford the additional problems being visited on them by a dispute which has nothing to do with Ireland.  The Foreign Secretary indicated that the British Government was also very concerned about the matter and was anxious to ensure that the transport routes were kept <Col N="67" /> open.  This was very much in keeping with the response received by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food in discussions they had with their respective British counterparts.</P>
      <P>The Irish Embassy in London has been in constant close contact with the British Government and police authorities from the outset.  I understand from reports the Embassy received in recent days that the situation at the ports has eased since Monday and, while small numbers of protesters remain at Holyhead and Fishguard, all Irish trucks have been getting through to their destinations.</P>
      <P>I welcome in particular the action taken by the police in Liverpool on Tuesday night to ensure free passage to Irish trucks despite the presence of a large protest.  I welcome also the fact that the British farmers' unions are pursuing their grievances by dialogue with the British Government and I hope these discussions will lead to an early and lasting return to normality which will allow our trade with Britain and the rest of the Single Market to continue unimpeded.</P>
      <P>The threat to the integrity of the Single Market from illegal actions taken by individuals in furtherance of disputes is a matter which the Government takes most seriously, and we are prepared to take all necessary action to defend our interests in this regard, including, if necessary, legal action at EU level.  In this connection the House will wish to be aware that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment wrote formally to the Internal Market Commissioner, Professor Mario Monti, on 3 December, drawing attention to the negative impact which the British farmers' protest was having on the functioning of the Internal Market, and calling on the Commission to take all possible steps to insist that the core rules of the Internal Market are respected by all member states.  The Government will carefully monitor the action taken by the Commission in response to this complaint. I am confident the Commission will take effective action to protect the working of the Single Market, and that it will not prove necessary for the Irish Government to initiate its own legal proceedings in the European Court of Justice. However, I wish to make it clear that in a matter of such importance to Ireland's vital interests, the Government would not wish to rule out any option at this stage.</P>
      <P>The House will also wish to know that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has written to Commissioner Fischler about this matter and that at Minister Walsh's request, the matter will be discussed at next week's meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  I can also tell the House that my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, will raise the disruption caused by the British farmers' action at today's meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers with a view to the adoption of measures to prevent future similar disruptive action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the Irish economy is the sixth biggest market for British goods, taking more than Japan and South America together, totalling £8 billion in the year 1996, that trade disruption of this kind does not benefit either side, and that far from this being a question of people having access to the Queen's highway, it is a matter of people having access to the European Single Market where we have a right to sell our goods?  Will the Minister ensure that rather than talking about legal proceedings which will take a very long time, there is an early warning system in place in his Department which will allow him apply pressure at the appropriate level when this sort of problem arises again?  We are very vulnerable as an island economy.  We have had problems in France.  They have seen in Britain how France got away with treating Irish and other exporters and they are following suit. Political action must be taken to ensure that other countries do not see this as a precedent to be followed, and that can only happen if the political response from us and our colleagues is strong enough to ensure that the countries behaving in this way learn a lesson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the views expressed by the Deputy.  It is quite appropriate in the circumstances that, in the case of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the Minister in particular, every reasonable and known diplomatic channel be used in the context of bringing this serious episode to a conclusion to the benefit of those people who are most seriously affected by it, namely, the Irish truckers carrying meat either to Britain or, by way of access across Britain, to the European mainland.</P>
      <P>As far as an early warning system is concerned, I accept there should be in place a process whereby matters of this nature can be anticipated by being in close contact with, for example, the farming organisations.  I would like to think that out of this terrible situation an early warning system will be put in place as a matter of <i>pro forma</i> and that it will not happen again.</P>
      <P>Much was done by the Irish Government to bring the episode to a conclusion.  The Ambassador in Britain raised the matter as did the Taoiseach in a telephone conversation with the British Prime Minister.  I raised it with the British Foreign Secretary on 8 December.  The Minister for Public Enterprise intends to raise the matter at the Transport Council today.  At his meeting with Prime Minister Juncker on 8 December, the Taoiseach indicated that he wishes to raise the matter at the European Council if it is not resolved by the time of its next meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note also that on 9 December, the European Court of Justice issued a judgment in favour of the Commission, supported by the Spanish and British Governments, by finding that the French Government had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 30 of the EC Treaty in not preventing private individuals blocking the free movement of fruit and vegetables <Col N="69" /> from Spain in August 1995.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, will write immediately to Commissioner Monti to bring this judgment to his attention.</P>

First, has he raised with his counterpart the proposals of the British Government to compensate Irish exporters for loss of income?  Second, will the Minister confirm, irrespective of whether the matter is resolved or is raised at the European Council meeting, that he and the Taoiseach will raise it bilaterally with Prime Minister Blair and the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Cook, at the European Council meeting this weekend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that as a result of the action taken by the various Ministers and Government agencies this matter may have resolved itself by the weekend.  In deference to the Deputy, if that is what he wishes and requires, I will address the issue again with my colleague, the British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook.  The Taoiseach indicated that if the matter is not resolved he has sought the permission of the Grand Council Presidency to raise the matter over the next day or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is much work to be done if we are to meet the May 1998 deadline for agreement in the multi-party negotiations, there has been very substantial progress since the negotiations resumed in September.  The participants have set out their views on all items of the comprehensive agenda, across the three strands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is now required is a tighter focus on the core substance of the negotiations and I am encouraged by the recognition of this among all the participants.  In particular, the review plenary agreed last week to establish a restricted subgroup to identify key issues and determine the best way to structure consideration of those issues.  I am hopeful that agreement on these matters will be reached at the review plenary on its resumption next week.  This will enable us to move into a still more intensive phase directly after Christmas and make it possible to proceed <Col N="70" /> from analysis into direct negotiation on the broad lines of an agreement.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the continuing excellent work of Senator Mitchell and his colleagues.  Their judgment and skill as chairmen are proving to be invaluable.</P>
    <P>The Government also has valuable ongoing bilateral contacts with all of the parties involved in the negotiations.  Most recently, the Taoiseach had useful and constructive meetings during his visit to the talks on Monday.  We will be maintaining the closest contact with all the participants.</P>
    <P>We are very much focused on the May deadline and there is no reason it should not be met. Indeed, I believe that participants would prefer to move even more speedily, if that were possible. Of course, if some additional time were required to complete negotiations which were going well, I am sure there would be general agreement to this, but I hope and expect that will not be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the process well over the coming months because we are entering a key phase of negotiations when, as the Minister rightly said, people will have to focus on the core substantive issues.  I want to get clarification from the Minister on certain events that have taken place since the last time we had questions to the Minister.  In particular, around that last time there was an incident where the Minister apologised to the Unionist Party for his remarks in relation to Articles 2 and 3.  May I take it that the Minister again admits that remarks he made about cross-Border bodies were misjudged and inappropriate?  Is it not necessary that he should be somewhat more careful in interviews as he after two relatively substantive interviews had to apologise to those across the table from him?</P>

      <P>As I indicated before, there have been many difficulties in these talks and there will be many more in the future.

In relation to my remarks in the past, we should look to the present and to the future.  We should draw a curtain on what was said in the past because I do not believe it serves any useful purpose referring to it.  I do not believe it progresses the talks or the peace process any further. Raising those remarks again does not advantage or advance the current very healthy state of the talks process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I must differ with the Minister who is a long standing colleague and a man for whom <Col N="71" /> I have enormous respect.  The reality of being Minister for Foreign Affairs is that one is accountable to this House.  Whereas the Minister has enjoyed the freedom of giving interviews any time he wished, ultimately he is responsible to this House and he must account for his actions and the conduct of his office to this House.  The Minister gave two interviews and on both occasions he ended up &mdash; I do not want to misquote him &mdash; saying, &ldquo;I wish I could unsay the interview&rdquo;.  Is that a way to conduct foreign affairs diplomacy?  I would be perhaps the last person in this House to underestimate the difficulties involved and why three days a week are required in Stormont buildings.  I, too, compliment Senator Mitchell and his colleagues for the enormous work, resilience and patience they have shown, but I ask the Minister to be more careful in the remarks he makes about Northern Ireland because whatever possibilities we have of overcoming the enormous difficulties they will not be overcome if on a monthly basis we have to have the Leader of the Irish Government's delegation apologising to others across the table.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has used the word &ldquo;apology&rdquo; with great abandon and I do not believe it reflects accurately the situation.  I set out in my reply today the position of the Government. Last week I made whatever clarifications were necessary arising from my BBC interview and I was happy to do that because Governments have a particular responsibility to clarify, reach out and move quickly to calm any problem that arises.  All of us in the past faced similar difficulties. That is accepted on all sides.  We must now move on.  We can all drop the ball from time to time, as the Deputy will appreciate.  In the circumstances even people who transgress from time to time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, the Taoiseach did not have to intervene between the Monday and the Tuesday. The talks went into a mode that I believe will be successful for the future of what I believe will be an historic judgment and outcome.  In relation to my dealings with the Unionists, I met Mr. Trimble on his own on one occasion.  I then met Mr. Trimble with his party, including Mr. Maginnis, Mr. Taylor and others, with my officials and my very able Minister of State.  Subsequent to that the Taoiseach met with Mr. Trimble and his party in London and subsequent to that again the Taoiseach met with Mr. Trimble and his party in the Stormont buildings the other day.  There is no problem with that.  It seems extraordinary that the storm on the Monday was probably necessary in a way because we are now into a situation from which I believe will emerge an historic judgment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Government in regard to the outcome we wish to see emerge from strand two of the multi-party negotiations, as part of an overall settlement, is based on the framework document.  There should be a North-South body which would provide a focus for practical joint action at island level, for which there is ample scope, and which would also provide the necessary institutional expression of the Irish identity of Northern nationalists.  The creation of a North-South body is essential if nationalists are to feel able to give their support to an overall agreement.  Equally, there would have to be unionist agreement to such a body and to its functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers and structures of a North-South body are matters for negotiation, as is every other issue in the talks.  An indicative list of possible functions for the body is set out in the framework document, paragraphs 31 to 33, but again this is obviously for negotiation.  We have made clear our view that the body must, in certain agreed areas, have meaningful powers to make decisions <Col N="73" /> and to have them implemented.  In addition, it should operate exclusively by agreement between representatives of North and South and should be politically accountable in both jurisdictions.  We would see it as having the capacity to develop over time, by agreement, in line with the further evolution of the relationship between the two parts of the island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the use of terms such as &ldquo;powers not unlike a government&rdquo; is sending confused signals to those who are participating in the northern talks as is the fact that his colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, unilaterally changed the symbol for tourism in the Republic to replace the joint symbol which existed for North and South?  Does he agree that Ministers in general, at this stage in the negotiations, should really hold their breath and give the process an opportunity to run its course?  It seems to me that discussions are at a delicate stage and that the sort of outpourings from Ministers outside the process are anything but helpful.</P>
      <P>What role does the Minister envisage for the party leaders' and Ministers' group in progressing the peace process?  How will they go about their work, when will they complete it, will they report to a plenary group and what machinery will be in place for those meetings?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The machinery, which is complex, is well set out.  It involves deep negotiation between all the parties involved and entails a commitment on my part and that of the Minister of State to be in Belfast two or three days a week. From time to time it entails meetings with the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Next Monday and Tuesday, an interim report will be published on the position of the peace process.  I would like to think that when that becomes available in the public domain, the Deputy and other Members will appreciate the ongoing work which will continue within the talks process.</P>

What view does the Minister take of the reported views of the Unionist leader, Mr. Trimble, on the whole question of a Flanders-Netherlands type relationship between the northern minority and the Republic?  What is the Minister's view on that proposal and is it on the agenda for discussion at the party leaders' and Ministers' meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not but it would be open to Mr. Trimble to bring that proposal to the negotiations if he had a desire to do so.  I have no doubt the Deputy has special knowledge of this proposal.  If it is to emerge, it will emerge for negotiation within the talks process.  I cannot anticipate that form of proposal until it appears within the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions at the European Council in Luxembourg on the 12 and 13 December are expected to focus on two central topics, Agenda 2000, especially the issue of future enlargement, and preparation for the third stage of EMU.</P>
      <P>As regards future enlargement, and with a view to enabling the actual opening of negotiations as soon as possible next year, the European Council will have the task of taking the necessary decisions on the management of the overall enlargement process, including practical arrangements for the initial phase of negotiations and the reinforcement of the European Union's pre-accession strategy as well as other possible means to strengthen co-operation between the EU and all applicant countries.</P>
      <P>There is also likely to be some discussion of the non-enlargement aspects of Agenda 2000, notably the development of EU policies and the question of the future financial framework. However, the outcome of the European Council on these issues is expected to be procedural rather than substantive.  The Commission may be mandated to complete various elements of the dossier in 1998.</P>
      <P>The other core item for this weekend's European Council summit concerns preparations for Stage 3 of EMU, in particular, arrangements for enhanced economic co-ordination.  In addition, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will consider certain foreign policy issues over dinner on Friday night.  I may report on my meetings with various prominent politicians in Algeria over the past few days.</P>
      <P>A meeting between the members of the European Council and heads of Government and foreign Ministers of the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe and of Cyprus, at which the Presidency will present the outcome of the European Council, is also planned for Saturday. A similar presentation by the Presidency to the Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the outcome of the European Council is also planned for Saturday evening.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that 1 January 1999 remains the date for the irrevocable locking of exchange rates in the third stage of EMU, that this will go ahead on schedule and that all the necessary preparations are in place <Col N="75" /> across the EU for that?  The Minister mentioned Agenda 2000.  Does he share my concern in relation to the comments of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding the idea of subdividing the country for future EU funding purposes?  I would be particularly concerned that the Dublin region would not lose out as a result of any proposed subdivisions.  Will the Minister avail of the European Council meeting to discuss the issue with other foreign Ministers to ensure that if there is any proposal to subdivide Ireland for regional funding or other structural and cohesion funding it will be strongly resisted?  The Dublin region must continue to get its fair share of funds as much infrastructural renewal needs to be done, particularly in the inner city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The third stage of EMU will come into effect on 1 January 1999.  This means that the exchange rates of currencies of the participating member states will be locked.  The new currency will be called the euro.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the issue of structural, cohesion and Objective 1 status funds.  I want to make it clear that this Government will be very vigilant in relation to retaining these.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Wulf-Mathies recently commented on transitional arrangements, particularly on reduced receipts for structural funds for Ireland.  In its Agenda 2000 proposal, the European Commission recognises that transitional arrangements will be necessary for regions such as Ireland which will have passed the 75 per cent threshold for eligibility for Objective 1 status.  Such transitional arrangements are necessary in order that Ireland's recent economic progress, in which structural funds have played a significant part, is not put at risk by any abrupt scaling back of structural funds.  The Government will insist that transitional arrangements are adequate in content and duration to continue to meet our infrastructural needs, investment and human resource requirements and to tackle regional underdevelopment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government submitted its views on how best to proceed with the enlargement process?  Practical arrangements must be put in place for the opening negotiations and the accession arrangements.  Has the Government expressed a preference yet about the number of countries to be included in the first tranche of enlargement and what countries should join subsequently or has it been left to other countries to make the running on this issue?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify how he envisages the negotiations for the accession of Cyprus being conducted?  Is there a likely prospect of a united team from the island, representing both the Cypriot and the Turkish communities, or has that been agreed yet by the Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has taken a view on the process of enlargement.  There are two tranches of countries seeking accession, five countries plus <Col N="76" /> Cyprus and a second group of five plus, possibly, Turkey.  Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Cyprus were given a positive opinion in relation to their eligibility for membership of the EU and arrangements will be made to include them in the greater European Union over the next four to six years.  The second tranche consists of Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and, possibly, Turkey.  I use the word &ldquo;possibly&rdquo; advisedly because the Deputy is aware of the problems in relation to Turkey.  There will be a European conference which will encapsulate discussions on a basis which will be inclusive of these countries.</P>
      <P>The accession of Cyprus is a fundamentally important question.  Cyprus applied for membership of the European Union in 1990.  In March 1995, the EU Council of Ministers decided that accession negotiations with Cyprus would commence six months after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, taking its results into account.  It is anticipated that the forthcoming European Council at Luxembourg will reconfirm this commitment.  Accession negotiations with the Government of Cyprus, which is the sole Government of Cyprus recognised by the UN and the international community, are expected to open in April 1998.</P>
      <P>Ireland, along with other EU members, would also wish to see representatives of the Turkish Cypriot community participate in the accession negotiations, particularly in view of the clear benefits accession would bring to that community. We hope the parties involved can, and with the necessary political will they will, agree on a formula to allow such representation. However, such a formula cannot extend to a recognition of the so called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.  The European Union and the wider international community wish to see an agreed political solution and a united Cyprus within the bi-zonal, bi-communal federal state approach proposed by the United Nations.  We will continue to lend encouragement and support to the efforts of the UN to achieve this objective within the direct talks process which it has convened between the two leaders.</P>
      <P>We hope to see a resumption of the UN direct talks process as envisaged by the UN early in 1998.</P>

      <P>Given the likelihood that the European Union will be taking in countries which will need major support to reach European standards of living, does the Minister agree that the European Union budget as proposed under Agenda 2000 is grossly inadequate?

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the Commission can review its recommendations about the countries to be negotiated with in advance of others based on the performance of the applicant states?  If the position in Slovakia, for example, were to improve with regard to the democratisation process, Slovakia could be admitted and the same could apply to other applicant states.  If the economic ability of applicant states to take on the <i>acquis</i> were to improve, does the Minister agree that the Commission could make further reports which could change the current line up of applicant states?</P>
      <P>I was a noted critic of the Department of Justice for many years, particularly when I was Opposition spokesman on justice.  Does the Minister agree that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform did exceptionally well during the Irish Presidency?  Does he further agree that the Dublin II European Council meeting made substantial progress in the area of tackling crime on a European basis and will he seek to ensure that the Luxembourg European Council meeting maintains that momentum?  The Dublin II meeting set up a group, set it tasks and gave it a tight reporting date.  That approach and momentum, for which great credit is due to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, needs to be maintained.  Will the Minister push that point strongly at the European Council meeting this weekend?</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy was referring to including countries from the second tranche in the event of their economies improving.  The Commission would take note of any improvements, whether they be in the economic or democratic context, and would include such countries in the process if they measured up to the positive opinion which was given to the first tranche of five countries plus Cyprus.</P>

      <P>The General Affairs Council has not expressed a view on the general question of immigration, although it may consider specific matters arising in this area within the context of its overall responsibility for the external relations of the Union.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, substantive responsibility for co-operation within the Union in the fields of justice and home affairs, including the area of immigration policy, rests with Council meeting within its Justice and Home Affairs formation and, therefore, comes within the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The General Affairs Council has a supervisory role and the Minister for Foreign Affairs accompanies the Taoiseach to European Council meetings.  These issues are growing in importance given the possibility for racial tension here and the example of such tension in other EU member states, some of which has resulted in the loss of life.  A huge number of emigrants from Ireland live abroad; about 800,000 people of Irish birth live in the UK.  Eleven and a half per cent of the population of greater London are of Irish birth or are children of those born here.  The Irish are the largest group of immigrants in Britain.  This example occurs throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Given that so many Irish people live abroad, we should take particular interest in the issue of immigrants.  We should take the lead to ensure there is a constructive, balanced and fair approach to housing, social services, community relations and the right of residence.  A comprehensive approach needs to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the General Affairs Council has a supervisory role.  Title six of the Treaty on European Union provides a framework for co-operation within the Union in the fields of justice and home affairs, including immigration policy and policy regarding nationals of third countries.  The General Affairs Council retains overall responsibility for the external relations of the Union and in this context can discuss pertinent political or humanitarian aspects where large numbers of people are fleeing a country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, substantive responsibility for immigration falls within the remit of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs.  A discussion took place at the General Affairs Council meeting on 8 December last when Ministers exchanged views on political aspects of the influx of immigrants from Northern Iraq, taking account of the debate at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 4 December.  The Council mandated COREPER to <Col N="79" /> consider the matter and Ministers agreed to take it up at a future meeting with a view to debating the underlying causes of the influx of refugees.</P>
    <P>Also at the meeting on 8 December, Ministers had an informal and inclusive discussion over lunch about the requirement of Bulgarian and Romanian nationals to secure visas for entry to the EU.  Similar aspects have been discussed in the cases of former Yugoslavia and Albania.  This is not an exhaustive list of discussions which may have taken place over the years at the General Affairs Council.  An annual report on achievements in the field of justice and home affairs is submitted to the General Affairs Council and then to the European Council.</P>

      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty allows for the transfer of certain immigration and visa issues from the third to the first pillar.  The treaty has not been ratified and will not be put to referendum and in other cases, parliamentary approval, until the first half of next year.  Will the Minister ask his colleagues on the General Affairs Council or the appropriate council to consider an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement where the Commission will be asked to act on immigration as if the Amsterdam Treaty was passed and to start preparing comprehensive Europe wide policy issues of a compassionate, balanced and fair nature?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 20 together.  Under Article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, all states parties are required to present periodic reports to the UN Human Rights Committee. These reports are intended to set out details of the protection afforded under domestic law of the rights guaranteed in the covenant, and also to show how its provisions are being implemented.  The Department of Foreign Affairs co-ordinates the preparation of Ireland's reports under this covenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> Our first national report was completed and published in October 1992 and then presented to the Human Rights Committee in Geneva.  It was considered by that committee in July 1993.  Arising out of this examination, the committee compiled its general comments on our report which were published on 3 August 1993.  It referred firstly to the high quality of the report itself and expressed its satisfaction with the constructive fashion in which Ireland had approached its dialogue with the committee.</P>
    <P>It then elaborated on the positive aspects of the report and commended certain specific legislative and administrative developments.  A number of concerns about lreland's implementation of some provisions of the covenant were also addressed, as is normal when such state-party reports are being examined.  These concerns were subsequently conveyed to the various implementing Government Departments as the responsibility for acting on these matters lies primarily with them.</P>
    <P>Ireland's second national report on this covenant was scheduled to be submitted in March 1996. However, there is a considerable backlog of reports facing the Human Rights Committee and this delay is not seen as critical by the UN.  The Department of Foreign Affairs, in conjunction with other Government Departments, is now finalising the draft of the report, which will contain information on the measures taken by implementing Departments to address those points of concern raised by the committee in its examination of the first report, as well as updated material on administrative, legislative and constitutional developments and policy initiatives undertaken since then.  It is envisaged that this report will be ready for submission in spring of next year.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that, in recognition of the important role played by the NGO community in matters relating to civil and political rights, a number of interested NGOs were invited to consider the draft of the second national report on a confidential basis.  The purpose of this consultation was to enable NGOs to convey their views on the draft itself and on how Ireland could achieve fuller implementation of the terms of the covenant.  This consultative process culminated in a meeting of NGO representatives and officials from a number of Government Departments on 28 October last which facilitated a most constructive exchange of views on the draft report and on the issues addressed in the covenant.  In the final version of the report which is now being prepared, my Department will seek to reflect the views of the NGO community as expressed through this process, including by means of a specific chapter in the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>First, will the Minister explain the 12 month delay in submitting the report?  It was due last March and now we have been told it will not be submitted until next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, while I welcome the involvement of NGOs who are constructive and have a good <Col N="81" /> relationship with the Department of Foreign Affairs, is there any prospect of the draft report being brought before the House?  The House should consider the report before it is submitted as we have rights as well as the NGOs.</P>
    <P>Third, the Minister said we will be informed when the report is submitted on action taken since the first report in October 1992.  Will the Minister inform us of progress made on the areas suggested by the UN?  Are there areas where we need to take further action?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the third part of the Deputy's question, the substantive part of the committee's comments in the first report refer to eight principal subjects of concern arising from the report.  These include the legal status of the convention under Irish law; the provisions of the Emergency Powers Act, 1976; the regulation of law enforcement officials; the adequacy of our legal aid schemes; the issue of imprisonment for non-payment of debts and imprisonment of juveniles; freedom of information legislation, including the availability of information on abortion; the provisions of section 31 of the Broadcasting Act; the absence of divorce legislation and the legal status of non-nationals.  These issues concern domestic policies and are within the remit of other Departments, particularly the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Many of these issues have been addressed by legislative and constitutional means over the past four years, specifically the ending of the national emergency on 16 February 1995, the constitutional referendum on abortion, information and divorce, and the rescinding of the ministerial order made under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act.  Further provisions are contained in the Government's legislative programme.  Others are being actively considered by the relevant Department.</P>
      <P>As to the delay in preparing the second report, it seems there is quite a backlog of reports waiting to be heard by the committee and that it is not viewed as critical that there is some delay in finalising our second report.  However, work is in hand in the Department in putting the final report together and it is due to be ready by the spring of 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Deputy's proposals for a debate on the draft report, I would be open to such a debate.  I agree that as well as including civil society and non-governmental organisations, it is important that Members of this House are acutely aware and kept informed at all times of the progress of our compliance with the details and articles of the covenant.  The main mechanism of compliance with the covenant is primarily by way of reports.  For that reason our drafting of and contribution to the report, and compliance with the articles of the covenant which are still outstanding, should properly be a subject for debate in this House.  I intend to have a wider debate on human rights generally in the context of a number of events which are planned by my Department <Col N="82" /> to highlight this year of human rights and the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  That might be the opportunity to debate the draft report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's openness in relation to having a full debate.  There are three areas where we are in difficulty in relation to the United Nations because we have not ratified human rights conventions.  Could the Minister outline to the House when the Government will be in a position to ratify the racial discrimination convention, the torture convention and protocol 7 to the European Convention which are very important issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not ratified the convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  In order for us to give effect to the convention it will be necessary to introduce domestic legislation.  In regard to the convention against torture and the convention on racial discrimination, work is in hand and it is hoped to introduce legislation early in the new year.  Once the legislation is in force we will move to ratify the convention.  Regarding the convention on racial discrimination and what the Government is doing to speed up the process of ratification, the advice of the Office of the Attorney General is that to give effect to this convention we will be required to enact an employment equality Bill and an equal status Bill.  It is the intention of the Government to ratify the convention once this domestic legislation has been approved by the Dáil.  The Department of Justice is working on the equal status Bill which it is hoped will be published in 1998.  I do not know whether we can guarantee that the measures necessary for ratification will be in place by 10 December 1998, the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but it is my genuine hope that we will reach that target and be in a position by the end of 1998 to ratify this important convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Protocol 7 was open for signature on 22 November 1984 and was signed by Ireland on that date.  The rights elaborated by the protocol are primarily the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, although my Department has an obligation to play a co-ordinating role.  The provisions of protocol 7 touch upon a number of complex issues currently before the Government.  While the matter has received preliminary consideration by the Government Departments concerned, much detailed work and consultation is required before we can establish the legal, constitutional and, possibly, legislative implications and take full account of the developments which have taken place in the areas concerned since our signature in 1984.  Those complex issues involve matters relating to the expulsion of lawfully resident aliens and equality as between spouses following <Col N="83" /> divorce on marital breakdown.  These are issues which fall outside the parameters of my own brief in the Department of Foreign Affairs but in which I have a co-ordinating and non-supervisory role.</P>

      <P>The perpetrators of the horrendous crime against Pan American flight 103, committed in December 1988, nine years ago, have not yet been brought to justice.  The investigation team identified two Libyan suspects, one of whom is a senior security official.  Libya refused to surrender these two suspects for trial.  The Security Council subsequently imposed sanctions in the form of an embargo on flights to Libya, which is binding on all UN members, including Ireland.</P>
      <P>As a compromise, Libya has offered to make the suspects available for trial under the Scottish legal system in a &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; country, that is other than in Scotland or the USA, or at the International Court of Justice, which is based in The Hague.  This compromise proposal raises a number of very complicated issues in the context of international law.  The option of trial at the International Court of Justice could, for example, involve significant changes to Scottish and Dutch law.</P>
      <P>Ireland continues to monitor the evolution of this case and, with our EU partners, is prepared to facilitate a resolution should the opportunity arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Our distinguished Foreign Minister is a senior counsel of long standing.  Surely he could express a view on the validity or otherwise <Col N="84" /> of the compromise offered.  Having looked over the years at the file the Minister is reading now, I believe there is some prospect of bringing the matter to a resolution on the basis of a compromise, notwithstanding the complexities of international law and the changes required in the international court and Scottish jurisprudence. Surely the Minister must be able to express a view on whether it is something we can support or has no validity and is not worth supporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that.  I want to place on record the absolute outrage felt by all the people of this country at the callous and indiscriminate bombing of Pan American flight 103. The US and Britain are determined, as we all are, that the perpetrators of this terrible crime will be brought to justice.  The trying of the Libyan suspects in a neutral country under the Scottish legal system involves very complicated issues of international law and the application of domestic law in an outside jurisdiction.  We are not in a position to know the ramifications that would flow from such a compromise which, in any case, has failed to win acceptance from the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>The most recent Western European Union ministerial meeting took place in Erfurt, Germany on 18 November.  Because of urgent business at the Northern Ireland talks at Stormont I was unable to attend the Erfurt meeting. In the circumstances, Ireland was represented, in accordance with our observer status, by our permanent representative to the Western European Union, Ambassador Eamonn Ryan.</P>
      <P>The main item of interest to Ireland at Erfurt was the decision taken by the Western European Union to facilitate participation by Ireland and the other non-aligned observers, Austria, Finland and Sweden, in planning and decision-taking for Petersberg tasks undertaken at the behest of the EU, in which they intend to make a contribution. This corresponds with the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty which in turn reflected the interests of Ireland and the other observers to have the opportunity, based on our long UN experience in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, to be in a position on a case by case basis to contribute to conflict prevention, crisis management and peacekeeping tasks conducted by the Western European Union at the behest of the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland and the other observers who are not members of military alliances welcomed this <Col N="85" /> decision as a demonstration of the willingness of the Western European Union to prepare itself to give effect to an EU common foreign and security policy and to facilitate the contribution Ireland and the other Western European Union observers can make to conflict prevention and peacekeeping based on our long UN experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Western European Union Petersberg tasks, including peacekeeping, peacemaking in some circumstances, environmental protection, co-operation on human rights issues etc., are similar to the tailored arrangements members of Partnership For Peace can have with NATO.  Given that the Western European Union is seen by the NATO members of the Union as the European wing of NATO, why is the Minister so enthusiastic about the Western European Union Petersberg tasks and so opposed to the Partnership For Peace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On Partnership For Peace, Ireland is a non-aligned country which is not connected to any military alliance.  The PFP is a backdoor to NATO.  Our peacekeeping record speaks for itself.  The Defence Forces have served the country well over the years in the name of international peace and our membership of organisations like the United Nations and the EU enable us to play the role we believe we should play in an international peacekeeping context.  The PFP is not a prerequisite of our foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister seriously expect Members to accept that the Partnership For Peace is a backdoor to NATO membership?  For example, does he believe Russia, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden or Finland, all of which have signed up for membership, will use the PFP as a backdoor to gain NATO membership?  Why has the Minister aligned our foreign policy with that of the strife torn country of Tajikistan and deliberately said we can somehow be involved in Western European Union type arrangements but the Partnership For Peace is absolutely out even though Russia, Switzerland and other neutral countries have signed up to it?  What element of our neutrality would be compromised by joining the Partnership for Peace which was not compromised by taking on our current status in the Western European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated my willingness to debate the issue in the House.  As Minister I have a view on the direction foreign policy should take in the context of peacekeeping.  The association between the Partnership For Peace and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is too close for comfort in the context of our military nonalliance and the need to preserve our neutrality. On the previous occasion the Deputy raised the issue of Tajikistan I said that country's policy is a matter for it and our policy is a matter for us. That is the policy I intend pursuing.  The offer of a debate is still open.</P>

      <P>I have sought on the Order of Business to have time allocated for this debate.  In the context of the Northern Ireland peace talks, membership of Partnership For Peace would help enhance North-South and East-West relations. We are taking a principled stand on this matter but I do not understand the principle and how our membership of the PFP would compromise our neutrality.  If we ask other people to take off the blinkers in the Northern Ireland discussions, maybe we should take off the blinkers and look at issues in which we could co-operate.  Will Ireland's role in the Western European Union be reported on and incorporated in the Green Paper on defence?</P>

Because of her poor health, she has been unable to attend any of the four committal hearings held to date in connection with a request that she be extradited to Germany. The magistrate has refused to order her extradition in her absence.  A further committal hearing is set for 2 January 1998.  I am informed the High Court will be asked tomorrow to direct the magistrate to take a decision on the extradition request.</P>
      <P>Since her arrest, the Government has expressed humanitarian concerns about the health of the person concerned, the physical and mental suffering she has undergone and the need to care for her young baby.  These concerns have been raised at various levels with the British Government.  I raised them directly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and will continue to do so.  I recently brought this case to the attention of the German Foreign Minister.  The Government believes that, on humanitarian grounds and because of the nature of the case, every avenue should be explored to have the case speedily resolved, and that was the basis on which the approach was made.</P>
      <P>At all times the Government has been careful to avoid involvement in the judicial process.  The representations made relate solely to the exercise of discretionary powers falling within the competence of the Executive.  I received a reply from Minister Kinkel that humanitarian aspects are of particular importance in this case and that Germany would welcome a swift ruling by the British courts on the extradition request.  He stated that the decision on the extradition application is a matter for the British courts.</P>
      <P>I met the mother of the young lady concerned, with a number of her associates, a meeting at which Deputy Keaveney was present.  She has played a prominent role in this case and in other prison issues, which is appreciated.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I compliment him on his involvement in this case and on the work he is doing on behalf of the person involved.  I also compliment those looking after the individual and supporting her in difficult circumstances.  I am aware of the difficulties of interfering with the judicial process.  I visited the person concerned on two occasions in recent months and I have ongoing discussions <Col N="88" /> with her family.  I am seriously concerned about this case.  Is the Minister happy the professionals dealing with this individual are concerned for personal health and the welfare of her baby?  Is he confident humanitarian issues are being addressed in her current location?</P>
      <P>The Minister said the High Court will ask tomorrow that a decision be made on the extradition request.  Acknowledging the difficulties involved in interfering with the judicial process, is there an option open to the Minister should this impasse continue?  Will the Minister comment on the report by the Union of Students in Ireland which stated that in this case there is a blatant disregard for and abuse of human rights?</P>

      <P>Like other organisations, the USI expressed a strong view, on humanitarian grounds, on the continued incarceration of this young woman and her baby, and I support its view in that regard.  It would be inappropriate for the Government to seek to influence court decisions in other jurisdictions.  The Government, however, considers it appropriate in these circumstances to draw the attention of the two Governments concerned in the extradition application to the humanitarian aspects of this case and I hope they will be taken into account in reaching a decision on the request.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has raised this issue with me on a number of occasions.  The person concerned is an Irish citizen.  Her health and the welfare of her daughter have been seriously jeopardised as a result of the extradition proceedings brought against her.  This case has given rise to widespread public disquiet in Ireland and elsewhere and in those circumstances the Government believes that every avenue should be explored to have the case speedily resolved.  On that basis, representations were made, strictly on humanitarian grounds, to the British and German Governments. Many Members of the Oireachtas share my concern about this case, as is evidenced by the large volume of mail I received from all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's response.  I take it from what he said that the report in <i>The Irish Times,</i> which indicates the Minister made representations for withdrawal of the extradition proceedings, is incorrect.  I would be more than upset if the Government did not raise the humanitarian aspects of this case or seek to have the matter speedily resolved, which is separate from having extradition proceedings dropped or withdrawn without going through the normal court proceedings.</P>

      <P>I do not deny I asked the German Foreign Minister to request his colleagues to consider dropping the extradition proceedings.  I would not like the House to think I attempted to influence the judicial process, particularly in another country.  I approached this matter in a direct way with Klaus Kinkel, with whom I have <Col N="89" /> good relations.  Having regard to the feelings of other Deputies about the manner of my approach, I had no inhibitions in making my representations. I asked that consideration be given to dropping the proceedings on humanitarian grounds, given the serious violation of this young lady's position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a view that I make strange pronouncements, but the Deputy has totally misrepresented me.  I did not ask, nor did I suggest that the German Foreign Minister, my friend, Klaus Kinkel, should interfere with the German judicial process.  I ask the Deputy to reflect on that allegation, which has no substance.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister to say that he asked the German Minister to consider dropping the extradition proceedings.  To do that he would have to go to the judicial authorities in Germany to seek to have the extradition proceedings withdrawn.  Surely that is requesting an interference in the judicial process.</P>

      <P>I made my request to the German Foreign Minister at a recent meeting and he accepted my representations with the utmost equanimity.  He is an outgoing, decent man and he did not seem in the least fazed by my request. Within my responsibility I will support Deputy Keaveney and other Members in trying to right the wrong this woman and her baby are suffering. That is a perfectly reasonable request to make to a member of another Government.  I would have no difficulty if the roles were reversed.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he did. At the same time he said all he wants is to resolve what he claims is an infringement of the rights of the person currently in custody.  How can he ask to have the extradition proceedings dropped and say it is not an interference by a foreign Government in the judicial proceedings of the German authorities?  In what way does he believe the human rights of this person are being infringed by the British or German Governments?  The Minister did not explain that.</P>

      <P>I already explained that I made representations on humanitarian grounds to have this mother and child case reviewed.  I received a <Col N="90" /> letter dated 5 December l997 from Klaus Kinkel thanking me for my letter.  He stated:</P>
      <P>Dear David,</P>
      <P>Thank you very much for your letter of 25 November 1997 in which you refer to our conversation on the fringe of the Luxembourg summit concerning the extradition of [the particular individual concerned].</P>
      <P>I am aware that humanitarian aspects are of particular importance [to the individual's case]. The uncertainty regarding her fate must be a heavy burden for [the lady concerned] to bear and the situation has been made even more difficult by the fact that she became a mother in mid-l997.</P>
      <P>That is a response to the allegation from the Deputy that in some way I tried to interfere with the judicial process of another country.  What are we to do?  Are we to let this unfortunate woman remain in the current circumstances?  Should we remain mute because we feel we might transgress another person's patch?  Mr. Kinkel did not see it in that light, but Deputy De Rossa does.  I am deeply grateful for the manner in which Mr. Kinkel responded to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for giving me time to return from Clonmel for this debate.  On my behalf and on behalf of the Government, I extend sympathy to the workers of Seagate, to their families and to the people of Clonmel and the surrounding area.  The news that Seagate will close its entire operation in Clonmel from the second week in February is devastating for those workers, their families and for the people of Clonmel.  A total of 95 per cent of the workforce live within a ten mile radius of the town.  Seagate is worth £20 million per annum to the local economy.</P>
      <P>Most Members are aware of the background to Seagate's location here.  In June l995 the former Government approved grant aid to the tune of £17 million for the company.  It involved investment of £21 million in fixed assets and, combined with working capital, the total amounted to £82 million.  The company was to create 1,400 jobs by the year 2000.  Everybody was delighted when the news reached Clonmel because it was a replacement industry for Digital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seagate quickly began its operation in Clonmel and exceeded its employment targets ahead of time.  It currently employs approximately 1,100 full time and 300 temporary employees, more than 1,400 in all.  It is a major employer for a town such as Clonmel.  Shortly after Seagate began its development in Clonmel it acquired a new company called Conner Peripherals which also makes disk drives.  Seagate told me that from then onwards there was overcapacity, but it continued <Col N="92" /> to ramp up its operation at Clonmel, which sounds incredible.</P>
    <P>In August last, with representatives of the IDA, I went on an industrial promotion trip to the United States.  It is customary on such trips for a new Minister to visit some of the client companies currently operating in the Republic.  I visited Seagate to discuss its operation at Clonmel and its plans for Cork.  As Members know, in June last the outgoing Government approved proposals for Seagate to build a facility at Ringaskiddy in Cork.  This would involve investment of £148 million and the employment of 1,000 people by l999.  The Cork project would be hi-tech and capital intensive.  It would make disks rather than disk drives, which are made at the Clonmel plant. Disk drives are at the lower end of the market and are a commodity product within the peripheral area, whereas the Cork plant would be a much more expensive and capital intensive project.</P>
    <P>In early October Seagate informed us that because of changes in the market it wanted to postpone the Cork project for six months, until April l998.  It assured me it was a mere postponement and I know from the IDA that is not unusual.  Other companies currently operating in our economy have postponed major investments.  It makes sense to bring such an investment on stream close to when one needs the products for the market. Seagate claimed that because of changes in the marketplace it did not need the products as soon as it thought and that the project would have to be postponed until April l998.  I accepted their assurances on that matter.  Shortly afterwards, they informed the IDA that as part of their worldwide review of operations, given the changing market conditions, they were also reviewing and re-evaluating their Clonmel operation.  I heard of that on Friday, 3 October, and immediately sought to contact the senior vice-president in charge of the Irish operation, Bill Watkins.  I had some difficulty in contacting him because he was travelling throughout the Far East.</P>

      <P>I contacted him by telephone on Friday, 3 October and asked him to agree to meet senior executives from the IDA, which he did on Monday, 6 October.  Over the weekend, Martin Cronin who is joint number two in the IDA, with other colleagues, went to meet Seagate executives to discuss the re-evaluation of the Clonmel project. They were assured that what was under way at Clonmel and elsewhere was a re-evaluation. They were told there was a stagnant market and that Seagate's share of the market was declining. They were also told there was an overcapacity of hard disks because of the acquisition of Conner <Col N="93" /> Peripherals and that fewer were needed because hard disks are becoming more powerful.</P>
      <P>They said that for all those reasons they had to review their operation.  The IDA assured them that they wanted to remain in touch with the review and when they informed me of what was happening I sought a meeting with the company's senior executives.  I travelled to the United States at the earliest possible moment they could meet me because they were travelling around the world to their various operations.  I travelled on the bank holiday weekend, 26 October, and on 27 October I met Mr. Watkins and Mr. Glen Peterson, who were carrying out the review, at their headquarters in California.</P>
      <P>They told me that two options were being considered for Clonmel.  The first option was to upgrade the facility and invest more money in it to produce a higher grade product.  That would maintain all the existing jobs.  Clearly, I urged them to do that and I told them that if they did, grant assistance would be available from the Government through the IDA.  They said the second option was to downgrade &mdash; or retrench, as they called it &mdash; the Clonmel facility reducing it to perhaps 750 jobs by introducing automation and, therefore, making it more productive.  They told me costs in Clonmel were three times higher than those in the Far East.  They also said that if they were making the decision now they would never have put a hard disk drive facility in the Republic of Ireland because, given that they are labour intensive, hard disks can be produced much more cheaply in Asian countries.</P>
      <P>I emphasised to them the significance of upgrading the facility for a number of reasons.  I told them that it was a major employer in Clonmel. They told me that their experience in Ireland had been a good and positive one.  They had a good workforce and were happy in Ireland.  They said the evaluation would be ongoing.  They wanted us to keep in touch with that evaluation and we did.</P>
      <P>On 5 and 6 November they travelled to Ireland. They told me they wanted to discuss their plans with the management in Clonmel.  While they were here we arranged that they would also meet the IDA.  On 6 November Mr. Peterson told the IDA that as a result of his evaluation, he would be recommending to the board that they retrench Clonmel to about 750 jobs and introduce automation. He said that recommendation would go to the board on 8 December and they would inform us of the board's decision after that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On many occasions my predecessors and I were involved with companies in difficulties and restructuring?  Former Ministers, Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Quinn, were involved with many of them.  It would be wrong to breach confidentiality and tell the Deputy which companies were concerned.  However, any Minister <Col N="94" /> dealing with client companies on behalf of the Government must deal with them, firstly, on a confidential basis.  Secondly, it would be wrong of me to downgrade the company in any way. This was a company in difficulty and I was not going to make their problems worse by making announcements to workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Please listen, Deputy Broughan. Of course, the workers are my first concern.  I felt it was the duty of the company to tell the workers. I was dealing on a confidential basis with the company.  When I heard on Tuesday that they were coming to Ireland to tell us of the outcome of their board decision it immediately rang alarm bells because I felt that if the decision was a good one they would not travel over to tell us so, they would tell us by telephone.</P>
      <P>They met the IDA early yesterday morning and told them the bad news.  They then came to meet me.  To say we were shocked is probably an understatement because closure was never on the agenda, nor were we ever informed that it was. We had a difficult meeting with the company yesterday and it is hard to understand their decision. When I learned of the decision yesterday, my priority was to meet the workers and the people in Clonmel, given the enormity of what was happening there.  That is why I travelled to Clonmel yesterday evening.  The company said it would start telling the workers from 6.30 p.m. on and clearly they did not want any statements to be made before that.  I regret that so many of the workers heard it on the airwaves.  One of the things that most upset workers at Packard Electric was the way they heard the bad news.  I did not want that to happen in the case of these workers.  It is unfortunate that, because of the way it was arranged they should be told, some of them heard it on the news.  Yesterday evening we had the appalling vista of husbands and wives coming to the factory to tell their spouses of their fate, having just heard about it on the RTÉ news.</P>
      <P>The Government's priority now is to find a replacement industry for the Clonmel facility.  It is a modern, state of the art building and has a dynamic young workforce of 1,400 people.  When I met them this morning the thing that impressed me most was the fact that they were focused on the future.  They want jobs in Clonmel and my priority is to ensure that they get employment there.  Because it is a state of the art facility and we have a readily available workforce, and because we have a number of projects in the pipeline for next year as well as a number of companies currently looking at various sites around the country, I hope we will be able to succeed soon in finding a replacement industry.</P>
      <P>The priority for the IDA will be to bring companies that are interested in locating in Ireland to see the Clonmel facility.  We are establishing a task force to be chaired by the county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> I am sorry I am not in a position to announce the membership of the task force.  Two persons whom I would like to have on the task force are currently travelling abroad on business.  I am keen that they would participate but I wish to speak to them personally before I announce their names as they may not be willing to participate.  I hope to be in a position later this evening or tomorrow morning to announce the membership of the task force.  The duty of the task force will be to look after the needs of the workers, to do very much what was done in relation to Packard Electric in Tallaght, to find a replacement industry and to work with the development agencies.</P>

      <P>The announcement by Seagate Technology that it is closing its plant with the loss of 1,400 jobs is a catastrophe, not only for the people who are losing their jobs but also for their extended families who are dependent on them.  It is not only a catastrophe for Clonmel but also for neighbouring towns such as Tipperary, Cashel, Carrick-on-Suir and Cahir as well as parts of Waterford, Kilkenny and north Cork.  For each job lost there are probably a minimum of three dependants, so the devastation felt by so many is hard to calculate.  It is particularly poignant that this announcement should have come out of the blue only two weeks before Christmas.  Many of those working in Seagate lost their jobs when Digital closed in 1992.  Many people got jobs in Seagate after long periods of unemployment, while others left jobs to join the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bombshell announcement is difficult to understand.  How can a company the size of Seagate, with an investment the size of that in Clonmel, expect its employees to accept that such a decision can be made overnight?  This is what the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, wishes us to believe.  I <Col N="96" /> do not believe that a company of this scale can make such a decision in a matter of a few days.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from what we now know that the position of the Clonmel plant had been under review for three months.  We know this from the Minister herself and from the head of the IDA. The Tánaiste will have to explain why she is expressing such shock and surprise at this announcement when she clearly had known for three months that Seagate was considering its position in Clonmel.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that as recently as Tuesday, 24 hours before this announcement, staff had been informed that a new clean room facility was being installed to upgrade facilities.  It is also extraordinary that 24 hours before this announcement, staff were being informed about details of a wage increase which they would get over the next two years.  This kind of business practice is to be condemned.  I am critical of senior management in Seagate who kept their staff in the dark and lulled them into a false sense of security by speaking about plans two years hence.  This morning I heard of one man who only yesterday at 3 p.m., approximately three hours before staff were informed of the closure, signed mortgage papers for his new home.  I heard too of people who were on their day off and got telephone calls from other members of their families who heard the announcement on the radio, and of a young couple, both of whom work for the company, who have no prospect of paying their mortgage.  This is not the way to treat staff who have given their all for the company.</P>
    <P>I turn to the role of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, in this horrific saga.  No Minister can be held responsible for the impact on trading of changes in the economy of other parts of the world but the responsibility rests with the Minister to keep herself informed as to the impact of the Asian economy on jobs in Ireland.  She has been particularly complimentary to Asian economies and work practices and has quoted their success, the low cost of labour and the long hours that Asian people are prepared to put into their work.  Since the Minister has declared herself to be such an expert on these economies, why was she not conscious of the effect of a downturn in them on any projects providing vital jobs here?  Why does she now tell us she knew about the difficulties in the Clonmel plant for three months and took no steps to prevent its closure, or to at least prepare the people working in this company for some rationalisation of the plant, which was being discussed by senior management?</P>
    <P>In early October, the Minister met a deputation from south Tipperary consisting of Oireachtas Members, the chairman of the county council, the manager of South Tipperary County Council, the county development officer and the IDA to discuss the lack of jobs in Tipperary town.  Seagate was referred to in a very positive manner in terms of the excellence and number of jobs created in south Tipperary.  No hint or word of caution was <Col N="97" /> given by the Minister that day despite the fact that information was becoming available that Seagate was considering options for the Clonmel plant.</P>
    <P>On the 6 November 1997 in columns 923-5 of the Official Report under questioning by Opposition Deputies, including myself, the Minister assured the House that the Seagate project for Cork was only postponed and not cancelled.  She stated:</P>
    <P>the company's representatives have assured me this is a merely a postponement and all I can do is accept their word, which I am happy to do.  Our experience with this company in the past has been a good one and its Cork project is very much part of their plans for the future.</P>
    <P>At the time she was fully aware the company was considering downsizing the plant in Clonmel by 750 jobs, or finding a way to cut down on overhead costs which would have led to loss of jobs. How could the Minister have been so badly informed and so unaware of the realities of business that, on the one hand, she was discussing with the company the downsizing of its Clonmel plant and, on the other, accepting its assurance that there was no threat to the Cork project?</P>
    <P>It defies belief that the Minister could have been so naive to accept these assurances and pass them on to Members without giving some warning of the nature of her discussions with Seagate about Clonmel.  The Minister misled the House and the high powered deputation from south Tipperary. On 4 December 1997 in the Seanad Senator Tom Hayes raised the issue of employment in Tipperary yet again and my colleague, Deputy Theresa Ahearn, expressed outrage at how this closure could have been allowed to happen. In the Minister's reply to Senator Hayes, she talked positively about initiatives that were ongoing in Tipperary and did not refer to any concern she might have about Seagate and its future.  The statement was made 24 hours ahead of the decision in the US to close down the Clonmel plant.</P>
    <P>I find it extraordinary and incredible that this Minister who, when in Opposition, expected every Minister to be on top of his brief, totally informed of and accountable for what was going on in his Department, can now distance herself. She must be measured against the standards she expected of others.</P>
    <P>The workers of Seagate are entitled to know why this decision has come like a bolt from the blue and why the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was not on top of her brief and making plans to cope with a decision that might be taken by Seagate to close the plant.  We have experience of other plants closing with job losses but there are ways in which such closures can be carried out on a phased basis to allow the IDA and other agencies the opportunity to look for alternative jobs and also to give the workers the opportunity to come to terms with the job losses. <Col N="98" /> This did not happen in this case and the Minister is culpable.</P>
    <P>She must take responsibility for allowing people to raise loans to buy houses or cars, to invest in their children's education, to spend money for Christmas knowing there would not be salaries to meet those expenditures.</P>

      <P>Because of the time constraint I do not want to dwell on Clonmel other than to express my solidarity with and concern for the people who have experienced this disaster in the past 24 hours.  Seagate Technology is a world leader in its field with a major slice of the disk drive market.  It is a major company with a preeminent position and it defies belief that a company of that stature should in the space of six months have made a complete U-turn on its investments in Ireland.  While I will not indulge in multinational bashing, this company has a case to answer.  The IDA's assessment capabilities must be questioned because if, as the Minister stated, the company said it made a mistake in selecting Clonmel and Ireland, why was the IDA's assessment unit not more aware of such problems?</P>
      <P>Worldwide over capacity did not happen in a matter of days, weeks or months.  Market stagnation is a matter of a company making a wrong judgment while lower prices for products arising out of that is the normal marketplace at work. However, I accept the situation in the Far East was probably unexpected.  I am a great supporter of the IDA, but it has a case to answer as does the Minister because she is ultimately responsible.</P>
      <P>I refer to the Cork plant about which the Minister has said nothing final unlike the one in Clonmel. The Cork plant is not subject to the same rigours in pricing because it operates in a high investment and hi-tech industry and if Ireland cannot compete in it, then we must accept that. We should not write off that plant but a great deal of comment today indicates that it is a virtual write off.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister do everything possible to save it while at the same time giving priority to Clonmel?  I do not agree with the notion that the Cork plant is gone because Clonmel is failing since the products, technology and competition involved are different.</P>

      <P>As Labour Party spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Employment I express my strongest sympathy for the people of Clonmel and surrounding districts following last night's callous announcement.  The plight of 1,400 <Col N="99" /> workers and their families at the loss of their jobs just a few days from Christmas is heart rending.  I call on the Minister and the Government to do everything in their power to help the Clonmel community which has been devastated by a multinational closure for the second time in just over two years.  I applaud the Minister's announcement of the setting up of a jobs task force for the region and I urge her and the IDA management team to produce a replacement industry at the earliest possible opportunity in 1998.  The Seagate Technology debacle raises the most serious questions about the judgment of the IDA and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Seagate company first came to my attention around 1991 when a major project for Clonshaugh in my constituency was abandoned in favour of the development in Derry which, hopefully, will continue to flourish.  Given the increasingly competitive nature of disk drive assembly, the original decision of the IDA to pour £16 million into the Seagate project at Clonmel from mid-1995 must be closely re-examined. Was the IDA aware of all the developments in Seagate Technology's core business and world network of plants when the final decision to support this project was made in 1995?  Without the massive Irish Government support were the economics of disk drive assemblies from the mid-1990s correct?  Everybody is grateful for two and a half years of employment but the hopes of the Clonmel workers and their families which were understandably raised were cruelly dashed last night. Will the Minister, Deputy Harney, order a review of procedures for attracting large transnational assembly type electronic and computer industries to Ireland?</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister misled the Dáil in a cavalier way on 15 October and again on 6 November 1997.  On 15 October, in a written question &mdash; Official Report, vol.  481, col.  1048 &mdash; I asked about her contacts with Seagate following the loss of 1,000 promised jobs in Ringaskiddy and her plans for a replacement industry in Cork.  She informed me of her trip to California in late August and of her detailed conversation with the executive vice-president of Seagate on Friday, 3 October.  She reported to the Dáil that the Cork Seagate project was postponed to review changes in the market for the company's product and that it would not be appropriate to seek a replacement industry for the area.  The Minister knew on 15 October that Seagate was carrying out a worldwide review of all its operations, including Clonmel. She knew Bill Watkins and his team were examining Clonmel's future but did not warn us, the elected Members.  I am not sure if she even warned the Government and she did not warn the workers and the people of Clonmel as I believe she was legally obliged to do, a point I will return to later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 6 November, Deputy Derek McDowell in an oral question on my behalf &mdash; Official Report, vol.482, col.  923 &mdash; asked the Minister about the <Col N="100" /> so-called postponement of the Ringaskiddy project. I asked for the start-up date for Cork and the Minister said: &ldquo; .all I can do is accept their word [that is Seagate's word] which I am happy to do&rdquo; that there was to be a six month postponement. The Minister accepted its word but knew from her visit to California on 27 October that Clonmel was being seriously reviewed.  She has admitted today that the slashing of the workforce from 1,400 to 750 workers was a serious option.  The Minister knew on 6 November, at the latest, that we were talking about a possible 750 redundancies or more &mdash; Glen Patterson had told her this, through the IDA, on 5 or 6 November. The Minister knew this, yet did not inform the workers and the people of Clonmel.  She let them proceed in happy expectations of a five year review and the other developments, to which my colleague, Deputy Owen, referred, and knew this disastrous Christmas box was not only possible but likely for at least half of those workers.  The Minister misled the people of Clonmel and the Dáil.</P>
    <P>This is the second disastrous error the Minister has made in the conduct of her ministry in just five months.  She made an incredible mess of the Guinness take-over of United Beverages Holdings, for which she took responsibility in this House on 6 November.  It was surely a resigning matter.  She is now presiding over the Clonmel Seagate debacle in which she cruelly misled the House and the workers of Clonmel.</P>
    <P>The awful events in Clonmel highlight once again the predicament of workers who are forbidden trade union representation.  In Clonmel they were forbidden such representation, as a letter to Tom Walsh of SIPTU in June 1991 makes clear. R.A. Kundtz, Seagate vice-president, said on 27 May 1991 that Seagate saw no requirement for entering into employment agreements, yet without trade union recognition who is to negotiate the redundancy terms on behalf of the workers?  Workers with less than two years' service do not have a legal entitlement to redundancy.  Had there been a recognised trade union or group of unions in Seagate Clonmel there could have been much earlier consultation with the workforce on more humane dealings with workers facing such a closure and more knowledge of all the facts at a much earlier stage, as happened recently at Semperit in Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister has appointed a high level group to consider such legislation on trade union recognition but the collapse of Seagate and the brutal treatment of the workforce reiterates the urgency of action on trade union recognition.  Our trade union colleagues have warned us that of all the issues which seriously threaten the future of Partnership 2000, and any possible successors, the most serious problem for them is how they are treated in relation to recognition.</P>
    <P>Even without trade union recognition the Minister and her Department are legally responsible for the failure to warn the workers of Seagate.  I have demonstrated that the Minister, Deputy Harney, <Col N="101" /> was aware of the so-called Clonmel review from early October at the latest.  Article 2.1 of the EU Directive on Collective Redundancy as cited in Catherine Barnard's standard work on EU employment law states: &ldquo;Where an employer is contemplating collective redundancies he shall begin consultations in good time with a view to reaching an agreement&rdquo;.  This directive was passed in 1975 when one of the Minister's predecessors, Dr. Paddy Hillery, was commissioner.</P>
    <P>In attempting to reach such an agreement, the employer and genuine employee representatives must include redundancy avoidance and social measures aimed at aid for redeploying or retraining workers made redundant.</P>
    <P>Two years ago the EU Court of Justice ruled in EU <i>v.</i> UK Government that where collective redundancies are desired by the employer, in the absence of a trade union, there is a legal obligation on the member state Government to put in place a mechanism for consultation.  The Minister's failure to do this has had the most dire consequences for the Seagate workforce and their families.  She is responsible for the cruel and inhumane way in which this terrible news was announced to workers yesterday and the failure to forewarn and protect them.  There was some indication from the Minister and her officials this morning that my colleague, Deputy Ferris &mdash; who is out of the House for the time being &mdash; had been responsible for breaking the news.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It was the Minister who had the responsibility to ensure that as early as possible the workforce had the opportunity to plan their future.  The Minister cannot hide behind the executives of Seagate Technology. They can take care of themselves.  They are a powerful multinational trans-national company based in California.  They are looking after their own interests and go to areas where money is cheapest and workers are prepared to work in dire conditions.  The Minister failed in one of her most vital tasks as a Government Minister.  This is her second failure in a short time.</P>
    <P>I commend my colleague, Deputy Ferris, on the efforts he is making today to organise a meeting of the workforce and all the interested parties to give them the information he has gleaned from the IDA and some people in the Minister's Department to put before them at last the full facts of their predicament.</P>
    <P>Deputies on my left will remember the days when we wrestled with the problem in Packard Electric in Tallaght.  At that time the Minister &mdash; who stood where I am standing &mdash; the former Deputy Michael McDowell and others took the most stringent view of what they saw as Government failure.</P>

What has the Minister done about that in the past five months?  Why was there not such a unit to warn the House, the Minister's colleagues and the families of Clonmel?  This is an issue on which the Minister has failed dismally.</P>

      <P>Like previous colleagues I extend my sympathy to and express my solidarity with the workers at Clonmel and their families who have been dealt a devastating blow.  This is the biggest industrial crisis the country has experienced since the closure of Ferenka.  At one time the workforce in Digital and Packard exceeded 1,400 in each case but had been wound down before closure.  This is a major blow not alone to Clonmel but to the surrounding region. The focus should be on the people immediately affected who have mortgages to discharge and children at school and who, in the most unexpected and blunt way, have learned they are to be disemployed.</P>
      <P>This issue gives rise to the necessity to take a serious look at and conduct an evaluation of the track record of the international corporation in question.  I agree with Deputy Coveney on the role of transnational corporations generally.  The decision of the IDA to focus on the hi-tech sector, which employs more than 33,000 people, was correct and one from which the economy and society benefits but it is especially unusual that a company would have grown quickly and pulled out rapidly.  Having regard to the decision in 1990 not to proceed with the opening of a plant in Clonshaugh which would have resulted in the creation of 1,300 jobs &mdash; and the decision two years later, having examined a different location in Dublin, to locate in Derry &mdash; there is a necessity for the Minister to be satisfied that the IDA in its evaluation is sufficiently rigorous in terms of the track record of the company in question.  It is odd that within six months of locating in Clonmel it acquired Conner Peripherals, a company that was also producing disk drives.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot win in a case like this.  If she was negligent, she should be called to account but if not, we are probably wasting our time pretending a Minister can prevent a multinational corporation from deciding that it is in its strategic interest to make a decision such as this.  It comes shortly after an indigenous company decided to disemploy 750 workers here and 550 in Britain.  I hope one swallow does not make a summer and we cannot draw general conclusions from this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> I am conscious that on a previous occasion, when the vice-president of General Motors came here to advise of the closure of Packard Electric, mischief was made for me in the House &mdash; I exclude the Minister from this &mdash; which did not help in circumstances remarkably similar to these where the workers concerned learned of the closure on the radio.  That is an especially lamentable aspect of the decision-making of large companies. Because meetings were taking place, the vice-president of General Motors asked me not to make an announcement for 24 hours but the matter was mentioned in the news media later that night.  The information, most emphatically, did not come from the Department or my side of the House.  We were immediately wrongfooted and it made the experience extremely difficult.  In this instance, it is unforgivable that many hundreds of workers and their families learned of the closure over the airwaves.</P>
    <P>The focus should be on what can be done in these circumstances.  It would be fatuous to suggest it is possible to persuade a company of this dimension to change its mind.  Assuming everything that reasonably might have been done was done before the decision to close was made, in my experience when a company such as this makes a decision it is irretrievable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has available to her the experience of Digital in Galway and Packard in her constituency. The task force established by Deputy Quinn in Galway and by me in Tallaght were spectacularly successful.  Digital has as many people employed in Galway as it had at its peak. The supports put in place for disemployed workers in Tallaght were a tremendous success. In recent weeks the Minister was able to bring to a conclusion work that was well advanced when I left the Department in terms of finding a replacement industry for the Packard premises.  Despite the scepticism and cynicism with which the announcement of competent task forces was greeted, they produced tangible results which are there for all to see.</P>
    <P>Workers in Clonmel hope they will continue to be employed in Clonmel and that everything reasonable that can be done will be done to ensure this.  There is no point in causing a task force to be established unless resources are provided to underpin its recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for sharing his time.  For the people of Tipperary, 10 December 1997 was a sad and black day.  I thank the Minister for visiting Clonmel, for communicating in a sympathetic and understanding way with the workforce and for assuring them of the solidarity of the Government and every Member of the Oireachtas in their plight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seagate decision was communicated and announced in a cruel, inhuman and unacceptable way.  It is a shattering blow to the workforce and their dependent families who are angry and demoralised.  The county is struggling to come to <Col N="104" /> terms with the enormity of what has happened.  It is gripped by a sense of gloom and despair.  The severity and suddenness of the decision will have serious consequences for the economies of Clonmel and Tipperary.  The timing and manner of the announcement is an appalling reflection on the company, the State agency involved and the Government.  No amount of preparatory explanations will lessen the psychological blow to the workforce.  It was callous to allow a situation to develop where the workers learned of their fate through the media.  This shoddy management of such a serious crisis must be closely examined to ensure there is no repetition in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>It seems incredible the IDA was so out of touch that, by its own admission, the decision took it by surprise.  It is obvious it underestimated the company's intentions.  With an investment of £12 million in the company, the liaison between the IDA and the company should have been such that the company's policy and motivation should have been known to it in advance to allow intensive lobbying to save all or, at least, part of the plant.  I urge the Minister to commence an immediate investigation into the motivation and reasons for this decision.  The explanation given by the company is unbelievable.  How could market decisions, over-capacity and labour costs deteriorate so quickly to merit closure?  How could a company get its research, planning, projections and judgment so utterly wrong?  How could it move from an expansion and development plan in June last to closure in December with a loss of 1,400 jobs?  There is something radically wrong, something rotten and incomprehensible about this Seagate decision.  I welcome the establishment of the task force because it is crucial that this debacle be approached in a positive, constructive manner.  There remains in Clonmel an attractive, state of the art plant and a multiskilled, dedicated and committed workforce.  The task force should examine the human dimensions of this tragedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Party for sharing its time with me.  The loss of 1,400 jobs in Clonmel, or anywhere, sends shivers down many people's spines.  Let us hope the workers of Seaate will not be jobless for long, which I hope will be the message to go out from here.</P>
      <P>I represent Dublin North, a constituency which is heavily dependent on, and very grateful for, investment by trans-national companies like Motorola, Amdahl and IBM, all of which play a central role in the lives of my constituents.  The sympathy of those working in such companies will be all the greater for those losing their jobs in Clonmel, particularly following on the loss of 350 jobs in 1991 with the closure of Digital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must now assess what action remains to be taken by the Government, analyse what has occurred and also what remains to be done by all those in positions of power in State agencies.  The first priority must be to support the workers of <Col N="105" /> Clonmel who will obviously be anxious to find a replacement for Seagate, in addition to more general training of and help for those involved in enterprise generally, rather than specifically in the case of Clonmel.  Although I shall have some questions about the task force, its establishment is welcome.</P>
    <P>There are wider lessons to be learned from this experience.  For example, I do not think sufficient numbers of people are really aware of the risks involved and the need to take precautions whenever we become dependent on trans-national corporations. It is a fact of life that such large companies are sensitive to competitive advantages in other areas.  There are lessons for us to learn.  We must be careful that rural communities, do not become reliant on one company.  This is something which must be avoided in spite of initial euphoria when a major project is mooted.</P>
    <P>Adaptability is critical for the survival of our young people and the Department of Education and Science appears to have taken account of that necessity.  It would appear the Japanese are beginning to feel the pinch at the lack of flexibility in their market and other countries in the Far East are beginning to make similar sounds.</P>
    <P>Ireland needs to continue to trumpet the advantages and bonuses that attract large corporations to invest and locate here.  We must ensure they can be guaranteed a clean environment, an important factor in the case of many trans-national corporations.  The fact that we speak English better than anybody else in the world, according to George Bernard Shaw, are well educated and motivated, and our proximity to the European mainland, must also be trumpeted.</P>
    <P>All of those attractions should not detract from the political lessons to be learned from this tragedy.  I hope the Minister will be able to withstand the increasing pressure from other European Union member states who oppose our tax advantages for trans-national corporations.  Can she tell us more about the task force she has announced?  What resources will be made available to it?  What will be its full remit?</P>

Clearly we must make funds available for that purpose.</P>
      <P>On the matter of temporary workers, at present the company does not intend giving them severance payments out of the severance package amounting to approximately £6.5 million.  I have asked the company to make arrangements to give its temporary workers some severance payments and contribute to a job centre and employment fund to help both temporary and full-time workers.  I hope they will respond positively to my request.  They need to talk to some members of the board in the United States before being in a position to give me a commitment on those matters.</P>

Will she inform the House whether she and the IDA are continuing to promote and support that project, contrary to some media reports today?  In the event of the Ringaskiddy project not going ahead &mdash; and I hope it will &mdash; will the Minister appoint a task force similar to those in the case of Clonmel, Tallaght and Galway to identify and procure an industry, or industries, to replace the 1,000-plus jobs which will be lost to the Cork region?</P>

      <P>We always believed the Cork project would go ahead.  The company assured me yesterday that Cork is going ahead but I told them it would be difficult to recommend grant aid for a new facility in Cork following on this disaster. However, it would be irresponsible of me to close the door completely.  Clearly, given our unprecedented experience in relation to Seagate, we would have to take its track record into account, not merely in relation to Clonmel but in relation to the years 1990 and 1991, to which Deputy Rabbitte referred.  Given that track record, personally I would be very reluctant to recommend to Government that we proceed with the Cork project unless circumstances change very dramatically.</P>

    <P>The Deputy asked whether the IDA was still pursuing the Cork project.  I have discussed the matter with the IDA who have come to the same conclusion as I have.  Because the company never made us aware that closure was on the cards &mdash; on the contrary, we were assured that the worst <Col N="107" /> case scenario would involve the loss of 750 jobs, perhaps upgrading, reinvestment, retaining all of the jobs or even more &mdash; there is a credibility issue.  They know that to be the position of the IDA.</P>
    <P>On the matter of a task force for Cork, I will be delighted to give that consideration.  Cork is a very attractive location for foreign investment. There are a number of projects in the pipeline for Cork next year and Ringaskiddy will be targeted by me and the IDA for one of them.</P>

      <P>In view of this overall debacle, does the Minister accept that workers have a right to know, at least in general terms, about the progress of their company?  That is the first point.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;why did she not set up the task force for south Tipperary three months ago, as he asked her to do?  Third, does the Minister accept that under the 1975 EU collective redundancy directive, she had a legal obligation to put in place mechanisms to inform the workers of their rights?  Will she agree that this terrible event shows once again that urgent action was needed?  During the general election, the Taoiseach promised us that urgent action would be taken on trade union recognition and representation and association rights.  In her reply the Minister told us what she has done, but will she now accept that she and the Taoiseach should keep the promise made in June and introduce legislation on trade union recognition?

      <P>Does the Minister agree with the remark made in the House that the IDA was taken completely by surprise in this matter?  Will she require the IDA to do an evaluation of the track record of this company to see what lessons can be learned from this experience?  Will she tell the House again if, in her contacts with the company, it indicated that closure was contemplated at any stage in Clonmel?  Also, having regard to the fact that no trade union advice is available to the workers concerned, will the Minister assist the task force in putting in place immediately some kind of unit or facility to advise the workers of their current entitlements and how they deal with the situation in which they now find themselves?  Will she agree that is one of the practical things the workers confronting this situation urgently need?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Rabbitte's last question, that is already under way in relation to advising the workers, and it will happen <Col N="111" /> immediately.  I was asked by many people last night if the IDA, the last Government or somebody else got it wrong.  Hindsight theory and 20:20 vision are always useful in politics.  I do not believe people got it wrong.  This was a blue chip company at the cutting edge of the industry, one of the world leaders.  Everybody, including my predecessor, was delighted, when it came here. The company is evaluated in my Department and in the Department of Finance but this is one bad case.  We have had 150 good cases and, thankfully, this is an exception.</P>
      <P>In relation to the lessons that can be learned, I will not pretend to be an expert in electronics.  I knew nothing about a computer until a few months ago but one learns quickly.  This company is in what is called the peripherals area.  It is a low value added, commodity product which is very labour intensive.  If any lesson is to be learned it is that it is not viable to have many of those projects in Ireland.  We must concentrate on high tech, high capital investments.  An evaluation is taking place in which world experts are involved. The IDA uses leading world experts like Kinsey and many others in evaluating projects.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Rabbitte's question on closure, that was never on the cards.  I have kept in touch with this company.  Travelling back from Clonmel this morning, the chief executive of the IDA said we could both do a PhD on Seagate with all the contact we have had with the company.  Two meetings were held in the United States and two here.  I contacted Kieran McGowan every week asking for news.  I rang him on Monday night to ask how the board meeting went and he told me we would probably hear about it the next morning. We then heard company representatives were coming to see us.  We thought they might be coming to ask for more money to upgrade or, as I thought more likely, to give bad news.  I was shocked yesterday morning when I heard the story after the Order of Business, as was the IDA. The company has lost $63 million in Ireland in two years &mdash; £45 million.  Some people say this is a con job but it has been an expensive con job for the company.  It will have to pay back £11.3 million and it has cost the company £6.5 million in severance payments.  It has lost £45 million and there will be other costs associated with the closure. This has been an expensive experience for the company and, as its representatives said, they got it wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there are probably only two other companies here making that type of hard disk product.  I will not name them but the Minister will know of them.  I want her to give an assurance they will not run into the same problems Seagate ran into, given that the company said those problems have arisen because of oversupply and over-capacity in this sector and price of work in the Asian markets.  Can the Minister assure the House that the IDA and her Department <Col N="112" /> are examining the companies in this business to ensure there will not be another bombshell, such as this, very soon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is yes.  Every year we have lost companies in the electronics industry.  Notwithstanding that loss, employment in that industry has grown by between 3,000 to 5,000 each year over the last decade, even in the year Digital closed.  There is a high risk in that industry and the market changes very rapidly.  Representatives of one company recently came to see me and told me that over the next 12 to l5 months their company will change the entire product range it makes here and the process through which it is made. That reflects the pace of change in the electronics industry and companies must be able to respond to it.</P>
      <P>There is a unit that evaluates the position on an ongoing basis.  The IDA is a professional industrial development agency that looks after not only new business; it constantly manages and works with the existing client base to ensure there are no problems and where they exist it tries to iron them out.  That work is continuing in respect of the companies Deputy Owen did not mention by name.  I am satisfied that as of today the IDA is working to ensure the problems facing any of those companies can be resolved satisfactorily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Minister first made aware of Seagate's vulnerability in July and, if so, what steps did she take on foot of that information?  Why was there a reluctance to announce Seagate's proposals for Cork prior to the general election?  Did real concerns exist at that time about the company?  Will the Minister and Government agree that mobile investment of this nature, which can evaporate over night, would have serious but less dramatic consequences if a guaranteed basic income payment was put in place for all workers to enable them, at least, find other work with some assured income and dignity?  Would that not be in line with the type of mobile investment of which the Minister talks, which requires flexibility and adaptability of workers and of general strategy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not know about this at the end of July.  I met representatives of the company at the end of August.  When a new Minister goes to the United States it is traditional for her to meet some of the existing client base and to be introduced to senior management.  My meeting with the company was very upbeat.  I was told how wonderful the operation was in Clonmel and what a wonderful experience they were having in Ireland, that they were getting ready for Cork, their planning process was under way and they complimented the consultants working with them.  The meeting with the company was very upbeat and positive.  The chief executive of the IDA and the secretary general of my Department were with me at that meeting.  That is why I was <Col N="113" /> amazed when I heard in early October the company was reviewing its operations in Clonmel.</P>
      <P>Regarding the announcement, the decision in relation to Cork was leaked during the general election.  The facility in Clonmel was officially opened on 4 June.  However, to his credit my predecessor, Deputy Bruton, did not have anything to do with the leak nor did he officially launch the Seagate project for Cork until the day after the election, 13 June.  Yesterday evening some time after 6 p.m. or 6.30 p.m. I contacted Deputy Bruton to inform him of what was happening as a matter of courtesy because he was involved in bringing in this project.  It was the right thing to do and other Ministers did the same in similar situations.</P>
      <P>Regarding mobile investment, it is very important to this economy, particularly American investment.  There are 485 American companies operating here.  By and large they are outstanding employers, pay good wages, have good working conditions and I am sure the workers in those companies would acknowledge that.  This company is an exception and I hope it will remain one.  Flexibility is very important.  We are attractive to foreign investment.  We are getting between 30 per cent to 40 per cent of all of the US projects investing in Europe, notwithstanding that we have less than 1 per cent of the European population. That is because of flexibility, the attitude of our workers, their skills base and low corporate taxes.  We must maintain those competitive advantages because they are very important to our economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned in the course of her reply that a senior executive of the company stated it would definitely go ahead with the project in Cork.  The company has a modern plant, excellent infrastructure and a willing workforce familiar with its activities.  Will the Minister clarify why, if the company is so committed to the project in Cork, it will not locate that project in Clonmel and retrain the existing workforce?  Why is it necessary to build a new plant and recruit a new workforce?</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the IDA and she have enjoyed a good deal of success in attracting new jobs.  A number of projects are under negotiation with the IDA.  Will the Minister indicate a timescale for the conclusion of those negotiations and will Clonmel and Tipperary be given priority?  Regarding the social dimension to this problem, will the Minister exercise her influence to ensure the financial institutions look sympathetically and fairly on any restructuring of young people's existing mortgages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's query about Cork, I made the point he made to the company.  It told me the work in Clonmel is at the low end of the market, assembling disk <Col N="114" /> drives, and the project for Cork would involve making disks, which is a much more capital intensive and high tech development requiring workers with very different skills.  The Clonmel facility and its workers, in the main, are not suitable for the Cork project.  The company told me the cleanroom facilities and others that are needed for the Cork project could not be provided in Clonmel. Unfortunately, the Clonmel facility is not capable of what they call being &ldquo;ramped up&rdquo; to make a more value added product.</P>
      <P>Regarding the timescale for those negotiations, it is hoped they will be concluded as quickly as possible.  We want to get a replacement industry in there.  The IDA will bring in client companies I hope before Christmas or shortly after.  There are a number of companies in negotiations with the IDA, but from the time the IDA gets a positive response from a company negotiations can take between 18 months and two years.  Clonmel will be the number one priority for the Government over the next few months because the devastation that will be caused by these job losses will be enormous for the town and the workers concerned.</P>
      <P>Regarding the financial institutions, I will try to influence them if I can, but Deputy Lowry knows as well as I do that influencing financial institutions is like trying to influence multinational companies.  In terms of mortgage subsidy and so on, I want to ensure that the State agencies and the statutory bodies help the workers in every way possible.  By and large most of the workers will be paid up until the end of May and I hope that some time around then we will be in a position to start re-employing many of them. That is our aim.  Most of them will get 14 weeks severance pay and the rest will get 11.  The position of temporary workers has not yet been resolved.  To get back to a position of having 1,400 people employed will take months rather than weeks and it might take years.  Normally a company that will employ 1,000 to 2,000 people begins by employing 100 or 200 people and it can take a period of three to four years before the level is reached that was reached by Seagate in a couple of months, which was extraordinary.  I cannot understand how that happened so rapidly.</P>

Presumably they are not insane and have learned something from the debacle in Clonmel.  I ask the Minister to be more positive in this regard.  In the event of the Cork project not proceeding, I would like some confirmation of the Minister's seemingly qualified support for a task force, such as those established in Galway, Tallaght and Clonmel, to replace those one thousand or more jobs in Cork.

      <P>Boston Scientific is creating more than 1,000 jobs in Cork.  There have been a number of recent announcements on job creation in the region, among them one relating to EMC &mdash; one of Seagate's customers.  Indeed, Seagate told me that EMC was one of the reasons it located in Ireland as it wanted to supply its European customers from a European base.</P>
      <P>I laughed because Seagate never indicated that closure was on the cards.  The company led us to believe there were two alternatives to that and yet it announced a closure yesterday.  I will not close any doors on this issue; it would be irresponsible of any Minister to do that.  Let us examine Seagate's track record.

      <P>I will look seriously at Deputy Coveney's suggestion in relation to Ringaskiddy and I agree that what is proposed for Cork is different from the Clonmel operation.  The company is in difficulty internationally.  When it acquired Conner Peripherals, it acquired 1.3 million square feet of factory space.  It has closed down .5 million of that in Italy, Scotland and Asia.  If the company recovers from its difficulties, convinces me of its good intentions and puts a lot of money up front then perhaps I will go to my Government colleagues and ask that it be given a second chance. However, I would be very reluctant to do that. We would have to see big changes for that to happen.</P>

      <Col N="116" /> As I said to the company's management, the manner in which it handled this closure will also influence my attitude to the company.

Those commitments related to temporary workers, employment funds, the establishment of a job centre and the handing over of the facility at a reasonable price to a new investor.

Tam Brands recently made a facility available in Tipperary and that is why the Pall Corporation located in the town.  Clearly, Tipperary, and Clonmel in particular, will be a priority.  Ninety five per cent of Seagate workers live within a ten mile radius of Clonmel town; the factory was worth £20 million a year to the region.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this subject.  We all accept that children are the future of our country.  It is sad that, in a period where most people have high standards of living, children are homeless on the streets of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Homelessness represents the most extreme form of social exclusion and should not be a feature of our society.  A mere 44 hostel places are provided for children in the Eastern Health Board area.  This is insufficient.  There are only six or eight emergency beds available each night but there is a requirement for at least three times that amount to ensure that no child must resort to sleeping in squats or on the streets.  Hostel accommodation should only be a short-term measure until such time as services are in place which would provide proper day care services for children which would be supported by a 24 hour social work service with access to emergency foster care, supported lodgings or home family support services.  Placing children in hostels or bed and breakfasts is not a suitable alternative to hospital resources and professional skills and creates unnecessary demand on hostel resources. Bed and breakfasts are excellent as private enterprises but the necessary professional skills are not available there to deal with homeless children and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Focus Ireland has drawn up a plan in which emergency needs and immediate requirements are outlined.  Extra emergency accommodation must be provided as a matter of urgency and a reception area for children.  Day services for homeless children should include basic facilities such as food, water, informal education and links with other services on a 24 hour basis.  Provision must be made for a seven day street work service. Focus Ireland has also outlined the need for settlement facilities and an increase of 60 places in foster care services.  There is a need for 30 more supported lodgings, a home support service and care workers to support children in their own home.  There is also a need for a community service, independent living and training in supported lodgings.  This situation must be tackled on a long-term basis; we must examine our education <Col N="118" /> facilities to see why these children are becoming homeless at such a young age.  Nine, ten, 11 and 12 year olds are dropping out of the system so there is a need for better home-school liaison services and better support for neighbourhood youth projects.  Services must be planned by the health board and must draw on the experience of the voluntary sector.  There is a need for an integrated service delivery system inclusive of the experience and capacities of the voluntary sector. There should be a clear and cohesive strategy to ensure the needs of children who are or are likely to be homeless and the needs of their families are properly addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Fahey, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to express my concern about the plight of homeless young people in the Eastern Health Board area and to set out the initiatives my colleague, Deputy Fahey, has taken in this area.  Although the problem of homeless young people is difficult to solve, considerable progress has been made in the provision of services for this group of youngsters.</P>
      <P>For the period January to July of this year a total of 1,945 referrals were received.  Approximately 50 per cent of these young people are known to the Eastern Health Board.  A difficulty experienced by the out of hours service is that many young people who cannot be placed by community care teams during the day, because of a shortage of placements, present to the out of hours service at night.  To respond to this problem, the Eastern Health Board intends to create more foster care and residential places in the region.</P>
      <P>The board opened an emergency short-term residential unit for 12 to 18 year old homeless children early in 1996.  Supported lodgings have been developed in all community care areas. There are now 87 approved supported lodgings places for adolescents who are homeless.  This initiative helps to maintain young people in their area of home origin.  The lodgings provide an element of independence to young people but provide support at the same time.  This new scheme has been successful and supported a total of 145 young people in 1996.</P>
      <P>The board has also assigned additional social workers to its out of hours service.  My colleague has made the development of services for out of home young people a priority and in 1997 approved a special allocation of £2 million to fund a number of initiatives for homeless children in Dublin under the auspices of the Eastern Health Board.  Included in measures to proceed immediately is a ten bed emergency residential centre for children under the age of 12 years.  This centre will be operational on a 24 hour basis and will provide a workable alternative to social admissions to hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> The board has immediate plans to open an additional ten bed emergency residential centre for children over 12 years of age who are out of home.  In addition, up to ten emergency carer families are being brought on stream at present. These will be available to provide emergency care for children during the out of hours period.  The board also operates a day project which offers care, welfare and recreation support to approximately ten young people considered to be at risk during daytime.</P>
    <P>Plans are advancing for a day and night reception centre in Dublin city centre to facilitate homeless young people in accessing Eastern Health Board services.  This will replace the current unsatisfactory arrangements whereby young people make contact with the Eastern Health Board out of hours service <i>via</i> Garda stations. The reception centre will provide a base for the day project where meals can be provided as well as recreation, laundry and bathroom facilities. This centre will have a small number of emergency beds available for young people where no placement is available.  These new services will come on stream in early 1998.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is no quick fix solution to the problem of young homeless people on our city streets.  However, I am confident the measures I have outlined will make a major contribution to helping this vulnerable group of children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity of raising the anomaly which, over recent years, has crept into the administration of supplementary rent and mortgage allowances to separated people.</P>
      <P>It has gradually become more obvious that the administration of this scheme discriminates against separated spouses who have custody of their children and a mortgage, often substantial, on their houses.  On the other hand, a person who has had to sell his house and is homeless is fully supported by the scheme, which is operated by the health service but paid for by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  That person's immediate housing requirements are met in full.  The system discriminates against spouses, usually women, who have the responsibility of maintaining themselves, their children and their mortgages.  They get virtually no assistance at present, except in extreme cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State must always be mindful of getting good value for its spending.  If these women had never had a house or had sold their houses they could qualify for the maximum rate of rent supplement. There is something wrong in such a system. I can offer the Minister the example of two cases with which I dealt recently.  A woman with an income of £180 per week to feed, clothe and maintain seven people in the household had a mortgage of more than £125 per week.  She could <Col N="120" /> not pay the mortgage.  The system failed to recognise that woman's plight and to respond until the last moment when the court was about to repossess her house on behalf of the building society.</P>
    <P>Another case involved a separated woman who also had custody of her children and a mortgage. Between lone parent's allowance and part-time employment, she has an income of about £160 per week to feed, clothe and maintain four people, one adult and three teenagers, and service a mortgage of more than £500 per month.</P>
    <P>These two cases are not isolated and the Minister is familiar with this problem.  I am concerned the system has turned against people in that category. The assessment system in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which operated when I was Minister of State at that Department, is not fair and discriminates against such people.  Under the regulations the separated spouse, usually a woman, must make reasonable efforts to ensure she receives maintenance from her former husband.  The problem is that the degree to which she is expected to seek that maintenance puts her in a vulnerable position, to the extent that she could virtually starve to death before she has exhausted all the procedures.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister examine those procedures?  It does not require vast expenditure.  The administration of the rules as they apply to that category of people is being operated wrongly according to the guidelines, as far as I am aware.  The health boards which operate those instructions as agents of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are doing so in a way that is wrong and unfair to the people concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Durkan raised this matter with me outside the Chamber last evening but the matter for discussion tonight is somewhat different.  However, I am aware of his intention. The response I will deliver is strictly related to the subject of this debate.  With regard to the broader issue of separated spouses who are maintaining children and a mortgage, I accept there are difficulties.  It is one of the age old problems involved in separation, that two families into one income will not go.  That is the difficulty with separation and divorce in society, which is a broader issue.  I am aware of the issues to which the Deputy refers and perhaps we might get together to tease them out.  From the point of view of the Department, however, there are logical reasons for the way in which this scheme is implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, SWA, provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest payments to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The amount payable depends on the person's circumstances and on the cost of the accommodation. In the case of mortgage interest supplements, the rate of supplementation varies according to the amount of interest charged and does not take the capital element of the repayment into account.  This is the core of the issue to <Col N="121" /> which the Deputy referred.  It does not relate to the assessment and what the Deputy says is the insistence by the Department that a separated spouse chases the errant spouse.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to a rent or mortgage interest supplement is determined by the health boards and the amount paid depends on the individual circumstances in each case.  The rate of either rent or mortgage interest supplements payable in any individual case is generally calculated to ensure that the person has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which applicants are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
    <P>The maximum amounts of rent and mortgage interest supplement payable differ within and between health board areas as the cost of accommodation varies across each health board reflecting market forces and local conditions. Maximum rent and mortgage interest supplementation levels are also set according to family size.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, similar maximum levels of supplementation apply to both rent and mortgage interest supplementation.  For example, in the Eastern Health Board area, the maximum supplement for a family with two or more children is £450 per month for both rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to assist eligible persons who would otherwise be unable to meet their housing needs.  Rent supplements form the bulk of housing supports under SWA.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is to help people meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  Generally speaking, claims are made for a short period only and often as a result of an unexpected change in a person's circumstances.</P>
    <P>The mortgage interest supplement scheme operates on the basis that the person shall be entitled to a supplement towards the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  The capital element of mortgage repayments becomes significant only towards the end of the mortgage period. This refers to the type of situation the Deputy referred to.</P>
    <P>As a consequence, excluding the capital element of the repayment from the SWA calculation does not significantly reduce the amount of mortgage interest supplement payable in the early years of the mortgage when repayments generally represent a high proportion of household income.  By the time the capital element forms a significant element of the mortgage repayment, the total monthly mortgage repayment usually represents a smaller proportion of household income and the outstanding capital sum usually represents a small proportion of the market value of the house.  The principal is not, and never was, taken into account in the calculation of the mortgage interest supplement because it is not considered appropriate that the <Col N="122" /> Exchequer should repay part of the initial loan and thereby provide assistance towards the accumulation of a capital asset on the part of the individual concerned.</P>

      <P>Olga Anisimova and her ten year old daughter came to Ireland in February 1996. They were resident in Moldova and belonged to a minority ethnic group &mdash; they are Russian as are 13 per cent of the Moldovan population. Since the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Russian speaking people and those of ethnic Russian origin in Moldova have suffered a great deal.  Children of Russian origin are excluded from state-run schools.  Those of Russian origin have also been subjected to violent attacks, as has Olga Anisimova.  They live in great difficulty which this woman experienced, while at the same time she was deserted by her husband who subsequently divorced her.</P>
      <P>She came to Ireland in February 1996 seeking asylum.  As is the case with a number of asylum seekers she did not arrive here directly.  She flew to England and in 24 hours was in Dublin.  While her asylum application was dealt with an issue of importance to this State arose &mdash; whether asylum applications should be accepted from those who come from another EU member state but who can seek asylum in the original state in which they arrived.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform took the view that as she entered England before coming to Ireland, that was the country to which an application for asylum should be made.  As there are now in excess of 3,000 applicants for refugee status, the Department saw this woman's situation as a test case.  As a result there was litigation through the courts and on 28 December 1997, the Supreme Court upheld the case made by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and ruled it was under no obligation to consider the woman's application for asylum.  Based on international law the Department was entitled to return her to England where she could apply for asylum.</P>
      <P>Legally, the Department is technically correct in the way in which it has dealt with the case, based on the Dublin Convention and its implications. However, the convention is a convenient tool to ensure we do not assume any responsibility for any reasonable number of people from any country in the world seeking refugee status. As a small island with limited direct contacts to countries where there is repression and difficulty, most of those who seek asylum in Ireland inevitably pass through another state.  As part of the EU we have a moral obligation to those seeking asylum and a peaceful existence in a different country away from the threats they experienced in their country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department used the case of Olga Anisimova to establish an important legal principle. The Supreme Court decided the State has no <Col N="123" /> obligation to provide her with political asylum.  It is at the Minister's discretion to decide on humanitarian grounds as we approach Christmas that this woman and her child who have suffered so much and have now lived in the State for almost two years should be given the right to remain here.  Olga Anisimova and her daughter should not be used as guinea pigs to establish a test legal principle.  We then pass the buck to England.  Nothing will be achieved by forcibly deporting her and her daughter to another country.</P>
    <P>The court case brought by the Minister's Department established a legal principle which the Minister may see as protecting the State from people using this jurisdiction for spurious applications for political asylum.  This woman's claim is not spurious.  We want to deport her on a technical legal issue.  Perhaps she will be granted asylum in England in a year or 18 months' time. However, we are talking about a ten year old child and a young woman who has suffered from depression.  This State is big enough and humanitarian enough to offer her the home she seeks on humanitarian grounds.  Will the Minister do this rather than using her and her daughter to convey the message that this is not a country which welcomes those seeking asylum?  I am not saying this is the Minister's motive.  This test case did not start while the Minister was in office, and it is not a political issue.  However, the past history of the Department of Justice has been one of a lack of insight and sensitivity and, on occasions, a lack of decency in the way it has dealt with people who have suffered oppression and who have come to Ireland seeking help.</P>
    <P>As was well illustrated last night on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; and Louis Lentin's extraordinary presentation, this country does not have a good record in this area despite what some of us would like to think.  We are heading into the Christmas period. I ask the Minister not to deport this woman and her child from what has now become their adopted country, a State they have lived in for two years, to another strange country where this young girl will yet again have to try to establish roots and start all over again fighting the battle for asylum which, in effect, is a battle simply to be allowed to lead a peaceful and safe life.</P>

      <P>Let me point out the following general considerations which I regard as highly important.  Section 19 of the Refugee Act, 1996 makes it incumbent on all persons involved in the processing of applications to take all practicable steps to ensure that the identity of applicants for asylum is kept confidential.  In fact, the Act specifically makes it an offence to publish or broadcast such information which is likely to lead members of the public to identify a person as an applicant for asylum.</P>
      <P>While that section of the Act has not been implemented for reasons which I will outline shortly in response to the matter raised by Deputy Upton, it has always been the practice of my Department and of former Ministers for Justice not to participate in any discussions or proceedings which could lead to the identity of an applicant for asylum becoming known.  This philosophy, reflected in the Refugee Act, 1996, has always been followed in processing applications for asylum and will continue to be followed under the new administrative procedures which have effect from yesterday.</P>

      <P>There are good reasons for this, including the fact that if, generally speaking, the identity of an applicant is made known and discussed, this could have unfortunate repercussions for members of his or her family in the country of origin.</P>
      <P>Having emphasised this importance of the confidentiality of asylum applications generally, I appreciate that the case in question has been the subject of certain media coverage following the Supreme Court judgment of 18 November last.  That judgment, which upheld the High Court judgment of February last, was to the effect that the Supreme Court was satisfied that a proper inquiry, in accordance with the requirements of natural and constitutional justice, had been carried out to determine that the United Kingdom was the appropriate country for the purpose of a substantive inquiry into the claim of the person in question for refugee status.  The High Court was satisfied that there was a third country, the UK, which was prepared and willing to process an application for asylum and that this effectively precludes me from examining an application for asylum, irrespective of the applicant's wishes.</P>
      <P>The position now is that I have received a communication from the legal representatives of the persons concerned.  That is a private communication to which I will respond in the near future when I have given it full consideration. I do not propose, therefore, to say anything further in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking the time and trouble to come into the House to respond to this question.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister announced new administrative arrangements to deal with asylum seekers. I have asked for this matter so that these proposals can be discussed in the House.  The Government parties committed themselves, in An Action Programme for the Millennium, to implementing them in the Refugee Act.  There were no qualifications; it was a priority and it was going to be done.  Legislation for handling applications for asylum already exists.  It was passed by the Oireachtas and awaits only a commencement order from the Minister.  The clearest possible commitment has been given that that will happen.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that these new administrative measures will not further delay the full implementation of the Refugee Act?  I ask him to declare in absolute terms that the Refugee Act will be implemented without further delay.</P>
      <P>Yesterday's press release stated that these administrative arrangements, which were outlined in a letter to the UNHCR, were drafted with extensive consultation with the UNHCR. The UNHCR previously stated that the Refugee Act is the ideal legislation to handle refugee applications and views these new arrangements as temporary stopgap measures.  I ask the Minister to expand on some of the items contained in the letter to the UNHCR, in particular the paragraph which deals with translation facilities.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge and welcome the fact that the letter, which is signed by a civil servant, gives a commitment to provide translation facilities where possible, but it does not give a right to such facilities.  The letter to the UNHCR does not provide a guarantee of legal representation where that is appropriate.  Indeed, in the Minister's press statement it is stated in the second last paragraph that &ldquo;where possible the new arrangements broadly follow the philosophy of the Refugee Act&rdquo;.  I wonder why the term &ldquo;where possible&rdquo; is included.  I would like the Minister to outline exactly what is not possible and why.  I am rather concerned about the phrase &ldquo;broadly follow the philosophy of the Refugee Act&rdquo;.  That provides 1,001 escape routes from following the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>In terms of dealing with refugees, we are still operating on a non-statutory basis.  All the agencies concerned with this matter seem anxious that it should be done on a statutory basis.  The agencies seem anxious that a commissioner for refugees should be appointed.  I understand there is a problem in terms of a law case currently before the courts, but I wonder if it would not be appropriate for the Minister to introduce amending legislation to deal with that matter which relates to an age ceiling on people entitled to apply for the position of commissioner.  It is important that that matter is resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> The central question here in relation to what was outlined in yesterday's press release is whether the provision will be permanent and whether the full provisions of the Refugee Act will be implemented.  Can we expect that people who apply for refugee or asylum status in this country will have their case heard in an open and fair way rather than having it heard in a manner which, to a large extent, still reverts to the old method which was quite unsatisfactory to a large number of people?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the House on a number of occasions that I implemented sections 1, 2, 5, 22 and 25 of the Act with effect from 29 August last.  I have also told it that there is presently a High Court injunction preventing the appointment of a refugee applications commissioner under the Act.  Given this litigation, I am not in a position to appoint a refugee applications commissioner, an appointment central to the introduction of the remaining sections of the Act.  In the absence of a commissioner no applications for refugee status can be considered and the entire process will come to a complete stop. This would be highly undesirable for all concerned.</P>
      <P>In light of the impasse over the appointment of the refugee applications commissioner, my desire to deal with all applications for refugee status fairly, efficiently and in a timely manner and the need to put in place an interim arrangement to deal with the current large caseload, I met with the representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Both the UNHCR and I were satisfied that the arrangement made in 1985 which involves formal consultation with the UNHCR in each individual case was no longer workable due to the huge increase in numbers applying and that a new approach was necessary. I emphasise that this was not only my view but also the view of the UNHCR.  Extensive consultations with the representative have resulted in the establishment of a procedure to deal with the backlog of cases which has built up over the last two years and currently stands at approximately 4,000.</P>
      <P>In a letter regarding the new arrangement the UNHCR stated, <i>inter alia</i>, &ldquo;Overall we believe that the revised document provides for a balanced administrative procedure pending the entry into force of the Refugee Act&rdquo;.  Despite comments to the contrary, there has been consultation with the UNHCR who has expressed her satisfaction with the procedures pending the entry into force of the Refugee Act.  This is of considerable importance in light of the current debate.  Details of the new arrangement have been circulated to Members of this House and a copy has been placed in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that I received Government approval for the recruitment of additional staff to help deal with the applications in hand.  I expect the new staff to be in place in early 1998.  Accommodation has also been <Col N="127" /> obtained to house the new staff together with the Eastern Health Board's refugee unit, the UNHCR and a proposed legal advice service for asylum seekers.  This will be a one-stop-shop for asylum seekers and should be ready next spring.</P>
    <P>The new arrangement, which broadly follows the philosophy of the Refugee Act, is an interim measure pending a review by me of the Act and the conclusion of the legal action currently taking place.  In this latter regard, a statement of claim in the matter was received by the Chief State Solicitor from the plaintiff only this week.  In so far as the review of the Act is concerned, this has been necessitated by the large increase in applications over the past year.  When the Act was drafted it was envisaged that applications would be of the order of hundreds per annum, not thousands as is the case.  When the number of applications began to increase last year it was decided that the refugee applications commissioner position should be changed from part-time to a contract appointment for three years.  Given the current <Col N="128" /> number of applications, even this solution will be unworkable.  The Act provides for only one commissioner with no powers of delegation. One person could not cope with the number of applications in hand and the current backlog would only be exacerbated.</P>
    <P>The number of new applications has begun to fall in recent months.  If this level of decrease continues and the new arrangements result, as is the intention, in the backlog being cleared then it may be possible to implement the provisions of the Act, as currently drafted, pertaining to the commissioner.  If not, I will bring forward fresh proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>The Government will respect its international obligations in so far as asylum seekers are concerned and will grant a safe haven to refugees. However, there is a clear distinction between a refugee and an illegal immigrant.  I am satisfied that I have a good enough insight into the human condition to know that there are no easy cases.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.55 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 16 December 1997.</P>

      <P>The European Commission published its Agenda 2000 communication and its opinions on the applications for membership of the Union by the ten central and eastern European applicants in July.  On the basis of its opinions, the Commission recommended that the Union open accession negotiations in the first instance with five of the ten central and eastern European applicants: Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, together with Cyprus, which already had the benefit of a positive opinion.  The European Council, which is meeting in Luxembourg on 12-13 December, is to take the key decisions with regard to the management of the enlargement process, including as to the applicants with which the EU should open accession negotiations, the practical arrangements for the initial phase of negotiations and the reinforced pre-accession strategy.  We would expect that accession negotiations will, in accordance with the conclusions of the Amsterdam European Council, open as soon as possible, after the Luxembourg European Council, in early 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While none of the applicants fully satisfies all the criteria for accession at the present time, the Commission considers that Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia could be in a position to satisfy all the conditions of membership in the medium term.  New members of the Union will be expected to apply and enforce the <i>acquis communitaire</i> upon accession and a process of screening of legislation by the Commission will, as a first step, identify the main problem areas for subsequent discussion.  As the Commission has pointed out, the timing of the <Col N="130" /> conclusion of the accession negotiations will depend primarily on the progress made by individual applicants in adopting and implementing the <i>acquis.</i> Given the complexity of the issues involved in the negotiations, and the varying degrees of preparation of the applicants, it is not possible to say when precisely the negotiations with any individual applicant will conclude.</P>

      <P>I wish at the outset to express the Government's deep concern at the appalling loss of life which has been taking place in Sri Lanka over the past 14 years.  This has been caused by the conflict between the central authorities and the group called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, also known as the Tamil Tigers.  The suffering of all the people of Sri Lanka and the damage caused to the country's infrastructure and economic development has been truly immense.</P>
      <P>Since the latest resumption of hostilities in April 1995, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and her People's Alliance Government have pursued two concurrent strategies in order to reach a durable settlement to the ethnic conflict with the Tamil people.  She has attempted to seek support in parliament for constitutional changes aimed at a form of devolution for the Tamil areas which might satisfy Tamil demands for autonomy and independence.  At the same time, Mrs. Kumaratunga has sought by military means to weaken the effectiveness of the Tamil Tigers guerilla movement.  Allegations have been made of human rights abuses in the Tamil areas under government control but &mdash; in the absence of international involvement &mdash; these are not well documented.  What is certainly true, however, is that the suffering caused to the many civilians displaced as a result of the conflict has been very great.  The International Committee of the Red Cross reported ealier this year that up to 40 per cent of the population in the Vanni region alone &mdash; amounting to as many as 400,000 people &mdash; had been forced to leave their homes and were classified as displaced persons.  There have also been several terrorist bombings in the capital Colombo and elsewhwere which have added to the civilian death toll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sri Lankan Government has not sought the assistance of outside parties for the purpose of mediation in the current dispute &mdash; although it has had discussions with the Indian Government because of the many connections which exist between the Tamil populations of Sri Lanka and the neighbouring Indian state of Tamil Nadu.  It does not, however, view the conflict as one requiring international involvement, nor has it <Col N="131" /> raised the matter at the United Nations in New York or Geneva.</P>

      <P>The European Convention on the non-applicability of statutory limitation to crimes against humanity and war crimes was opened for signature on 25 January 1974.  It has been signed by Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Romania. The Netherlands is the only state to have it ratified. The convention has not entered into force since it has not been ratified by the required number of countries.  The United Nations Convention on the non-applicability of statutory limitation to crimes against humanity and war crimes was opened for signature on 16 December 1968.  It entered into force on 11 November 1970 and has been ratified by 43 countries.</P>
      <P>The object of these conventions is to encourage the adoption of measures by contracting states to ensure that statutory limitations shall not apply to crimes against humanity and war crimes.  The position in this jurisdiction is that statutory limitations do not apply to criminal offences and, accordingly, the question of signature and ratification by Ireland of these conventions is not seen as a priority and has not received consideration in recent time.  The Government has, therefore, no immediate plans to arrange for the ratification by Ireland of either convention.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the principle that, wherever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families. This commitment is based both on humanitarian grounds and on the strong view that transfers are a confidence-building measure of significance which can bolster trust and underpin the peace process in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Transfers of prisoners, including republican prisoners, to this jurisdication are governed by the terms of the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which both Britain and Ireland have ratified.  There were no transfers of republican prisoners in the first half of 1997.  Since July of this year to date, four republican prisoners have been transferred here under the terms of this convention, three from Britain and one from the United States of America. I warmly welcome this development.</P>
      <P>There are currently 18 convicted republican prisoners in Britain.  Sixteen of them have requested transfer to this jurisdiction, one has requested transfer to Northern Ireland and the remaining prisoner has not yet made a transfer application.</P>
      <P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995 gives effect to the provisions of the European Convention in this jurisdiction.  I am informed that these 16 applications, which are the only applications currently in hand from republican prisoners, are at different stages in the procedure set out in the Act.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that implementation of the Act is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the Minister to expedite the processing of applications once they are received in this jurisdiction.  Indeed, he has brought before the Seanad an amending Bill designed to facilitate the processing of a number of the applications for transfer.</P>
      <P>Finally, let me say that I am very hopeful that further transfers will take place in the near future. The Government attaches the highest priority to this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The Government remains seriously concerned at the situation in Algeria, especially at the ongoing violence which has resulted in continued loss of life and enormous suffering.  Because of this concern, and in order to see the situation at first hand and to assess how it might be improved, I made a visit to Algeria this week, from Monday evening until yesterday.</P>
      <P>During my visit I had lengthy and very frank discussions with President Liamine Zeroual, Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf, and Speaker Bensalah of the National Assembly.  I also met the chairmen of the foreign relations and defence committees of the assembly.  I made clear, in all my discussions, the feeling of outrage in the international community at the continuing slaughter and suffering in their country.  I stressed our solidarity with the people of Algeria and the urgency of continuing political and economic reforms, including the protection of human life.</P>
      <P>The President and the Foreign Minister both gave me a detailed account of their Government's reaction to the crisis &mdash; politically, economically and in the security area.  They stressed their commitment to building a pluralist and democratic society that fully respects and promotes human rights.  The terrorist onslaught, which had gone through successive phases of targeting different groups, had, in their view, culminated in indiscriminate attacks on the population as a whole and might now be nearing an end.  The state was fulfilling its legal obligations of protecting its citizens, using force only where necessary.  They accepted that some abuses had occurred, but maintained that all allegations were being investigated and that those responsible for illegal acts would be brought to justice.</P>
      <P>I believe that, as a result of my visit, the Algerian Government will be more open to dialogue with countries, such as Ireland, which have deep concerns about the problems it faces.  I indicated that my visit had the full support of the President of the EU Council of Ministers, Mr. Poos, and that I would be reporting to him and to my other EU colleagues.  I intend to do so when we meet next Friday in Luxembourg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the standpoint of bilateral relations, I believe that my visit was timely and that it should pave the way for increased contacts and <Col N="134" /> exchanges in a number of fields, including trade. Algeria has, in the past, been a significant market for Irish beef, and I am hopeful that it will be in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not underestimate the gravity of the crisis in Algeria, or the extent of alienation felt by many of the population.  High unemployment, an acute shortage of housing and other problems have all combined to aggravate the situation.  The Algerian Government is keen to attract outside support and investment, but I made it clear to it that a prerequisite for this was an improvement in external perceptions of the situation, including the handling of the security situation.  For their part, my interlocutors all stressed the importance that they attached to improved relations with the countries of the European Union.  I very much hope that the effect of my visit will be to encourage those positive tendencies that already exist and, by reducing the sense of isolation, help the people of Algeria to escape from the appalling difficulties that confront them at present.</P>

      <P>I intend to reply to Questions Nos. 18 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on the Treaty of Amsterdam has now been finalised within my Department and I intend to launch it early in the New Year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the White Paper will stimulate an informed debate on the Treaty of Amsterdam. One of the Department's principal aims in drafting the White Paper has been to make it as accessible and as user-friendly as possible, in recognition of the fact that the Treaty of Amsterdam, as an amending treaty, is not only an extremely complex document, but is also almost unreadable as a stand-alone text.  Unlike the Maastricht Treaty, the Single European Act and the founding EC Treaties, the Treaty of Amsterdam essentially contains a series of amendments and sets out to improve the existing treaties.  It will result in important changes to the functioning <Col N="135" /> of the Union in key areas and will enhance its capacity to address some of the issues of most concern to citizens of the Union.  This means that a comprehensive and comprehensible White Paper is required to inform the public of the contents of the treaty and what it sets out to achieve.</P>
    <P>As far as public information campaigns for referenda are concerned, the Deputy will appreciate that general policy on referenda information does not come within the scope of the responsibilities of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I can only speak on the specific case of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</P>
    <P>A primary consideration must be the Government's fulfilment of its clear duty to inform the public comprehensively.  In the case of the upcoming referendum on the Treaty of Amsterdam, the White Paper will, as I have already said, be one important means of making the public aware of the content of the treaty, hopefully contributing to an informed public debate on the treaty.  I would also expect in the normal course of events that my ministerial colleagues and I will have occasion to speak both here and elsewhere on particular aspects of the treaty and to provide the Government's view of their significance.</P>
    <P>The Government will, of course, be mindful of the need to respect the relevant Supreme Court judgments, in particular the implications of the judgments relating to public funding in a referendum campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm that human rights is a priority issue for this Government and a central component of our foreign policy.  We believe that the international community has an obligation to act when it has concerns, and that these concerns should be pursued whenever possible in a constructive spirit of co-operation and dialogue, conscious of the responsibility which devolves on all governments to promote and protect human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In co-operation with our EU partners, we monitor closely the human rights situations in a number of countries.  On many occasions we have commented publicly on those situations which give rise to grave concern, as for example at the UN General Assembly, both in my predecessor's address to the assembly on 25 September and in <Col N="136" /> the debates of the third committee.  The EU statement delivered at that forum by the Presidency, on behalf of all member states, expressed our common disquiet at human rights violations in certain countries which are of particular concern at the present time, including Afghanistan, Burma, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, East Timor and Nigeria.</P>
    <P>We believe that applying concentrated international pressure through multilateral organisations such as the EU, the UN and the Council of Europe is the most effective means of eliminating human rights abuses and, moreover, has resulted in an improvement of the situation in some countries &mdash; for example, the adoption by the Kenyan Government of a programme for constitutional, legislative and administrative reform; the resumption without preconditions of the constructive dialogue on human rights between China and the EU; ratification of the optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by the Sri Lankan Government; the dialogue which has been established between the Governments of Nepal and Bhutan on the issue of refugees from Bhutan; and the co-operation of the Colombian Government with the Commission on Human Rights and the High Commissioner's new Centre for Human Rights in Bogota.  While many of these countries still have serious problems in the human rights sphere, such improvements are to be welcomed nonetheless.</P>
    <P>As I recently assured the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ireland will continue to fulfil our obligations to promote the observance of universal human rights standards. We will also continue to voice our concerns, whenever possible in partnership with other member states of the Union, in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to those powers of search contained within the British Prevention of Terrorism Act.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of Schedule 5 to that Act, any person who has arrived in or is seeking to leave Britain or Northern Ireland by ship or by aircraft may be examined and-or searched by an examining officer.  This applies also to land travel between Northern Ireland and this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> The powers apply to persons of any nationality, including British nationals and other EU citizens. They are seen by the British authorities as a means of countering international terrorism as well as terrorism related to the Northern Ireland conflict.  The Prevention of Terrorism Act does not confine examination and search powers to traffic between Ireland and Britain.  However, the indications are that a majority of persons examined are stopped at points of entry and departure for Common Travel Area traffic; separate figures are not available for the number of persons who are actually searched under these provisions.</P>
    <P>The Government has frequently expressed its concern at the provisions of the PTA, particularly those whose application appears to have a disproportionate impact on the Irish community in Britain or persons travelling between the two islands, such as the powers relating to port and border controls.  We will be pursuing our concerns in the context of the proposals for permanent counter-terrorism legislation which the British Home Secretary will present early next year in the form of a consultation paper.</P>

      <P>On 28 October 1996, under the Irish Presidency, the European Union adopted a Common Position in respect of its relations with Burma.  In view of its concerns at the absence of progress towards democratisation and at the continuing violation of human rights, the European Union decided at that time to expel all military personnel attached to Burmese diplomatic missions in member states and to place an embargo on all exports of arms, munitions and military equipment to Burma; in addition, entry visas were denied to all senior military and Government personnel.  These restrictions remain in place.</P>
      <P>Ireland is among a number of EU member states which would favour increased restrictions being imposed in order to bring further pressure to bear on the Burmese regime.  This was made clear at the General Affairs Council held in Brussels on 6 October this year.  We shall continue to seek agreement from partners for the adoption of such measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the ruling military regime in Burma, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), was transformed into the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) on 15 November last.  It is too early yet <Col N="138" /> to say if any substantive changes have occurred in Burmese Government policy as a result of this changeover; in particular, there continue to be serious doubts regarding the new regime's attitude to human rights and its willingness to co-operate with the democratic opposition led by Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.  The fact that the four most senior generals in the previous regime have remained in place under the new arrangements does not, however, inspire confidence that any significant changes are likely to occur.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>Honorary consuls are appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to look after the interests of Irish citizens abroad and to perform other consular functions.  They play an important role in supplementing the work of our embassies and career consulates.  Appointments are subject to the approval of the receiving state and are made following an evaluation of the need for a consulate and careful consideration of the suitability of applicants for the position.  It is the policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs to check references submitted with applications.  There are at present 68 honorary consuls.</P>
      <P>Honorary consuls can accept applications for Irish passports.  These are normally sent for processing to the Passport Office in Dublin.  In November 1994 the Honorary Consul in Karachi was given five blank passport booklets for use in emergency situations and only then on the basis of prior approval from the Passport Office in Dublin.  One passport was subsequently issued by the Honorary Consul, in May 1995, with the approval of the Passport Office.  In November 1997 the Honorary Consul was instructed to return the four unused booklets to the Passport Office.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any allegations against the Honorary Consul in Karachi relating to the processing of applications for Irish passports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> In 1990 the Garda Síochána investigated allegations concerning visas which had been made against the Honorary Consul in Karachi.  The investigation found that the allegations were not substantiated.  Earlier this year further complaints concerning the processing of visa applications were received by the Department.  These are being considered at present.</P>
    <P>The Honorary Consul continues, for the present, to perform such duties as he is requested to undertake by the Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 42 together.  The convention on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction was opened for signature on Wednesday, 3 December in Ottawa.  I was pleased to represent the Government at the Ottawa Conference and also to be among the first of 121 foreign ministers and other representatives to sign the convention.  Three countries, Ireland, Canada and Mauritius, also ratified the convention on 3 December.  I met the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who was in Ottawa for this event, to hand over a copy of our instrument of ratification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next step in our efforts to rid the world of these barbaric devices is to secure the rapid entry into force of the convention.  For this to occur smoothly we need to have the requisite implementation <Col N="140" /> machinery in place by the end of next year.  The convention itself does not provide for a preparatory mechanism &mdash; as is otherwise common with treaties.  This is mainly because the cost of servicing a cumbersome diplomatic process would be beyond the resources of many of the mine-affected countries.</P>
    <P>The core group of countries to which Ireland belongs, and which was instrumental in bringing about the conclusion of this treaty in a remarkably short space of time, has therefore looked at alternative approaches to developing the machinery needed for implementation.  One of the areas that must be addressed is that of the data regarding the location and clearance of mines and assistance for mine victims so that questions of mine clearance, mine awareness and victim assistance can be more effectively tackled once the convention has entered into force.</P>
    <P>After consultations with my core group colleagues, I announced in Ottawa that Ireland would host a meeting in Dublin in autumn 1998 to address these issues at expert level with a view to producing a report.  This meeting is being prepared and co-ordinated with the Canadian Government and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), in a co-operative approach between governmental and non-governmental bodies.  Such close co-operation is the defining characteristic of this process.</P>
    <P>By pooling the information resources of governments, international organisations and NGOs in this way we should be able to build up a clear picture of the extent of the tasks ahead in the implementing phase of the convention.</P>
    <P>We all clearly wish to see this convention gain universal acceptance as soon as possible, following its early entry into force.  We will continue to work, both in all appropriate multilateral fora where we are represented and also bilaterally, to secure universal adherence to this convention. The target must be for the mines convention to become a norm of international law before the year 2000 so that the hope we have kindled among the populations of so many mine-affected countries may become reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of the term state aircraft is recognised in <Col N="141" /> international law.  I refer the Deputy to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation of 1944, which Ireland ratified in 1946. Article 3 (a) of that convention states the the convention &ldquo;shall be applicable only to civil aircraft, and shall not be applicable to State aircraft&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Article 3 (b) of that convention goes on to define state aircraft as &ldquo;aircraft used in military, customs and police services.&rdquo; The term state aircraft is, then, an internationally recognised term which can be applied equally to Irish and foreign aircraft.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea distinguishes between merchant ships and government ships, although it does not define the latter.  The Mercantile Marine Act, 1955, which governs the ownership and registration of Irish ships, uses the term State owned rather than Government ship.  The Act defines a State-owned ship as a ship wholly owned by the Government or a Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The term state ship, as used by the Deputy, might be used to refer to a wider category of ships, that is, those owned or operated by a state. Such ships are usually entitled to certain immunities under international law.  For example, Article 96 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea provides that ships owned or operated by a state and used only on government non-commercial service shall, on the high seas, have complete immunity from the jurisdiction of any state other than the flag state.</P>

      <P>The Government views the current impasse in the Middle East peace process with great concern.</P>
      <P>The Middle East peace process continues to occupy a high priority for the Union.  It is regularly considered in the General Affairs Council, and by the various working groups which meet in Brussels.  The President of the Council of Ministers, Mr. Jacques Poos, Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, recently carried out visits to the Middle East on behalf of the Union, in the course of which he visited Egypt, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.  He underlined the role of the EU in the peace process, the considerable financial support provided by the Union and its willingness to be at the disposal of the regional parties in the role of facilitator.  The EU role continues to be that of offering constructive support to the parties in order to restart substantive talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foreign Minister Poos also discussed the situation with the US Secretary of State, Mrs. Albright, on 4 <Col N="142" /> December.  They agreed on the need for continued EU-US co-operation in this area.</P>

      <P>SFOR is performing an indispensable task in maintaining peace, deterring violence, and creating the conditions in which long-term stability can begin to take root in Bosnia and Hercegovina. In my previous capacity as Minister for Defence, I had the opportunity to visit the Irish contingent of military police serving with SFOR, and I saw at first hand the excellent contribution which they, and the other Irish pesonnel serving with the UN, ECMM and OSCE, are making to the efforts of the international community.</P>
      <P>It is clear to me, and it is a view that is widely shared by most governments involved, that there will be a need for a continued and effective international military presence for some time to come in order to maintain and advance the cause of peace in Bosnia and Hercegovina.</P>
      <P>This view has been reinforced by the message from the Peace Implementation Council, which met this week in Bonn.  The Bonn meeting underlined the reality that implementation of the civil aspects of the Dayton Agreement must be complemented by adequate support and underpinning on the military side, continuing after June 1998, when SFOR's current mandate, under UN Security Council Resolution 1088, will come to an end.</P>
      <P>Consideration is currently being given in NATO, which conducts the SFOR operation under the UN mandate, to possible options in this regard.  Ireland, like the other non-NATO troop contributing nations in SFOR, will be briefed and consulted on continuing developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has committed itelf to maintain its contingent with SFOR until the end of its current UN mandate in June 1998.  Were the UN Security Council to extend SFOR's mandate, or mandate a successor force, the Government would carefully consider any request for Irish participation. A decision by the Government in this matter would depend on a number of factors, including availability of resources; the terms of the mandate given by the UN Security Council to any successor force; the size and composition of the <Col N="143" /> force; and the nature of the tasks which an Irish contingent would be asked to undertake.  The safety and security situation would be fully taken into account in arriving at any such decision.</P>

      <P>The burden of debt imposes a serious constraint on the least developed countries, including the African priority countries for Irish aid.  I am personally aware of the campaign referred to by the Deputy, which is aimed at increasing public awareness of the debt burden faced by the developing world, and in particular calling for serious action to be taken on the matter by the year 2000.</P>
      <P>Ireland has consistently used the relevant international fora to stress the need to seriously address the debt problem of the poorest countries and to indicate our openness to innovative solutions. Successive Ministers for Finance, in their capacity as Ireland's representative on the Board of Governors of the World Bank and the IMF, have highlighted the difficult situation of heavily indebted developing countries and have pressed the case for significant alleviation of their debt burden.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable progress on this problem over the past year.  The HIPC Initiative, the debt initiative for highly indebted poor countries which was agreed at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in October 1996, represents a significant step forward in the international community's response to the debt problem of the poorest countries.  This initiative is committed to co-ordinating relief from all creditors &mdash; bilateral, commercial and multilateral &mdash; to bring a highly indebted country's debt down to a sustainable level.  It is directed at highly indebted poor countries which have demonstrated, through a track record of good economic management, that they have the capacity to use debt relief to resume the process of economic growth and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has been strongly supportive of the HIPC Initiative and we have urged both its early implementation and its flexible application to the maximum number of heavily indebted poor countries on the most favourable terms possible.  We welcome the progress which has been made on the implementation of the HIPC Initiative.  In particular, we welcome the decisions which have been taken on its application to Uganda, the first <Col N="144" /> country to qualify for relief under the initiative, and the more recent approval of assistance for Bolivia and Burkina Faso.  Consideration of the eligibility of a number of other countries for similar relief is well under way.  The HIPC Initiative can produce significant debt relief for highly indebted poor countries and it must be given an opportunity to work.</P>
    <P>Reaction towards the HIPC Initiative from the developing countries has been very positive.  We have reason to believe that the initiative is being applied with flexibility and concern for the interests of the beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>Ireland has consistently called for the consideration of all options for relieving the debt burden of the developing countries.  The Deputy will appreciate that Ireland, as a non-creditor country, is not directly party to the debt problem and is not in a position itself to give a lead with regard to debt cancellation.  However, we will continue to use our influence to press for a just and comprehensive long-term solution to the debt problem in the developing world.</P>

      <P>The Refugee Agency, established by the Department of Foreign Affairs, has responsibility for the co-ordination of arrangements for the admission, reception and resettlement in Ireland of programme refugees, that is, refugees admitted into the State under Government decision in response to appeals from the United National High Commissioner for Refugees.  At present, the main groups of programme refugees are Vietnamese and Bosnian.  The total number of Vietnamese currently in the country is 593 and the number of Bosnians is 783.  These numbers include children and dependants (for example, grandparents).</P>
      <P>The Refugee Agency operates a scheme of voluntary repatriation for progamme refugees who may wish to return to their country of origin. Applications to repatriate are completed in the Refugee Agency and submitted to the Department of Foreign Affairs, which forwards the applications to the International Organisation for Migration to make the necessary travel arrangements. On departure, a small resettlement grant is paid per individual and consideration is being given to increasing the amount of this grant.  Individuals retain a right to return to Ireland within six months of their departure but are required to pay their own travel costs in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> To date, no Vietnamese have availed of such repatriation facilities.  So far, 126 Bosnian programme refugees have repatriated to Bosnia.  Eight of these have availed of their right to return to Ireland within the six month period allowed.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has operational responsibility for immigration matters that do not fall within the scope of such Government decisions, including refugees and asylum seekers other than programme refugees. However, I understand that no applications for return to country of origin have been received by that Department from persons in those categories.</P>

      <P>Ireland, with all the other members of the United <Col N="146" /> Nations, is a party to the statute of the International Court of Justice.  Bearing in mind the important role which the court can play in resolving international disputes and Ireland's commitment under Article 29.2 of the Constitution to the peaceful settlement of international disputes, the question arises whether Ireland should make a declaration under Article 36 (2) of the statute of the court, accepting the court's compulsory jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>In view of what it understands to be the possible legal implications of making such a declaration, the Government remains to be convinced that it would be appropriate to do so.  It should be borne in mind, in any case, that the absence of such a declaration does not preclude all parties to a particular dispute from agreeing to submit the dispute to the court.</P>
      <P>It should also be borne in mind that the acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice may not necessarily be preferable to retaining the option of having recourse to other fora or methods of dispute settlement.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 9 December to his Question No. 128 on Rwanda.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the persistent reports of violence particularly in north-west Rwanda over the past months and the effect of this on the stability of the country.  The return of massive numbers of refugees to Rwanda in 1996 and 1997, among whom were many militants on the Hutu side, has been accompanied by a vicious circle of terrorist attacks and countermeasures by the Rwandan armed forces in that area.  There have been numerous civilian deaths on both sides.  As recently as last Sunday, 7 December the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Robinson, stated, at the end of her visit to Kigali, that the scale of violence by Hutu extremists, resulting in large numbers of killings in certain prefectures, was increasing dramatically.  Further arbitrary killings linked to the Rwandan Patriotic Army had risen substantially in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Violence is also reported as occurring in north-west Rwanda and also in neighbouring parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, where, reportedly, Rwanda Government forces are fighting what has been described as a loose <Col N="147" /> coalition of the losers of the civil wars in these countries.</P>
    <P>While it is not possible to confirm the extent of the violence in north-west Rwanda, the Government strongly wishes that the Rwandan authorities will again pursue, as an urgent priority, a policy of reconciliation between the Tutsi and the Hutu sides, so that stability may be restored in the country.  The Rwandan authorities must act to prevent any further deterioration of the political and security situation and continue with their work of re-establishing in such areas the system of justice and administration, and the reintegrating of the more than 1.2 million refugees who have returned from the Democratic Republic of Congo.  In view of the very difficult situation in north-west Rwanda and of the concern of the European Union, the EU Special Envoy, Mr. Adjello, is to visit Kigali soon and explore with the Rwandan authorities how to deepen the dialogue between the EU and Rwanda.  As I indicated in my earlier reply, EU Heads of Mission in Kigali have been asked for their assessment of security in north-west Rwanda and at the borders with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda.</P>

      <P>There is currently a backlog of reports waiting to be considered by this committee.

In this regard, we will continue to use every available opportunity to raise our voice against incidences of human rights abuses, wherever they may occur, through our membership of a variety of international bodies, such as the Council of Europe, the UN Third Committee and the UN Commission on Human Rights, of which Ireland is a member in the period 1997-99.  We will also pursue our concerns on human rights issues in co-operation with other member states of the European Union.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the entire island of New Guinea, which is shared by Irian Jaya-West Papua and Papua New Guinea, has been severely affected by the El Nino phenomenon.  No significant rainfall has occurred on the island since April 1997.  Due to the lack of cloud cover the drought has been exacerbated by frost which has destroyed many crops.</P>
      <P>These problems have been aggravated in the western part of the island by forest fires.  In common with other areas of Indonesia, fires were started by local farmers in Irian Jaya-West Papua to clear land in the expectation that the rains would extinguish them.  I understand that the fires have restricted access to many areas and have, in addition, prevented vulnerable people from seeking food in the nearby forests.</P>
      <P>UN assessments indicate that at least 500,000 people throughout New Guinea, around 10 per cent of the population, are currently suffering from malnourishment.  In addition to food shortages, many of the available water sources have dried up or become polluted leading to an increase in diseases such as scabies and diarrhoea. While I hesitate to describe the current situation as a famine, there is no doubt that substantial and well-targeted humanitarian assistance is needed in both parts of the island of New Guinea to avert a crisis.</P>
      <P>In this context, the Government has made an immediate allocation of £50,000 for emergency humanitarian relief to the island of New Guinea. This grant will be channelled through the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs, UNDHA.  UNDHA has been providing relief supplies, medical assistance and transport to the worst affected areas.  The grant will be divided equally between those most in need in Irian Jaya-West Papua and Papua New Guinea.  Officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs continue to monitor the situation closely and the Government is open to considering allocating further grants to promote food security in the coming months.</P>

      <P>The Council of Europe Agreement on <i>Au Pair</i> Placement was opened for signature on 24 November 1969.  Six of the 40 member states of the organisation have ratified the agreement: Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway and Spain.</P>
      <P>The question of Ireland's signature and ratification of the agreement has been looked at on a number of occasions.  The Departments concerned with the welfare of foreign <i>au pairs</i> in Ireland are satisfied that present provision for their welfare is adequate and do not favour the further legislative and administrative machinery which ratification of the agreement would necessitate.</P>
      <P>An additional consideration is that the agreement provides for the protection of <i>au pairs</i> only within the acceding state.  Ireland's accession would not, therefore, increase the protection of Irish <i>au pairs</i> abroad.  For these reasons there is no proposal at present that Ireland should sign the agreement.</P>

      <P>The Luxembourg European Council, meeting this weekend, is to take the necessary decisions with regard to the management of the next phase of the enlargement process, including with which countries the Union should open accession negotiations early next year.  As I indicated in my reply to a question from the Deputy on 4 November, we consider that the Commission's proposals in its Agenda 2000 communication, together with its opinions on the applicants for accession to the Union, are generally well-constructed, are balanced, and provide a suitable framework for the conduct of the enlargement process and an objective basis for the opening of accession negotiations. We are also concerned to ensure that the arrangements for the management of the enlargement process to be decided at Luxembourg should reflect the key principle of inclusiveness. The Amsterdam European Council confirmed that enlargement is an inclusive process, embracing all the applicant countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is important that the decisions to be taken at Luxembourg should maintain equality of treatment between the applicants, in accordance with the criteria laid down by the Copenhagen European Council, and should sustain the momentum towards accession on the part <Col N="151" /> of all applicants.  In this regard, we are pleased that the Commission has not closed the door in the face of any country.  The possiblity of participating in accession negotiations, at the early stage, has been left open to those countries which did not receive a positive recommendation from the Commission, as soon as their performance warrants it.  The Commission has also brought forward detailed proposals for a reinforcement of the pre-accession strategy to assist the associated states in preparing for membership.  These proposals have been discussed by Ministers and will also be decided upon at Luxembourg.  The key feature of the reinforced pre-accession strategy will be a new instrument, the Accession Partnerships, which will mobilise all forms of assistance to the applicant countries in central and eastern Europe to support their efforts to accede to the Union.  The Accession Partnerships will be elaborated on the same basis with all applicants and with the same objective.  Finally the proposed European Conference is intended to bring together member states, candidates for accession and also Turkey.  We consider that the arrangements for the next phase of the enlargement process, taken together, and as elaborated on by Council, provide the essential framework in which all applicants can participate fully on an inclusive basis.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my predecessor indicated in reply to a question in this House on 30 September that the establishment of a resident embassy in Mexico was under consideration in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  That remains the position.  I cannot say when a decision on this matter will be taken by the Government.  The Deputy will also be aware that the formal agreement <Col N="152" /> of the host country is required before a resident embassy may be opened.</P>
      <P>Because of the small size of our foreign service, we are not in a position at present to establish diplomatic relations with Cuba.  In the event that we were to open a resident embassy in Mexico, this position could be reviewed.</P>
      <P>On 5 November, Ireland, with all our European Union partners, voted in the United Nations General Assembly in favour of a resolution which called for an end to the economic commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba.  The General Assembly adopted the resolution with 143 votes in favour, three against and 17 abstentions. The US Government is well aware of our concern about the embargo.  On 2 December 1996, Ireland joined the other EU member states to adopt a common position on Cuba.  The EU favours a peaceful transition to democracy and a sustainable recovery and improvement in living standards of the Cuban people and does not try to bring about change by coercive measures with the effect of increasing hardship.  Having said that, I wish to make clear that the EU, including Ireland, attaches importance to the Cuban Government's responsibility to ensure full respect for human rights and political freedoms within Cuba.</P>

      <P>I am familiar with the report to which I assume the Deputy is referring, which was launched in Dublin by PeaceWatch Ireland on 27 November 1997 and deals with the events on the Garvaghy Road earlier this year.  The findings and recommendations in the report are currently being examined by officials in my Department.</P>
      <P>The report will reinforce the view that everything possible must be done in the future to avoid a repetition of the events surrounding the marching season in recent years.  I trust also that the report will be studied closely by the relevant British authorities, together with the comments of other observers of the events on the Garvaghy Road, including members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the British Government has published a Bill designed to implement the recommendations of the North Review and to establish a parades commission on a statutory basis.  Successive Governments have put forwards views and proposals on the parades issue to the British authorities, including to the North Review.  We remain in ongoing consultation with the British Government on this issue through the <Col N="153" /> framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>The draft Bill is currently progressing through the British parliament.  We are pleased that the British authorities have now decided to abandon plans to extend the remit of the Bill to include &ldquo;other expressions of cultural identity&rdquo;.  We were not convinced of the need of this general extension and welcome the confirmation that this has been withdrawn.  Our embassy in London will continue to monitor closely the parliamentary debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have previously stated on the record of this House, I broadly welcome the establishment on a statutory basis of an independent parades commission with determining powers.  To succeed in its task, it is critically important that the Commission acquires the confidence of both communities in Northern Ireland in the fairness and impartiality of its operations.  In carrying out its functions, it must attempt to strike a balance between the rights of those who wish to march and the rights of the community in the areas through which they seek to march.</P>
    <P>The success of the parades commission will depend on whether its decisions are upheld. Should local agreements fail to resolve certain contentious parades, the Commission's determination on the issue should be resolutely upheld by the authorities.</P>

      <P>I have no direct statutory responsibility in this matter in that responsibility for the protection of eels in the Shannon estuary is a matter for the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and the owner of the fishing rights is the ESB. However, I have had inquiries made on the Deputy's behalf and I am advised that assessments by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and the ESB do not point to any evidence of damage to elvers at the points of intake by industries in the Shannon estuary.  The local authorities are obliged to assess the effects on fish passage of any developments in their areas.  Both the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and the ESB, make inputs to the planning process on an ongoing basis to ensure that the necessary precautionery measures are put in place to protect fish stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also advised that scientific analysis of the movements of elvers through river systems indicates that natural mortality rates are quite high, with only a small proportion of elvers which enter <Col N="155" /> any river system surviving to become breeding adults.</P>
    <P>I am also advised that a minimum of four tonnes of elvers annually is the recommended level to guarantee a viable eel fishery in the Shannon system.  I am advised that the co-operative action by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and the ESB over recent years has resulted in this annual target being achieved.</P>

    <P>Expenditure in 1998 is expected to amount to £137 million, equivalent to 0.32 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The resources available for official development assisstance (ODA) have increased significantly in recent years.  Between 1992 and 1997, the budget has increased from £40 million to £122 <Col N="156" /> million &mdash; a three-fold increase.  Expressed as a percentage of GNP, the growth has been from 0.16 per cent to 0.31 per cent.  Relative to other donors, the Irish performance as a percentage of GNP has increased from less than half the average of all donors in 1992 to a position of now exceeding the donor average.  The Government is committed to maintaining a rapid rate of growth of ODA with a view to reaching 0.45 per cent of GNP by the year 2002, as an interim step on the way to reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>Apart from the obvious consequence of permitting the ODA programme to increase in size, the budgetary expansion has facilitated qualitative change and improvement in our approach.  In practical terms, this means we are able to support coherent development programmes targeted at the economic and social sectors.  Assistance is provided for measures to support the quality of life and productivity of poor people, through, for example, the provision of basic education, primary health care and clean drinking water.  The methods employed are kept as basic as possible, in line with locally available expertise and resources and in close collaboration with the recipient countries.</P>
    <P>The composition of the Irish aid programme, therefore, reflects our objectives of reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development in some of the poorest countries in the world; establishing and maintaining peace in developing countries by strengthening democracy, respect for human rights, gender and social equality; protecting the environment and providing a humanitarian response to natural and man-made disasters; and initiating measures to prevent impending emergencies, and building civil society and social solidarity.</P>
    <P>Ireland's bilateral aid programme is concentrated on the priority countries of Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. The other countries to which we have contributed under the bilateral aid programme includes South Africa, Zimbabwe, Sudan, the Occupied Territories, Albania, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Eritrea and Vietnam.  These countries are among the poorest in the world and as a consequence the proportion of Irish Aid allocated to them is very high.  Our fellowships, development education and co-financing schemes cover a broad range of developing countries which benefit from our bilateral aid programme.  Funds are also made available to agencies working in countries suffering from or recovering from natural or man-made disasters.  In recent years, these have been largely spent in Bosnia, Central Africa and Angola.  Contributions to Irish and foreign NGO's ensure that development projects are funded in a wide-range of countries not only in Southern Africa but also in Asia and Central and Latin America.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> Through our multilateral aid programme we contribute to the European Union's European Development Fund in respect of the developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific and we also make contributions for development co-operation purposes in Asia and Latin America. In addition we contribute to the UN development agencies such as UNICEF, UNDP and UNHCR which provide assistance throughout the developing world.</P>

      <P>The issue of human rights is a priority policy concern of this Government and, as such, is a central component of our foreign policy.  We believe that the international community has legitimate concerns in this area and we are conscious of the responsibility which devolves on all governments to promote and protect human rights.</P>
      <P>In co-operation with our EU partners we continue to monitor closely the human rights situations in a number of countries.  On many occasions we have identified situations which gave cause for serious concern.  For example, at the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly in November, the common EU statement highlighted our common anxiety at human rights violations in certain countries which are of particular concern at the moment, such as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Belarus, Turkey, the Great Lakes Region of Africa, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Niger, the Sudan, Algeria, China, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Cambodia, Burma-Myanmar, East Timor, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Cuba and Colombia.  It may be necessary to address these concerns again at the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights which will convene in Geneva in March 1998.  Hopefully, we will also be in a position to welcome improvements in this area as a result of international efforts and dialogue.  In that regard, we believe that applying international pressure through appropriate multilateral international organisations is the most effective means of eliminating human rights violations.</P>
      <P>As I recently assured the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ireland will continue to fulfil our obligation to promote the observance of universal human rights standards.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="158" /> We will also continue to raise our concerns in International fora such as UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe, the OSCE and through the European Union.</P>

      <P>Both the Minister of State and I met the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights prior to the inauguration of President McAleese on 11 November last.  This was our first meeting since her appointment and, on behalf of the Government, I offered her our full support in her endeavours to promote universal human rights standards throughout the world.</P>
      <P>We took the opportunity to discuss a number of issues of common concern, including the strengthening of the office of the High Commissioner, the reform proposals of the UN Secretary-General in relation to human rights activities within the UN system and the human rights situations in Algeria, China and East Timor.  We very much welcomed her interest in visiting China to get a first hand impression of the situation there and to meet with the appropriate Chinese officials.  Regarding the situation in East Timor, we assured her of our support for the Secretary-General's Special Representative and for the opening of a UN human rights office in Jakarta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, on 27 November last, the Minister of State travelled to Geneva for a wide-ranging discussion with Mrs. Robinson on matters of mutual concern to the High Commissioner and the Government.  Before turning to specific human rights situations in a number of countries, they discussed the significant human rights anniversaries which fall in 1998, i.e. the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Five-Year Implementation Review of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.  The High Commissioner gave details of the plans at international level for commemorating these events while the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, gave a brief outline of <Col N="159" /> the national events that were being considered to mark the anniversaries here in Ireland, such as the forthcoming NGO Human Rights Forum in the spring.  It was agreed that these anniversaries provided an important opportunity to measure the progress made in translating the principles set out in the two Declarations into meaningful action.</P>
    <P>In view of her planned visit to Rwanda, the High Commissioner spoke of her determination to restore proper monitoring mechanisms there and in other countries of the Great Lakes region and she was informed that this was a project which Ireland would wholeheartedly support.  She went on to acknowledge the complexity of the human rights situation in Algeria while the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, reiterated the concerns of the Government on that point.  The Minister of State also expressed our desire to work closely with both the High Commissioner and the international community to relieve the sufferings of the Algerian people.  The human rights situations in Cambodia and Burma were also raised during their meeting.</P>
    <P>These two meetings facilitated a most useful exchange of views on a number of pressing human rights issues.  They also provided an opportunity to look at ways in which we might usefully co-ordinate our efforts to ensure respect for human rights and to further the promotion of universal standards.  We now look forward to working closely with the Office of the High Commissioner and with other relevant international organisations to achieve those objectives in the coming years.</P>

      <P>As I explained in the Dáil debate on 8 October last, it has been a priority for me to ensure that the BSE related restrictions on our live cattle trade to Egypt are removed.  A commitment in principle to reopen the market for Irish cattle was communicated on 4 June to my predecessor, subject to agreement on a number of conditions. Discussions at technical level in relation to these conditions followed but final agreement on reopening the market was delayed due to increased concerns in Egypt relating to food imports generally.  In view of this I contacted the Egyptian Deputy Premier and Minister for Agriculture Dr. Wally and met him in Cairo on 28 September.  I also met the Minister for Trade and Supply Dr. Goweily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of my meetings, the Egyptian authorities agreed to consider accepting a trial shipment of live cattle from Ireland.  The formulation of a proposal which would allay the concerns of the Egyptian authorities, necessitated a veterinary and engineering assessment of quarantine and slaughtering facilities in Egypt.  This way completed in early November and a detailed proposal, <Col N="164" /> drawn up by my Department in conjunction with the Irish Livestock Exporters Association was forwarded by me to Dr. Wally on 20 November.  This proposal is now being considered by the Egyptian authorities and pending a response further political intervention is not appropriate at this stage.</P>

    <P>There is no obvious pattern in cattle prices at the beginning of the DSP period.  The above table shows that, since the introduction of the DSP in 1993, prices for January compared to the previous two weeks fell in three years &mdash; 1993, 1996 and 1997, increased in 1994 and remained unchanged in 1995.  However, a comparison between prices in the two weeks immediately preceding the DSP period and average steer prices over the full DSP period, reveals that the latter prices were higher in 1993, 1994 and 1995 and lower in 1996 and 1997.</P>
    <P>As with all commodities cattle prices are determined primarily by the situation on the market and by other factors, including decisions made at EU level in relation to intervention purchasing and export refunds.  In general, it should be noted that cattle prices are traditionally higher in December than in the first two weeks of January because of strong demand in the pre-Christmas period combined with lower supplies.  More particularly, the lower prices in January 1993 reflected the uncertainty on the market following the decision by the European Union in December 1992 to introduce a carcase weight limit on sales into intervention.  The lower prices in January 1996 and 1997 can be largely attributed, in the case of 1996, to a substantial reduction in export <Col N="165" /> refunds in the autumn of 1995 and, in the case of 1997, to a reduction in export refunds and a revaluation of the Irish Green Pound.</P>

      <P>The annual report by the European Court of Auditors on the EU budget for the financial year 1996 was published on 18 November 1997.  The Court of Auditors, in its Statement of Assurance, was unable to give an affirmative statement regarding the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying payments.  Based on a sample of transactions, projection of the results of its sample <Col N="166" /> gave an error rate of 5.4 per cent of all payments effected in 1996.  This figure is lower than the corresponding figure for 1995.  It would be wrong to assume that all of these errors in payments involve fraud, many refer to irregularities of one kind or another.  This fact has been acknowledged by the President of the Court of Auditors, who also referred to the process being made by both the Commission and member states as part of the ongoing initiative &mdash; SEM 2000 &mdash; to improve the management of EU funds.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the Government, in common with other member states and the European Commission, is concerned about the existence of fraud or irregularity in EU funding.  Indeed, article 209a of the Treaty on European Union obliges member states to take the same measures to counter fraud affecting the financial interests of the Community as they take to protect their own financial interests.  The Government is fully committed to combating the misuse of Community resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the income from foreign travel duty, i.e. travel tax for 1996, the last full year for which figures are available, was £12,315,080.  The breakdown of this figure was £10,923,720 from air travel and £1,391,360 from sea travel.  The corresponding figures for the first ten months of 1997 are £9,979,955 from air travel and £1,146,265 from sea travel, making a total of £11,126,220.</P>
      <P>The tax imposed by section 65 (2) of the Finance Act, 1982, is charged on &ldquo;each and every passenger ticket relating wholly or partly to carriage by a ship or an aircraft on a voyage or a flight, as the case may be, commencing in the State to a destination, other than Northern Ireland, outside the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>By virtue of section 74 (2) of the Finance Act, 1984 a passenger ticket within the meaning of the above definition received in the State on or after the 26 January 1984 shall &mdash;&ldquo;notwithstanding that it was sent or brought to the State from outside the State, be deemed, for the purpose of the said section 65, to have been issued in the State and to have been so issued on the date on which it was sent or brought into the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The tax is payable by carriers.  The legal definition of &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; contained in section 65 (1) of the Finance Act, 1982, is: a person being a person who performs the carriage of persons by ship or aircraft who as a principal makes an agreement for the carriage of a person by ship or by aircraft either with the person to be so carried or with a person not being a person who performs the carriage of persons by ship or by aircraft acting on the latter's behalf.</P>
      <P>The effect of the 1984 amendment was to establish that travel tax is now levied on all chargeable tickets issued both in the State and abroad for travel commencing in the State to a place, other than Northern Ireland, outside the State.</P>
      <P>The tax is not, however, chargeable on travel which commences outside the State &mdash; most tourists would fall into this category.  Therefore, carriers who carry passengers into the State and then take them to place outside the State as part of the same journey or who return them to their place of departure on a return ticket, are not liable to travel tax in Ireland.  They may, or course, have liability to similar taxes in other countries in respect of such journeys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not, of course, have any responsibilities concerning taxes applied by other jurisdictions to travellers, nor is it my function to comment on them.  However, for the information of the <Col N="168" /> Deputy, &ldquo;Air Passenger Duty&rdquo; in the United Kingdom applies to both domestic and foreign travel by air.  It does not apply to travel by sea. In the particular context of the question put by the Deputy three main differences appear to be: the UK tax applies to both domestic and foreign air travel; the Irish tax applies only to travel commencing in the State, whereas the UK tax, subject to some exceptions such as connecting flights, can apply to the return leg of a journey by air, the outward leg of which commenced outside the United Kingdom; and the UK applies a higher rate of tax to non-EU travel than to EU and domestic travel.</P>

      <P>A revised programme of pre-registration nursing education and training was introduced in October 1994 and has since been extended to a large number of schools of nursing.  The programme is operated by schools of nursing in association with third level institutes.  Student nurses who successfuly complete the programme will be awarded a diploma in nursing from the associated third level institute and will be eligible to be registered with An Bord Altranais, which in turn will render them eligible for employment as nurses.  It is my intention that the transition to the revised model of pre-registration training will be completed in all three nursing disciplines in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In tandem with the developments in pre-registration education and training, the third level institutes which are involved in the delivery of the registration-diploma programme, in accordance with the normal procedures applying to such institutes, are developing one year programmes leading to the award of a bachelor or nursing <Col N="169" /> studies degree.  Existing registered nurses are being afforded equal opportunity of access to these degree programmes, either immediately or on the basis of a short access course.  Since any such degree programme will be optional, nurses will be responsible for making their own arrangements for admission to and attendance at such programmes, including the payment of course fees.</P>
    <P>The rationale behind the development of a degree programme is to provide those members of the nursing profession who wish to obtain a post-registration qualification at degree level with an opportunity to do so by means of a one year part-time programme.  However, as I have already stated, a degree in nursing is not a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment.  I am satisfied that it is feasible for nurses working throughout the country to undertake these part-time degree programmes, either through attendance at the colleges or through distance learning, and continue in their current posts.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the Commission on Nursing, in its interim report, has identified a number of issues relating to both pre-registration and post-registration nursing education and training. The commission will address those issues in its final report, which is expected to be finalised during 1998.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would be prudent to await the outcome of the deliberations of the commission before making any changes to the current system of education and training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Respite care is provided both on a planned and an emergency basis by almost all residential care service providers in the Eastern Health Board region.  Respite care is provided in a number of ways.  It is estimated that there is approximately 100 to 150 designated respite beds in the Eastern Health Board region.  In some cases it is provided in a residential setting, which may be in places specifically designated as respite, or alternatively through the use at weekends of places vacated by people who are in receipt of five day residential services.  It is also provided by host families through the various Share a Break schemes.  The home support services can also provide shorter respite breaks for carers.  There are in excess of 750 people availing of respite care and there is no doubting the value of this to both recipients and their carers.</P>
      <P>Funding provided to the Eastern Health Board in 1997 towards emergency placements, which was over and above funding provided for the development of additional day and residential-respite places, did in many cases, allow for the freeing up of respite places and up to 20 extra respite beds became available.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to continue to expand respite care for persons with a mental handicap in order to improve the service available so that individuals can continue to live in the community for as long as is possible before being placed in residential care.  I am pleased to say that I am providing additional funding of £16 million for services to persons with a mental handicap in 1998.  This includes additional revenue funding of £7 million, as announced in the recent budget, for the provision of new residential-respite and day places and £3.75 million, provided for in the Estimates, to strengthen the existing services.  Sustained capital investment is needed to support these developments.</P>
      <P>I recently announced the establishment of a £30 million capital programme to develop the mental handicap services including day, residential and respite places for persons who have been assessed as in need of such places.  As part of this programme £5.25 million capital funding is being provided in 1998.</P>

The hospital authorities have explained that it is necessary to make a number of their monitors available for use by in-patients and emergency admissions and this has contributed to their current waiting list for out-patients.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, additional resources have been made available to the hospital which have allowed for the purchase of two new blood pressure monitors and one new portable heart monitor in the past week and I am confident that this will have a favourable impact on existing waiting times for out-patients.</P>

      <Quest>whether any civil actions remain pending in the courts brought against the Blood Transfusion Service Board by claimants who have contracted hepatitis C; if so, the number of these cases; and the approach, if any, being taken by the Government regarding these claims.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 744 civil actions pending in the courts against the Blood Transfusion Service Board and others which have been brought by persons who contracted hepatitis C through the administration within the State of blood and blood products.  The majority of these persons have also lodged claims with the hepatitis C compensation tribunal and I would hope that the bulk of cases will be resolved in that forum.  In order to expedite the processing of claims before the compensation tribunal, I have made arrangements under section 8 of the hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997 to provide for the settlement of claims.  The arrangements will operate as informally as possible and in a manner which ensures that settlement offers are made as early as possible.  Settlement offers will be based on the same criteria applied by the tribunal under section 5 of the Act in relation to the level of awards.  Where a claimant accepts a settlement offer, the claimant is entitled to an additional amount of 20 per cent from the reparation fund established under section 11 of the Act, in lieu of the tribunal assessing and awarding aggravated or exemplary damages.  I will shortly be making additional appointments to the tribunal and I anticipate that this will facilitate a greater throughput of cases for decision before the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to persons who have decided to pursue court proceedings rather than going before the compensation tribunal, my objective is to ensure that they will be required to establish no more or no less than the proofs which are required to obtain compensation before the tribunal, and that the cases will thus be dealt with as an assessment of damages only.  As the House is aware, the BTSB has decided that it will admit liability for negligence in court proceedings where plaintiffs were directly or indirectly <Col N="173" /> infected with the hepatitis C through anti-D Immunoglobulin supplied by the board.  In such proceedings, and in other court proceedings where plaintiffs allege infection with hepatitis C from blood, blood components or derivatives supplied by the board, the BTSB will admit the findings of fact contained in the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the BTSB.  This admission will enable the plaintiffs to recover full compensatory damages in the proceedings without having to prove negligence and they will, therefore, be able to treat the proceedings as an assessment of compensatory damages only.  If the plaintiffs wish, the court, at the hearing of the proceedings, will only be asked to determine three issues, namely: the amount of compensatory damages to be awarded; whether aggravatedexemplary damages ought to be awarded; and if so, the amount of such damages.</P>
    <P>The legal advice available to me is that the State itself is not liable, except in a limited number of cases arising out of the facts described in chapter 6 of the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the BTSB.  This relates to the delay in the introduction of hepatitis C screening between February 1991 and September 1991.  The State proposes to admit liability in such cases.  In addition, the State also proposes to admit liability in any case which is attributable to the inadequate recall procedure as outlined in chapter 13 of the report.  As these cases identify themselves, the State will admit liability at the earliest opportunity. Everything possible will be done to facilitate an early hearing of cases before the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The promotion of water safety is a matter for the local authorities and the National Safety Council.  The role of the local authorities includes the making of by-laws for the regulation of bathing places, the employment of life guards, the provisions of equipment and appliances for life saving and arranging for instruction in swimming and life saving.</P>
      <P>The NSC actively promotes the dissemination of information on water safety, liaises with the Department of Education on water safety matters for school children, issues guidelines for local authorities on water safety matters and through local communities, organises and supports swimming, life saving and resuscitation courses, over 80,000 certificates were awarded to people who attended such courses in 1996.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the amalgamation of safety promotion functions in the NSC which has existed since 1988, has operated efficiently and that it has secured the administrative rationalisation and cost-effectiveness on which the establishment of NSC was premised.  The consolidation of safety promotion functions in the NSC has moreover facilitated a greatly increased sponsorship of safety promotion by the Irish Insurance Federation.  Water safety, in common with road safety and fire safety, has benefited from these arrangements.  I have therefore no plans to withdraw the water safety functions from the NSC and allocate them to a new body.</P>
      <P>As regards the position in other countries, there appears to be no single model for the organisation of water safety functions.  The assignment of major promotional responsibilities to a national body together with extensive local authority involvement in on the ground activities, as is the case in Ireland, seems however to be a common arrangement.  The National Safety Council is affiliated to International Life Saving and participates actively in international co-operation on water safety.</P>

      <P>This year's Christmas bonus was paid in the first week of December to 722,000 people who receive long-term social welfare payments including: disablement pension, death benefit by way of pension, old age contributory and non-contributory pensions, retirement pension, invalidity pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, widow's and widower's contributory pension, orphan's contributory and non-contributory pensions, preretirement allowance, blind pension, carer's allowance, one parent family payment, payments to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, disability allowance.  The bonus payment amounts to 70 per cent of the person's normal weekly payment subject to a minimum bonus payment of £20.  The cost of this measure is estimated at £41 million.  The bonus is targeted at those who are on long-term payments and there are no plans to extend it to recipients of short-term payments.</P>

      <P>The free schemes such as the free electricity allowance, the free telephone rental allowance and free television licence are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition.  In addition, widows and widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes, retain that entitlement.  Widows and widowers may also be eligible for a fuel allowance subject to satisfying a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> There are an estimated 17,000 widows-widowers between the ages of 60 and 65.  My Department does not maintain statistics on the number of widows over the age of 60 whose late husbands died aged under 66 years.  The extension of the free schemes to all widows, aged 60-65 years, could involve estimated additional expenditure of up to £7 million in a full year.  The extension of these schemes could only be examined in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>Natural heritage areas are as yet at the proposal stage and will not be designated until the necessary amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1976, has been enacted.  Consequently, no specific restrictions apply to land proposed for NHA status.  Planning authorities and grant-aiding authorities are, however, obliged to consult with the National Parks and Wildlife Service before approving developments in these areas to advise whether proposed developments are likely to be environmentally damaging.  Under the rural environment protection scheme, participating farmers in these areas are required to farm in an environmentally friendly manner and thereby qualify for a top-up payment of £12 per acre.</P>
      <P>The general position in proposed SACs and SPAs is that the EU Habitats and Bird Directives require that an assessment be carried out of operations or activities proposed for these areas, and if it appears that the ecology of the area will suffer in a significant way, the proposal may not proceed save for reasons of overriding public interest.  In proposed SAC areas hosting priority habitats or species, the only considerations which may be raised are those relating to human health or public safety, to beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment, or, further to an opinion from the European Commission, to other imperative reasons of overriding public interest.  Farmers with land in those areas will be required to farm in accordance with an approved agri-environmental plan, which will specify any conditions or restrictions necessary to protect the relevant habitats or species.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 88, 89, 90, 91 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>Further to my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 324 of 25 November last seeking copies of submissions made in relation to the proposed special area of conservation at the White Strand, Doonbeg, County Clare, it will be appreciated that a number of submissions may be made to my Department relating to any such similar site, ranging from single letters to quite large documents with many pages.  As I stated in that reply, I considered that it would be impractical to furnish copies of the submissions to the Deputy in regard to the White Strand but I offered the Deputy the opportunity to inspect all the relevant papers in the offices of my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service, if he wished to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" /> The present questions from the Deputy relate to a further six sites, however, and I am reluctant to commit the considerable staff time which would be necessary to allow the NPWS to carry out the necessary research to prepare the comprehensive information sought in relation to those further sites.  I would stress that the difficulties relate solely to the pressures on staff resources and in no way imply a lack of transparency. Indeed, I might point out that I have already supplied the Deputy with copies of submissions relating to the Glen of the Downs, as requested in his Question No. 326 of 25 November last.  However, the resources at my Department's disposal are finite and I regret that it is not possible to accede to the Deputy's much broader request at this time.  If, however, the Deputy is in a position to indicate a particular and pressing need for information in relation to any of the sites involved, I will be glad to consider the matter further.</P>

      <P>The Coroner's inquest into the death of the person referred to by the Deputy has not yet been held.  At 4.25 a.m. on 21 November 1997 an officer found the deceased hanging from the window in his cell.  Two officers entered the cell and removed the ligature from his neck.  The medical orderly attempted to revive him but failed.</P>
      <P>The Garda, ambulance service, a doctor and a priest were alerted.  The doctor pronounced him dead at 5.10 a.m. and the remains were removed to the Regional Hospital, Dooradoyle, at 6.05 a.m. The offender was being observed every hour.</P>
      <P>This death, like any other death in custody, is the subject of a Garda investigation and an inquest.  In addition, the circumstances of each death are examined by the suicide awareness group in each prison.  These examinations fully cover the background and circumstances of each death.  Their objective is to identify, where possible, measures which might be taken to contribute to the prevention of such tragic deaths in the future.  My Department's press officer issued a statement which contained the above information on 21 November 1997.</P>

      <P>Prisoners are granted temporary release for a variety of reasons ranging from a few hours to attend a funeral to full temporary release which is, in effect, our system of parole.  Accordingly the number of offenders on temporary release changes from day to day and statistics are not maintained in a fashion which would allow the number of persons on temporary release per month to be readily extracted.  In 1994, the latest year for which accurate figures are available, the number of full or renewable temporary releases granted was 6,922.  This figure does not include short fixed periods of temporary release granted in that year.  Figures for 1995, 1996 and 1997 have not yet been collated but I will, of course, be happy to let the Deputy have them as soon as they become available. <Col N="180" /></P>

      <P>The number of offenders on renewable temporary release from Mountjoy Prison can vary substantially from week to week and as such the number required to report to the prison on any one day can vary between 30 and 50.</P>
      <P>The granting of temporary release is a statutory function of the Minister for Justice under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  In cases where renewable temporary release is granted, a precondition of the release is that the offender must report back to the prison from which he or she is on release on a specified date to sign on and have his or her temporary release renewed.  It may also be a condition of renewable temporary release that offenders report at their local Garda station on a daily basis.  I am aware of the concerns of residents in the area surrounding Mountjoy and I can assure the Deputy that once the new prison accommodation becomes available that every effort will be made to reduce the level of renewable temporary release.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact where renewable temporary release is granted to an offender it can only be renewed by the governor of the relevant prison in consultation with the prison division of my Department.</P>

The salary costs in respect of these officers, the General Secretary and the Deputy General Secretary of the POA, are refunded to my Department by the POA.

      <P>The special leave was granted on the condition that the officer would not be replaced in the prison service, that the period of special leave would not extend for more than three years and that the arrangement would be reviewed annually.  At each of the annual reviews in 1996 and 1997 it was decided to allow the special leave continue. The three year period of special leave will, however, expire on 30 April next year.</P>

These posts were allocated on the basis of criteria agreed between representatives of school management, the teacher unions, parents and my Department.  Factors which were taken into account were: the number of first year pupils whose parents are in receipt of unemployment assistance or benefit; the number of first year pupils living in rented local authority housing and non-permanent accommodation; the number of first year rural pupils from a deprived economic background; the number of first year pupils living with lone parents; the number of first year pupils whose parents hold a medical card; the number of first year pupils with significant literacy and numeracy difficulties and the percentage of pupils who drop out of school at or about 15 years of age without any formal educational <Col N="184" /> qualifications.  Schools were ranked in order of merit and the posts were allocated accordingly.</P>

      <P>The report of the advisory committee on third level student support, chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitléir, was published in February 1995.  The advisory committee found the present system of student support to be fragmented, cumbersome and very confusing for grant applicants.  It identified overlaps and duplication with up to 70 different organisations involved in the administration of the grant schemes.  It also found that payments were too frequently delayed and that students were often disadvantaged by various administrative problems in the system.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee recommended that the three existing schemes, which have the same means test, the same rate of grant and cover virtually the same courses, should have a single application form.  It also recommended significant changes in the processing of grant applications and payments.</P>
      <P>In August 1997 a joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs commenced an examination of various options for the future administration of the student support schemes including the case for and against transferring this activity to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  I accept that the current administration of the student support schemes needs to be improved.  Apart from the reservations about the need for a new body, I have an open mind as to what the best and most appropriate options are for a new centralised system.  My priority is to ensure that the system properly addresses the concerns of students and parents.</P>
      <P>On the question of the expansion of the scheme, I have recently announced that I intend to introduce maintenance grants for students attending post leaving certificate courses.  I intend that these grants, which will be at the same level as the third level maintenance grants, will be available to students who are registered on PLC courses as of September 1998.  While the method and timing of these payments may take some time to finalise they will meet our commitments in an Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

      <Quest>whether a scheme is being drawn up by his Department to extend the targeted approach at second level schools towards increased access to third level institutions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental policy objective of promoting equality of access to, participation in and benefit from higher education is well established as is the need for a holistic approach to promote equality rather than policies focused only on the third-level sector and on the transition from second to third level.  Fuller participation in third level also depends on ensuring retention of students in full-time education at first and second levels.  In this regard, my Department has a range of strategies in place throughout the education system.  These include the development of Early Start centres; the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas; the Breaking the Cycle pilot project; the home school community liaison scheme; curricular reforms to allow students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes; support for junior and senior centres for travellers; the free book scheme, and alleviation of examination fees for necessitous pupils; a new initiative focused on structured pilot projects in urban and rural disadvantaged areas which test models for the development of an integrated areas based co-ordination of services to cater for young people aged eight to 15 years at risk of early school leaving; the development of second chance education and training options through Youthreach and VTOS.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department provided £77,000 in 1997 in direct financing for three access initiatives involving Dublin City University, University of Limerick and Trinity College to improve participation of pupils from disadvantaged areas at third level.  The initiatives involve linkages between the colleges and local second level schools and incorporate supervised study facilities, extra tuition for pupils, information and advice for parents and pupils, including seminars, mentoring and support teaching in key subject areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to measures specifically at third level, the Higher Education Authority has provided £260,000 in 1996 and £475,000 in 1997 for initiatives in a number of colleges specifically relating to disadvantaged students.  These initiatives, build on existing programmes and involve links with second-level schools and local communities. For this reason it will take some time for the effect of the programmes to be reflected in the actual numbers going on to higher education. The programmes will assist some students to meet the points requirement for courses, enabling them to obtain a college place through the standard CAO entry procedure.  The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry <Col N="186" /> arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports put in place for students entering by this method.</P>
    <P>In the technological sector, the Dublin Institute of Technology, Waterford Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges have a comprehensive set of activities in which the colleges interact with second level schools and disadvantaged groups.</P>
    <P>A policy decision has been taken by the Dublin Institute of Technology authorities that direct entry should occur in relation to second level students from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not meet the normal admission criteria.  The recruitment and admissions committee of Dublin Institute of Technology is discussing details of this decision including the mechanism for its implementation and the quota of students involved.</P>
    <P>The Regional Technical College Equality Network Project which arose out of the EU Programme New Opportunities for Women, is operational in six regional technical colleges. Programmes under the project are specifically aimed at encouraging more participation by women in third level education, with specific focus at women who have been disadvantaged by a lack of educational opportunities.  These programmes include school taster programmes and a new module in mathematics for female transition year students.</P>
    <P>In 1995, approval was given for a pilot scheme which enables holders of NCVA level 2 awards to progress to designated certificate and diploma courses in all regional technical colleges throughout the country.  The scheme was extended to cover additional courses in regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology in 1996.  This pilot scheme is an important development in establishing alternative progression pathways for students to higher levels of education and training.</P>
