      <P>It is proposed to take the report from the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy on the Credit Union Bill, 1996; No. 22, the Freedom of Information Bill, 1996 [Seanad], Report and Final Stages; No. 23, the Organisation of Working Time Bill, 1996, Report and Final Stages; and No. 2, the Youth Work Bill, 1997, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the Report and Final Stages of No. 22 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion not later than two hours after its commencement by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Tánaiste; and (2) the Report and Final Stages of No. 23 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Courts Service Bill is to be published shortly.  In view of the comments by the Law Society regarding the urgency of this Bill, perhaps the Taoiseach will tell us when it will be published.</P>
      <P>On a morning when the headlines in the newspapers are about the soaring profits quickly leading to the privatisation of Aer Lingus, may I ask the Taoiseach when the legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister, against his colleagues in the Labour Party, going ahead and organising the privatisation?  Will the Taoiseach or the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, please tell the House what cosy arrangement is going on behind the board and workers in Aer Lingus?  What involvement has the Labour Party in what is going on in Aer Lingus?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Courts Service Bill is receiving urgent attention and will be ready next week.  I am glad the Deputy mentioned the Law Society because it has particularly complimented the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, on the priority she is giving to court reform and the unprecedented progress that has been made in court reform during her tenure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as Aer Lingus is concerned it is a matter of congratulation for all involved in the company that such a high level of profit has been achieved.  It is also prudent that the board should look at the possibility of making strategic alliances so that those profits can be enhanced and the job security of the employees in Aer Lingus can be enhanced also.  The attempt by Fianna Fáil to politicise this issue in the way they are is detrimental to the interests of the employees in Aer Lingus whose job security will be enhanced by any arrangements that the board, upon which the employees have representation, makes in order to ensure that jobs are secure and that the business is in hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>The Taoiseach became involved in the Northern Ireland election yesterday evening by stating that a vote for Sinn Féin was a vote for the IRA.  Will he show the same honesty during the election here in a few weeks' time by telling the electorate that a vote for Fine Gael is a vote for Democratic Left?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will advise the people who intend to vote for Fine Gael to continue their preferences for the Labour Party and Democratic Left to keep a good Government in office.

      <P>Today and next Tuesday the Select Committee on Social Affairs will take oral submissions from approximately 15 bodies on the Education Bill.  An attempt was made to take Committee Stage on Wednesday, but I am glad that pressure forced the Government to relent. An attempt was also made to reduce the status of the Select Committee on Social Affairs in the Government scheme of things.  Some 300 amendments have been submitted by interested parties. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment not to guillotine Committee Stage of the Education Bill because I want to avoid the unseemly rows we had in this House when Second Stage was guillotined?</P>

      <P>We can leave the matter confidently in its hands.  It is important that this legislation is passed so that parents will, for the first time, have an opportunity to participate in educational decision-making and that an Irish statutory base is set up for Irish education so that we do not continue to rely on British statutes in this regard.</P>

      <P>Earlier this week the Government published its list of legislation but it did not include legislation on the hepatitis C compensation tribunal.  The Taoiseach seemed to suggest that I should amend his list.  At the Whips' meeting last night we were given an indication of the business to be taken in the House in the next three weeks.  However, there was no mention of the hepatitis C Bill.  The Family Law Bill, which seeks to change the situation in relation to void marriages, was not included either.  The Government has given a commitment on these issues, yet it has not included them in the list for the next three weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the question about marriages, a written question on today's Order Paper to the Minister for Health will provide the Deputy with the relevant information.  As regards the other matter, I do not expect the relevant legislation to be before the House within the next three weeks but it is being worked on intensively at present.  I have already indicated it is a priority issue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 27, to delete &ldquo;AMEND&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;REPEAL&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed this matter at the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  It deals with the long title of the Bill in which the Minister provides that the Bill will amend the Official Secrets Act, 1963.  As the Minister will be aware, the committee <Col N="748" /> which reviewed the Official Secrets Act recommended the repeal of that Act and the Select Committee on Legislation and Security accepted that recommendation.  Therefore, I cannot understand why &ldquo;AMEND&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;REPEAL&rdquo; appears in the long title.  The Minister discussed this previously but we must be clear that the intention is to repeal that Act.</P>
    <P>I asked the Taoiseach on the Order of Business when this House would debate the report of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security on the Official Secrets Act, 1963.  We are now on the eve of a general election and it appears that the Government has not taken on board the recommendations of that committee or sought to have that report debated in this House.  If there is to be freedom of information, transparency and accountability, one must deal with the Official Secrets Act.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has already stated in this House that it does not intend to delay the Freedom of Information Bill but legislation is required to deal with the Official Secrets Act and it must first be debated in this House.  The Taoiseach stated in a reply to Deputy Kitt that there were no plans to change the Official Secrets Act but he was contradicted by Deputy Flanagan, the Chairman of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security. The report of that committee which was based on consultation with law lecturer, Mr. Mel Cousins, recommended the outright repeal of the Official Secrets Act which it describes as having contributed significantly to a culture of secrecy in the Civil Service and as being inconsistent with rights to freedom of expression and the principles of good government.</P>
    <P>The Official Secrets Act, 1963, which was modelled on the best British practice of the time, protects just about every document connected with the running of the country.  In case there would be any doubt, it allows a Minister to make a document secret or confidential simply by certifying it so.  We will refer to that section later.</P>
    <P>The Official Secrets Act also gives the prosecution, rather than the court, sweeping <i>in camera</i> powers and it has been used to intimidate and, on occasion, prosecute journalists, such as Ms Susan O'Keeffe and Ms Liz Allen.  In the more recent case, Ms Allen was prosecuted for publishing a Garda document where the Garda Síochána claimed that disclosure of a mistake by gardaí in the Brink's-Allied robbery investigation prejudiced its officers, even though the information published by the journalist was already widely known.  That is the type of information to which we seek access.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to examine this Bill because it could, with the appropriate amendments, repeal and replace the Official Secrets Act, 1963.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because we debated this matter at length on Committee Stage.  It is a pity that we are not repealing the Official Secrets Act, 1963, at the same time as enacting this radical Bill.  The creation of the right <Col N="749" /> of access to records is the most important single provision of this Bill but, as I said on Committee Stage, this is subject to a wide and dangerous range of exceptions.  The proof of this legislation will be how those exemptions are enforced and used by the person who is withholding the information.</P>
      <P>There is little point in announcing a principle of openness and access to information if everything sensitive to the authorities can be excluded by way of exemption.  Section 4 of the Official Secrets Act, 1963, makes it a crime to communicate official information unless such communication is permitted.  Section 6 of this Bill extends considerably the circumstances in which such communication is permitted.  In so far as it goes, that is a good development and an improvement on the <i>status quo.</i> However, this Bill does not obliterate the mindset which treats official information as being secret unless there is an exception. To do that we would have to repeal and replace the Official Secrets Act in its entirety.</P>
      <P>The Select Committee on Legislation and Security recommended that the Official Secrets Act, 1963, be repealed as soon as possible.  Given that this Bill will not come into force for a year after it is enacted, it should be possible to introduce a Bill to repeal the Official Secrets Act.  It would be better, in terms of clarity and commitment to the creation of a brave new world in terms of access to information and open Government within a modern democracy, if the Government simultaneously repealed the Official Secrets Act.  It is totally illogical to enact a Freedom of Information Bill while retaining the Official Secrets Act on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>The Opposition advocate the repeal of the Official Secrets Act and is backed up by the excellent work and report of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security in teasing out the relevant issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy McDaid's amendments which are fundamental to the overall consideration of freedom of information.</P>
      <P>While the Bill has been described as an improvement, it represents no great step forward or leap into the future, contains no bold initiative and, by definition, will maintain the culture of secrecy within the public service.  We have reached the stage where we should be prepared to repeal the Official Secrets Act 1963 and replace it with more appropriate legislative measures which have been proposed by Members on this side of the House and discussed in great detail before being endorsed by the report of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outcome of the deliberations and examination of this Bill by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, chaired by a Member of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Flanagan, who has a deep interest in this area backed up by considerable experience, was its recommendation the Official Secrets Act be repealed without which, it <Col N="750" /> said, very little progress will be made.  In paragraph 4 of its recommendations the committee stated that the Official Secrets Act, 1963 should be repealed at the earliest possible date and should be replaced by criminal sanctions in relation to espionage and the unauthorised disclosure of specific categories of information, which does or may cause serious harm to the national interest.</P>
    <P>The fundamental question arises: who determines what is the national interest?  Is it necessary to protect the national interest?  Of course it is. That issue has been thrown in as a red herring from time to time merely to maintain the culture of secrecy which should be abolished, in the public service.  The select committee is correct in saying that the Official Secrets Act 1963 should be repealed and replaced.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 5 of its report the Select Committee on Legislation and Security recommends that Circular 15/79 should be withdrawn and that the circular issued in its place, following enactment of this Bill, should clarify the position in relation to disciplinary proceedings arising from unauthorised disclosure of information which would be no longer a criminal offence on repeal of the Official Secrets Act.</P>
    <P>People wonder why they do not receive information from the public service, specifically the Civil Service.  The reason is every civil servant, on recruitment, must sign Circular 15/79 which says, in effect, everything is secret unless otherwise stipulated by some higher officer.  While some people may contend that a civil servant may provide a great deal of information without being questioned, that is fine as long as nothing goes wrong but, whenever it does, that junior, middle or high ranking civil servant will be subjected, in retrospect, to the decision of a senior officer or the Minister.  That type of secretive system stultifies imagination, initiative and development within the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Why the Minister strayed from the broader approach to freedom of information I do not know but it appears that something frightened off the Government and Minister; somebody got to them between the time the initial proposals were advanced and the greater examination began. What Members want is an open Civil Service, backed up by the necessary controls clearly identified by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security which engaged in an excellent analysis of this issue.  It was one of the most incisive, valuable exercises ever undertaken by a committee of the House and has been particularly helpful to Members.</P>
    <P>However, what we propose to enact is a half measure.  I do not know why the Tánaiste, who is so enthusiastic about freedom of information, has backed down.  There is no doubt that as long as the Official Secrets Act, 1963 remains on the Statute Book, accompanied by Circular 15/79, all talk about strategic management amounts to mere psycho-babble.  Let us address it in the full realisation of what is being proposed.  If we do not <Col N="751" /> break down the culture of secrecy binding civil servants, their potential will remain untapped and development will be stymied within the Civil Service. That begs the question: in whose interest is it to stifle that potential?  One does not need to be a genius to answer that, for two different reasons: first at Government level where there is a fear of information being too readily available and, second, at management level where power and control is vested in the head of the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is telling us separately that what she wants to do is hive off much of that activity, vesting even greater power in the heads of Departments.  That cannot be done without repealing the Official Secrets Act.  Tackling the culture of secrecy is fundamental to the principle of this Bill.  It appears there is an acceptance of the half measure.  I do not agree with that.  If we accept it we will be perpetuating the culture of secrecy which adversely affects the management of the Civil Service, the flow of information and the readiness with which it is provided.  As long as civil servants can be criminalised by releasing information, a serious problem remains, because they will have to continue to keep their heads down.</P>
    <P>That is not the type of development we want to see; it is not that of an outward-looking, vibrant, young country prepared to take on anybody worldwide and compete in international markets with the support of the Civil Service.  For many years I have noticed the Dutch, who are well known as international merchants trading worldwide, seeking and developing business, and the manner in which its civil service operates in co-operation with industry, agriculture, horticulture and production, as though all were working for the same country albeit with slightly different controls and disciplines.  Their civil servants are free to participate and work with industry.  There is greater mobility between industry and their civil service.  We, too, can have such a system if we only free up our civil servants and afford them greater autonomy.</P>
    <P>In support of what we on this side of the House have advocated, the Select Committee on Legislation and Security has now formally reported &mdash; the Ombudsman and Data Protection Commissioner participated in the committee's deliberations &mdash; that no progress will be made until such time as the Official Secrets Act, 1963 is repealed.</P>
    <P>They would be happy to see the improvements the Minister is making but they came to the meeting and said we would not go anywhere until we did away with the Official Secrets Act and made other provisions.  That is the reason I strongly support the proposals by Deputy McDaid.  We should repeal the Official Secrets Act and introduce a more far reaching Freedom of Information Act.  We should provide for a confidentiality list, establish an independent information commission and an information commissioner.</P>
    <P>This is an important occasion, an opportunity <Col N="752" /> for which the House has waited for some time. Work on this Bill began while Fianna Fáil was in office with the Labour Party but today we are about to pass this legislation without taking into account the Official Secrets Act and its effect. That worries me.  We are in the run-up to an election which will pull the curtain on this work.  The opportunity to take a bold and imaginative step is being lost and half measures are being taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>I regret that we are setting aside the strong recommendation of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security produced after lengthy consideration of all views on the whole matter, taking into account external reports and the views of people directly involved, including the data commissioner, the Ombudsman, and an independent consultant.  Deputy McDaid is right to propose the repeal of the Officials Secrets Act and I support the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments put forward by Deputy McDaid.  This is the final stage of a Bill that purports to facilitate access to information in the public arena.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to a serious matter which I raised also on Committee Stage.  The Minister has failed to grasp the fact that there are Government Departments presided over by Ministers who deliberately and blatantly refuse access to information.  Students for example are treated in a derisory way by Government Departments when they seek freedom of access to information. The Minister should suggest to the Minister for Education before the Bill is passed what should be done with the State examinations appeal system in the Department of Education. The manner in which the Minister and the mandarins in the State examinations branch of the Department of Education treat students is nothing short of disgraceful.  They are denied access to information on the body of evidence presented at the appeals board and they do not know whether their examination papers are fully available.  I am not casting aspersions on the mandarins in the Department of Education, who are professional, fair, honest and decent, but I am casting aspersions on the manner in which successive Governments and successive Ministers have allowed themselves preside over a system where students who appeal examinations are blatantly and deliberately denied access to information and denied representation by their subject teacher.  I have made frequent unsuccessful attempts here, including by way of Dáil questions recently, to right this terrible wrong and I have been virtually ignored.  In our so called democratic world students who appeal the examination results are entitled to all the evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is about repealing the Official Secrets Act.  The Official <Col N="753" /> Secrets Act is invoked every year without fail by the Department of Education and the mandarins in the State examinations branch.  That is what I am getting at and I am appealing to the Minister who purports to be the facilitator of access to public information, to go to her sister Minister and say enough is enough.  Let us put into the public arena information for our students who appeal their examination results and let us stop this cynical, unfair, unjust, and blatantly undemocratic wall of silence, secrecy and concealment that is manifest in the examinations branch.</P>
      <P>The Minister purports to promote freedom of information.  I believe she is genuinely seeking to do that.  If she allows Government Ministers to continue to deliberately withhold information that should be available in the public arena, then this Freedom of Information Bill is a shambles.  If an example is to be given with regard to freedom of information and access to information in the public arena, it must start at the top with the Taoiseach and Government Ministers.  For recent examples of where information has been withheld we do not have to go any further than this Chamber but I will not dwell on that.  My message to the Minister of State is to go to the Minister of Education and demand that the appeals system in the examinations branch be made totally open, transparent, accountable, fair and free in terms of availability and full access to information.</P>
      <P>A Freedom of Information Bill or a Bill revoking an Official Secrets Act becomes meaningless if people believe they are being denied a fundamental and probably a constitutional right to access to information.  There is a serious job to be done at Government level before going to the semi-State companies and other companies in the private sector to seek to implement the Bill.  With respect, implementation of this Bill must start in Government Departments.</P>

      <P>While I realise there is a time limit on the debate I speak in support of the spirit of the amendment that the Official Secrets Act be repealed.  As the matter has been referred to by a number of speakers I will not repeat the comments made except to lend my voice in agreement. This amendment, if accepted, would present us with a technical difficulty in the House. The Minister stated on a previous occasion it is the Department of Justice that will ultimately repeal the Official Secrets Act and not the Minister's Department.  For that reason, I will not support the amendment if it is put to a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security I record my appreciation of the welcome given to its report on the Official Secrets Act which was published earlier in the year.  I particularly refer to comments made by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Fitzgerald, who acknowledged the fact that a key feature of the committee's report is a recommendation to repeal the Official Secrets Act and replace it with appropriate criminal sanctions.  Unfortunately, <Col N="754" /> such sanctions are not included in this Bill and, therefore, a repeal of the Official Secrets Act at this juncture would not be the best way to proceed.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Justice to state her intentions regarding the future of the Official Secrets Act.  As stated in the report, it appears that the protection of the right of freedom of expression advocated in the Constitution and international conventions on human rights, combined with the requirements of good government, means that we should have the maximum possible freedom of access to public information.  For the first time, the Bill acknowledges and accepts that in statutory form but it is inconsistent with the terms of the Official Secrets Act, 1963.  As a result, the Government should repeal the Official Secrets Act at the earliest opportunity.  I am aware there is a difficulty with regard to the time-scale involved.  However, before the end of this Dáil, it would be apt if the outgoing Minister for Justice committed herself to such a repeal at the earliest opportunity during the lifetime of the next Dáil.</P>
    <P>Appropriate criminal sanctions to deal with espionage and the unauthorised disclosure of specific categories of information are needed.  If the amendment was carried, it would make the current situation worse and give rise to grave uncertainty.  The repeal of the Official Secrets Act should be proceeded with as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I reassure Deputy Liam Fitzgerald that the examination appeals system will be fully open and available under the terms of the Bill.  Therefore, any difficulties will be removed when the legislation is enacted.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the strong personal commitments to the abolition of the Official Secrets Act expressed by Deputies McDaid, O'Donnell and Flanagan.  I commend the work of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security on its excellent report which I am anxious to see implemented in full.  Last evening, I spoke to the Minister for Justice about work on developing the appropriate criminal sanctions legislation in respect of espionage and the unauthorised release of information which could damage the security of the State or the criminal process.  We must also consider appropriate civil sanctions in cases where a gross violation of the personal privacy of individuals may occur.  Deputy Woods, whose brief includes the protection of personal privacy about which he harbours strong beliefs, referred to the Data Protection Commissioner and we must provide the appropriate machinery to deal with both the criminal and civil considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am as anxious as other Members to see the total repeal of the Official Secrets Act.  When the Freedom of Information Bill is enacted and the Official Secrets Act abolished, we can stand proud with regard to the openness of our democracy. I am pleased to reassure Deputies that <Col N="755" /> section 4 of the Official Secrets Act, which causes most grief and sets out the presumption that all information is secret &mdash; when I joined the Civil Service 27 years ago I was obliged to sign the Official Secrets Act and give an undertaking not to park my bicycle at Government Buildings &mdash; will be made redundant by section 48 of the Freedom of Information Bill in respect of information made available under terms of the new legislation. We are effectively turning the presumption of secrecy on its head and replacing it with one of openness.</P>
    <P>If I were to adopt the amendment tabled by Deputy McDaid, with which I have great sympathy, a vacuum would remain with regard to unauthorised disclosures which could put the security of the State at risk at a time when there is armed conflict on one part of this island.  It would be prudent to wait until the legislative framework, the preparation work for which I have asked the Minister for Justice to expedite as quickly as possible within her Department, is in place.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell made the point that we have a year's grace within which the preparatory work for the commencement date of this legislation will be carried out.  There is a window of opportunity and I hope that, by the time the Freedom of Information legislation comes fully into force, the Official Secrets Act will have been repealed.  When Deputy McDaid raised the question of a debate on the Select Committee's report on the Order of Business, the Taoiseach indicated his willingness to make time available for such a debate.  A good and comprehensive debate on that report in the House would set the stage for the work to be carried out by the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I welcome the all-party support for this legislation. In the 75-year history of the State, successive Governments have done nothing to repeal the Official Secrets Act or put in place Freedom of Information legislation.  I hope that, if it has not already been disposed of, the parties which assume power after the coming election will conclude the work on the Official Secrets Act.  It is important that there is all-party consensus in this regard.  For that technical reason, although I sympathise with it, I cannot accept the amendment. However, I am doing everything in my power to accelerate the total repeal of the Official Secrets Act.  The guts of that legislation are torn out in section 48, which overturns section 4 of the Official Secrets Act and makes provision to make information available under the Freedom of Information Bill.</P>

      <P>While I accept the point made by the Minister of State and Deputy Flanagan <Col N="756" /> regarding criminal and civil sanctions legislation, it still appears there would have been little difficulty in garnering the proper staff to put such legislation in place.</P>
      <P>The Select Committee reported that espionage is more clearly defined as giving information to a foreign country or an unlawful organisation with intent to prejudice the security of the State.  It more or less tied down the definition of espionage and made a clearer definition between &ldquo;wrongful disclosure&rdquo; and &ldquo;unauthorised disclosure&rdquo;.  The committee recommended that &ldquo;wrongful disclosure&rdquo; would be criminal where it interfered with national security whereas &ldquo;unauthorised disclosure&rdquo; involves what are commonly referred to as &ldquo;leaks&rdquo; to newspapers, which can be dealt with through normal disciplinary channels in each Department.</P>
      <P>The case has been made that, because of the convoluted process involved, it would be extremely difficult to replace the Official Secrets Act with the Freedom of Information Bill but I do not agree that is the case.  There is a large gap developing between those in the front line in the public service and the public.  This is evidenced by recent events in the Department of Education with regard to the leaving certificate, the Department of Justice with regard to the Judge Lynch affair and the BTSB affair.  Civil servants are at a point where they do not know their rights.  The public is also in a dilemma as to its rights.  The civil servants in the front line are in a dilemma about where they stand legally and whether they can be sued.  I hope to launch a policy document in the next two weeks on the public service as a result of what happened in recent times to try to clarify the relationships involved.</P>
      <P>In the past the Civil Service was well regarded as trying to give and providing information to the public.  However, nowadays the public service is afraid of giving information in case there is litigation. This is a subject which the Bill should cover.  I am disappointed because I do not believe there would be a great difficulty in overcoming the points made by Deputy Flanagan and the Minister of State on the matter of criminal and civil sanctions with amendments to the Bill.  I accept that she and Deputy Flanagan agree with the principle involved but an opportunity is being lost to repeal the Official Secrets Act, 1963, with this Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 12, line 13, to delete &ldquo;after&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;not more than two years before&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 6 (4) which defines the types of records to which the public may have access.  Subject to certain limited exceptions, people will not be entitled under the Bill to have access to records created before the commencement of the Bill.  In the Seanad some amendments were made to this provision and the Minister of State indicated that it was the intention that access to past records would be provided on a rolling basis &mdash; first, two years, then four years, then six years, etc.  Progress has been made on this issue and the Minister of State has gone some way toward meeting concerns on it.</P>
      <P>It is important that public confidence in the Bill is established at the outset.  We are far behind other parliamentary democracies in putting in place legislation such as this to provide a legal right to access to information for our citizens.  If the Bill becomes law with the current exclusion on past records for the first year or two of its operation almost every request will be turned down, not on the grounds that the information sought was prepared in confidence or that it is commercially sensitive because all such exemptions, among others, are provided for in the Bill, but on the grounds that the Bill does not cover requests for records created before the Bill became law.</P>
      <P>I do not know if progress can be made on this point.  It is hard to see how given the blanket approach adopted in section 6 (4).  On Committee Stage I argued that at the very least the rolling back approach should begin when the Bill comes into force.  People should be entitled to access documents not more than two years old.  In the debate in the Seanad the Minister of State explained her stance on the issue indicating that it is a matter of putting filing and access systems in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Departments will have a year after the coming into force of the Bill to organise themselves administratively before the provisions take effect. Local authorities will have 18 months to do so. This legislation has been the subject of a wide process of consultation and scrutiny by Departments over the last five years.  The Minister of State has been working on this Bill since she became a Member of the House.  There has been a long period during which the public service could have organised itself to allow for the rolling back period so that during the first couple of years of the Act being in force people would be entitled to information at least for the last two years.  Perhaps the Minister of State may explain why, after almost five years of preparation and another year after the Bill becomes law, citizens <Col N="758" /> will not have access to records created before the enactment of the legislation.</P>

I want to see the &ldquo;roll-back&rdquo; completed as soon as possible to go back 30 years so that this legislation will meet the National Archives Act, 1986.  While it is true that I have been working on this Bill since taking office on 14 January 1993, the public service is a leviathan which is hard to move.  It has taken some time for it to accept that freedom of information was really happening.  It is only since the publication of the heads of the Bill and the productive debate we had last year at Select Committee that the system has really accepted it.  The public service has not been beavering away for the last four years on getting its systems ready.  It is only now beginning to realise that this is happening.</P>
      <P>It is not fair to say that on commencement information will not be available to people who seek it.  All personal information, whenever created, will become available on the first day of commencement.  Experience abroad shows that such information is the subject of 90 per cent of all requests.  If a request is made for a current file it will be available with the relevant past information which forms part of it and such files will be available from the first day of commencement. Where a public body is not legally obliged to provide information, there is no prohibition which would prevent it making information available in keeping with the concept of freedom of information, if there would be no problem in doing so.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to move administrative systems. As a former civil servant, I am concerned that administrative assistants might take a two-year roll-back as being the end of the story.  Perhaps it would be better to tell them that this figure will be extended continually and that they will have to get ready for this.  If the system operates smoothly from day one, it is less likely to kick back.  As a consequence, the roll-back provisions will, ironically, work more effectively and quickly.  In drawing up the administrative arrangements I had discussions with groups such as the Cork Environmental Alliance and the one based in Bantry which has had a dreadful experience in gaining access to environmental information. From day one the system kicked back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the discussion in the Seanad, not alone can one have a roll-back of two years, four years, six years or eight years or three years, six years or nine years until one hits the 30-year rule provided for in the archives Act but specific categories of information can be provided for.  I am aware of the Deputy's strong interest in what happened at the BTSB.  If there is a particular subject in which there is sufficient public interest, a regulation can be made quickly to allow access to the full files, provided it is old information not linked to a current file and caught by the rules. While I have enormous sympathy for the Deputy in what she is trying to achieve, the way we are <Col N="759" /> going about it will deliver a quicker roll-back.  As someone who is married to a historian, the sooner we merge the Freedom of Information Bill and the archives Act the better for everybody.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister of State's explanation and I am reassured that all personal records will be available immediately.  Experience in other democracies shows that requests for personal information account for 90 per cent of the total.  I am reassured also that a special regulation can be made quickly to allow access to information on a matter of public importance.  That alleviates some of my concerns in this area.  I withdraw the amendments on the basis of the Minister of State's reassurance.</P>

      <P>In page 15, line 21, to delete &ldquo;10(1)(c),&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment reflects a sensible proposal made by Deputy O'Donnell on Committee Stage which I am happy to accept.  The effect of the amendment is to ensure that, where a request is rejected on the grounds that it is a &ldquo;voluminous request&rdquo;, the public body must give details of any material issues relevant to the decision and particulars of any matter relating to the public interest taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that, in amendment No. 15, Deputy O'Donnell is seeking to strengthen the <Col N="760" /> test provided for in section 10(1)(c) to guard against misuse of the provision.  Our legal advice indicates that the use of the word &ldquo;unjustified&rdquo; may place an onus on the requester to justify the processing of the request.  I am keen to ensure that we do not inadvertently cut across the rights of the requester in this way.  As Deputies are aware, there is no obligation on a requester to justify why he or she is looking for information.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill is broadly based on the Australian Freedom of Information Act. Since Committee Stage I have researched further the Australian experience with this provision.  In its recent review of the Act, the Australian Law Reform Commission considered whether any amendment should be made to the term &ldquo;substantial and unreasonable&rdquo;.  It concluded that the statutory duty to consult with the requester coupled with training of agencies in its use would be more effective than any amendment to the wording.  In addition, it recommended an overseeing role by an information commissioner on compliance with freedom of information legislation.</P>
    <P>Both the statutory duty and overseeing role are provided for in this Bill in sections 10 and 36, respectively.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the checks and balances in the Bill are sufficient to meet what the Deputy is looking for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for dealing with this issue.  It was a possibility that a public body would attempt to refuse to comply with a request on the basis that it would cause a substantial and unreasonable interference or disruption of its other work.  Section 10 (1) (c) is being deleted.  This is a good development.  Public bodies are entitled to defer a decision on a request for up to eight weeks instead of four. They can also refuse a request on the grounds that it is frivolous or vexatious.  There was a danger that section 10 (1) (c) would be relied upon by an unco-operative body to unjustifiably refuse requests.  It would be a first, perhaps not unique in law, to provide a way out for a public body to refuse a request on the grounds that it is a voluminous request or it is too busy to deal with it.  That would be a tempting prospect for an unco-operative public body.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State accepts the principle and recognises the dangers inherent in the section.  I understand the reasons she has advanced for rejecting the other part of my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 23, line 34, to delete &ldquo;regulations under that paragraph may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may, by regulations made under that paragraph after consultation with the Commissioner and the Director of the National Archives (within the meaning of the National Archives Act, 1986),&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment in response to the points made by Deputy O'Donnell on Committee Stage about the preservation of records.  It proposes that when making regulations on the preservation of records the Minister for Finance will consult with the Information Commissioner and the Director of the National Archives.  Deputy O'Donnell's amendment proposes an alternative procedure, but I believe my amendment meets her points.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell's amendment which only permits the destruction of records which are more than ten years old is flawed in that it cuts across the objectives of this Bill and the National Archives Act.  It also requires the retention of records for ten years regardless of whether they are of value.  I understand that accounts, invoices, receipts for cups of coffee, taxis, etc., which build up in large numbers are routinely destroyed after they have been audited and accounted for.  Jurisdictions abroad advise that e-mails can be deleted unless they have permanent or continuing value in which case they must be put on file.  If an e-mail between two people about meeting for a cup of coffee was regarded as a record it could not, under Deputy O'Donnell's amendment, be destroyed for ten years, which could mess up computer systems.</P>
      <P>Having examined the matter further since Committee Stage, I believe my amendment meets the Deputy's concerns.  By providing that the matter should be dealt with by way of regulation we will get it right.  If we were to deal with it by way of legislation which was subsequently found to be flawed we would be stuck with it.  If we get it wrong under the regulation we can amend it. What we regard as records and record keeping is changing at the speed of light as a result of the advances in computer technology.  Like me, many people now use the computer instead of writing. I believe my amendment meets the underlying concerns expressed by Deputy O'Donnell on Committee Stage in a practical way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of sanctions, the advice I received is that disciplinary procedures are more appropriate than criminal sanctions.  It is very difficult to make a charge stick.  I dealt with this matter <Col N="762" /> under the Ethics in Government Act and the Department of Finance, which has responsibility for discipline, advised me that it is much easier to deal with the matter through the disciplinary process rather than try to prove a case beyond reasonable doubt under criminal law or get the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute. Deputy O'Donnell has expressed concern about the operation of the DPP's office over the years. I propose to follow up on the disciplinary route so that genuine sanctions which ensure that people respect the intentions of the legislation are in place and that documents which should be preserved are preserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister accepts that public bodies should be required to preserve documents as in the absence of such a provision there is a danger that documents of public interest might be destroyed.  I thank her for taking on board in her amendment my points about national archives.</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 37 deals with the destruction of records or documents and the failure of a person working in a public body to co-operate with a request for information.  I raise the issue of sanctions because of the recent case involving the blood service where it was found that certain public officials did not co-operate with the expert group set up by the Minister.  This matter came to light in the judicial investigation.  It is a matter of regret that instead of imposing disciplinary sanctions on people for wilfully deciding not to impart information to the Minister, Department or expert group the solution was to offer them golden handshakes.  This undermines the normal sense of justice in this matter, given the harm caused by the wilful retention of this information which was of public interest over many years.</P>
      <P>I tried on Committee Stage to introduce the notion that it should be a criminal offence for a public servant to deliberately conceal information or refuse to comply with a request by a Minister to co-operate with an expert group.  The Minister of State said that it would be more appropriate to deal with this matter by way of disciplinary procedure rather than criminal sanction.  Will she clarify if the Bill deals with sanctions which may be imposed on public servants who do not comply with their obligations under it?  Even though it is intended to amend the Official Secrets Act, a criminal sanction will still be applicable to those persons who reveal information which is against the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that criminality should attach to this wrongdoing by a public servant.  However, it is also important that severe criminal sanctions be imposed on those public servants who deliberately and with <i>mens rea</i> fail to comply with the provisions of the Bill, wilfully withhold or destroy information or corrupt the process by refusing to comply with a request for information.  It is not sufficient to leave the matter hanging in the air.  Any disciplinary action must have teeth and act as a <Col N="763" /> deterrent to public servants who decide to pervert the very good intentions of the Bill by destroying documents or refusing to comply with requests for information by a Minister or citizen.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for taking on board my point in regard to the preservation of documents, but ask her to look further at the question of disciplinary procedures.  There has to be a sanction if the Act is to have any teeth and be effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Civil Service Regulation Act, the Minister for Finance, who will draw up the regulations on the non-destruction and preservation of records, can issue regulations which are binding disciplinary rules.  As the Deputy knows, the new ministers and secretaries legislation provision will provide that secretaries of Government Departments will be able to dismiss staff up to principal officer level.  There will be a tighter regime that is much more performance based.  Human error can happen in any case &mdash; the wrong document can be put in the shredder &mdash; but if somebody deliberately destroys a record, those disciplinary sanctions will be in place.  The regulations under the Civil Service Regulation Act or the ministers and secretaries legislation, as appropriate, will be drawn up in conjunction with the regulations on the preservation of records.</P>

    <P>This amendment is in response to a Committee Stage amendment from Deputy O'Donnell.  The Deputy's amendment seeks to require the Minister for Finance to report annually to the Dáil on the organisational arrangements being put in place by public bodies to facilitate compliance with the Act.  I indicated on Committee Stage that I would be happy to take on board the Deputy's proposal, subject to possibly strengthening it further.  This amendment goes beyond Deputy O'Donnell's amendment in two key respects. First, it requires that in addition the report should address issues raised by the Information Commissioner arising from an investigation under section 36.  Under that section, the commissioner can inspect and report on practices and procedures used by any public body in complying with the Act.  Second, it directs the report of the Minister for Finance to the Oireachtas committee to be established under section 32, which will have a particular mandate under the Bill and, no doubt, expertise on the issues arising.  That committee will examine the secrecy provisions of individual enactments and report on whether they should be retained, amended or repealed.</P>

    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised points on Committee Stage in relation to the consistency of this provision with the Supreme Court judgment on Cabinet confidentiality.  I listened carefully to those points and I indicated on Committee Stage that we would take legal advice on what was required to ensure the two were fully in line with each other and that the exceptions were sufficiently narrow to be consistent with that particular judgment.  Following our Committee Stage discussions I sought further legal advice and I propose an amendment to explicitly protect only records containing statements made at Cabinet or records from which such statements may be inferred.  The amendment also seeks to ensure that memoranda to Government and briefing material may not be captured by this provision. It was clear from the Supreme Court judgment <Col N="766" /> on Cabinet confidentiality that it literally only referred to talk around the table.  It does not protect memoranda to Government or the decisions. The factual information in a memorandum to Government will become available immediately the decision to which it relates is published, provided it is not caught by a security exemption. The full memorandum will become available within five years.  This is a very open regime in terms of Cabinet papers.</P>

The judgment referred to the claim for confidentiality of the contents and details of discussions at meetings of the Government.  It also stated that in relation to the beef tribunal inquiry it was a valid claim.  It was clearly the contents and details of Government discussions that the Supreme Court found to be confidential.  The Bill, as drafted, had gone further than that and included anything which relates to statements made at a meeting of the Government.  I am glad the Minister has ensured the Bill will comply with the limitations of the Hamilton decision.  The only matter the Supreme Court deliberately protected was discussions at Cabinet.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 29, to delete lines 34 to 37.</P>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, this is the sort of paragraph which sets off alarm bells in my head when I read it.  It is one of those catch all-vague phrases like section 10(1)(c) that we have now deleted.  It allows a public body to refuse access to a record if disclosure &ldquo;would have a significant adverse effect on the performance by the body of any of its functions relating to management&rdquo;. There are clearly defined exceptions elsewhere in the Bill, notably the deliberations of public bodies, in other words, the request for information would adversely affect the deliberations of public bodies.  Section 20 refers to the preparation for negotiations by the public body.  Section 21 (1)(c) refers to commercially sensitive information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> Section 27 refers to information obtained in confidence.  There is a menu of exemptions available under the Bill, even as it now passes through Report Stage, which allow room for a public body to extract itself from the provisions by way of exemption.  Paragraph (b) could be used to justify a refusal to disclose material which would shake public confidence in the management of that public body, thereby causing &ldquo;a significant adverse affect on the performance by the body of any of its functions relating to management&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I referred on Committee Stage to the controversial example of the BTSB, a public body of great importance.  Having regard to the fact that plasma obtained from patient X was used to manufacture anti-D after she had been diagnosed with infective hepatitis, the BTSB could have relied on this exemption and in terms of the persons who were trying to protect their notion of the public interest, it would have had a disastrous effect on the management of the public body concerned. This exemption leaves a dangerous loophole which could be used by a public body that did not want to co-operate or was seeking to hide a particular matter.  That is why I tabled this amendment.  There are sufficient exemptions in the Bill.  Paragraph (b) is too vague.  It would be too easy for unco-operative bodies or persons who are just trying to preserve the <i>status quo</i> and who are not anxious to comply with a requirement to disclose sensitive or controversial information to rely on this.  I do not know the Minister's justification for keeping this particularly dangerous paragraph, given that we have removed section 10(1)(c).  The Bill would certainly be better without this paragraph.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the points raised by the Deputy.  I would like to reassure her that there are two hurdles that must be crossed by any public body before it can avail of this exemption.  First, the public body must be able to show that there has been damage to the management of a particular function.  Second, and this is particularly important in relation to the BTSB, the public body must be able to show, even where damage might arise, that the greater public interest would not be served by release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A provision on the lines of section 21(b) is a feature of freedom of information legislation abroad, for example, the Australian Freedom of Information Act, which has been working without problems and which was reviewed in great depth by a commission which looked at it two years ago. There is a similar feature in Senator Dick Roche's Bill which is modelled closely on the Norwegian legislation.  This is the kind of provision that works well.  The double safeguards are there against abuse.  Ultimately it is not up to the public bodies concerned to decide whether the information comes into the public domain, what is the public interest or what would damage its functions. That decision is for the Information Commissioner <Col N="768" /> or an appeal in court on a point of law. That is a very important public safeguard.  The onus is on the public body to show why the information should not be released.  The presumption in the Bill and the Long Title is that information should be available unless there is a very good reason for holding it back.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the sincerity of the Deputy's concern and the strength of the example she gave. There could be some possibility of a particular example passing the first hurdle, but it would fall at the second hurdle in relation to the greater public interest being served.  I am satisfied that the Information Commissioner will exercise great independence of judgment.  It has been the experience abroad that as the culture of the leviathan shifts there is a presumption among people that there is openness.  Places such as Sweden have much looser legislation; because there is an atmosphere of openness, information is given automatically.  I believe that is what will happen here.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister says, that there is a second hurdle which has to be overcome, that is, the Information Commissioner, and that there is a presumption which will underlie all future transactions in relation to the disclosure of information.  However, it was useful to visit the area, given recent experience.  It should be a matter of public record that we have considered the dangers inherent in the section and that the Minister has taken cognisance of my reservations.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 36, to delete lines 5 to 37 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a head shall refuse to grant a request under section 7 if&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  the record concerned contains information given to the public body concerned in confidence and on the understanding that it would be treated by it as confidential (including such information as aforesaid that a person was required by law, or could have been required by the body pursuant to law, to give to the body) and, in the opinion of the head, its disclosure would be likely to prejudice the giving to the body of further similar information from the same person or other persons and it is of importance to the body that such further similar information as aforesaid should continue to be given to the body, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> (b)  disclosure of the information concerned would constitute a breach of a duty of confidence provided for by a provision of an agreement or enactment (other than a provision specified in column (3) of the Third Schedule of an enactment specified in that Schedule) or otherwise by law.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 is substantive.  Amendments Nos. 29 and 32 are purely technical adjustments. Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 are technical amendments to ensure that a director is included as well as a head or member of public staff.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 serves a number of purposes. It involves the deletion of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and its replacement by &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the first line. The purpose of this change is to require the head of a public body to invoke public interest when he or she proposes to release information given in confidence to that public body.  In this way the legitimate expectations of someone who supplies that information in confidence cannot be ignored by the head, without regard to where the public interest lies.  Following from this amendment, subsections (1) and (2) have been merged.</P>
    <P>The second part of the amendment relates to subsection (3) of the Bill.  As matters stand, the subsection requires that a public body must obtain the consent of the Information Commissioner prior to entering into any agreement not to disclose information of a particular class. However, I have been strongly advised by outside sources that this provision is not consistent with the independent function of the Commissioner.  I have been advised that the provision could be seen as drawing the Commissioner into confidentiality agreements at an early stage which he might be asked to overturn at a later stage.  The independence of the Commissioner, and ultimately protection against abuse of confidentiality agreements, is better served by the way we are setting it up now.</P>
    <P>The effect of the deletion now proposed would be to leave the Commissioner free of obligations previously envisaged.  Nevertheless, he or she can independently review the operation of this section under section 36.  Following from this he or she can comment critically and publicly on any misuse of section 26 by a public body.  That public body then has to come back and report to the House and any adverse comments by the Information Commissioner must be discussed by a committee of this House.  None of this can be done in secret or behind closed doors.  It is very much in the open.  In addition, he or she can exercise the usual review functions under section 34 and the findings would, subject to review by the courts, be binding on the parties concerned.  We are throwing much light on this without compromising the independence of the Commissioner. I am satisfied that this will achieve our objective, which is the shared objective of us all. The revised administrative arrangements contain enough safeguards to do the job better.</P>

      <P>In page 44, line 27, after &ldquo;her&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;from a head to seek permission to avail of a reason provided for under this Act not to agree to a request for information&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We discussed this previously.  It is an amendment about which I feel quite strongly because the appeals system in this Bill is based on appeals by the citizen against a failure to disclose, based on one of the innumerable exceptions that the Minister has devised.  This flatly contradicts the claims made for this Bill that it will shift the balance towards disclosure.  If the presumption were in favour of the disclosure, the appeal would have to be made by the public authority to the information officer.  It is ludicrous in practical and legal terms that the onus to appeal non-disclosure is on the citizen rather than the local authority. Fianna Fáil believes the presumption should be in favour of disclosure, which means that the onus should be on the local authority to appeal to the information officer to determine what should be secret.  If the onus is on the citizen &mdash; I discussed this matter with the Minister previously &mdash; since the cost of specialities and so on are enormous, it would be very expensive on the citizen to get certain information under the relevant headings as outlined in the Bill.  We stand by the principle that the onus should be on the local authority to obtain the information to deem that a matter be kept secret.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy McDaid is as anxious as I am to ensure this measure works for citizens and that is the purpose behind his amendment, but there are practical arguments against his proposal.  First, it would result in the commissioner being involved in every refusal, which would swamp the role of commissioner.  Experience abroad shows that between 30 and 40 per cent of cases are decided by internal review, by a senior official overturning the decision of a junior official.  That would enable the commissioner to focus on serious problems and ensure a backlog does not build up in the office.</P>
      <P>Second, the active involvement of the commissioner at the outset in confirming applications for refusal by public bodies could compromise his or her independent role.  The appeals system is modelled on the system in other countries.  That system has worked very effectively here for years in social welfare appeals.  When we give a social welfare payment we do not expect the Department to take it back in cases where people are not entitled to it.  Equally, we do not wish to hand out information to people which, when appealed, is taken back by the Department.  That is not the way appeals systems work.  The appeals model set out in the Bill reflects that which works best abroad.  The provision that the citizen should make the appeal is similar to Senator Roche's proposal in section 9.</P>
      <P>There are many mechanisms in the Bill to ensure the appeals system is citizen friendly.  The long title sets out the purpose of the Bill, to enable members of the public to obtain information held by public bodies to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public right to privacy.  The mandate to the information commissioner as set out explicitly in section 34 (12) is to assume that a refusal is unjustified.  As proposed by the Deputy in his amendment, the onus is on the public body to make its case to the information commissioner.</P>
      <P>Under section 35 the commissioner may ask that better reasons be given for decisions.  If people believe they are given a nonsense reason or a broad reason by a Department, they may ask how the decision to refuse relates to the relevant section of the Bill.  If the decision is nonsense it will be disregarded.  Most exemptions carry this public interest override where, in spite of information being open to exemption under a section, the balance of public interest is in favour of disclosure. The commissioner may say that although information is commercially sensitive, in the greater public interest it must be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDaid is concerned about placing a burden on citizens.  As with the Ombudsman's office, people will have access to the information commissioner who will deal with the matter.  In many cases appeals against administrative decisions are made by people who do not understand the system or who have problems with literacy and so on.  The office of information commissioner, which is the citizens' champion and guardian of the public interest, sympathetically <Col N="772" /> handles appeals by people.  The fears underlying the amendment put forward by Deputy McDaid are well addressed in the Bill.  I share his concerns, but the mechanism he proposes would be unworkable and I therefore oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(9) `point of law' includes a determination as to the public interest.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under section 42 an appeal may be made to the High Court in various circumstances but only on a point of law.  On Committee Stage I pointed out that many decisions to refuse access may be justified on grounds of public interest, as outlined in sections 19(5) and 20(1)(b).  While it is legitimate to seek to protect the public interest, it is not desirable that determination of the public interest should be entirely subjective.  On Committee Stage the Minister indicated that this issue will be covered by a point of law.  Has she sought legal advice on this matter?  My concern is that there may be an appeal if a body pleads in the public interest.  Could an appeal be made to the High Court on determination of what is the public interest?  This is an important point and perhaps it is covered by a point of law, but there is no reason it should not be made explicit.  I look forward to the Minister's comments on this matter.</P>

    <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that I would bring forward an amendment to this section to tighten up on the drafting and ensure the minimum information is excluded from the Bill.  This follows from points made by Senator Roche in the Seanad relating to the courts.  As a result of his concerns and of advice from the parliamentary draftsman, the revised text addresses this issue.  We are tightening up on what is excluded from the courts and ensuring that documents relating to the courts which may be held by other offices will not be excluded by virtue of section 46 &mdash; for example, documents in the Department of Finance about financing of the courts will become available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this amendment I propose that a head may by order direct that no records held by a public body which relate to matters specified in the order shall be withheld.  I also propose a criminal sanction for a person who perverts the process with a view to withholding information for the purposes of a reply to a parliamentary question or information specified in an order made under subsection (1) by the head.  We recently discovered there was no effective sanction for widespread <Col N="775" /> deliberate lapses and dereliction of duty in the case of the BTSB.</P>
    <P>My intention on Committee Stage was to deliberate on the possibility of introducing sanctions for the retention of information against an instruction or a requirement to reply to a parliamentary question.  In regard to malpractices and irregularities in the beef processing industry, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry failed to give information sought legitimately by Members of the House by way of parliamentary question.  Legislation to put in place a brave new world in which people can access information sits uneasily with the current parliamentary democracy in the House whereby on a regular basis Deputies who request information in the public interest are misdirected and thrown off the scent. The legislation should also cover replies to parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>I hope the strategic management initiative and the provisions of the Bill will bring about an impressive change in the way civil servants operate. There is certainly room for improvement in the manner in which replies to parliamentary questions are drafted for Ministers.  The information given in most replies to parliamentary questions is minimal and confusing, with the blatant objective of misleading or throwing the questioner off the scent.  While I do not know if the Minister of State can give a comprehensive response to this matter, I am not unreasonable in making the point because it impacts on the way in which our democracy operates.  It is a legitimate point in the context of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Experience from abroad indicates that replies to parliamentary questions will be transformed by the implementation of freedom of information legislation.  If Members cannot get the information required in reply to a parliamentary question, they can get it by way of a freedom of information request.  Any temptation by civil servants to be economical with the facts in a reply to a parliamentary question can be overcome by this legislation.  It is generally the practice to supply a note for the information of the Minister with the three line replies the Minister reads out in the House.  The file on which that note is kept can be accessed under this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's blanket proposal that all types of information should be made available could mean giving out information that should be constitutionally protected or that would undermine security, law enforcement or an individual's right to personal privacy.  That Liz O'Donnell, as a citizen as distinct from her position as a Member of this House, can get information under this legislation will have a radical effect on replies to her parliamentary questions.</P>

      <P>In page 58, between lines 27 and 28, to insert An Bord Pleanála,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Second and Committee Stages Deputy McDaid made a strong plea for access to environmental information under the Bill.  Such access is already available under the regulations on environment information.  This legislation provides a supplementary right of access to such information. I am pleased to include An Board Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency under the legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDaid proposes that we should also include the Garda and the harbour authorities. As Deputy O'Donnell will be aware from her role as Justice spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats, a review of the Garda is currently taking place and it would be appropriate to await-the outcome of that as there will be a major shake up in the information function of the Garda following that review.  The Garda will be included shortly after the review is completed.  It can be included by way of order at any stage after the commencement of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Under the legislation on harbours, harbour authorities have a commercial mandate.  A discussion will take place between the Minister for Finance, who takes over responsibility for the Bill when it is passed, and the sponsoring Department, the Department of the Marine, on questions that may arise as a result of including commercial companies.  It is proposed to start with non-commercial semi-State and regulatory bodies. It is not the intention to put commercial bodies at a disadvantage.  The nuts and bolts of this will have to be discussed with the relevant Departments.  We are not disposed to accepting the last two amendments, but I am happy to accept the first two.  Two out of four is not bad.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for accepting the first two amendments, but I am concerned about the omission of the Garda Síochána from the legislation.  The Minister of State is positively anticipating the result of Garda <Col N="777" /> review in that she tells us we can rely on the review body to propose what we are including in the Bill.  While I accept the Minister of State's remarks about harbour authorities, is it not possible to include the Garda Síochána at this stage? By excluding that body the Minister of State is sending out a signal that the Garda Síochána is in charge of more sensitive information than the offices of the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste.  Now that those offices and Departments are more open, we have excluded the Garda from this legislation. Does that not send out a signal that they are more sensitive than the Departments of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Army and so on?  The Minister of State is sending out the wrong signal and is anticipating the findings of the review of the Garda.  Perhaps the Minister of State has information I do not have.</P>
      <P>The public are entitled to information on how Garda policy is formulated.  I am surprised the Minister of State has excluded the Garda from the legislation but there is very little I can do about that at this stage.  The public have a right to know how Garda policy is formulated, particularly in view of their involvement in housing estate committees through which they have taken it upon themselves to ensure there is law and order in their estates.  They have a right to know how the Garda formulate policy that affects their lives.  By excluding the Garda from the legislation we are leaving it up to the Garda review body to give the Minister for Justice power to accept its findings without debate.  Had the Garda been included in this section, the findings of the review would be open for debate among the public.  If the matter is being left to the Garda review body and for us to accept its findings without the Garda being included in the Bill, another time limit will apply.  Is there a time limit within which this Bill can be reviewed?  Does this section provide that it can be reviewed in one or two years and that the Garda could be included in it at that stage?  I would like to hear the Minister of State's reply.  I accept her view on the harbour authorities, but she is leaving it up to the Garda review body to come up with solutions and it is important that they should be open, transparent and accountable.</P>

      <P>I express thanks to the House for the mature and open debate we have had on the Bill and the commitment shown by all sides to greater openness in our democracy.  Today is an historic day with the passing of this Bill.  It has passed through the Seanad and later this afternoon I hope to obtain its approval for the changes we have made to it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy McDaid, the new spokesperson for his party on this subject, who has been open on this and has done a good job.  Deputy Woods was involved at an earlier stage when we discussed the heads of the Bill.  He made a worthwhile contribution as he did on Committee Stage and today.  I also thank Deputy O'Donnell and her party for embracing the terms of the Bill and their many constructive suggestions.  I was happy to be able to accept some of the suggestions made by Deputies McDaid and O'Donnell and as a <Col N="779" /> result of them a good Bill has been made even better.</P>
    <P>We had a good and detailed debate in the Seanad.  Senator Dick Roche sponsored his Bill modelled on Norwegian legislation and Senators Dardis, Lee, McGennis and O'Sullivan all made important contributions which resulted in the tabling of amendments I was able to accept.</P>
    <P>I also thank, in particular, the staff of the Office of the Tánaiste.  This is a proud day not only for me but for that office with the bringing of this major legislation to conclusion.  I thank Gerry Kearney, Aine Stapleton, Noreen Egan and a number of members of staff who worked on this Bill in the early stages and have now moved on, including Pattie Conneely and Therese Conlon, Julie O'Neill and our legal adviser, Finbarr O'Malley.  Good teamwork went into the preparation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I also thank people in other jurisdictions who helped in drawing up the legislation.  I single out Madeleine Campbell of the Australian Attorney General's office, Robert Hazel of the Nuffield Foundation and Maurice Frankel of the Freedom of Information campaign in the UK.  The Bill is very much shaped by the input of all those people.</P>

      <P>Any legislation that passes through this House is important.  This Bill is particularly so as it involves our citizens and entitles them to more freedom of information on what happens in Departments which heretofore appeared to some degree to be kept secret.  While I have some reservations about this Bill in that it could have gone further, as I outlined in my argument on the repeal of the Official Secrets Act, I accept the work the Minister of State has put into it and congratulate her on bringing this legislation through the House.  I thank her for the help she has given me in offering the services of her Department to clarify any information that I considered questionable.  I congratulate her Department and officials on bringing this Bill before the House.  I thank my predecessor Deputy Woods who spoke on this Bill in the early stages.  I am sure our citizens will benefit from this legislation.</P>

It is a much improved Bill having gone through rigorous examination in the Seanad and here in the Lower House.  It is part of an evolutionary process in improving our democracy.  As we now know, democracy is not just about having an elected Government, but having an open and accountable one.  This Bill goes a long way towards achieving that.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 40, to delete &ldquo;a year beginning on any 1st day of April&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;such period of 12 months as an employer may designate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is similar to an amendment I moved on Committee Stage and on that occasion I did not push it.  However, I have subsequently been talking to employers in relation to this matter and many of them suggest that the starting date for calculating the holiday period should be 12 months and should not specify 1 April.  We must have flexibility in relation to work practices.  We must be practical.  There are other aspects of this Bill, as the Minister of State knows, with which I am not happy.  However, I do not see any reason we cannot give flexibility to employers in relation to the starting period for calculating annual leave. I do not know why we must enshrine in our law that it must be on 1 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I promised that I would look at Deputy Harney's suggestion on this issue when we discussed it on Committee Stage.  On the face of it, it appears to be a practical step but I am advised there are some problems.  First, as I mentioned on Committee Stage, if we had brought it in from a current date it would have the effect of postponing people's holiday entitlements, as agreed with the social partners and included in the Bill.  It would have the effect of postponing the extra day's holidays, possibly for a year.  To get one extra day people on 15 days would have to go up to 16 days this year, 18 days next year and 20 days by 1999.  They could thus miss the enactment time by 1999.</P>
      <P>Employees should begin to benefit from the directives without further delay.  The first additional day of the statutory annual leave entitlement should take place this year.  It is right and proper that it should be phased in; it gives businessmen better time to adjust rather than postponing the evil day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also looked at the possibility of a two-tier definition.  This is what I undertook to come back to on Report Stage.  One would apply up to the end of the transitional period with a phase-in <Col N="781" /> of additional leave because there is a real problem about accepting this up to 1999.  Deputy Harney's amendment would apply thereafter. However, when we looked constructively at the suggestion she made, it threw up new problems. We would have to include additional provisions as to what would happen if an employer decided to change the commencement date of the year from 1 April to a date of the employer's choice. What would happen in any interregnum that would build up?  It would make the definition unduly complex.  Annual leave entitlements apply to all employees.  It is an issue that is important and practical for everyone.  It is important for people to know where they stand.  Our legislation in this area should be clear and unambiguous. Though I did look at it seriously I am afraid I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>However, as I said on Committee Stage, this provision has been there for 20 years and we have had no problems with it.  I have not heard of the problems the Deputy says employers have with it.  For internal purposes an employer can run with the leave year from 1 January to 31 December and there is no problem with that.  It is just for the purpose of computing the legal entitlements from April to April.  This has been in law for 20 years without any problems arising and it gives a clear test when checking if somebody is getting what they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>If you had variable periods it could pose problems from the point of view of people establishing their legal rights and all the complex provisions around an interregnum.  Although on the face of it it looked like a sensible proposal, I am not in a position to accede to it, although I gave it an honest hearing.</P>
    <P>I propose to accept two other amendments tabled by Deputy Harney.  They are amendments Nos. 26 and 28 in sections 25 and 29 respectively. If there is a guillotine they can be taken as amendments accepted by the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `shift work' means any method of organising work in shifts, whereby employees succeed each other at the same work stations according to a certain pattern, including a rotating pattern, and which may be continuous or discontinuous, entailing a need for employees to work at different times over a given period of days or weeks;</P>
      <P>`shift worker' shall mean an employee who engages in shift work;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> This amendment relates to a definition and I am seeking the approval of the Minister of State to include a definition of shift worker.  The Bill contains definitions of rest period, short time and working time.  I feel this definition should be included.  I am conscious that this definition is taken word for word from the directive.</P>

      <P>&ldquo; `week day' shall mean any day of the week, except Sunday;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This refers to a definition of week day.  During the debate we had references to Sunday and Sunday work, with which we will deal later in the Bill. It is important that week day shall mean any day of the week except Sunday.  There is a need for clarity regarding weekdays, meaning Monday to Friday.

      <P>On Committee Stage, section 21 and the Second Schedule were amended.  The effect of these amendments was to remove the need to define what a day of the week is for the purpose of a public holiday.  A public holiday could arise any day of the week, including Sunday if, for example, St. Patrick's Day fell on a Sunday. The Bill now provides that employees are entitled to a public holiday regardless of what day of the week the public holiday falls on and regardless of whether the employee is normally obliged to work on that day or not.  They would get their day in lieu for St. Patrick's Day falling on a Sunday. The amendment is, therefore, redundant.</P>
      <P>Elsewhere in the Bill we deal with the issues of Sunday working and Sunday premiums.  It is well provided for.</P>

      <P>In page 7, to delete line 33.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to exclude an exemption for the activities of doctors in training.  There was a public debate on this issue because many junior doctors complained about their long working hours.  This situation is unsatisfactory, particularly for those working in hospital theatres.  We should not include the same exemption for junior doctors as for those who work at sea.  Like the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, a special provision should be inserted to allow junior doctors to be included in the Bill.  I said on Committee Stage that it should be possible to deal with this situation.  I tabled an amendment to allow for a collective agreement under an opt-out clause.  The thrust of the Bill is wrong in relation to junior doctors.</P>
      <P>Progress has been made in the discussions between the representatives of junior doctors and management since I tabled this amendment.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify what progress has been made at the EU Council of Health Ministers which is dealing with this issue.  I know that legislation or directives in relation to junior doctors are not only dealt with by the Minister but also by the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>I pushed this amendment on Committee Stage because we must not allow this exemption for junior doctors as it sends out the wrong signal.  It is not in the interests of patients if junior doctors suffer from fatigue and are not able to cope in difficult hospital circumstances.  I ask the Minister to take on board my views and to clarify what progress has been made at the EU Council of Health Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be possible to deal with this by regulation if agreement is reached in Europe.  The permanent working group of European doctors has been involved in trying to find a common solution to the problem of regulation. A Commission White Paper is awaited.  As a former Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, the Deputy knows the Commission must propose it before it comes to the table of the Council of Ministers.  It is, therefore, with the Commission at present.  Some preliminary drafts have been circulated within the Commission. It will require a specific Council recommendation to come to the table of the EU Council of Health Ministers.  The Commission is still working on it in consultation with the permanent working group of European doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> Only junior doctors are excluded; all other medical staff are included under the 48 hour rule. Improvements have been made in the recent agreement reached.  I agree with Deputy Tom Kitt and I hope the 48 hour rule will apply to everyone.  As soon as the proposal is put on the table at the Council of Health Ministers, I will be the first to suggest the regulation.</P>

      <P>There is a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> about this amendment.  It seems extraordinary that in a week when the Government decides to look for a derogation from Europe in relation to an environmental matter, which does not make environmental or economic sense, we will be out on a limb looking for an exemption.  We want Europe to give us permission not to charge for water, although we know from an environmental and an economic point of view that we should because it is a scarce resource.  Yet we have decided not to avail of the flexibility allowed for in the directive which would suit workers and employment and help to maintain Ireland's competitive edge in industrial investment.  There is a certain irony in relation to those two matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said that agreement had been reached between the social partners in relation to the Government's attitude to the opt-out clause.  This forces the Minister to make regulations or a statutory instrument exempting those sectors from the main provisions of the Bill, which relate to the 48 hour week, in advance of their coming into force.  It is important in the interests of consistency that we are clear on this matter.  The Minister said there would be consultations in relation to the regulations.  Perhaps she could clarify if she will make a statutory instrument available before the Bill comes into effect.  The changes in work practices as a result <Col N="785" /> of this legislation will be substantial.  It is important that employers, industry and workers are aware well in advance of the nature of those changes.  There is no point in people preparing to make changes if they are going to be exempt from the main provisions.</P>
    <P>Ireland is foolish not to avail of the maximum flexibility.  This is a small open economy with an enormous unemployment problem.  I have had discussions with American companies, the American Ireland Chamber of Commerce and others and they all agree that although we have done well in terms of industrial development, there is no doubt this will have a detrimental effect on Ireland's capacity to continue to attract major investment.  It will put us at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It is a mistake that the Government has adopted such a rigid approach to this matter.  The Minister said it only affects 6 per cent of workers and that is true but why should any worker who wishes to work more than 48 hours per week not be allowed to do so?  When the European Union allows us to have that flexibility, we should avail of it.</P>
    <P>Newspaper articles state that a worker who receives a salary increase of £20 per week loses £10 of it in deductions.  There are many things wrong with the tax and welfare systems and we do not need a rigid regime which will make Ireland less attractive for investment or which will make matters more difficult for the industrial sector.  It is particularly difficult for small and medium sized businesses because regulations of this kind fall heavily on smaller companies which need greater flexibility.</P>
    <P>We dealt on Committee Stage with the various sectors that were affected and I do not see much point in raising that matter now because the Minister was adamant that she was not going to change her position and, in any event, agreement has been reached with the social partners.  In the interests of clarity and consistency, it is a pity that the Minister is not making the regulations in advance.  If she does not want to do so by way of accepting my amendment, which substitutes &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;, perhaps she would give an undertaking that it will be done by way of statutory instrument prior to the implementation of the main provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 14, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) Except for certain `exempted activities' to be provided for by the Minister under regulations made under this Act, an employee shall not be obliged to work on a Sunday without his or her consent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment endeavours to deal with Sunday work in the retail sector.  We discussed the matter on Committee Stage and the Minister gave assurances that she would look at this area and report back to us.  In the meantime, I introduced a Private Members' Bill, which I published last November, entitled the Protection of Workers (Shops) Bill, 1996, which deals specifically with this area.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, said, prior to knowing about my Bill, that the need to provide workers in the retail sector with a voluntary opt-out if they did not wish to work on Sunday needed to be dealt with in separate legislation.  I welcome the fact that the Minister accepted my Bill because it is important that Opposition Bills which are beneficial to workers are accepted by the Government. Another member of Fianna Fáil, Deputy de Valera, has had a Private Members' Bill accepted recently and this is a welcome development.</P>
      <P>There is no need to go into the details of my Bill because it has been discussed already.  It gives shop workers the right to opt out of Sunday work. It states that a shop worker shall not be obliged to work on a Sunday without his or her consent. It also deals with appropriate pay and notice.  I hope we can deal with it as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>It is important that all businesses operating in the retail sector accept the fact that there is all-party support for this Bill and that they put in place immediately appropriate provisions for workers in such a position.  In saying that, I welcome the fact that Tesco, which has decided to operate in Ireland, is making such a provision for its workers.  This House recognises that Sunday should be treated differently and workers should not be coerced into signing a contract of employment to work on Sunday if they choose not to do so.  If other workers wish to work on Sundays, my Bill provides for that also.</P>
      <P>Dunnes Stores has been criticised over the years but I acknowledge the fact that it responded positively to public concern about its initial plans to open on Easter Sunday.  I and others called on other stores to follow suit when Dunnes Stores decided against opening on that day and I was disappointed that they did not respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of my Bill, I ask those doing business in this sector to take note of the cross-party support for this voluntary opt-out for workers and I respectfully suggest that they make the <Col N="787" /> necessary provisions immediately.  I acknowledge that some are already doing so.</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment to allow for that but as the Government accepted my Bill in the meantime the matter has been dealt with in another way.  Therefore, I will not press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Kitt on introducing his Bill which was accepted by the Government.  On Committee Stage, I made a strong case against Sunday trading in the context of rural Ireland.  The Minister claims it is not possible to legislate for small shops without affecting the big ones.</P>
      <P>Sunday trading is a new concept in Irish life. The local shop used to sell newspapers and some groceries for a couple of hours on Sunday in villages, towns and cities.  The scene has now changed and the community and the people working in retail shops are not interested in that. We will see the demise of rural Ireland because, rather than going out for a leisurely Sunday drive and a walk in the countryside, people are now shopping in the large multiples for even the smallest items which can be bought in the local shop and use the occasion as a form of social outing.</P>
      <P>There has been an influx of large multiples.  I do not have strong views on that but I have visited European countries which have legislated against Sunday trading while, at the same time, allowing small shops to open and sell the Sunday newspapers and items such as bottles of orange and boxes of smarties.  I cannot understand why we have failed to address that problem.  I have my finger on the pulse in my constituency and there is no interest within the community or the workforce in Sunday trading.  I ask the Minister to examine the matter.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why Ireland cannot legislate on this matter.  We must have the right to do so under EU Directives.  The easy option is to say that we cannot legislate for big shops alone without affecting smaller ones.  I am concerned about rural Ireland and I know Deputy Kitt and I have the full support of MANDATE, which looks after the interests of workers in the retail sector.  They have very strong views on the matter, the consensus being against Sunday trading in larger, multiple shops.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, I would prefer not to see large scale shopping on Sundays.  Sunday is a special day, particularly for people like us who tend to work a six day week. It is nice to have a seventh day of rest, affording us an opportunity to be with our families.</P>
      <P>With that in mind I consulted people on all sides who considered Sunday a special day, ranging from MANDATE, RGDATA, the Consumers Association of Ireland, the bishops, Uncle Tom Cobbly, and all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being anxious to tackle this complex issue I took careful legal advice.  There was no unwillingness on my part, but the legal advice given me is <Col N="788" /> to the effect that one cannot deal with small and larger shops in a different manner.  While Deputy O'Keeffe said there never had been any Sunday trading, in the same breath he said traditionally small shops in most towns sold papers, milk, bread, tea, rashers, etc.  In law, that represents Sunday trading.  That is my dilemma.  If one restricts the larger outlets, one must also restrict the smaller.  There would be an outcry in rural areas if people could not buy such commodities after Mass on Sundays.</P>
    <P>The same would apply in cities where people might do their main shopping on Saturday but, if and when they ran out of some commodity or received unexpected visitors and wanted to cook an apple tart, will want to purchase the ingredients, a couple of packets of biscuits or extra milk. In such circumstances the local small shop gives an invaluable service.  Nobody proposes to outlaw small scale shopping on Sundays, which does not interfere with its being the normal day of rest.</P>
    <P>MANDATE made it very clear at its conference that there is a legal and constitutional obstacle to Sunday trading.  Deputy Tom Kitt and I have been examining what can be done <i>vis-à-vis</i> Sunday working.  In this Bill we address a premium for Sunday working and offer time off for those who work on Sundays.  I have accepted Deputy Kitt's Bill which will be fully examined by the parliamentary draftsman followed by thorough consultation before being scrutinised by this House.</P>
    <P>In this Bill I have already provided that people whose contract of employment does not specify that they must work on a Sunday will be allowed retain Sunday as their day off but a difficulty arises in respect of those who do have such a stipulation in their contract of employment.  That issue is dealt with in Deputy Kitt's Bill.  I suggest we progress the matter in that manner and ask that he withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>While understanding the Minister's legal dilemma it is possible to overcome such obstacles.  I should remind the House that many large multiples trade in as much as 40,000 square feet, the norm being perhaps 10,000 square feet.  I want to see small shops of approximately 60 square feet remain open on Sundays. Is it not possible to legislate on the basis of square footage?  I should be interested in hearing the Minister's response.  I am glad to note that she like myself, likes apple tart&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Unprecedented events have taken place in this House in recent weeks.  Private Members' legislation has been accepted by the Government.  I welcome that as a new scenario in Irish politics.  While that type of consensus obtains, surely it is possible to overcome the obstacles encountered in the matter of Sunday trading which I have so vehemently opposed? <Col N="789" /> There are six towns and several villages in my constituency in east Cork where traditionally the very small local shops only, including the local butcher, remained open on Sunday mornings. The new trend is that these are being forced to remain open because of the leadership of the large multiples.  This is exacerbating the shift in population from rural areas to the east coast from Dublin right down to Wexford, something with which I totally disagree.  We talk much about decentralisation and offer incentives to people to live in rural areas but have failed to identify and deal with this particular problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Ned O'Keeffe's concerns about Sunday trading on which an extensive discussion took place within our Parliamentary Party when the general consensus was that something needed to be done.</P>
      <P>A White Paper was published on the issue in the United Kingdom.  I hope we will be centrally involved in the next Government, and that it will produce a White Paper and hand over this complex debate involving constitutional issues for consideration by a committee of the House following representation from all interested parties, ranging from MANDATE, RGDATA to shop owners.  It is interesting to note that RGDATA supported the Fianna Fáil Bill.</P>
      <P>As legislators we cannot continue to adopt a <i>laissez-faire</i> approach.  We are concerned to be good Europeans and comply with directives from Brussels.  It is interesting that in other member states there are all sorts of restrictions on Sunday trading.  There are restrictions in countries such as in Germany, France, Sweden &mdash; where there is quite a liberal regime &mdash; in practically all European countries with the exception of ourselves and the United Kingdom.  While appreciating that many of these are for religious and cultural reasons, I am convinced this debate is only beginning. There is legitimate concern among Church leaders and some members of the general public. While we cannot ignore the fact that many shoppers vote with their feet it is not a matter of simply imposing very strict controls.  The subject lends itself ideally to deliberation by a committee of the House, across party lines.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ned O'Keeffe's concerns are indeed legitimate; apart from public interest concerns we must protect the small shopkeeper.  The Minister spoke of people buying papers, ingredients for apple tarts and so on, and clearly we do not want to interfere with that traditional practice on Sunday mornings.</P>
      <P>MANDATE and others, in submissions have mentioned square footage &mdash; an area the size of a tennis court has been proposed as a sort of cut off point.  Such would cover Deputy O'Keeffe's and my concerns; in other words, that anybody trading on Sundays in an area larger than that could be legislatively restricted.  I merely suggest that as a possible demarcation line we should stipulate a precise square footage, above which regulations and controls would come into play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> I will not press my amendment because the Minister has accepted our Bill.

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 30 and 31 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Notwithstanding subsection 1 of this section, an employer may permit an employee to work, in each period of 7 days, more than an average of 48 hours calculated over the applicable reference period, if&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  he has first obtained the employee's agreement to perform such work;</P>
      <P>(b)  no employee is subjected to any detriment by his employer because he is not willing to give his agreement to perform such work;</P>
      <P>(c)  he keeps up-to-date records of all employees who carry out such work;</P>
      <P>(d)  he provides to an inspector appointed under section 8(2), at the request of such inspector, information on cases in which agreement has been given by employees to perform such work.  </P>
      <P>(7) An inspector appointed under section 8(2) may certify that he has prohibited or restricted the possibility of some or all of the employees of an employer working, in each period of seven days, more than an average of 48 hours calculated over the applicable reference period.</P>
      <P>(8) An employer who, without complying with paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection 6, permits an employee to work, in each period of 7 days, more than an average of 48 hours calculated over the applicable reference period, shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>(9) Where an inspector appointed under section 8(2) issues a certificate pursuant to subsection 7, the employer named on the certificate shall be guilty of an offence if, in contravention of such certificate, he permits an employee to work in each period of seven days, more than an average of 48 hours calculated over the applicable reference period.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We should not seek to get out of certain directives. We never got an opt-out in respect of environmental matters.  Ireland will put itself out on a limb by seeking an exemption purely in the interests of saving certain vulnerable Dáil seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> This will be bad for the environment and the economy.  However, in an area where there is flexibility an opt-out would have beneficial effects on inward investment and would be good for employment and give workers the freedom to work all the hours they wish to work.  This is about freedom of choice and about people who may want to increase their take-home pay.  It was confirmed yesterday by the Minister for Finance, that a person who gets a £20 increase in salary, at a certain level, ends up £10 per week less well off. There is much to be done to discourage the black economy, to encourage employment, and give workers a break so that they are not forced by economic necessity to work overtime.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that the prison service and the State sector generally will be exempt from the provisions of the Bill and it will fall heavily on the private sector.  In certain sectors there will be difficulties in relation to manpower planning and extra workers will have to be recruited, adding to the cost base and making many blue chip companies uncompetitive.  I am disappointed the flexibility being sought in relation to other matters was not sought in respect of this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment brings us to the heart of the debate on this legislation.  On Committee Stage it proved to be a controversial issue. My party has taken a position based on our concern for the right of the individual worker to make the choice to work more than 48 hours if he or she wishes.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions had some concerns about our position. The deputy party leader, Deputy O'Rourke, and I met Peter Cassells and Patricia O'Donovan to discuss the issues involved.  They understand our position and obviously do not agree with us.  If we agreed on everything it would make for a boring political life for all of us and society would be the worse for it.</P>
      <P>I have not changed my mind in the course of this debate in relation to my position and that of my party.  There is no need to rehearse the arguments we have made but we are calling for the opt-out with all sorts of protective measures enshrined in that amendment of which the Minister is aware.  We have also an option for the individual and we make provision for the collective opt-out, which is a sensible course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The representations received have been forceful. My colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe and I have represented many of the views from individual workers and companies who are worried about the implications of this legislation.  However, I am convinced the Government will go ahead with this and it is a mistake.  While this legislation is welcome and is vitally important in the interests of the health and safety of workers we are focusing primarily on this aspect of the legislation.  To phase in its implementation over two years is simply not good enough and is not adequate.  If I were Minister I would avail of the opt-out and <Col N="792" /> the provision for a review after seven years under the EU directive.  The sensible way to deal with this matter is to allow for the opt-out.  The broad objective of my party and no doubt of all of us across party lines is to protect the worker at all costs.  Workers have told us &mdash; and we are representing their views &mdash; they want this opt-out. Clearly there is a need to review this matter over the next seven years.  A review towards the end of seven years involving the Commission and the Council of Ministers would give the Government of the day an opportunity to assess how the legislation operated and impacted on workers' conditions and potential employment here.  I am not trying to make a case for inward investment but it is important that as legislators we do not ignore submissions.  Since the Minister has met the interested parties who made submissions during Committee Stage, perhaps she will clarify the results of her meetings.</P>
    <P>The sensible way to deal with this matter would be to give everybody an opportunity to adjust to the new situation and to review the procedures after seven years.  If it comes to it, my party will press the amendment.  I am anxious to see if the Minister will give way.  We object to the manner in which she has dealt with this aspect of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The next election will be fought and won on two issues: taxation and crime. Following recent criminal events in Tallaght, 600 people attended a meeting to discuss how to solve the problems.</P>
      <P>I come from an area where we have seasonal work and seasonal industries.  The level of submissions and lobbying in my area from people working in the food industry, is unreal. Employees are not satisfied with the 48 hour voluntary opt-out and they desire an open ended arrangement similar to that suggested by Deputy Kitt.  Management are also dissatisfied with the provision as it stands.</P>
      <P>This matter is about competition.  If Ireland is not competitive in world terms there will be an increase in the numbers on the unemployment register, which currently stands at 260,000.  The tiger economies of the Far East are attracting jobs which Ireland should be procuring.  Those on long-term unemployment and unskilled people are not obtaining employment.  Those who work in the industries to which I referred are unskilled and this provision will place industry and employees at a major disadvantage.  I appeal to the Minister of State to reconsider this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the farming sector, I referred to the bloodstock industry on Committee Stage. This is a very sensitive and valuable industry and is worth many millions of pounds to the economy. <Col N="793" /> Those involved in the livestock industry and animal breeding are aware that continuity is required in the areas of breeding, husbandry, etc. However, this is being changed.  It is well known that farmers and their employees, who are adequately compensated, work approximately 60 hours per week.  The Farm Apprenticeship Board, which is a wonderful training organisation, made several submissions in respect of the legislation and argued strongly against the 48 hour voluntary opt-out.  I do not know whether the Minister of State met representatives of the board, which works in conjunction with Teagasc, the training organisation, but it supports the views I expressed.  I do not wish to be seen as long-winded or critical but common sense is needed on this issue.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the spirit in the House in recent weeks where there has been consensus and agreement on Private Members' Bills and other legislation and past arguments and divisions have been forgotten, I appeal to the Minister of State to reconsider this matter and concede the amendments. Logical arguments in favour of their acceptance were made by Deputy Kitt, who is an expert in the area of labour law and labour affairs, and Deputy Harney, who is a great defender of commercial business in Ireland.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage, many of the colleagues of the Minister of State vehemently opposed the 48 hour opt-out.  Many other countries such as Britain &mdash; Tony Blair is moving to the right and he will not change anything, provided he is fortunate enough to gain a majority in the House of Commons &mdash; and France will have the opt-out.  As a small country, Ireland cannot afford to pay the high costs it incurs at present.</P>
      <P>When an influential organisation such as the American-Irish Chamber of Commerce takes time to make a submission to an Oireachtas committee, it should send a clear message to everyone. There are 400 North American firms with businesses in this country which provide good employment and we would welcome more of them.  However, the provision under discussion will be a disincentive for North American industries. It is probably true to state that Ireland inherited Sunday trading from the US but, at the end of the day, we must make our own decisions. We want to attract the jobs, skills, industry and investment offered by North American companies but if the correct climate and ingredients are not in place, we will not attract them in future. Deputy Harney is correct to speak strongly about that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The letter sent by the IDA to the select committee, which was subsequently withdrawn, was written with the best intentions and represented a good way to do business.  Good vision was displayed in that affair because the message came <Col N="794" /> across loud and clear.  I appeal to the Minister of State to reconsider this entire area.  Deputy Kitt referred to a period of seven years which is a long time, two Governments might come to office during that time.  At that stage, Ireland will have prospered and progressed enormously because of the introduction of economic and monetary union which will lead to low interest rates.  European Monetary Union will provide milk and honey and transform Ireland into a land of opportunity.</P>
    <P>Ireland attracts jobs from the original land of opportunity and freedom, the United States.  The submission to which I referred earlier convinces me that there is a strong case to agree to the 48 hour voluntary opt-out and put in place an open ended arrangement.  We must consider the wealth, strength and employment potential of other European countries to see what can be achieved if we are to build a good economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney stated that she felt a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> and, if she made the same speech twice because she received the wrong amendment list, we have heard her in stereo.  I do not want to revisit previous arguments and discussions in great depth.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brian Fitzgerald's contribution on Committee Stage was solid and practical.  In his work as a trade union official, the Deputy had much experience of dealing with restructuring arrangements, companies and situations where people traded overtime for jobs.  Deputy Harney stated that it would be terrible if a poor business person were forced to take on additional staff but we are concerned with the creation of employment.</P>
      <P>The economy has been extremely successful and, in the four years I have been in office, there has been an increase of 160,000 in the number of people in employment.  I met representatives of the American-Irish Chamber of Commerce to which Deputies Kitt and O'Keeffe referred and there has been a great deal of exaggeration in respect of this provision's effect on multinationals. When we met the American-Irish Chamber of Commerce and discussed this issue in detail, it emerged that they had a perception that Ireland is excessively regulatory.  We pointed out that the legislation is major deregulation to simplify labour laws dating from the 1930s, recast them in a modern framework and ensure that it will no longer be necessary for 21 companies to approach my Department each week to seek endorsement for changes in shift patterns.  The Bill is a major attempt to deregulate and simplify the labour laws and the main concern of the American-Irish Chamber of Commerce was about perception, not reality.  These arrangements will not pose problems for inward investment and American multinationals operating in Ireland which have working conditions better than those laid down in law and pride themselves on being good employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of firms and sectors sought a two year lead-in period with regard to implementing <Col N="795" /> the provision.  This was agreed with the social partners, IBEC and the ICTU.  Both sides signed that deal.  This provision is a balanced and measured approach to the problem of excessive overtime and will meet the needs of groups &mdash; they remain a minority &mdash; for which an immediate 48 hour week could pose a problem.  We are not providing an exemption for the entire State sector because most of this sector will be covered by the 48 hour rule.</P>
    <P>I remain concerned about the issue of excessive overtime.  It is my strong view, borne out by health and safety statistics on accidents and fatalities in the workplace, that consistently long working hours cause problems.  Standards slip and mistakes are made, sometimes with regrettable and sad consequences.  I apologise to no one for introducing legislation with a health and safety focus which states that excessive working hours are bad for the health of workers and safety in the workplace.  I need only highlight the fact that, in the current year, 11 people were killed as a result of accidents in the workplace, the majority of which were avoidable.  That is an alarming figure.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the Health and Safety Authority I will take all possible measures to improve people's physical working environment and ensure health and safety in the workplace.  The conditions under which employees work, such as rest breaks and maximum working time limits, should be seen as a welcome addition to the necessary protection of workers.  I am sure if we examined volumes of Hansard from the 19th century when there was a move away from the seven and the six and a half day working week and other fundamental changes were made to labour law, we would find alarmist predictions about the effect on competitiveness and the workplace. Conditions and living standards have improved immeasurably since then and the alarmist predictions were not fulfilled.  Alarmist predictions were also made about the loss of jobs, female employment in particular, and competitiveness when equal pay legislation was introduced in 1975, yet the sky did not fall on our heads and there are more women in the workforce now than ever before.</P>
    <P>There is much unnecessary alarm about this issue.  Rather than succumb to the robust protestations of lobby groups, we should consider the reality and see this as a sensible and balanced provision which has been accepted as such by those involved in industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government does not call the election soon we will all suffer from excessive working hours.  If they are bad for our health the Minister of State should make sure we do not have to endure them too much longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that employers may have to take on more workers and I am in favour of greater employment.  However, some companies will find their cost bases substantially increased <Col N="796" /> and will be put at a competitive disadvantage. The security industry is an example I have raised before.  It is full of cowboys who do not care about regulations and the black economy is rampant in that sector.  One company told me recently that this legislation would add £50,000 a year to its security costs.  We may consider this to be in the interests of workers.  However, it will not be good if people lose their jobs to employees of companies in the black economy who are also collecting welfare payments.</P>
    <P>We must be practical in this matter and accept that the greater the amount of flexibility the more employment is encouraged.  We are talking about the freedom of the employee to make a choice. Many employees choose to work long hours, particularly young people who might be getting married or saving for a house.  It is their choice and in a free society they should be able to make it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ned O'Keeffe is right about what will happen in the UK because I doubt if a new Labour government there will change the British policy on this issue given Mr. Tony Blair's policies on public spending, social welfare reform or taxation &mdash; he is talking about an initial tax rate of 10 per cent.  If the Minister of State's party had similar policies to those of the British Labour Party I would be enthusiastic about going into Government with it.  However, I see no sign of that; her party is about 15 years behind its British counterpart.  Mr. Blair is advocating for Britain what is needed for Ireland &mdash; he wants to develop the enterprise culture; he will not turn the tide against privatisation; he is in favour of maintaining low tax rates, introducing an initial tax rate of 10 per cent and radically reforming the welfare system.  As they have been his views for some time I do not believe he will change British policy on this matter because he knows it makes sense for Britain.  This is true in the context of inward investment from outside Europe, in particular from the United States which cannot understand why we would not opt out of something so inflexible.</P>
    <P>Although this may not have great practical effects on many companies that do not operate on the basis of large amounts of overtime and although there is some flexibility in the way in which the provisions apply, it will be damaging from the point of view of perception.  It will make the IDA's job more difficult.  The Bill is excellent, by and large, and the Minister of State is deregulating some labour practices which have not changed since we achieved our independence. However, many impractical features remain in our labour legislation regarding how employees are paid, for example, which need to be updated. Flexibility would be in the national interest and in the interests of workers and employment and I regret we did not opt for it.</P>
    <P>There is a contrast in our approach to this issue, on which we could have had an opt out, and our approach to water management and the protection of the environment.  Flexibility and <Col N="797" /> opt-outs are not allowed and we have never got an exemption in relation to an environmental directive, yet, in the interests of saving vulnerable seats, an exemption is to be sought in the knowledge that it will not be obtained.  This points up an ironic inconsistency in the approach to these matters.</P>

I agree with Deputy Ned O'Keeffe that the IDA's true position was as stated in the first letter it sent to the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy. Mr. McGowan deserves marks for making his point and whatever happened afterwards is history.  The Irish Concrete Federation has also expressed concerns.  It pointed out that it has problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> competition with those in the concrete business in Northern Ireland.  Its arguments on this point have not been addressed.  It has been argued that all will be well and that the arrangements will be phased in over a period of two years but by that stage the matter will be lost in the bureaucratic system administered from Brussels.  I am concerned about this aspect of the Bill which the Minister of State has been asked to reconsider by my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="798" /> This is the wrong way to go about dealing with the issue.  It would be more practical to phase in the arrangements over a seven-year period at the end of which they would be subject to review. This would not alone meet the needs of workers who wish to have freedom of choice but also the needs of industry.  As the Minister of State is aware, some of the submissions were extensive. There is no need to list the agencies, bodies and representative groups which have expressed serious concern which has not been addressed.  I regret that the Minister of State is determined to proceed in this manner.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State mentioned the health and safety aspects and that some workers are required to work an excessive number of hours.  This is an exaggeration.  We moved away from such a system a long time ago. There is now greater flexibility and a better understanding between employers and employees.  It is alarming and disappointing that the Minister of State would make such a statement. She gave many quotations but the reality is that if two countries in Europe decide to opt out, a problem will arise immediately.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on the effect the arrangements will have on the agriculture industry, both at production and processing level.  The Minister of State did not deal with this issue.  Many fine submissions have been made.  The Minister of State comes from the wealthiest part of the country, the stockbroking and banking belt, where people know little about the dairy sector. However, they know much about PLCs.  Even though she represents a party of the left, the Minister of State has their support.  To generate more wealth and income, they would like her to adopt a more flexible approach in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The agriculture industry is going through a traumatic period.  In a short few months farmers have lost £200 million and will soon incur additional costs.  Instead of an increase, there will be a downturn in employment.  The Government side of the House, which is being directed by the two left wing parties, is doing little to help them. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has run from the issue.  He goes racing regularly &mdash; last week he was at Aintree.</P>
      <P>The problems of the dairy and processing sectors are not being addressed.  Seasonality presents a problem.  I would like to know what the Minister of State said to the organisations concerned when she met them.  The bloodstock sector is vital to the economy but it cannot operate on the basis of a 48 hour week.  In the dairy sector, farmers have to tend their cows overnight in case they calve.  This seems to have been forgotten.</P>
      <P>The Government is anti-farmer.  Farmers are waiting to tell those on the Government benches, particularly the members of Fine Gael, what they think of them.  This Bill adds to their problems.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) (a)  It shall be unlawful for an employer to require the attendance of an employee at his place of work for the purpose of work without providing that employee either&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (i)  work on that day for a continuous period of not less than 3 hours, or <Col N="800" /> (ii)  remuneration in lieu of the above.  </P>
    <P>(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), an employee may waive his rights under this subsection by a written consent agreement with his employer but the said consent should not be a condition of his employment.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>This amendment would require an employer to give adequate notice, to specify a minimum number of hours and to pay adequate remuneration. So far as MANDATE is concerned, the practice of offering zero hour contracts is still being followed. We welcome the fact that this Bill goes some considerable distance in dealing with the issue.  Zero hour contracts should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Protection of Young Workers Act the Minister of State and I highlighted the need for legislation in this area.  In a time of increasing casualisation of employment, there is a need for greater protection in terms of adequate notice, remuneration and so on. Employers need to be upfront with their workers. This morning on Radio Ireland Peter Cassells spoke eloquently about this issue.  In the context of Partnership 2000, he made the point that there was a need for a change of attitude in the workplace.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to workers who found themselves in such positions.  We need to give comprehensive protection to young people who have to wait beside a phone to know if they are working and who are not given the hours they were promised. I acknowledge that the Minister has gone a considerable way in dealing with this issue but further work is required.  What progress did she make in this area during her discussions with MANDATE which I understand is not completely satisfied with her efforts?</P>

      <P>I had a two and a half hour discussion on the Bill with MANDATE before Committee Stage.  Initially it did not fully understand my proposal but it finally accepted that it will effectively outlaw zero hour contracts.  If it has gone back on this in any way it is more a touch of pre-conference collywobbles than anything else.  I do not use the term &ldquo;zero hour contract&rdquo; but the wording used has the same import. A person on such a contact who is not given work will have to be paid money on a weekly basis. The Deputy proposes that they should be paid on a daily basis but MANDATE is happy that my proposal meets its concerns.  There will not be zero hour contracts after the enactment of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt and his colleague, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, who contributed robustly to the debate on the Bill.  Deputy Kitt, who is a constituency colleague, has the workers' interests at heart.  I believe he is mistaken in one particular respect but we have had a fair, open and honest <Col N="807" /> debate.  Deputy Harney also contributed in her own inimitable and robust fashion.  I disagree with many of her points but she made a valuable and democratic contribution.</P>
      <P>The Bill will mark important progress in updating our labour laws as we approach the 21st century. We need a modern framework of labour law that ensures our economic progress is not based on the exploitation of workers.  It must be both flexible and simple and respect workers' basic rights.</P>
      <P>I thank my own staff who worked long and hard not only in preparing some very technical issues in relation to the Bill but also for their involvement in an unprecedented level of consultation with the social partners.  I thank the social partners for their co-operation.  Despite the difficulties experienced in the past we were able to reach agreement, and the Bill reflects a balance between the views expressed on both sides.  That partnership is important for us in framing our labour laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for the manner in which he presided over the latter part of the debate when we disposed of a large number of amendments.  I am conscious of the fact that many of our colleagues are currently campaigning, and I am sure the Minister of State and I will have an opportunity to do that later this week.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the manner in which she put her case.  I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill.  We differed on one particular aspect, mainly, the question of the 48 hour week and the need for a voluntary opt-out.  I thank my colleagues on this side of the House who contributed to the debate, particularly Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, my colleague Deputy O'Rourke and others who took a strong position on this matter. I hope it was accepted that the views we expressed were based on our own assessment of the situation.  Out of this debate Fianna Fáil had a Private Members' Bill accepted by the Government in relation to workers' rights, and that is to be welcomed.  It was important to deal with the whole question of Sunday work in the retail sector.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has been a strong advocate of social partnership.  We initiated the whole process and we welcome the new programme Partnership 2000.  I am aware there is some evidence of cracks appearing in that agreement.  I hope they can be mended because it is worrying that they appeared at this early stage.  Serious concerns have been expressed by Peter Cassells and others and I hope those can be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to issues such as the provision of an opt-out clause from the 48 hour working week, there is an onus on legislators to look beyond the process of social partnership and consensus. Deputy Jim Mitchell made the valid point that while consensus on various issues is a welcome development, it is equally important that legislators <Col N="808" /> keep their eyes on the real world in terms of the concerns of individual workers and industry. We have a role to play in the way we deal with specific issues; in this case labour legislation was required.  It is my experience that we cannot always depend on consensus.  I watched the Minister of State trying to juggle the interests of the trade union movement and those of industry, employees, etc.  In this case they simply did not gel.  Many workers expressed views to us that their own trade unions were not articulating their genuine concerns.  One could say this issue fell between those interests and there was a clear need for the legislators to enact a law pertaining to the real world.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well with this legislation. We are concerned about the aspects to which I referred but I hope they will not impact too seriously on those we endeavour to represent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny) Enda Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 makes provision for European Regional Development Fund support for a large dedicated conference centre capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates to be built in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The tourism potential of a national conference centre here has long been recognised, and the first Operational Programme for Tourism, 1989-93, contained provision for such a development. No progress was made, however, at that stage.</P>
      <P>In September-October 1995, Bord Fáilte organised an open tendering competition seeking interested parties to submit proposals for capital grant assistance of up to 50 per cent towards the development of such a centre and 13 consortia submitted full proposals.  These were rigorously assessed by a Bord Fáilte-led assessment team and considered by the independent Product Development Management Board set up under the operational programme to consider such projects. None of the applicants met the criteria which had been set, and the open tendering competition accordingly terminated.</P>
      <P>Following the failure of the competition to produce an acceptable private sector proposal to develop the centre, the independent management board, under whose aegis the competition was run, recommended that the strategy be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> They suggested, as an alternative, the possibility of developing the centre through a public sector option.  As a result the Royal Dublin Society, as a voluntary body potentially eligible for consideration for the higher rate of European Regional Development Fund assistance normally reserved for public or similar bodies, was invited to submit a proposal on this basis.  A similar invitation subsequently issued to a public-private joint venture who failed to submit an initial application within a twice extended deadline.</P>
    <P>Upon completion of its examination of the RDS proposal, Bord Fáilte, on the recommendation of the management board, commissioned an independent cost-benefit analysis which is required under the tourism operational programme in the case of all large projects.  This was undertaken by an experienced UK consultancy firm who were selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure.  The results were favourable to the RDS proposal.</P>
    <P>The Government, having taken into account a number of factors including the recommendations of the management board and Bord Fáilte and the results of the cost benefit analysis, agreed to make a submission to the European Commission recommending formal approval of the proposed development by the RDS.  The Government is recommending approval of 75 per cent capital grant aid subject to the existing financial provision for such a project in the current tourism operational programme.  The proposal has been submitted to the European Commission for approval, as required under the operational programme for projects of this scale.</P>
    <P>Since then the Commission officials of DG XVI and their consultants have been continuing their examination of the Government's submission, including the in-depth cost-benefit analysis. As part of this examination, they have sought clarification on a number of issues, and my Department is currently dealing with some final queries, recently received, on which the Commission requires a response before it is in a position to make its final decision.  These queries are currently being dealt with as a matter of priority in my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall references in the course of my reply to the House to questions on the same project on 5 March last, as reported in volumn 475, No. 8, columns 1594 to 1600 of the Official Report, to reports about a complaint lodged with the Commission.  I indicated in a written reply to the House two days ago that the European Commission has now communicated formal notice of a complaint lodged with it on the subject of selection procedures.  The clarifications sought in that communication are currently being prepared in my Department in consultation with Bord Fáilte who carried out the assessment of applications under both the tender competition and the alternative strategy.</P>
    <P>A specific timetable for commencement or completion of the national conference centre project cannot be determined until the proposal has <Col N="810" /> been formally approved by the European Commission and matters such as planning permission are in place.  There is, however, no reason at this stage to believe that the project cannot be developed under the tourism operational programme in accordance with the permissible timeframe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to place it in the public domain, we strongly support the principle of 75 per cent grant aid from the European Union. However, we are concerned about the so-called flagship project in the Minister's programme.  It appears that it is gently sinking beneath the waves of incompetence.  The Minister mentioned the original competition which was a shambles and indicative of what we could have expected.</P>
      <P>When did the Minister submit the plans for the RDS?  Has he been in contact with the European Union?  What are the issues that concern it?  To whom did he speak?  What was the response?  Can the Minister give some information on complaints and procedures?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the Deputy is at least supportive of the 75 per cent concept which is in the domain of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies.  I do not agree that the original process was a shambles.  It was properly and carefully conducted on the basis of a 50 per cent grant from within the private sector.  Of the 13 consortia that submitted proposals none met the criteria, and the process self-terminated.</P>
      <P>I have been in contact with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and Commissioner Monti.  On 5 November 1996 the Government gave formal agreement to making a submission to the European Commission recommending formal approval of a 75 per cent capital grant aid towards the proposed development by the Royal Dublin Society.  As a former Minister for Foreign Affairs and potential President, Deputy Andrews understands the procedures of the European Commission and that there are rules and procedures to be gone through.  Information requested by the Commission officials of DG XVI from Bord Fáilte and the Department was supplied.  Further queries followed, and they were answered quite recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of the lodging of a formal complaint, one has no control over what complaints are lodged with the European Commission.  I have only just received a formal complaint which came <Col N="811" /> through the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This is now being replied to by Bord Fáilte in conjunction with the Department.  I have not been informed of the name of the complainant, but I am aware that the complaint deals with technical and procedural issues.  I hope the reply currently being prepared within the Department and by Bord Fáilte will answer all queries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well known that the complainant has an address in the centre of Dublin. It appears there is a less than active effort being made to process this urgently before the operational programme runs out in 1999.  I am concerned that there is a lack of will and urgency about the matter.  Has the Minister adopted a hands-on approach to this?  Has he sent an official or officials from his Department to literally sit outside the Commissioner's door until such time as the problem is resolved?  This project is fundamental to tourism in this city because when the boom days are over it is the type of flagship project that will be necessary to maintain the input of people into the Dublin city and county.  It is fundamentally important that this project be processed urgently without further fudging on the part of the Department or of the Minister and without it creating chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am adopting a hands-on approach to this matter.  I spoke to Commission Wulf-Mathies &mdash; it is her responsibility &mdash; who said clearly she will deal with the issue of the level of grant assistance when that matter comes before her.  I respect her decision in that regard. I had a special meeting with Commissioner Monti, who deals with the internal market, at a Trade Ministers' meeting in Brussels the week before St. Patrick's Day and asked him if he would formally send any complaint he had received.  It was my understanding that this complaint had been lodged for some time within the legal section of the Commission.  The Commissioner responded by saying he would do so and it is only in recent days that the complaint on technical and procedural matters was sent to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I am as conscious and concerned as Deputy Andrews about the draw-down time, given that the operational programme will end in 1999. Article 5 of Commission decision C94/1972 of 29 July 1994, which deals with granting assistance from the European Regional Development Fund and the ESF funds under the Operational Programme for Tourism, provides that where money has been committed at national level before the end of the programme period it may still be spent after that period has expired up to 31 December 2000.  The RDS was advised in discussions with DG XVI that if its project was to be given approval the deadline could be extended by a decision of the Commission to end December 2001.</P>

      <P>I would like to finish with it now and have it approved for the benefit of the tourism industry and the country.  There are, however, procedures within the Commission over which I do not have direct influence and we are responding as quickly as possible in accordance with them.  I have no control over the lodging of complaints or the consequences that might follow lodging a planning application.  It is impossible for me to give an accurate time in terms of completion, but I would like to see the matter completed as quickly as possible.  The developers indicated that it could take up to 43 months from the date of approval to completion as it is a major project, but until the first stone is formally laid it is not possible to put an accurate timescale on its completion.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether the structures which are currently in place for the development of Ireland's tourism industry need to be re-evaluated to make them more compatible with the needs of a modern tourism industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9442/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to which structures the Deputy is referring in his question.  The Department of Tourism and Trade, which has the lead responsibility for the formulation of national policy on tourism, has been in place since the beginning of 1993.  In reply to previous questions from the Deputy, I have indicated that combining the tourism portfolio with trade has resulted in a single Government Department being able to focus specifically and successfully on the optimisation of Ireland's foreign earnings.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Bord Fáilte was the subject of a comprehensive review by international consultants in 1994 and, arising from that review, the focus and structure of the organisation has been radically altered with a renewed emphasis on the international marketing of Irish tourism, leading to such recent initiatives as the launch of the new Tourism Brand Ireland project.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Tourism Council continues to act as an effective national forum for consultations between the industry, the tourism agencies, namely, Bord Fáilte, CERT and Shannon Development and my Department, and for the provision of advice to me on tourism matters.  The council facilitates direct dialogue between all the key players in tourism on identifying the needs of modern Irish tourism and how best to address them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative &mdash; OTMI &mdash; which was launched in 1995, remains a vibrant partnership involving Bord Fáilte, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board <Col N="813" /> and the tourism industry, North and South, and has overseen significant new marketing initiatives in our four main markets of Britain, France, Germany and the US.  A unique characteristic of this strengthening partnership is the joint funding of the OTMI's activities based on sectoral and Exchequer contributions, topped up by EU funds under the Operational Programme for Tourism. It represents an excellent model for future development.</P>
    <P>I should also mention the detailed review of the co-ordination of regional tourism undertaken in 1993 which led, in agreement with the regional tourism organisations, to the establishment of more appropriate institutional structures for Irish tourism at regional and county level.  A new structure based on county divisions was established and new slimmed-down boards of management at regional level were also set up.  My understanding is that the new arrangements are functioning as well as intended.</P>
    <P>Within the operational programme itself, some innovative arrangements were introduced to give effect to the new partnership between State and the tourism sector in promoting future growth. The sector is, for example, represented for the first time on new management boards assigned significant decision-making responsibilities in respect of marketing and product spend.  These are functioning well.  Furthermore, the sector is represented on the steering committee for the programme and on the overall National Monitoring Committee whose role is to oversee the management of the programme in terms of the principal objectives set under it for the development of the sector up to the end of the century.  In this regard I should not let the opportunity pass without saying that progress in achieving core targets has been excellent to date and the industry is well on track to reach foreign exchange earnings of £2.25 billion and total employment of 120,000 by 1999.</P>
    <P>Currently the programme is the subject of a mid-term evaluation following which certain refinements and adjustments may be made.  Planning for possible scenarios post-1999 has already commenced which will take into account the views and needs of the industry and the overriding objective of developing a strong sustainable tourism sector contributing to increased foreign earnings and employment creation.  In the course of this exercise, the adequacy and suitability of existing structures for future tourism development will be looked at, but it is clearly too early for definite views to have emerged at this stage. Whatever about the future, it is indisputable that the policies and structures currently in place have helped to contribute to the achievement of excellent results in recent years, with average annual foreign exchange earnings from tourism increasing by more than 11 per cent in each of the last three years, a performance which is at the top end of the European league.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Finance Act, 1995, made provision for a pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas to apply on a pilot basis for three years from 1 July 1995.  The purpose of the scheme is to renew and update the tourist amenities and facilities in the areas designated. The 15 areas designated were selected to give an even spread around the coast of designated resort areas.</P>
      <P>From time to time I have consulted the Minister for Finance, who has primary responsibility for the scheme, about the possibility of extending it but we have agreed not to make any changes to its scope or to designate any new areas until the present three year pilot period has elapsed and a full evaluation has been completed.  In this context, ongoing meetings are at present taking place between my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and Bord Fáilte with a view to evaluating the impact of the scheme.  The evaluation is not expected to be finalised until later in the year and meanwhile it is simply too early to say what its outcome will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>A review of what is happening in various areas is currently taking place.  Reports suggest the scheme has been very successful in <Col N="815" /> some places, but not in others.  There are different views about the types of facilities being provided. The level of overall investment between designated areas varies somewhat.  It is similar to the urban renewal scheme in that one can plot paths of progress in various parts of the country.  The long lead-in times for capital projects and the planning process inhibits the ability of the regional tourism authority to assess accurately what is involved.  Also, one cannot make an accurate judgment until claims are made to the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the appropriate tax year.  However, work is progressing and I will be pleased to listen to any suggestions the Deputy might wish to make.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the drop in the tourism and travel balance in 1994 and 1995; when the revised figure for 1996 will be available; and whether the provisional figure for 1996 is being matched or exceeded in 1997.</Quest>

      <P>The end of year CSO figures for 1996 show revenue from overseas visitors reaching a record £1.9 billion.  This represents an increase of 12 per cent on 1995 and provides further evidence of the continuing excellent performance of Irish tourism.  Last year was the third consecutive year of double digit revenue growth. I was also pleased to note from the recently published CSO figures that expenditure increased at a higher rate than overseas visitor numbers, which suggests that visitors to Ireland are spending more money per head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the roll-out of Tourism Brand Ireland in <Col N="816" /> all our major markets and a significant expansion in air access to Ireland, I anticipate that tourism will continue to achieve significant growth in 1997.</P>
    <P>In regard to Ireland's tourism and travel balance, the primary reason for the growth in outbound tourism in the past three years, particularly in 1994 and 1995, is due to Ireland's economic growth and the attendant increase in personal disposable incomes.  A contributory factor would also be the increased competition in air and sea fares which, in addition to helping to reduce inbound fares to Ireland, has also made foreign travel more affordable for Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>This increased propensity among Irish people to travel abroad has greatly benefited Irish carriers whose revenue from Irish tourists increased by 24 per cent from 1993 to 1996.  In addition, Ireland's tourism and travel balance has been in our favour in recent times and I am very encouraged to note that the balance increased substantially in 1996 to £524 million, compared with £412 million in 1995.</P>
    <P>With the launch of the domestic tourism marketing campaign this year, with a budget of more than £1 million, the intention is to reinvigorate the home holiday market, particularly in the off-peak and shoulder season.  This campaign should go some way towards encouraging more Irish people to take their holidays at home.</P>
    <P>I understand from the CSO that the figures published for 1996 are final.  The only provisional element in the figures are the passenger fare receipts which may be subject to amendment once definitive figures are provided by the carriers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister is placing more emphasis on expenditure by tourists rather than on numbers.  I am sure he will agree that is an important matter.  I take the Minister's point about the contribution made by people travelling abroad to the lowering of air fares.  In that context, the attempt to promote the domestic market is very important.  Are there indications that the tourism and travel balance will favour the domestic market in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it will.  The domestic market and its revenue yield is important.  That is why we gave the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, specific responsibility for that market.  The £1 million will yield results.  It takes time for people to accept a new image.  While I agree this is an important market, we live in a free country and if people want to travel abroad on holidays, we cannot stop them.  The country is booming and international air fares have decreased.  At the same time, it is important to present, in their best light, the facilities we offer to home holidaymakers. Many of our citizens are not very familiar with this country, but can talk eloquently and long about places around the globe.  As one of the leading tourist designations in the world, I hope as many people as possible have the opportunity <Col N="817" /> and experience of sampling the delights of the facilities of their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there provisional figures for the first quarter of 1997?  I suspect there are not. Has the research indicated why the balance for 1994-5 is substantially lower than 1994 and 1996? Did particular factors make travel to foreign destinations more attractive than holidaying at home in those years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The tourism and travel balance was £533 million in 1993, £426 million in 1994, £412 million in 1995 and £524 million in 1996, an increase of £112 million on the previous year.  I am sure there are a number of reasons for that which one could attempt to identify.  I do not have figures for the first quarter of this year and if they become available I will send them to the Deputy. The indications for this year are good.  When one introduces a new tourism brand initiative it takes some time for the market to understand the new positioning of the country.  We are seeking revenue yield from international visitors &mdash; an important element of the tourism brand.  It is now in full flight internationally and I expect it will pay dividends which will be of substantial benefit.</P>

      <P>The six regional tourism authorities together with Shannon Development operate a national network of tourist information offices.  Those authorities are currently carrying out their Tourist Information Offices Investment Programme 1994-1999 to upgrade their offices through building work, outfitting and installation of new technology.  Funding and resourcing for the programme based on 1993 projections is as follows:</P>

    <P>This represents a projected investment of £12 million to the end of the decade.  While all offices will benefit from the installation of new technology, the prioritising and targeting of particular locations for upgrading or development are matters for the regional tourism authorities and Shannon Development.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I am glad to note that substantial funding is <Col N="818" /> available towards the improvement of the tourist office information network.  The Minister will be aware of the disastrous situation in County Cavan where the tourist office in the county town is in a building around which there has been a hoarding for a considerable time.  The Minister met a deputation, visited the office and saw that it is in inadequate. This matter was raised previously in this House and at committees.  Will the Minister use his influence with Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisation to put in place a proper tourist office in Cavan town as a matter of extreme urgency?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of grave concern to the people of Cavan.  It was raised here by the Deputies Smith, Boylan and others.  I met a deputation when I was travelling south from Donegal and looked at the building.  It is structurally unsafe and is not suitable for use as a tourist information office in an area which has good potential for investment and the generation of tourism revenue now and in the future.</P>
      <P>I communicated my concern about this matter to Bord Fáilte and I will do so again following the Deputy's request.  I had a brief consultation with the local authority on the occasion I met the deputation and I will take the matter up again with it and with the regional tourism organisation manager.  I am not happy that visitors to Cavan should have to call to that tourist office, around which there is a hoarding, to obtain information. It is right and fitting that Cavan town should have a proper tourist information office and that people from around the region wishing to avail of the facilities and delights of the region should have access to valuable information in a bright and well decorated office.  I will follow up this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks.  In his earlier reply he indicated the investment programme would be targeted at the areas where the present infrastructure is totally deficient.  I do not believe there is any other tourist office as inadequate as the one in Cavan.  Will the Minister stress to the officials in the relevant organisations that we need capital assistance as a matter of urgency to put in place a proper office to avail of and develop the great tourism potential of the area?  The Cavan area needs regeneration following the difficulties it faced for a period of 25 years.  The county needs to develop the tourism industry if it is to have any hope of regenerating the local economy.</P>

      <P>That decision is a matter for the regional tourism organisation which prioritises areas it considers deserve prioritisation.  That is why the programme of money was laid out in the way it was.  If it remained in the realm of the <Col N="819" /> Minister of the day, there would be claims of slush-funding activities or political bias.  That is why the RTO is expected to draw up a priority list and state the agenda it will follow.  I will take up this matter.  I, as well as the Cavan people, am concerned about this and I hope that some progress can be made to provide a decent office from which visitors to the area can obtain information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware there are a number of other tourist information offices operating throughout the country.  Is some of the funding from the four sources he mentioned used to run those offices?  Are they in the main or exclusively set up with the co-operation of the RTO or are they mainly depending on funding from Leader or some such programme and operating in a semi-independent way separately from the main tourist information service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a variety of such offices.  The six regional tourism authorities and Shannon Development operate a national network of tourist information offices.  They are open all year round in key locations and in other areas seasonal offices are open where they are justified by tourist demand.  In 1996 the network comprised 94 tourist information offices, of which 38 were open all year round and 56 were seasonal offices.  They deal with about 3.7 million callers each year as well as approximately 1.5 million telephone and postal inquiries.  At locations which do not justify a tourist information office but where visitor demand or potential exists the RTAs and Shannon Development establish tourist information points.  These are either display or sales stands or tourist literature at visitor attractions or in tourist related businesses.</P>
      <P>Dublin Tourism operates all year round in Suffolk Street, Dublin Airport, Dun Laoghaire, Tallaght and Baggot Street Bridge.  In the Shannon Development Area tourist offices in Ennis, Limerick, Shannon Airport and Tralee are open all year round as well as others in various localities.</P>
      <P>The following TIOs have benefited to date under the current 1994-99 operational programme and INTERREG II Border programmes. All the facilities in addition to receiving EU funding have received assistance from Bord Fáilte's capital development fund.  They include Blarney TIO and the Skiberreen office which was enlarged and outfitted, in Dublin City the office in Suffolk Street, Dun Laoghaire TIO and offices in County Louth, County Roscommon and County Sligo.  Tourist information offices in Bantry in County Cork and Dingle and Killarney in County Kerry have been the subject of operational funding approval but construction work on them has not yet begun.</P>

    </table>
    <P>As I have said in reply to previous questions, specific targets have been set under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 for improving tourism activity in the shoulder and off-peak seasons.  At the beginning of the programme 70 per cent of visitors came to Ireland outside the peak season and our aim is to have 75 per cent of visitors arrive outside the peak period by 1999.  The mid-term target set out in the programme is for 72 per cent of visitors to arrive outside the peak period and I am happy to say this target was reached during 1996.  To help achieve the 1999 target, the level of business outside the peak season needs to be significantly increased.  It is mainly up to the industry itself to make the necessary adjustments in terms of product development and marketing to achieve this goal.  A number of specific initiatives are currently under way to help industry address the extension of the season.</P>
    <P>On 15 January I launched the Celtic Flame Music Festival.  This initiative is based on a recommendation of the Tourism Council and its <Col N="821" /> aim is to further build tourism in the off-season. Festival events took place in Galway from 20-23 February, in Cork from 25 February to 2 March and in Limerick from 7-9 March.  Although I have not yet received final figures for numbers attending, I understand that these events attracted a significant level of interest.  The festival also acted as a lively lead-in to the very successful St. Patrick's Day Festivities in Dublin which I am convinced have the potential to become a further major attraction in the shoulder period.</P>
    <P>On 10 February the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, launched the 1997 Domestic Tourism Marketing Initiative.  This major boost to domestic tourism will provide an added impetus in the off-season.  A recent survey on the domestic holiday market commissioned by Bord Fáilte concluded that the home product has improved dramatically in most people's experience.  It is considered attractive, available and affordable.  In particular, short breaks were seen as seasonally flexible and weather is no longer regarded as a major impediment.</P>
    <P>At the level of product, the improvement in the range and quality of weather independent facilities in recent years and the substantial investment in the marketing of these facilities is designed to improve the seasonality profile of the industry. The assistance which the industry has received under the tourism operational programmes has been of considerable benefit in this regard.</P>
    <P>It will also serve to complement the success to date of overseas tourism marketing, which is a State industry partnership marketing initiative promoting Ireland on a year round basis in our key markets and whose campaigns are directed at attracting visitors outside the peak season.</P>
    <P>Finally, the launch last year of Tourism Brand Ireland formed a key part of a new strategic approach to marketing designed to address major issues such as yield, regional spread and seasonality. The advertising emphasis is on aspects of the Irish holiday such as human interaction, culture and historical heritage, which are not season dependent.</P>
    <P>All these initiatives are aimed not only at increasing numbers but achieving greater growth in tourism revenue outside the peak period.  CSO figures show consistent increases in revenue generated by overseas visitors during the off-peak months of October to March.  For example, in 1996 there was an increase of over 9 per cent to £626 million compared with 1995.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1996 some 17 new hotels opened in Dublin, which is almost half the total built in the country as a whole in the preceding 12 months.  In 1984 there were only 65 hotels in Dublin, in 1996 there were 104 and by the end of this year the figure will have increased to at least 117, with a further 26 hotels in the pipeline.  Taking account of the fact that I am speaking specifically about Dublin, with that type of hotel accommodation available can the Minister say whether <Col N="822" /> these hotels will survive in the off-shoulder season? I hope the boom will continue into eternity but in the event of the bubble bursting what action does the Minister contemplate taking in regard to this type of burgeoning hotel accommodation?</P>
      <P>A total of 6,800 rooms is not an enormous amount for a capital city.  Brussels, for example, has about 20,000 rooms but it is a different type of city and attracts a different type of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of these points were raised at a recent seminar on the growth of tourism in Dublin.  Deputy Andrews raised a very important point.  Hotel developments, including extensions, are commercial decisions made by people who want to spend money to get into the market because they believe they can make a profit. I would like to see a situation where the discourse we have begun about what will happen post-1999 when the current operational programme ends, is taken on board by everybody in the business.  I would like to think that all new commercially driven hotels, and some speculative hotel projects, will involve themselves in promoting their industry.</P>
      <P>It would not be fair to have a number of traditional hotels in the market spending money on marketing the industry in Dublin while others tend to wait for the benefit to arrive.  We should continue to market aggressively the quality, facilities and range of experience that visitors here can have.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Andrews is aware from discussions I had with him, it is important to go one step further and anchor business with major events such as the World Equestrian Games next year, the tall ships' visit to Dublin and, of course, the largest bicycle race in the world, the Tour de France, the magnitude of which people here are not yet fully aware of.</P>
      <P>There are other such events, including the major American professional football league game, which will take place this July.  That will bring an influx of many thousands of American football supporters from the United States and Continental Europe.  That kind of activity lends itself not only to building a vacation around the event but to the possibility of creating further substantial benefits in terms of repeat business.</P>
      <P>It is all about presenting ourselves in the best possible light and marketing ourselves in that way.  We have now built the tourism industry to a point where it is rolling on a wave.  Everyone associated with the industry must see to it that the wave keeps rolling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate why Fianna Fáil has added sports to the tourism portfolio in its policy document, which makes a lot of sense.  I commend Pat McQuaid and the Minister for the efforts they have made in bringing the Tour de France to Ireland.  It is a wonderful development which is tremendously important and exciting.  I have been following the Tour de <Col N="823" /> France from the days of Fausto Copi in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  It is a wonderful achievement and I commend everybody associated with it.  It is in the national interest and I hope people here and the hundreds of millions of people watching the race on television will enjoy it.  I hope those along the route of the Tour de France on this island of ours will benefit from it culturally and economically.  I wish it well.</P>
      <P>The quality and standard of hotels in the city and county of Dublin is exceptional.  I can think of hotels in my own constituency &mdash; like Fitzpatrick's Castle, the Court Hotel in Killiney, the new Rochestown Park Hotel, formerly known as the Victor, and the Royal Marine in Dún Laoghaire &mdash; which are excellent and run by excellent hoteliers.  The quality and standard of hotels in Dublin city and county, and indeed in the country generally, is really good.  We do not have to worry too much about their marketing and development.  However, I am concerned about the need to address the possibility of a downturn in the tourist industry, which, I hope, will never happen.  Nevertheless, we should be prepared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Andrew's view of the quality of the hotels run by the Fitzpatrick group and others.  Research recently commissioned by Bord Fáilte shows a few interesting things.  There has been a significant increase in people's ability to buy desirable products, with holidays being seen as an aspect of their lives. While foreign holidays still exert strong pressure, the domestic offer is not seen as inferior but different.  The home product has improved dramatically in most people's experience.  As I said in the main reply to this question, it is considered attractive, available and affordable.</P>
      <P>It is important that the tourism industry shares the sense of co-operation and co-ordination shown in many other areas for the greater benefit of everyone and of the industry.  The big sin in tourism was the inbuilt inward-looking jealousies which caused disruption on too many fronts.  I am glad there is greater co-operation upon which we intend to build so that everybody understands that £1 invested in this industry has the potential, if handled properly, to be repaid many times.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Andrews's view on the Tour de France, which is the largest annual sporting event in the world.  I hope the citizens respond to this initiative and that children will be given an opportunity at some point along the route to see the colourful caravan as it winds its way back to France.</P>

      <P>During the course of the Minister's initial response he referred to the success of the Celtic Flame Music Festival.  Is it intended to hold that again in 1998?  Are there any similar initiatives for the winter, such as a festival of sound or magic?  What is the NITB's involvement in the domestic tourism initiative following the <Col N="824" /> Ballintubber meeting and any subsequent meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Celtic Flame Music Festival was recommended by the Tourism Council which felt, as we all did, that the St. Patrick's Day traditional festivities were too confined and that Ireland should not look at how others celebrate an Irish day; 4 July, Australia Day and Bastille Day are claimed by others.  This is traditionally a shoulder season so it was an attempt to build interest, particularly in Northern Ireland and Britain, in the Celtic Flame Music Festival.  The intention is to make the St. Patrick's Day festivities into a week long festival leading up to St. Patrick's Day by the year 2000.  It holds great potential.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Council looked at a range of other options and I assume that when we review the Celtic Flame Music Festival this year, those options in respect of the winter period will also be considered.  The Tourism Council recommended that March would be a better option than the winter months.</P>
      <P>I do not have any details of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board's involvement in the domestic tourism initiative, but I will forward them to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  We should also pay tribute not only to the Government for agreeing to allocate funding because one cannot sponsor the Tour de France, but to the race director, Mr. Jean-Marie Le Blanc, who consistently said he would not offer this event to any other country &mdash; many wanted to have it &mdash; until Ireland had made up its mind.  I am happy to have been associated with it.  Ireland will benefit enormously from this event.  Some 960 million people internationally will watch this race and they will see Ireland's countryside, towns and people giving the French and their entourage a warm reception as they did in 1798 in Enniscorthy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8, 15, 16 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The House is aware that Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, which are joint owners of the Gulliver system, have been seeking potential private sector partnerships to assist in the longer term future development of the system. Against this background, the Government gave its approval on Tuesday to a proposal for a commercial partnership arrangement, but final details have yet to be formally agreed between all the parties involved.  Until such time as this has been done, the confidentiality required by those involved must be respected and it would be inappropriate for me to divulge any details.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on 17 October last, total expenditure on the Gulliver project in the period 1990 to 1995 was £10.2 million.  Taking account of membership and transaction fees of £1.6 million, the estimated net cost of the project up to the end of 1995 was £8.6 million.  Funding for the net expenditure on the project came from EU development grants, which amounted to £2.9 million, Bord Fáilte's own resources of £2.6 million, International Fund for Ireland development grants of £1.6 million and £1.5 million from the Northern Ireland Tourist Board's own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also informed the House on that occasion that details of the percentage of reservations made <Col N="826" /> through the Gulliver system is commercially sensitive information which would not be appropriate for me to disclose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Gulliver, which someone described as gullible, is a costly failure.  The Comptroller and Auditor General criticised its operation in a value for money examination.  He was of the opinion that the system had not provided the planned service.  He was also critical of the fact that it was not excessively used by the travel industry.  He said the cost of developing and running the system was greater than estimated, that management of the project had been deficient and the system may have been overtaken by advances in technology.  The Minister was right when he said that by the end of 1995 the total cost was £10.2 million, while fee income was only £1.6 million.  It is understandable why the Comptroller and Auditor General said it was not value for money.</P>
      <P>I do not want to prejudice the outcome of the negotiations to rescue the system &mdash; perhaps it should be let die on the vine &mdash; but newspaper reports suggest that a Kerry-based financial services and data processing company is negotiating to buy a stake in Gulliver and that the deal will be concluded in the near future.  It has been proposed that the company concerned will pay between £3.5 million and £4 million for 75 per cent of Gulliver and the tourist boards will have a 25 per cent shareholding.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Gulliver system was introduced in 1989 to bring tourism reservations systems in Ireland to the leading edge of technology. It did not work in the way intended.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the Government gave its approval to outsource the management of the Gulliver system and it was decided that a third party specialist operator-investor should be sought to take responsibility for adapting and developing the system and managing the accommodation supplier contracts.  Quite a long bidding and tendering process followed and it was eventually agreed the matter would be disposed of to a County Kerry company, the Foreign Exchange Company of Ireland Limited or Fexco, as Deputy Andrews will probably be aware.  I do not want to give the details of the exact sums involved until the contract has been signed, and I expect that will happen shortly.  I expect this will be a good marriage.  This is an exceptional company and it will be able to manage and develop this system. Following the adverse comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General and others, I believe this is the best deal we could get in respect of this system and I hope it will prove itself in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the Gulliver experiment has been expensive and we need to learn from it?  In the course of the examinations to which the Comptroller and Auditor <Col N="827" /> General referred and the examination of the matter by the Department, are there lessons which we must learn about expensive tourism undertakings? Will it be possible to ensure that something like this does not happen again or, at least, that the kind of required background information is in place before future experiments of this nature are undertaken?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The best technology changes rapidly.  When this was first introduced in 1989, its approach was radical and it was a world leading technology; but it did not develop to a point where it could achieve its capacity and potential. As no other national tourist board was involved in the same sort of radical approach, we did not suffer adversely.  It was costly, it was examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Government recommended that it be outsourced. I was happy to get formal Government approval this week for the outsourcing, management and eventual fundamental development of the potential of the system with a company which has an outstanding record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister uses expressions like &ldquo;outsourcing&rdquo;.  Is this the new language of political correctness?  He is really saying this operation was tragically unsuccessful.  I would not call it a failure because I do not want to frighten off Fexco, which is kindly considering taking over and operating Gulliver successfully.  The Minister would agree that Gulliver was not successful, to say the least.  In the circumstances, all we can do is wish the proposed new operators well and thank them for their interest and for giving Gulliver the kiss of life.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>
      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has put to the Department of Finance to encourage development of the tourism product in the upper Shannon catchment area by means of tax concessions or designation in a similar way to the special resorts scheme.</Quest>

      <P>The pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas was introduced in the Finance Act, 1995, and operates for a three year period from 1 July 1995.  The purpose of the scheme is to renew and update the tourist amenities and facilities in 15 designated areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, it has been the practice for me to consult from time to time with the Minister for Finance, who has primary responsibility for the scheme, about the possibility <Col N="828" /> of extending it but we have agreed not to make any changes to its scope or to designate any new areas until the present three year pilot period has elapsed and a full evaluation has been completed. In this context, ongoing meetings are taking place at present between the Department, the Revenue Commissioners and Bord Fáilte with a view to evaluating the impact of the scheme.  The evaluation is not expected to be finalised until later in the year and it is simply too early to know the outcome of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister's response to the question of special designation for the upper Shannon region was not more positive. He will be particularly aware that, since the restoration of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal, there has been a considerable increase in tourism activity in counties Cavan, Fermanagh and Leitrim but there is a shortage of investment in tourism in the area.  There has been some notable investment but there has been little or no investment in the north-west of Cavan near the source of the Shannon in the Cuilcagh mountain range.  Will the Minister consider introducing some measures to encourage private sector investment to improve the tourism product in an area which is renowned for its beauty?  A quality tourism product could be generated there.</P>

      <P>This question is slightly different to the one in the name of Deputy Doherty, which sought an extension of the seaside pilot relief scheme to the Shannon basin.  If one dropped the word &ldquo;seaside&rdquo;, one would be left with a pilot scheme which would be suitable anywhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>About 49 areas for which designation was sought this year, were submitted to the Department of Finance for agreement but we had agreed on the structure.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the European Regional Development Fund programme is to encourage private sector investment.  This initiative has stimulated investment in buildings and other facilities in some areas but the European Regional Development Fund programme is for private or public sector involvement in the provision of tourism in the Deputy's area and other areas.  That is why, for instance, Bord Fáilte was prepared to provide £4.5 million for a major development at Lough Kee forest which did not proceed because the conditions were not met by the proposers.  The opportunity is there.  The mid-term review of the Operational Programme is under way and there will be further funding in the various sectors for which private and public enterprise can apply.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's view of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal.  It has given a great stimulus to that area and a range of projects are being considered.</P>

      <P>The decision by the Government to establish an information society commission to spearhead national strategy will facilitate the exploitation by the tourism and trade sectors of the potential benefits of the information society which include: improved competitiveness as disadvantages of size and remoteness from markets are reduced; better and more efficient market development and access to markets as market reach is extended with better means of marketing products with opportunities for new products and services and improved market information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>A number of issues facing exporters are being addressed in the marketing subprogramme of the Industry Operational Programme, ranging from preparing for and responding to global competition with the resultant requirement to strengthen exporters' marketing capabilities to allow them enter and develop markets.  There is also the issue of market diversification as we prepare for economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>Primarily, because we are a small open economy, we are exposed to currency fluctuations, a feature of normal international trading life and the main reason the Government is so committed to becoming a founder member of economic and monetary union to secure our long-term economic growth and minimise such problems in future.</P>
      <P>I understand that An Bord Tráchtála has established a special task force to work with companies experiencing difficulties with the punt's appreciation against the deutschmark and the French franc.  The task force will work on a basis similar to that of the sterling task force which assisted companies in difficulty in the United Kingdom market last year.  In the short-term firms can guard against currency fluctuations by hedging and other devices but, in the long-term, the only answer is to be as flexible and competitive as possible.  An Bord Tráchtála is currently helping Irish exporters in the French and German markets to emphasise non-price factors such as quality, design etc., and ensure proper treasury and exchange risk management, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> In addition, An Bord Tráchtála is already providing very substantial support to firms exporting to continental Europe as part of their ongoing &ldquo;Opportunity Europe&rdquo; programme under a range of marketing support initiatives.  Assistance to exporters under this programme &mdash; with a strong emphasis on encouraging companies to diversify into new markets &mdash; is currently estimated to cost £10 million this year.</P>
    <P>Finally, while efforts are being made to assist affected companies, financial compensation to exporters for currency risk is not under consideration. It would be unacceptable to the European Union that we introduce schemes specifically to compensate for currency fluctuations.  We must accept that exchange rate problems always have been, and will continue to be, a factor in international trade.</P>

      <P>In my reply to Deputies Brendan Smith and Kathleen Lynch on 25 June 1996 &mdash; Official Report, volume 467, No. 4, cols. 969-970 &mdash; I provided details of tourism projects approved for funding under the Ireland-Northern Ireland and Maritime INTERREG II programmes up to that date.</P>
      <P>On 26 November 1996, in a further reply to Deputy Brendan Smith &mdash; volume 472, No. 1, cols 232-233 &mdash; I provided details of nine additional projects approved under the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG II Programme and one approved under the Ireland-Wales Maritime INTERREG II Programme.</P>
      <P>Since then, a further four projects have been approved under the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG II Programme, details of which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  In addition, I understand that approval in principle was granted recently for four more projects but, as letters of offer have not yet been issued, I am not in a position to give details.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Ireland-Wales Maritime INTERREG II Programme is concerned, a further six projects have been approved in principle since my reply of 26 November 1996, but the implementing agencies await additional information from the respective developers before letters of offer can be issued and details of the projects disclosed.</P>

      <P>While not a great fan of the extension of the INTERREG II Programme to areas way beyond the Border, does the Minister agree that the establishment of the Ireland-Wales Maritime INTERREG II Programme was wrong in the first place, taking investment from areas for which the INTERREG Programme was first designated, namely the six southern and six northern Border counties?  In responding to an earlier question the Minister referred to the small amount of grant assistance available from the International Fund for Ireland and INTERREG II for the provision of tourist accommodation, particularly small hotels and additional bed and breakfasts.  With this in mind, will he impress on those agencies dealing directly with the INTERREG Programme the shortage of that type of accommodation in Border counties such as Cavan and Monaghan?  For the remainder of the INTERREG Programme I am particularly anxious that a substantial proportion of funding is made available specifically for the provision of additional bed and breakfast accommodation and upgrading the existing small hotels sector.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's view which has been expressed to me by quite a number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As he will be aware, we are at present dealing with the mid-term review of the Operational Programme for Tourism from 1997 to 1999.  I make no secret of the fact that one of my recommendations is that the smaller family-run accommodation sector should receive support.  I cannot predict the outcome of all these negotiations &mdash; the process of evaluation of the second half of the <Col N="833" /> programme will probably not be completed until approximately July next.</P>
    <P>What the Deputy said in respect of INTERREG funding in this area in regard to bed and breakfast and guesthouse accommodation is dealt with in a separate question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister will use the influence of his office to encourage additional investment in the small hotels and bed and breakfast sector.  We must remember that over a period of 25 years, if not more, these business people suffered immeasurably because of the troubles on their doorsteps, making it impossible to adequately invest in necessary expansion.  While great strides have been made in the provision of some top-class hotels and the upgrading of others, there remains a shortage of that type of accommodation, with a need for some grant assistance to encourage additional investment in that area.  I am glad the Minister will recommend that to the relevant agencies.  I appeal to him especially to devote whatever funding remains within the tourism component of the INTERREG II Programme to that sector.</P>

      <P>There are specific committees dealing with the disbursal of these funds, not under my or my Department's control, based on the quality of the projects and applications submitted, quite a number of which do not relate to the accommodation sector who must take decisions on relevant submissions received but I will bear the Deputy's concerns in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As Minister of State with special responsibility for youth affairs, it is a source of enormous satisfaction to me to propose the Youth Work Bill, 1997 to the House.  It is, without doubt, the centrepiece of our efforts to reform Ireland's youth work policies, structures, programmes and services. The introduction of this Bill provides the House with a marvellous opportunity to debate ground-breaking legislation aimed at giving a strong legislative basis to the provision, co-ordination, monitoring, evaluation and development of youth work programmes and services.</P>
      <P>Many people ask what exactly we mean when we speak of youth work.  For the first time, the Bill provides a clear mission for youth work by defining it in section 2 as being a &ldquo;programme of activity that is designed for the purpose of providing developmental and educational training so as to assist the personal and social development of young persons which (a) requires the voluntary participation of young persons, and (b) is complementary to academic or vocational training&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of key features of youth work in this country.  They include the fact that it entails the involvement of young people on a truly voluntary basis, where young people get involved because they want to, not because they have to.  Youth work in Ireland is made possible by volunteer adult leaders working with young people in such a way as to promote the active participation of young people as real partners in the process.  Another characteristic of youth work is that it is a mutually beneficial and enjoyable experience entailing an active mode of experiential learning.  Young people are involved in learning <Col N="835" /> by doing in real life situations through, for example, arts and crafts, drama, environmental work and outdoor pursuits.  They are also involved in learning by reflecting on the experiences encountered as a result of this youth work model.  It provides structures whereby young people participate in decision-making, planning, organising and evaluating.  Youth work permits communities to play a meaningful role in meeting the needs of their young people.  Last but not least youth work in Ireland is implemented primarily by voluntary groups and organisations.</P>
    <P>The Youth Work Bill is the culmination of years of work and discussion among all those involved in youth work.  I avail of this opportunity to pay special tribute to them.  I have no hesitation in saying the Youth Work Bill, 1997, has historical significance in the Irish youth work context. History is all around us but historical events do not just happen: they can be influenced and planned.  As a French author once said, &ldquo;all history is choice&rdquo;.  This is especially true in the context of the Youth Work Bill which came about as a direct result of a significant political choice expressed in the December 1994 policy agreement, A Government of Renewal, between the three political parties that form the Government. That agreement, included a commitment to prepare a Bill to provide a specific, detailed legislative framework for youth work.  In other words, the Youth Work Bill came about because a definite and reasoned political decision was made that such action was needed.  This undertaking was repeated in the chapter on youth work in the Government's April 1995 White Paper on Education. Charting our Education Future.</P>
    <P>A Youth Work Bill was long overdue, as is shown by the fact that all these Government statements on legislation for youth work drew much of their inspiration from the seminal Irish youth work document, the report of the national youth work policy committee chaired by Justice Declan Costello and issued in September 1984. The Government then in office included in its December 1995 document, In Partnership with Youth, a commitment that legislation would be introduced for youth work.  The period between December 1995 and December 1994 yielded little progress on the issue of specific legislation for youth work, with the notable exception of the rejected 1990 Private Members' Bill proposed by my party while in opposition.</P>
    <P>However, during this time much useful work was done in related spheres.  For example, the Bill draws on much of the content of the excellent report of the consultative group on the development of youth work, presented in November 1993 to my predecessor, Deputy Alyward.  That report made a number of recommendations on the development of youth work provision particularly as regards definitions, underlying principles, characteristics of youth work, evaluation, and youth work structures and much of its content is reflected in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> In addition, I carried out my own research, consultation and discussion.  On 28 June 1995, I wrote to all the relevant bodies to give them the opportunity to present written observations on the chapter on youth work of the White Paper, Charting our Education Future.  Some 31 submissions were received in response to my request. My officials and I met representatives of several of the interest groups who have made submissions including the National Youth Council of Ireland, the National Forum for Voluntary Youth Councils, the National Youth Federation, Foróige, the Catholic Youth Council, the City of Dublin vocational education committee &mdash; Comhairle le Leas Óige &mdash; and the National Association of Travellers' Centres.  Other relevant research was also undertaken, such as the obtaining of information on the legal and administrative framework for the provision of youth work services in Northern Ireland and in England.</P>
    <P>It has been a long haul but anything worth doing is worth doing well and, as a great philosopher once said: &ldquo;in all things, success depends upon previous preparation, and without such preparation there is sure to be failure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The principal purposes of the Bill are to define the functions of education boards regarding youth work, including the stipulation of their procedure for planning, prioritising, funding and reporting on the provision of youth work programmes and services; establish a special youth work committee in each education board; detail the policy, budget, research, monitoring and assessment functions of the Minister for Education regarding youth work; establish a national youth work advisory committee; enable the allocation of grants for youth work, and establish a voluntary youth council in each of the functional areas to be prescribed.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives a clear legal definition to youth work.  It also defines the responsibilities of the Minister for Education and of the education boards regarding youth work.  On the one hand the Bill achieves a formalisation of the Government's commitment to youth work because by setting out the Department's policy, co-ordination, budget, research, monitoring, assessment and consultative functions, it will represent a clear and unequivocal Government commitment to the performance of youth work functions now performed on an informal and <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  On the other hand, the Youth Work Bill, through stipulating that each education board will, in so far as is practicable and within the financial resources available to it ensure the provision of youth work programmes and services for its region, provides that the benefits resulting from subsidiarity are gained in the delivery of youth work services.  We require a structure that is more responsive to the needs of the regions and is representative of community interests, not remote from them.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the resource allocation function exercised centrally by the Department in regard <Col N="837" /> to local and regional youth work programmes and services will be devolved to the education boards. This in turn will help to free up the Department sufficiently to enable it to concentrate more closely on issues such as national policy formulation, overall planning and development, assessment of performance, financial management, quality assurance and the national distribution of funding.  This situation will be very much in line with the European norm.  Empowerment and mobilisation of regional and community resources is a feature of countries such as Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands.  Countries such as France, Italy, Sweden, Spain and Portugal &mdash; which share with Ireland a tradition of highly centralised control of all aspects of the education system &mdash; have made significant progress towards devolving responsibilities to the regional level.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, through the Youth Work Bill, the education boards will be aware of the youth work needs of regional communities and will involve and empower communities and ensure that youth work needs are met more effectively and co-ordinated more efficiently. However, the regionalisation of decision-making to education boards will not result in the establishment of any kind of rigid State youth service and will not substitute public sector activity for voluntary sector activity in the youth work sphere.  On the contrary, the Bill sets out detailed procedures for ensuring that youth work services will normally be secured by education boards through grant-aiding voluntary youth work organisations.</P>
    <P>Section 4 sets out the precise procedure that an education board must undertake before it may consider providing a youth work service itself. This procedure entails placing notices in newspapers, seeking proposals from voluntary youth work organisations for the provision of the youth work service in question and provides that the board may only provide the service if, having consulted its youth work committee, it specifies in a report that the proposals submitted by voluntary organisations are not suitable and if it passes a resolution in favour of the provision of the service by the board itself.</P>
    <P>The Bill also formally provides that the Department will prescribe or recognise national voluntary youth work organisations which will be designated or named by the education boards.  It is intended to ensure the primacy of the volunteer in youth work.  The most significant way in which the Bill will do this is through the establishment of voluntary youth councils of volunteer youth leaders throughout the country.  These councils will have a number of vital functions, including the crucial power to nominate 50 per cent of the members of each education board's youth work committee; the important duty of advising the relevant education board in respect of its youth work planning and the valuable role of providing a forum for local voluntary youth work organisations. Hence, the Youth Work Bill should help <Col N="838" /> to ensure that there are adequate safeguards to ensure the continuation and development of volunteerism in the youth service, which, to use the words in the Taoiseach's foreword to the 1977 <i>Policy For Youth &amp; Sport</i> document, produced while he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, &ldquo;plays such a significant role in the life of the people and strengthens the web of society&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Volunteerism is the key to real success in the provision of youth work services.  It is worth pointing out, in connection with the voluntary youth councils, that among the innovative provisions of the Youth Work Bill are that at least one fifth of the membership of each council will be set aside for volunteer youth leaders under the age of 25 and there will be special provision for volunteer youth leaders working with the travelling community.  It is intended, therefore, that the councils will be effective guardians of the interests of the voluntary youth work sector.</P>
    <P>Moreover, everyone is aware of the greater demand for accountability in the expenditure of public resources.  In that context, the Bill is important because several of its provisions, particularly those regarding monitoring and assessment, give everyone in the youth service the opportunity to demonstrate the benefits and value for money of youth work and ensure that public funds expended on youth work services are spent efficiently and effectively.  Therefore, the Bill should help us to attract additional resources for youth work.  In addition, the provisions of the Youth Work Bill stressing integration, co-ordination, assessment and targeting will meet the value for money requirement which must attach to all public expenditure.</P>
    <P>In particular, the Bill enhances the measurement of the benefits of youth work.  Section 19 provides for the application of terms and conditions to the allocation by the Minister for Education of grants to organisations in respect of the provision of youth work services.  Section 4 provides for the application of terms and conditions to the allocation by education boards of grants to organisations in respect of the provision of youth work services.  Section 3 and 9 provide for a statutory national system of monitoring and assessment of youth work services.  Specific provision is made in section 3(4) for value for money considerations to be taken into proper account, in that it stipulates that monitoring and assessment shall have regard to an evaluation of the expenditure incurred in the provision of youth work programmes and services.</P>
    <P>Section 4(1)(c) makes a similar stipulation in the case of monitoring and assessment carried out by the education boards.  In addition, the value for money of youth work will be given added emphasis by the special importance to be attached in the Youth Work Bill to co-ordination between youth work policies, other policies affecting youth and to the youth work needs of disadvantaged young people between ten and 21 years of age.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> Furthermore, the national youth work advisory committee envisaged in the Bill will include nominees of the national body representing the views of the voluntary youth work organisations and other Departments.  This will permit the availability of the best possible advice in respect of the optimum integration and co-ordination between youth work services and other services for young people, thus helping to ensure value for money through proper targeting of resources, integration of efforts and networking between agencies.  Similarly, the planned youth work committees of the education boards, by including representatives of the voluntary youth councils and important statutory agencies such as health boards, FÁS and the Garda juvenile liaison service, will also contribute to the value for money requirement.</P>
    <P>Another important feature of the Bill is that it includes provisions for consultation and partnership in decision-making.  At national level, the fact that the national youth work advisory committee will include nominees of the national body, recognised as representing the views of the voluntary youth work organisations, should be another crucial guarantee of the voluntary nature of the youth service.  Similarly, the provisions in the Bill on the youth work committee which each education board will be obliged to establish represent a good model for partnership.  This partnership will be achieved by having an equal partnership between the statutory sector and the voluntary sector on that youth work committee. This will guarantee a central role for the voluntary youth work sector in the development of youth work policies and services.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, several of the Bill's provisions, especially those with regard to monitoring and assessment, provide the opportunity to demonstrate the benefits and the value for money of youth work and to ensure that public funds spent on youth work services are spent efficiently and effectively.  This development should in due course help to attract additional resources for youth work.  I have no doubt that youth work can help to prevent social ills, such as juvenile delinquency, and do so in a much more cost effective way.  There is no doubt that rehabilitation, even where successful, is extremely expensive.  In this regard, I was particularly struck by an article I read recently in <i>The Economist</i> of 8 March 1997 which stated that in England it costs more to keep a child in a young offenders' institution than it would to send him to Eton.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, it was a tragic Easter weekend this year for the families and friends of all those killed in the recent so-called &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; incidents.  One of the saddest was the case of the 71 year old mother of seven from Raheny, Dublin, who died after being struck by a car driven at high speed by a 15 year old.  That event holds a particular resonance for me because I understand that, in a thoroughly dignified response to the awful death of his dear mother, Mr. Joe McGrath <Col N="840" /> made an impressive plea for improved recreational, developmental and sporting programmes and facilities for young people, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  Similar pleas were made in Cork in response to recent tragedies there.</P>
    <P>Communities are crying out for greater recreational resources, sporting facilities and services for young people.  If young people are occupied in positive activities the evil and negative attractions can be dispelled.  While we need an increased emphasis on the standards of law and order which go to make a civilised society, we must also address the root causes of problems such as joyriding.  Youth work can help young people, including those at risk of getting involved in anti-social activities, to acquire the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to overcome the problems caused by unemployment, alienation, demoralisation, crime and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Youth Work Bill is significant because it stipulates that in the development of youth work programmes and services, priority will be given to the youth work requirements of young people between ten and 21 years of age who are socially or economically disadvantaged. I am committed to this core principle because, in the words of the great Nelson Mandela &ldquo;A nation should be judged not by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Given that the youth work sphere is quite complex and specialist, a separate piece of legislation for youth work is warranted.  However, there is a clear link between the Youth Work Bill and the Education Bill, 1997, because one of the key aims of the Youth Work Bill is to set down the youth work responsibilities of the education boards.  As the Education Bill, which will set up education boards and education regions, is not yet enacted, provision has been made in the Youth Work Bill for the definition of an education board as being any board established by or under statute for an area within the State &mdash; such area is defined as an education region &mdash; and designated by order.</P>

Moltar chomh maith go mbeadh Gaeilge mhaith ag stiúrthóirí na mbord eile.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the need not to interfere with the single sex programmes and organisations that are necessary features of youth work, the provisions made in the Youth Work Bill regarding gender equity in sections 3(2), 4(3), 6(7), 7(1), 10(2) and 14(3) stipulate that regard must be had to the treatment of males and females in relation to access to youth work and the number of males and females participating in youth work and in the provision, planning, monitoring and the assessment of, as well as advising and consulting on, youth work programmes and services.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Education did in her speech on the Second Stage of the Education Bill on 4 March, I remind the House of an observation made by the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Costello, on 11 October 1996.  He said:</P>
    <P>Hundreds of millions of pounds are spent annually on education by means of administrative measures known only to a handful of officials and specialists ... the measures [are] not readily available to the public and their effect [is] uncertain and often ambiguous.</P>
    <P>This point applies not alone to the formal education system but to the non-formal or youth work sector.  Together with the Education Bill, the Youth Work Bill will help to address Mr. Justice Costello's concerns.  In particular, the Youth Work Bill will provide a statutory basis for the development of youth work services on a phased basis within the resources available.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Youth Work Bill, 1997, has historical significance in the Irish youth work context. It arises out of a sustained, open and intensive process of consultation, carried out with all of the partners in youth work.  The Youth Work Bill will validate and affirm the voluntary hallmark of the Irish Youth Service; enhance youth participation in decision making; help to ensure that our young people are served to best effect through regionalised partnership between the voluntary and statutory sectors and devolve a significant degree of responsibility to volunteer youth leaders drawn from local communities.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread recognition that the long process of consultation and consideration that went into the production of the Youth Work Bill significantly enhanced mutual understanding.  It promoted an appreciation of respective positions and difficulties.  It promoted an increased awareness of the fundamental importance of partnership, pluralism and a deeper commitment to co-operation and consensus.  Since becoming Minister of State with responsibility for youth affairs, I have endeavoured to promote dialogue and debate with maximum transparency.  The Bill before us today is the product of such openness.</P>
    <P>Publication of the Bill does not, however, bring to an end the dialogue between the partners in youth work which has played such a key part in advancing us to this point.  I look forward to hearing <Col N="842" /> the views of this House.  Where a reasonable case is put for amendment of the Bill which does not dilute its central principles I am prepared to consider that case objectively and, if necessary, to bring forward proposals for amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of youth work, and its power to influence the lives of our young people is recognised in Ireland, Europe and throughout the world.  However, we must accept the need to identify clearly the challenges facing youth work.  From time to time we must take stock of development needs facing us and we must think carefully about how to address them. The Youth Work Bill, 1997, comes before this House at a particularly opportune time, for the reason that we must now take action to put in place a proper legislative framework for youth work in Ireland &mdash; a framework that will enhance and enrich its inherently dynamic and proactive nature.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome publication of the Bill and congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, and the officials of the youth affairs section of the Department on having it drafted, published and brought it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In general terms, the Fianna Fáil Party welcomes the Bill but there are issues which require detailed questioning on Committee Stage. I welcome the Minister of State's commitment to listen to the views of Members of the Oireachtas and, where worthwhile suggestions and proposals are made, to bring forward relevant amendments on Committee Stage.  He is to be commended for adopting such an attitude.  Far too often valid proposals and amendments are not accepted by the Government, although this is beginning to change slowly.  In recent months more Private Members' Bills have been accepted than at any time in the past.  Their quality was an essential component in their acceptance by the Government.</P>
      <P>I doubt if the Minister of State expects this Bill to reach Committee Stage.  This may be his last opportunity, therefore, to speak to it before the life of this Dáil expires.</P>
      <P>The extensive negotiation process entered into by the Department prior to drafting the legislation is a welcome feature.  Other Members who have held the Minister of State's portfolio deserve recognition for their input and commitment to placing the youth services on a statutory footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The youth organisations, in their well researched documents, always make good use of statistics to back up their arguments.  Out of a total population of 3.852 million some 1,493,700, or 42 per cent, are under the age of 25.  The EU average is 25 per cent.  Half of the population are under the age of 30.  Another telling statistic is that there are more young people in further and higher education than in farming.  One quarter of the electorate are in the 18 to 30 age bracket.  The findings of a recent survey published by the National Youth Council of Ireland indicated that the most popular party among this age cohort was <Col N="843" /> Fianna Fáil.  This demonstrates clearly how discerning young people are.  The fact that such a high percentage of the population are at such a vibrant age has to be a distinct advantage in the ongoing development of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State outlined the purpose and extent of the proposals contained in the Bill.  He laid emphasis on the primacy of the volunteer in youth work.  I agree with this wholeheartedly.  The Fianna Fáil Party is dedicated to the spirit and concept of voluntary effort.  The necessary professional support is required in parallel to ensure voluntary bodies receive adequate backup. Within youth services, voluntary activity &mdash; voluntarism &mdash; has been the catalyst and main engine for growth and the delivery of services throughout the country.  The delivery of youth services depends on voluntary effort.  Side by side with this is the necessary and welcome contribution of the statutory organisations.</P>
    <P>I remain to be fully convinced the voluntary youth work sector is given the role in this legislation it has earned for itself in the delivery of youth services during the years.  Unfortunately, adequate financial resources have not been provided for youth affairs.  Since 1987, however, there has been a substantial increase in funding, rising from £3.7 million to in excess of £20 million. This increase in expenditure is welcome but it still leaves large segments underfunded at a time when many young people face serious and daunting problems.</P>
    <P>Youth work is an intricate part of the education process.  The Minister of State said the Bill supports the primacy of the volunteer in youth work and there is provision for the devolution of responsibility to the voluntary youth councils. The proposal to establish a national youth work advisory committee is of major importance and a measure which can enhance considerably a proper co-ordination and integration in the provision of services for young people and youth services.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes a definition of youth work and provides the legal authority for the allocation of grants by the Department and the proposed regional education boards.  However, the position on the disbursement of funds is not clear.  I query whether disbursement will take place solely at regional education board level, or will national organisations receive a national allocation?</P>
    <P>We are discussing for the first time legislation that deals specifically with youth services.  The Minister of State mentioned Mr. Justice Declan Costello, whom I commend for his work as chairman of the national youth policy committee, which reported in 1984.  The officials of national youth organisations and their volunteers throughout the country who engaged in the consultation process on the need to develop youth services, and specifically the need to place these services on a statutory footing, deserve commendation and thanks.</P>
    <P>The former Minister of State, Deputy Liam Aylward, was very much involved in establishing <Col N="844" /> the consultative group which reported in 1993 on the development of youth services.  It too deserves special commendation.</P>
    <P>The role of the proposed regional education boards permeates the Bill.  As it stands, they will have a key role in the structure and delivery of youth services throughout the country, but neither the Minister of State nor the Department is being taken from centre stage.  The Education Bill proposes to establish ten regional education boards.  This will, in effect, introduce a new intermediate tier in the education system.  Fianna Fáil is opposed to the establishment of these boards on the grounds that they will be too expensive and too removed from local educational interests. It is estimated that in time they will cost up to £50 million to administer on a yearly basis.  My party's spokesperson on Education stated clearly that Fianna Fáil will not establish such an unnecessary structure.  We believe, and have continually stressed, that all available resources should be channelled through to the classroom and the other services within education.  We cannot as a nation afford to waste scarce resources on undemocratic and expensive bureaucracies.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Education Bill was rushed through the House and adequate time was not provided to enable all Members who wished to contribute to have their say on Second Stage. This is in stark contrast to the wishes of the Minister of State for the debate on this legislation.  I was one of the large number of Fianna Fáil Deputies who was deprived of the opportunity to put on the record their concern at the intentions of the Minister and the Government.  Educational interests outside the House indicated to Deputies, including me, that they were not given adequate time to engage in the necessary consultative process with their membership.</P>
    <P>Like the Youth Work Bill, a number of Ministers held office in Marlborough Street during the preparation of the Education Bill.  Fianna Fáil began the process of providing the necessary legislative framework for the education system. There is an obvious need to place the education system on a proper and sound statutory footing. The Education Bill which is in Committee does not devolve power and will, unfortunately, increase the power of the Minister.  Ministerial control over education will be reinforced and strengthened if such a measure is enacted.</P>
    <P>Some anomalies occur in that Bill in that the professional role of the teacher in the modern educational system is not properly defined.  The issues of disadvantage and poverty are not tackled at a time when there is an urgent need to make progress on the elimination of all forms of disadvantage.  Surely it would be appropriate to provide for children from disadvantaged and poor backgrounds at a time when there is substantial growth in the economy.  Such children should not be deprived of the opportunity to develop to their full potential.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate specific information has not been provided to the Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="845" /> on the costs of the proposed boards.  It is obvious the ten regional education boards proposed by the Minister are much too large in terms of their geographical remit alone.  My party's spokesperson on Education, Deputy Martin, referred in other debates to the experience of the regional education boards in Northern Ireland.  Apparently the administrative costs of those boards are extremely high.  This must be a source of concern to us.  There is need to have within the educational system an ability to respond to local interests but the boards as proposed will not be able to respond to the needs of each area as their geographical remit is much too extensive and there will also be conflicting needs between the sparsely populated rural areas and large urban centres.  I have referred to the Education Bill as I did not have an opportunity to outline my views on it due to the Government's decision to curtail the debate.</P>
    <P>The development of the education system is of the utmost importance in terms of youth affairs. Fianna Fáil has consistently stated that the county unit is the most appropriate mechanism for improving the levels of co-ordination at local level and for developing co-ordinated local responses to education needs.  The establishment of fora at county level would enable the partners in education to establish their priorities in that area.  Obviously the role of voluntary and statutory bodies involved in the delivery of youth services within a county would be given parity with the other education partners.  The county unit has a strong sense of identity and it allows for a strong measure of local autonomy and decision-making at that level.</P>
    <P>I referred to the additional administration costs which will arise from the establishment of education boards and the continual under funding of youth services.  The imposition of an estimated £50 million additional administrative costs on the Education budget will not improve the education service.  One can imagine the benefits that would accrue to many disadvantaged youths if even a small percentage of that £50 million was allocated as an additional grant to national youth organisations. The futility of establishing education boards can be clearly understood when one considers the £50 million cost involved in their administration and compares it with the national allocation on a yearly basis to the youth services budget of the Department.</P>
    <P>There is also widespread and justified concern about other aspects of the Education Bill such as its impact on denominational schools at primary and second level and the future of voluntary second level schools.  The Bill proposes too much control in the composition of school boards.  The role of the patron is also in question.  In the past, patrons rightly played a significant role in the development of their schools.  The recent announcement by the Taoiseach of additional resources for the provision of computers for schools is welcome.  Fianna Fáil issued a document a considerable time ago on the need to provide <Col N="846" /> resources to enable the younger generation to embrace the technological revolution.</P>
    <P>The Conference of Religious in Ireland has provided useful research in recent years on many facets of Irish life.  It recently stated the education system is failing to meet the needs of poor people. Other reports have rightly referred to the strong link between education and poverty.  Given the competition for jobs, educational qualifications are naturally of the utmost importance in determining a person's chances of gaining employment.  The long-term future for many people has to be stark when one considers the figures produced by the National Economic and Social Forum, namely that 1,000 young people failed to transfer from primary to post-primary schools, 3,000 leave post-primary school with no qualification and 15,500 leave with no more than a junior certificate or a poor leaving certificate. Further analysis of those figures shows that the majority of people with little or no qualifications come from deprived backgrounds.  Of the 4,000 people who leave school with no qualification, more than 90 per cent come from backgrounds which are classified as poor.</P>
    <P>There is a constant theme of centralisation in the Education Bill.  The needs of the disadvantaged and socially excluded, to whom the Minister rightly referred, will not be addressed by the establishment of education boards.  During the 1994 by-election I canvassed in the Minister's constituency of Cork North Central where I met many young people who suffer severe disadvantage. I am sure the Minister and his colleagues from that constituency are more aware of the problems of large urban areas than I am. However, there are also marginalised and disadvantaged people living in small urban areas and rural communities.  Disadvantage and marginalisation are not confined to the major urban areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome recent reports which highlight and specify the severe disadvantage now occurring in rural areas.  The National Economic and Social Forum has produced a very detailed and important report on early school leavers and youth unemployment.  That report indicated that although the number of early school leavers has fallen in recent years, the problem is now more critical, arising from the process of requiring higher and additional qualifications and a decrease in traditional job opportunities for the unskilled.  The report states bluntly that the problem of marginalisation and social exclusion for this group is becoming more acute.</P>
    <P>The unemployment rate for those aged between 15 and 24 with no educational qualifications was approximately 46 per cent.  That is approximately two and a half times the overall rate of youth unemployment of 19.1 per cent. Furthermore, the long-term unemployment rate for those without qualifications in that age group was approximately 30 per cent in 1995 and is one of the highest in the European Union.</P>
    <P>The report to which I referred earlier highlighted the fact that rural areas have the highest <Col N="847" /> level of educational disadvantage.  The forum considers that the link between educational disadvantage, poverty, drug abuse, crime and long-term unemployment has been clearly established and that a more comprehensive and integrated strategy on a number of policy fronts is necessary to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The youth organisations, which operate primarily on a voluntary basis, have been to the forefront in helping the marginalised and in creating a greater awareness of the difficulties that exist for many of our young people and of the benefits that can accrue from organised youth activities.  Their education work, in an informal sense, assists in the personal and social development of young people.  It enables young people to involve themselves consciously and actively in their development, the development of their local communities and society in general.</P>
    <P>The 50 youth organisations working in the State have a combined membership of more than half a million young people and serve 250,000 others.  The 40,000 voluntary adult youth leaders are supported by more than 300 full-time staff and upwards of 500 part-time scheme workers. Those impressive figures convey their own message to Government decision makers of the importance of a proper structure for youth services. They underline once again the inadequate provision of financial resources for youth services.</P>
    <P>The report drawn up under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Declan Costello referred to resources.  If the recommendations of that report were followed, the provision for youth services in 1996 would need to have been £26 million instead of the allocation made of £13.5 million.  It is disappointing to note that of the lottery allocation, the percentage of total lottery funds allocated in respect of youth services has decreased over the years.  Like the Minister, I commend the youth organisations, their staff and volunteers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Health to intervene in the ambulance strike because of the latest reports that only limited progress has been made in talks today with the ambulance drivers. A countrywide strike is scheduled to begin next Monday unless a resolution can be found.  Signs of that resolution have not materialised so far and the threat of a dispute is great.  The dispute involves both ambulance drivers in the provinces <Col N="848" /> and in Dublin.  In the provinces, 520 drivers and their attendants are threatening to stop work, and in Dublin, 90 Eastern Health Board personnel are also planning to strike.</P>
      <P>A dispute by ambulance drivers could have major consequences, and disagreements appear to persist over emergency cover.  I understand the Army is on stand-by if necessary.  This would be a drastic step and might entrench the dispute even further.  On the last occasion there was a strike involving ambulance personnel, the dispute lasted five weeks and there was much controversy about the cover provided during the strike.  There was concern that some of the ambulances being used were not fully equipped cardiac ambulances, and there was controversy about the level of training of the personnel working the ambulances.</P>
      <P>Given the vital nature of the ambulance service, I call on the Minister to intervene tonight to resolve this dispute.  The Minister must realise the dispute will have to be resolved and it would be better if that were done before a damaging strike began.  In the event that the dispute goes ahead, I ask the Minister to outline the contingency plan which should now be in place.  When the nurses' dispute was threatened, a situation developed where the contingency plans were left until the very last minute and appeared to unwind at the time.  Fortunately, the dispute did not go ahead, but had it done so there might have been a problem with cover.  The Minister must ensure that nothing similar happens in any other dispute involving an essential service such as this one with ambulances.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Deputy Cowen for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to reply.  I can give an assurance to the House that my first priority is that the dispute does not go ahead on 14 April, and I ask those involved to use the agreed processes for the resolution of this dispute.  I assure the Deputy every effort is being made to ensure that if a strike is to take place there is an adequate arrangement in place to ensure no life is put at risk.</P>
      <P>The team led by the Health Service Employers Agency, including health board management and the Department of Health, have met the unions involved.  The Labour Relations Commission has intervened in the Dublin dispute and a meeting was fixed for 2.30 this afternoon.</P>
      <P>In relation to the provincial dispute and contingency plans, discussions took place earlier this morning regarding the provision of an emergency service if the dispute goes ahead and some limited progress has been made.  Both sides have agreed to meet again tomorrow and I hope it will be possible to agree an arrangement that will ensure all reasonable steps are taken to protect the lives of citizens if the dispute goes ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the particular circumstances involved and the fact that discussions are ongoing, I do not want to say anything else at this stage.  I am sure the Deputy understands the <Col N="849" /> position and will join with me in urging all those involved to use the agreed processes for the resolution of these difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this issue on the Adjournment because of the commitment in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, that a White Paper on training would be published &mdash; that was two years and three months ago &mdash; and the &ldquo;inspired leaks&rdquo; I have read in the newspapers in the past few days which indicate that Minister Bruton is intent on making radical changes in the FÁS organisation.  Has the Minister discussed those in full with the unions?  It was proclaimed by the Government in December 1994 that it would be published at an early date and that once it was published the Minister for Enterprise and Employment would initiate a major public debate on its proposals which would lead to the setting up of a national certification training board.  There is hardly time now for a major national debate about anything.</P>
      <P>Since that promise was given I have asked many times about the promise of a White Paper, at Question Time and during other debates.  At various stages I was told it was being prepared by the Department, then that outside consultants had been brought in &mdash; outside consultants are flavour of the day, week, month, year as far as this Government is concerned.  In January of this year I asked a parliamentary question and again I was told it would be ready shortly.  On 6 March the Minister promised that a White Paper on training, which has become the White Paper on Human Resource Development, will shortly be going before the Government and, presumably, will then be published.  The Minister then said it was his intention to put the White Paper before the Government prior to Easter.  This week's media reports are to the effect that the White Paper has still not gone to Government.  The Minister is now seeking a meeting with three party leaders on the matter, but as everybody in the Government has the one opinion on everything, that should not pose too much of a difficulty. I am calling on the Minister to state when the White Paper will go to Government and when or if it will ever now be published.</P>
      <P>I am also calling on the Minister to state the implications for FÁS of the draft White Paper. We continue to read that the trade unions and the Minister's Cabinet colleagues believe that FÁS will be disbanded under the Minister's proposals and that there is major Cabinet and Government opposition to this, especially as it appears that the Minister did not consult the unions or FÁS on the proposals, even though they were renegotiating a restructuring package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister went to Ardagh in County Longford last week and had a courteous and cursory meeting, but it was not a full negotiating meeting.  These proposals will radically affect those negotiations, or so we are led to believe. <Col N="850" /> Have the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the leader of Democratic Left, Deputy Prionsias De Rossa, agreed to those proposals?  One may well ask the question because the media reports I read signal that the Minister for Finance is not happy with the proposals and that he has sternly put his oar into the debate.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my question is to find out where is the White Paper, when we will have the major national debate, and the status of negotiation with FÁS.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, who is unavoidably absent this afternoon.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to developing an education and training system which meets both the needs of individuals and the skill requirements of a growing and competitive economy.  The White Paper on Education, which was published in 1995, was the first stage of the Government's commitment in this regard.  This White Paper sets out a comprehensive plan for the development of an education system which will prepare people for life and the world of work.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Human Resource Development will contain strategies aimed at complementing and giving added value to the outcomes of the education system.  This document is one of a number of key national strategy papers that will constitute the framework and focus for employment policy into the next century.  Strategy documents on the labour market and the services sector have already been published, as well as a White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation.  The importance of the human resources factor in this overall framework cannot be underestimated.</P>
      <P>The primary objectives of the human resources White Paper will be to outline the strategies, programmes and structures which will encourage and support Irish business in improving its overall skills and thus enhance its capacity to prosper in an increasingly competitive, national and international business environment, and improve the knowledge and skills of individuals in, or wishing to enter, the labour force.  The State has a particular responsibility in relation to those on the margins of the labour force because of the clear link between unemployment and low educational and skills attainment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparing the White Paper, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has been particularly conscious of the need to encourage and facilitate individuals in committing themselves to the lifelong learning process with a view to keeping their knowledge and skills up to date.  It is essential that a culture of lifelong learning is created and nurtured to help us to cope with the changes taking place in the workplace and in work patterns.  The days of one job for life are to a large extent gone.  Contract and part-time work is increasing, particularly among women.  There is a move to increased team working within business. <Col N="851" /> There are new management techniques &mdash; total quality management, world class manufacturing and so on.  Firms are organising themselves differently.  It is equally important that individuals on the margins of the labour force be encouraged, supported and facilitated to develop the skills and knowledge that will enhance their prospects of securing gainful employment.</P>
    <P>In preparing the White Paper, the Minister has also been particularly conscious of the need to ensure that strategies are cohesive and realistic. The Department has, therefore, undertaken careful examination of the current state of play regarding human resource development issues, and has investigated where national policy in this regard should lead in the future.  To assist in this work there has been widespread consultation with interested parties, including employer representatives, trade unions and educational and training bodies.  These discussions have been on the broad direction of human resource development and the approaches which would be most beneficial.  Indeed, there are some indications in Partnership 2000 to the approach which will effectively equip us to deal with human resource issues into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>The consultative and drafting approach, which was very time consuming, has been completed, and I expect the White Paper to be considered by the Government in the near future.  When the Government makes its decision on the proposals contained in the White Paper, the Minister will make them known and implement them in consultation with all concerned parties.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Brendan Smith.</P>
      <P>I want to thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise the fact that 70 people employed at A. S. Richardson and Company, which is part of the Balcas group in County Leitrim, have been put on short time.</P>
      <P>The reason I raised this with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is that I could not raise the main substance of the issue with the Minister for Agriculture, who is the Minister who has responsibility for Coillte.  The problem, as stated by the company when these layoffs took place ten days ago, is that they were facing difficulties with regard to supply of timber.  As a result they were being forced to put people on short time.  I understand this is not the only company involved in timber processing that has been forced to put people on short time because of lack of supply of raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear that there has been no co-ordination with regard to supply and demand in the sawmilling and timber processing industry over the past 18 months or two years.  It is apparent that there has been overselling by Coillte of the basic raw material which is necessary for the sawmilling industry, and this has led to short-time <Col N="852" /> working at this plant and at others.  I hope the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will be in a position, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, to talk to Coillte and arrange for an ongoing supply of sawlogs at a competitive price.</P>
    <P>The net result of this shortage is that market share will be lost and jobs will be lost if there is not a supply of raw material for this industry.  We are now finding that this industry is competing against similar product coming, especially in the UK market, from Scotland and, in some cases, from Scandinavian countries.  The need to protect these jobs in what is seen as one our major industries for the future is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Health, who is here on behalf of his colleague, to relate back to both his colleagues the problems being experienced in this industry because of a new tendering process that has been put in place by Coillte.  It is not much good if Coillte sells next year's timber or the timber for the year 2000 during this year in order to keep its balance sheet looking well if the net result is job losses in the timber industry down the road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ellis for sharing his time with me.  My interest in this small sawmilling plant is that many of my constituents, particularly in the west Cavan area, are employed in A. S. Richardson and Company in Newtowngore, County Leitrim.  As Deputy Ellis said, this sawmilling plant is part of the Balcas group.  It is a source of major concern to the local community that the 70 employees have been put on short time working.  Deputy Ellis rightly pointed out that the scarce supply of timber is the immediate reason those people have been put on short time working.  There is a need for Coillte to have a proper supply and demand policy.  I was disappointed the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry did not reply to my parliamentary question in which I asked him to request Coillte to establish a policy that would ensure a continual supply of timber so that employment in sawmilling plants is safeguarded.  There is much forestry in the Cavan-Leitrim area and the least we should expect from those forestry developments is downstream processing activity.</P>
      <P>Many of my constituents have enjoyed permanent and gainful employment in the A. S. Richardson plant in Newtowngore for many years. Those who visited me at my clinics last weekend and spoke to me on the phone are concerned about the need to safeguard their employment in the long-term.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank both Deputies for their contributions on this matter. A. S. Richardson has been an important employer in Newtowngore for many years.  The 1970s and 1980s saw considerable expansion in the company.  In 1995 it was acquired by Balcas Limited, sawmillers with headquarters at Enniskillen. Balcas has sawmilling facilities at Enniskillen <Col N="853" /> and Magherafelt, County Derry.  The company also has a plant at Kill, County Kildare, engaged in secondary processing of medium density fibreboard, which it purchased from Medite in Clonmel, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>The sawmilling sector is suffering from over-capacity which is driving up the price of sawlog. The difficulties for the mills are aggravated further by recent declines in the market for sawmill residues and a drop in prices which have been provoked by falls in the international market for paper and pulp.  I understand that in the circumstances Balcas management has decided that the most prudent decision is to cut back production at all its plants.  The effect on A. S. Richardson will be that 51 of the 68 workers will be on a three day week for a temporary period.  The company hopes to be able to resume full time working in three to four months if raw material supplies and market conditions improve.</P>
      <P>The issue of sawlog supply and price is being addressed through a new sales system based on fortnightly electronic auctions which came into operation in January 1997.  This has the approval of Coillte and the Irish Timber Council, the umbrella body for sawmillers.  I understand this new system is experiencing teething problems but the industry is confident that when these have been resolved the system will work efficiently. There is currently evidence of a degree of rationalisation in the industry which will relieve the pressure on scarce raw material supplies.  The imminent start-up of the Masonite plant near Drumsna, County Leitrim, will produce significant new demand for sawmill residues.  I understand that A. S. Richardson has negotiated a contract with Masonite in this regard.</P>
      <P>Forbairt is engaged in a programme encouraging and supporting sawmilling companies to initiate new product development and diversification projects in an effort to ensure the future growth of the sector.  It is monitoring the position at A. S. Richardson and will assist the company in any way it can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this matter.  There has been news in recent weeks of drilling activity commencing again off the west coast &mdash; three oil companies have moved into the area with their operations &mdash; and such news is welcome.  There is however growing concern that Ireland will not benefit significantly from this activity.  My primary concern is that the maximum benefit should accrue to the economy, particularly in terms of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the late 1960s there has been a substantial input from Irish based oil rig workers on the oil rigs drilling in Irish waters.  Many of these workers had worked abroad and returned home with skills vital to developing the native Irish oil industry.  The initial quantities of oil did not fully materialise, however, and natural gas off the south coast was the only natural hydrocarbon <Col N="854" /> resource to be fully exploited, providing a limited number of well paid sustainable jobs.  Those jobs and conditions were achieved with Marathon. While drilling was at its peak during the 1970s and 1980s many new people were introduced to the industry in Ireland, with the impetus coming from the then ITGWU.  The standard was such that between 54 and 78 jobs on each rig in Irish waters were held by workers from Ireland. Employment procedures and pay rates were established at the oil rig servicing ports.</P>
    <P>SIPTU has expressed extreme concern that Irish workers will not get fair treatment in terms of job opportunities in the latest oil operations off the west coast.  They say there are 900 experienced Irish based oil rig workers and they fear the Minister will allow the international oil companies coming into Irish waters to by-pass them. They have described the advertisements which have appeared in Irish newspapers seeking oil workers as &ldquo;window dressing&rdquo; to get the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications off the hook.  They accuse the Minister of being &ldquo;hoodwinked&rdquo; by the oil companies and of allowing them to depart from every established practice for pay, conditions and employment in the oil industry here.</P>
    <P>The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications is in a very strong position in this matter in that it awards the licences and it requires the oil rig emergency response vessel to be able to reach the site of an oil spillage in half the time it takes oil to reach land.  Clearly vessels cannot be based in Scotland, as has been suggested by the oil companies, if there is drilling off the west coast of Ireland.  The Minister is in a position to ensure maximum benefit for the economy.</P>
    <P>Ireland operates a generous regime for search and discovery of oil and gas.  Of 110 countries surveyed by an international group, Ireland offered the lowest corporation tax and royalty rates in the world, with all drilling, labour, research, production, goods and construction costs deductible against tax.  While oil companies need to be attracted to drill in Irish waters with competitive tax benefits, some commitment to the Irish economy in terms of jobs, services and related spin-offs needs to be ensured.  I call on the Minister to attend more carefully to this duty and to show some speed in the matter.  I also call on him to maintain better links with advisers on the oil industry who will be able to guide him to the best course in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Brennan for raising this issue which is one of the success stories of the Government. The primary objective of my Department in regard to offshore oil and gas exploration is to secure the discovery and economic development of indigenous petroleum resources by maintaining a favourable environment for exploration <Col N="855" /> and production by private enterprise on a basis that will yield optimum benefit for the State.</P>
      <P>In pursuing these objectives the Department's strategy involves maintaining clear licensing terms which balance the interest of the State and optimal exploration and development activity. This is pursued by providing effective promotion and appropriate licensing opportunities for exploration and production companies.  The current licensing terms have been very favourably received by the petroleum exploration and production industry.  The success of policy in this area can be measured by the quality and geographic spread of petroleum exploration in Ireland and by the number of companies operating in the exploration and development sectors.</P>
      <P>Thirteen frontier licences and one deepwater licence have been issued for areas off the west coast.  In addition, applications are currently being processed from 17 exploration companies for acreage off the west coast in the Rockall Trough under the Rockall Trough Frontier Licensing Round.  This is the most successful round to date in the history of our exploration efforts.</P>
      <P>Exploration activities have resulted in significant benefits for Irish firms in various service areas such as catering and supplies, air transport and communications.  Some of the requirements for drilling operations are of a specific and specialised nature and Irish firms are not currently in a position to exploit these opportunities, but I hope that, in time, they will be able to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that EU legislation on the free movement of labour within member states precludes me from imposing minimum levels of employment of Irish workers on licence holders for particular operations.  However, while I have no direct role in relation to manning levels on drilling rigs it is my policy to try to ensure that the Irish economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from hydrocarbon exploration activities in the Irish offshore.  I have continually impressed on operators that Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services must be given equal opportunities to participate in such activities. The Irish Offshore Operators Association has had discussions among its own members and with SIPTU on the issue of labour on drilling rigs with the intention of arriving at an acceptable solution <Col N="856" /> through consultation with all parties concerned. I understand Statoil has reached a new agreement with SIPTU for the employment of up to 34 workers on the Connemara drilling operation. Significant numbers will also be employed in the service vessels and auxiliary activities associated with the drilling operation.</P>
    <P>I have made my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, aware of the increased opportunities arising from offshore activities as I believe his Department also has an important role to play in this area.  It is important that we identify areas in which Irish goods and services and Irish industry can enhance its current level of involvement.  Forbairt, which is under the aegis of that Department, plays a very active role in promoting the use of Irish goods and services and has compiled a register of services available in Ireland to support exploration and production operations.  That agency liaises with exploration companies at a very early stage and is in a position to act as a catalyst in establishing linkages between service companies and exploration companies. I compliment Forbairt on the magnificent job it has done in this area.</P>
    <P>This is set to be a significant year for offshore oil development in Ireland.  Statoil has plans to proceed with appraisal of the Connemara oil field and is currently in place.  I am optimistic this will result in the first commercial oil find off Ireland. Marathon and Total also have firm plans to drill in the Porcupine Basin and Enterprise proposes drilling in the Kish Bank Basin.  I am confident the economy will benefit to a significant degree from these operations this year.</P>
    <P>In recent times the union spokesperson has been enthusiastic about the programme and demonstrated that 200 jobs will be created as a result of agreements between SIPTU and Statoil.  Other rigs are also likely to benefit.  The Deputy may not have been aware of that positive move.  I agree with the Deputy that this operation must add value to the Irish economy.  We have tooled up the Whiddy Island tankage farm, which is ready to receive the largest tankers in the world for the storage of crude.  We have also upgraded the Whitegate refinery to refine the oil when it is found.  I am confident oil will be brought ashore this year in commercial quantities.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 April 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish pound is currently trading at under 96p sterling, its lowest level for over three years, reflecting a recent resurgence in the British currency. There has also been a strong recovery in the UK economy, which is now forecast to grow by 3.3 per cent in 1997, out-performing the other major European economies.</P>
      <P>CSO figures for exports to Britain for the period January-October 1996 indicate an increase of 4.5 per cent and An Bord Tráchtála has a range of support measures in place to assist Irish indigenous firms in particular to avail of the emerging opportunities in this market in the current year.</P>
      <P>We must, of course, remember that exchange rates have always been, and will continue to be, a factor in international trade, especially in the case of a small open economy such as ours.  This is a core reason the Government is so committed to becoming a founder member of European Monetary Union, in order to stabilise our long-term economic growth and minimise such problems in the future.</P>
      <P>Another plank of trade policy which is relevant to Irish firms currently in the British market is the focus on continued diversification into other proximate markets in continental Europe.  I have set An Bord Tráchtála specific targets in relation to this, so that we may increase the proportion of our non-food indigenous exports going to continental European markets.</P>
      <P>In order to achieve this, ABT have developed a programme called &ldquo;Opportunity Europe&rdquo;.  This programme is a marketing initiative designed by ABT specifically to assist exporters to commit themselves fully to developing the enormous business potential of the expanding continental European market.  ABT has set a target of trebling non-food indigenous exports to Europe by 2001.  Exports to Europe currently account for 32 per cent of all indigenous exports.  The programme was designed after consultation with industry and the board has allocated a budget of £10 million in 1997 to the Opportunity Europe programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> The Government is committed to the pursuit of policies which promote and improve Ireland's competitiveness in our main markets and as a result of such policies, Ireland, and its exporters currently enjoy an excellent economic environment, with interest rates and inflation at historically low levels.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 88 and 92 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourism industry in Ireland is now exposed to higher standards of consumer expectations.  It is also faced with increased demand for skilled and experienced personnel.  CERT is responding to these challenges through a variety of initiatives. The trainers in industry programme was introduced to support the concept of industry taking more responsibility for training at the operative level.  The programme aims to produce tangible change in the quality of workplace training, to influence standards and to create a training culture throughout the industry.  The focus of the effective management practices programme is to develop professional management practices in <Col N="859" /> tourism and to enhance the competence of managers in meeting current and future challenges. The programme is designed to help managers to develop certain skills for long-term business success which include interpersonal skills, team building, motivation and communication skills. The objective is to achieve a more professional approach to management within companies, providing a strategic outlook for the changing and emerging trends in products and services.</P>
    <P>CERT is also involved in supervisory management programmes which help supervisors to define their role more clearly as a support to management.  Research has identified the need for this programme to meet the needs of future supervisors in the industry.  It will enhance the professionalism and career opportunities of existing and potential supervisors as well as enhancing the quality of service throughout the industry.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year at the Irish Hotels Federation conference, I announced a revised industry training support scheme which aims to provide business with grant assistance for training of employees.  The scheme, which will be operated by CERT, will help business enhance their current structures and improve quality, competitiveness and professionalism in the industry through three key measures: placement of human resources &mdash; development manager; foreign language training, and new technology training.</P>
    <P>CERT also administered a full range of short-term programmes which can be run on an in-service basis and are focused on developing quality employment.  A range of technical courses are also part of this programme and includes activities such as food service, food production and accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in response to previous similar questions, it has been policy for some time not to provide support for tourist accommodation projects, on the basis of the proven ability of the commercial accommodation sector to respond to growth in visitor numbers without grant assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> This approach incorporated into the Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-1993 agreed with the European Commission and by and large carried forward into the current operational programme. However, the current programme does make an exception in the case of a number of specific market segments where the quality of existing accommodation was recognised to be deficient.  Hence, it includes a provision to assist on a selective basis, investments in such areas as accommodation-related conference and leisure facilities; a limited scheme of accommodation improvements to existing small and medium sized hotels with a current capacity of up to 100 bedrooms and graded up to and including three star; limited grant aid for certain specialist accommodation needs such as caravan and camping park facilities; upgrading and improvement of existing buildings for hostel or other specialist accommodation and associated facilities on branded walking routes; provision of new and improved accommodation at approved outdoor pursuits centres in remote areas currently without appropriate accommodation; improvement of existing accommodation at approved residential equestrian centres; horse-drawn caravan and motor-home investments; the additional cost of providing, in existing hotels, suitable access-friendly accommodation for people with disabilities; and improved access for people with disabilities at hotels and major visitor centres.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the overall strategy in the programme, such support is aimed primarily at the enhancement of existing investment rather than supporting new development and all accommodation supported must be registered or approved, as appropriate.  Already, all funds in this regard under the programme are fully committed.  The programme is currently the subject of a mid-term evaluation, in line with the present mid-term review of all the Community Support Framework for Ireland (1994-1999), and the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position, at this stage, to anticipate its findings.</P>
    <P>Other EU funded programmes which provide support for smaller tourism initiatives including accommodation are the Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry and the Leader II programme administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the local urban and rural development programme administered by the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  In the Border counties limited assistance is also available under the IFI and INTERREG programmes and the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Additionally, all registered and approved tourist accommodation was eligible for low interest loans under the access to finance scheme launched last September by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  Some £52 million of this £208 million fund was specially earmarked for tourism projects throughout the country but the target was actually exceeded with the allocation of over £56 million, 27 per cent, of the fund <Col N="861" /> to tourism.  A similar scheme especially for the Border counties, was introduced under the Peace and Reconciliation Fund and all of it has now been committed.</P>
    <P>Finally, investment in registered or approved tourist accommodation in any of the resort areas designated under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas may also qualify for generous tax reliefs under the scheme.</P>

      <P>In 1994 my Department wrote to the European Commission listing 12 cases where Irish exporters had claimed they were facing barriers to trade in certain EU markets.  The cases were subsequently discussed with the Commission and member states in the context of the internal market advisory committee where it emerged that more detailed information would be required to enable follow-up action to be taken by the Commission on such cases.</P>
      <P>I subsequently encouraged IBEC to carry out a survey on barriers to trade faced by Irish exporters in EU markets.  The survey, which was presented to me in May 1995, found that one-third of respondent exporters had experienced difficulties in gaining access to other EU markets. IBEC was subsequently requested to further analyse the survey results to ascertain the nature of the problems concerned to enable my Department to pursue these problems with the EU Commission and other member states concerned.</P>
      <P>In late November 1995 IBEC confirmed that almost all cases of difficulties reported by Irish exporters had been successfully resolved.  Efforts were still being made to settle the small number of unresolved cases and, if these proved unsuccessful, the assistance of my Department would be sought.  Because of the progress made through other channels, the need for further representations to the EU Commission and other member states regarding difficulties experienced by Irish exporters in EU markets has not arisen to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 November last, during the Irish Presidency of the European Union, I chaired an open debate on the European Commission's review of the impact and effectiveness of the single market following a presentation by the Commission of the review to Council.  The review, which confirms that the single market has contributed to increased levels of income and employment, also highlights the need for further action to be taken <Col N="862" /> to ensure that single market legislation is correctly applied and effectively enforced throughout the European Union.  The Dublin European Council subsequently noted the Commission's intention to present to the European Council in Amsterdam an action plan and a timetable covering all necessary measures that must be taken to ensure that the full potential benefit of the internal market is achieved before the beginning of stage three of European Monetary Union.</P>

      <P>Most countries provide for facilities for street trading and traditional markets.  These facilities have traditionally co-existed with other forms of retail shopping.</P>
      <P>There has been no formal study in Ireland as to the importance of open markets as tourist attractions, but it is accepted that street trading areas, e.g. Moore Street, add to the colour and character of cities and towns.</P>
      <P>Good shopping opportunities are an important part of the portfolio of tourism attractions which a destination can offer.  It is generally accepted, however, that visitors to Ireland do not have any rigid expectations as regards the format in which shopping opportunities are offered.</P>
      <P>Feedback from tourists would suggest a high degree of satisfaction with the mix of shopping facilities currently available.  Nevertheless it is imperative that street trading and markets are regulated and licensed properly.  In this regard, the Casual Trading Act, 1995, the primary purpose of which is to achieve decentralisation, efficiency and flexibility in the regulation of casual trading by the local authorities will serve this purpose well.</P>

      <P>My Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs liaise closely and on an ongoing basis on matters relating to the representation of Ireland's economic interests overseas, particularly tourism and trade matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Departments are also represented on the foreign earnings committee, which I chair, and on <Col N="863" /> which there are representatives of other relevant Government Departments and State promotional agencies, including Bord Fáilte.  The committee's terms of reference are to help maximise foreign earnings (i) by focusing the State's overseas promotional activities on potential areas for increases in trade, tourism and investment and (ii) by co-ordinating and enhancing the effectiveness of Ireland's collective promotional efforts abroad.</P>
    <P>The committee has successfully encouraged the establishment of local foreign earnings co-ordination committees &mdash; comprising the market-based representatives of the agencies, including Bord Fáilte, and chaired by the Irish Ambassador &mdash; in our nine main external markets.  The purpose of these committees are to ensure maximum co-ordination at local embassy level with the State promotional agencies, including the tourism agency.</P>
    <P>The system of half-yearly reports from these co-ordinating committees make a significant contribution in highlighting the potential for joint actions by Departments and agencies and co-ordinated pursuit of particular tourism and trade objectives.  Last years's White Paper on foreign policy, Challenges and Opportunities abroad, reiterates the responsibility of all heads of missions in our embassies to promote Ireland's economic interests, including tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 25, 33, 37 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in an earlier reply, the Deputies will be aware that the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 makes provision for European Regional Development Fund support for a large dedicated conference centre capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates to be built in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The tourism potential of a national conference centre in this country has long been recognised and the first Operational Programme for Tourism, 1989-1993, contained provision for such a development.  No progress was made, however, at that stage.</P>
      <P>In September-October 1995, Bord Fáilte organised an open tendering competition seeking interested parties to submit proposals for grant assistance towards the development of such a centre and 13 consortia submitted full proposals. These were rigorously assessed by a Bord Fáilte led assessment team and considered by the independent product development management board set up under the OP to consider such projects. None of the applicants met the criteria which had been set and the open tendering competition accordingly terminated.</P>
      <P>Following the failure of the competition to produce an acceptable private sector proposal to develop the centre, the independent management board, BFE area under whose aegis the competition was run, recommended that the strategy be reviewed.  They suggested as an alternative the possibility of developing the centre through a public sector option.  As a result the Royal Dublin Society (RDS), as a voluntary body, potentially eligible for consideration for the higher rate of European Regional Development Fund assistance normally reserved for public-similar bodies, was invited to submit a proposal on this basis.  A similar invitation subsequently issued to a public-private joint venture who failed to submit an initial application within a twice extended deadline.</P>
      <P>Upon completion of their examination of the RDS proposal, Bord Fáilte, on the recommendation of the management board, commissioned an independent cost/benefit analysis which is required under the tourism OP in the case of all large projects.  This was undertaken by an experienced UK consultancy firm who were selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure.  The results were favourable to the RDS proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, having taken into account a number of factors including the recommendations of the management board and Bord Fáilte, and the results of the cost benefit analysis, agreed to make a submission to the European Commission, recommending formal approval of the proposed development by the RDS.  The Government is <Col N="865" /> recommending approval of 75 per cent capital grant aid subject to the existing financial provision for such a project in the current tourism OP.  The proposal has been submitted to the European Commission for approval, as required under the OP for projects of this scale.</P>
    <P>Since then the Commission officials of DG XVI and their consultants have been continuing their examination of the Government's submission including the indepth cost benefit analysis. As part of this examination they have sought clarification on a number of issues and my Department is currently dealing with some final queries, recently received, on which the Commission require a response before they are in a position to make their final decision.  These queries are currently being dealt with as a matter of priority in my Department.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will recall references in the course of my reply to the House to questions on the same project on 5 March last as reported in Volume 475 No. 8, columns 1,594 to 1,600 of the Official Report, to reports about a complaint lodged with the commission.  I have indicated in a written reply to the House two days ago that the European Commission has now communicated formal notice of a complaint lodged with them on the subject of selection procedures.  The clarifications sought in that communication are currently being prepared in my Department in consultation with Bord Fáilte who carried out the assessment of applications under both the tender competition and the alternative strategy.</P>
    <P>A specific timescale for commencement or completion of the national conference centre project cannot be determined until the proposal has been formally approved by the European Commission, and matters such as planning permission are in place.  There is, however, no reason at this stage to believe that the project cannot be developed under the tourism OP in accordance with the permissible timeframe.</P>

      <P>The setting of standards for the approval of bed and breakfast accommodation is a matter for Bord Fáilte.  The standards are set with the clear objective of providing a high quality product for the consumer and are reviewed on an ongoing basis by the board and the relevant approving agencies to ensure such quality is maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of mandatory approval of all bed and breakfast accommodation I do not believe, as I have said many times in the past, that it would be practical or that it would necessarily <Col N="866" /> improve standards to any great extent.  It could in fact reduce the accommodation bank available, particularly during the high season and at the cheaper end of the market, and it would certainly give rise to endless policing and prosecuting problems.</P>
    <P>I believe that the best approach is to ensure that the unapproved sector does not have advantages over the approved.  At present unapproved operators do not have access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte and the Tourist Information Offices, nor do they have access to tax breaks or other subsidised finance schemes which are available to the approved sector.  The pilot tax relief scheme for the tourist resort areas and the subsidised tourism loan schemes were carefully designed so that only approved operators would be eligible.</P>
    <P>Unapproved operators, on the other hand, are obliged to comply in the same way as the approved sector with requirements, for example, in the areas of taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene.  My Department has been impressing on the relevant enforcement agencies the need for constant vigilance to ensure that their policing or inspection practices do not discriminate as between approved and unapproved sectors.</P>
    <P>The ideal solution would be for unapproved operators to become approved and I can confirm that both Bord Fáilte and the recognised approving agencies are mounting an information campaign encouraging operators to seek approval and explaining clearly not only what is involved in terms of procedure but also in terms of the benefits to be gained from being part of the approved tourist accommodation sector.</P>

      <P>Since the entry into force on 1 July 1995 of the EU system for controlling the export of dual-use goods, three Irish-based companies have been found to have contravened the EU regulation which established the system.  Two of these cases involved minor infringements of the regulation in relation to issues such as record-keeping which came to light during the course of audit visits by officials of my Department.  The third case resulted in the detention of a consignment of controlled dual-use goods being exported by a company who had not obtained the necessary export licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> The European Communities (Control of Exports of Dual-Use Goods) Regulations, 1996 which I made under the European Communities Act, 1972 provide for the imposition of penalties in the event of breach of the EU legislation regarding the control of exports of dual-use goods.  A fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both, is provided for; the maximum penalties permitted under the Act.  In the case of the minor infringements discovered in the course of the two audit visits referred to above, the companies undertook to remedy the deficiencies which had been brought to their attention and therefore no further action was considered necessary.  In the third case, the company was informed of the serious nature of the breach of the regulation and warned that any similar breach in future would result in penalty proceedings being taken by my Department.</P>
    <P>As I explained in a reply to a parliamentary question on 5 March, the implementation of the EU regulation and joint action regarding the control of exports of dual-use goods is under ongoing review in the EU groups established for this purpose, which are attended by officials from my Department, and a number of changes to the list of dual-use goods has been approved by the Council of Ministers and published in the Official Journal.  My Department has also arranged to bring these changes directly to the attention of known Irish exporters of dual-use goods.  I am continuing to keep under review the implementation of the regulation in this country with a view to ensuring that our control system is effective without imposing an undue burden on business.</P>

      <P>The value of Irish merchandise exports to India has grown steadily over the last three years and 1996 has seen a major improvement on the 1995 export performance.  In 1994 merchandise exports totalled £17.4 million and grew by 6 per cent in 1995 to total £18.5 million.  Preliminary trade figures for last year indicate that exports grew by a dramatic 32 per cent to total £24.5 million. The main products exported are scientific instruments, computers, chemicals and machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imports from India also grew significantly in 1996 and according to preliminary estimates imports totalled £58.7 million.  The main goods imported are textiles, computer parts and clothing. A series of trade missions since 1993, most <Col N="868" /> recently in November 1995 led by me have generated considerable interest in Irish goods and services in India and have made the large Indian market more accessible to many Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>An Bord Tráchtála advises me that its objective in 1997 is to make every effort to assist Irish exporters to India to increase market share in niche areas including in the pharmaceutical, consumer goods, infrastructure and international services sector.  Since the nature of the Indian market will continue to favour joint venture co-operation and partnership approaches, I also understand that An Bord Tráchtála will continue to encourage and support the recently formed Ireland &mdash; India Business and Economic Association.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated in reply to earlier questions on this subject, I have been conscious for some time of the need to plan properly for the situation when the current round of EU Structural Funds expires at the end of 1999.  The issue has surfaced already in a number of fora <Col N="869" /> such as the Tourism Council, the overseas tourism marketing initiative and in bilateral contacts between ITIC-industry representatives and my Department.  I have referred to the matter in many speeches over the past two years in which I have exhorted the industry to build on its successes, particularly during this decade, by taking on more responsibility for the development and marketing of its own product and for skills training within the sector.</P>
      <P>More recently, I have indicated to Bord Fáilte and the sector that my Department has already begun to look at possible scenarios for post-1999, with a view to future consultation and discussion with the industry on this subject.  No firm proposals have yet emerged from this process nor, indeed, are they likely to until full analysis, consultation and preparation have been completed. This work will, of course, also provide the necessary background to future negotiations with the European Commission in the lead up to the completion of the current Operational Programme for Tourism which runs up to end 1999.</P>
      <P>As to the EU financial framework post 1999, I understand from the Minister for Finance that the negotiations on the future financing of the European Union, including the Structural Funds, will not commence until the conclusion of the Inter-Governmental Conference when the European Commission will submit a communication on the future financial framework of the Union as from 31 December 1999.  Ireland's overall approach to these negotiations is still under consideration but the House can be assured that when the negotiations commence, the Government will ensure that Ireland's interests are vigorously and effectively pursued.</P>

      <P>The largest element of EU grant assistance for the tourism sector comes from the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, which is available from the Government Publications Sales Office (GPSO).  This sets out in detail the financial framework which will shape investment decisions necessary to achieve the targets set out in the programme.  When this programme was launched in 1994, my Department also published Tourism 2000, again available from the GPSO. This publication contains a comprehensive list of contact points appropriate to the tourism related activities covered in the programme.</P>
      <P>There are also grants available for the development of aspects of the tourism industry under EU programmes administered by Departments other than my own.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The administration of the civil registration system is a matter for an tÁrd-Chláraitheoir (Registrar-General) of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for local registrars who act under his general direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to certain difficulties which have arisen in relation to compliance with the requirements of the Family Law Act, 1995, with respect to marriage preliminaries. The requirements of a valid marriage set out at sections 31 and 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995, are each declared to be a substantive requirement for a valid marriage, and where either section has not been complied with, a marriage may not be registered.  The Deputy will be aware of the provisions of section 33 of the afore-mentioned Act, which provides that an application may be made to either the Circuit Family Court or the High Court for an order exempting a proposed marriage from the application of either or both of the requirements of sections 31 and 32.  Where there has not been compliance with the provisions of sections 31 and 32, and where exemption to these requirements has not been obtained from the courts under section 33 prior to the marriage, then the marriage may not be registered.  I am aware that of the 154 marriages which have been referred to the Office of An tArd-Chláraitheoir, it appears that there has not been compliance with the requirements for a <Col N="873" /> valid marriage, contained in the Family Law Act, 1995; in 79 cases.  I understand that a further 28 marriages are currently under investigation to establish if the requirements of the Act have been met.</P>
    <P>The difficulties, in the cases referred to, arise primarily from the failure of the persons concerned to give three months written notification of their intention to marry to the appropriate registrar of marriages as required by section 32. In the majority of these cases written notification was given to the wrong registrar, in a number of cases there is no record of any notification having been given to a registrar and in some cases it was established that the couple had given the necessary written notification direct to the appropriate registrar less than the required three months before the date of the marriage.</P>
    <P>I very much regret the inconvenience that may be caused to the couples affected and every effort is being made to find an early and satisfactory resolution.  The Government has decided to introduce amending legislation to cater for difficulties, which have arisen in circumstances where the three months written notification was given to a registrar other than the appropriate registrar.  I understand that the Heads of a Bill have been referred by my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, to the Attorney General's office for formal drafting and that he intends bringing forward the Bill for consideration by the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 52 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first nursing registration/diploma programme of education and training was commenced at University College Hospital Galway in 1994, in association with University College Galway. Considerable progress has since been made in extending the programme to other schools of nursing.  The programme is of 156 weeks' duration which is spread over three academic years. Successful completion of the programme leads to registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais <Col N="874" /> and the award of a diploma in nursing from the associated third level institute.</P>
    <P>The first intake of students to the programme at University College Hospital Galway is due to complete the programme this year.  I understand that the person who is the subject of the question from Deputy O'Keeffe is one of those students. Successful students who register with An Bord Altranais will be eligible for employment as nurses.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the transition from the traditional apprenticeship model of nursing education and training to the diploma based programme, one academic year courses leading to a degree in nursing are being developed by those third level institutes involved in the delivery of the diploma programme in partnership with the schools of nursing.  It is intended that such a course will be available during the coming academic year at University College Galway.  As the degree course will be an optional post-registration qualification, registered nurse wishing to undertake the course will be responsible for making their own arrangements and for meeting the associated costs.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 77 of 20 March to Deputy Gregory on this matter, which was as follows:</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Local Drugs Task Forces have been set up in 12 priority areas in Dublin as recommended by the Ministerial Task Force on Measures to Reduce the Demand for Drugs.  One of the priorities for each Task Force will be to draw up a profile of all existing services and resources available in the area to combat the drugs problem and to agree a development strategy to build on these.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board, which has statutory authority for the development of health services in Dublin has approved a plan costing up to £5 million in 1997 for the development of its drug misuse prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services in Dublin in accordance with the recommendation made by the ministerial task force that waiting lists for treatment should be abolished during 1997.  The board will be consulting each local drugs task force about the elements of the plan which impinge on the task force area and these will be considered by the task force for inclusion in its service development plan.  In so far as such developments relate to mainstream services, funding for them will be provided by the Eastern Health Board.  It could arise that a local drugs task force may propose a new initiative involving a number of agencies, including the Eastern Health Board.  In such circumstances it would be envisaged that funding for a proposal along the lines should come from the £10 million available this year to fund proposals from Local Drugs Task Forces. </P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Following discussions with my Department regarding the problem of overcrowding at University College Hospital, Galway, the Western Health Board has proposed a range of measures aimed at resolving the difficulties.</P>
      <P>I understand that the possibility of utilising the Bons Secours Hospital, Tuam, is one of the options being kept under review by the board, having regard to the service issues involved and the availability of resources.  However, in proposing additional &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; beds, the board is giving priority to the provision of such beds in its own hospital at Merlin Park.</P>

Over £65 million has been allocated to the corporation to date in respect of these projects, including £7 million this year.

Given the level of funding which will be required by Dublin Corporation and other local authorities throughout the country to complete approved projects, and the general level of demand for assistance under the scheme, it is not possible, at this stage, to designate further projects for funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools, by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
      <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remediation, service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>Specific funding for research is not provided in my Department's current grant aid to third level colleges.  However, it is estimated that about 10 per cent of the HEA's current grant to universities is used for research.  In addition, funding from the Department of Enterprise and Employment for basic and strategic research increased from £1.5 million in 1994 to over £3.7 million in 1997. My Department and the Department of Enterprise and Employment have also introduced schemes of post-doctoral grants.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999 a dedicated amount of £10 million is being provided for the replacement of research and teaching equipment in the universities.  This provision is part of an overall £120 million capital investment programme designed primarily for the purpose of supporting the third level sector in areas of research and teaching related to economic growth and job creation.</P>
      <P>This £10 million allocation for equipment has already been complemented by a further £2 million of Exchequer funds bringing the total allocation for equipment for the Higher Education Authority sector to £12 million, an average of £2 million per annum over the six year period of the plan.  A further £60 million capital investment programme comprising £30 million from the private sector with matching funds from the Exchequer was approved by Government in 1995 with a view to providing additional graduate and postgraduate places in the university sector.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, no arbitrary cutback has been made in the capital provision for teaching and research equipment for the universities in respect of the period 1994-9.  While some variations may occur in the annual capital equipment allocations to the Higher Education Authority by my Department is not envisaged that there will be any reduction in the level of equipment to be approved over this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> To further enhance the effectiveness of the sector both in terms of meeting the recommendations of the science technology and innovation advisory council and the steering committee on the future development of higher education and in the awareness that there is need for further investment in capital resources for research my Department is at present considering introducing a number of further initiatives that will contribute to the funding of new equipment for the sector.</P>

      <P>The revised proposals for agreement on the Pay and <Col N="886" /> Conditions of Teachers under Clause 2 (iii) of Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> include a proposal for the purchase for superannuation purposes of incremental service given by teachers when they were eligible to join the secondary teachers' superannuation scheme but did not do so.  The proposal provides for the purchase of such service at the normal contribution rate of 6.5 per cent - 5 per cent for teachers who are not members of the spouses' scheme.</P>
      <P>The proposal is confined to actual incremental service given in schools and would not apply to the purchase for superannuation purposes of any other service.</P>
      <P>However, my Department operates a scheme for the purchase of notional service.  This scheme enables teachers to voluntarily purchase additional years for the calculation of superannuation benefits.  It is open to any primary or second-level teacher who is a member of the relevant superannuation scheme to apply for the purchase of notional service &mdash; which would include time spent teaching in Africa &mdash; at the appropriate rates.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply of 20 February 1997 the issue of when a psychological assessment may be arranged for the child referred to in the question is a matter for the director of community care in the relevant community care area.  There is a schools psychological service provided by my Department to post-primary schools in the Louth-Monaghan area, but it is not yet available to national schools in the area.  However, as an exceptional arrangement for the child concerned, my Department's psychological service, in consultation with the psychologists in the community care team, will ensure that the child is psychologically assessed.</P>
      <P>Due to the need to limit public expenditure, it has not been possible to expand my Department's psychological service in the recent past.  Given the current level of staffing, the schools psychological service cannot be offered to national schools in areas other than those where it is currently being provided.  Any extension of the psychological service provided by my Department will take place on a phased basis, as resources become available for the purpose.  It will, necessarily, be some time before the Department of Education is in a position to take over responsibility for psychological assessments for educational purposes from the health authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As and when it becomes possible to extend the schools psychological service, the needs of children <Col N="889" /> and of schools in various areas, including County Monaghan, will be borne in mind.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1997, came into effect on 2 April.  Its provisions include an important change in the rules relating to the requalification for unemployment benefit which will have a substantial beneficial effect on the incomes of many workers, particularly those in a typical employment such as seasonal and casual workers like dockers and fire fighters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These workers were precluded from requalifying for unemployment benefit until they had a further 13 PRSI contributions paid subsequent to exhausting their unemployment benefit entitlement. In future, a person will be able to requalify <Col N="890" /> for unemployment benefit by having 13 paid contributions at any stage after the 156th day (i.e. six months) of unemployment.  This will mean that, where the 13 contributions are paid between the 156th day and the 390th day, the claimant can requalify for a further 390 days of unemployment benefit immediately after the first 390 days has been exhausted.</P>

      <P>As I said in response to a similar question last October, official statistics on the number of overseas visitors to Ireland and their expenditure while in Ireland are collected and published by the Central Statistics Office.  This information is compiled from two large sample surveys conducted continuously throughout the year at each of the major air and sea ports and covering both incoming and departing passengers.  The sample size in each survey is in the order of 350,000 passengers per annum.  The fact that we are an island nation allows us to implement sample surveys at airports and seaports very efficiently.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, for the first time in 1997 the CSO is implementing a survey of domestic and out-bound tourism in response to Eurostat requirements for statistics within EU member states. Hitherto, Bord Fáilte have surveyed domestic tourism.  The CSO survey will cover a larger sample and will be conducted at more frequent intervals.</P>
      <P>Our Central Statistics Office operates as part of the Eurostat regime and experts in the compilation and methodology of statistics are in constant contact with a view to applying the best operational methods.  I am satisfied on the basis of expert advice from Bord Fáilte and the CSO that our current practices are as good if not better than any in Europe.</P>

      <P>Innovation is desirable and necessary in all areas of business endeavour including tourism. Organisations that are swift to perceive the need for change and flexible enough to adapt are those most likely to endure in today's competitive environment.</P>
      <P>From a tourism marketing aspect one of the most innovative events in recent years was the launch in November last of the new Tourism Brand Ireland developed following extensive international consumer research.  All of the industry is unifying behind the new brand which incorporates an all island approach in co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Also for the past three years we have operated an innovative marketing partnership with the private sector for destination marketing in our key markets.  This is part of the emphasis by Government on a partnership approach with the industry in developing the tourism sector.  It is through this partnership approach that the well of innovative thought and new ideas within the industry can best be tapped into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through the vehicle of the new tourism council, which I chair, I am open to many proposals <Col N="892" /> and suggestions for improving our tourism product such as how we tackle the areas of seasonality, manpower and training.  In addition the ongoing contact that I and my officials have with the tourism promoting agencies are all used to emphasise the need to continually examine methods of operation and how strategies and programmes might best be adapted or improved.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-9 which sets out the principal objectives of Ireland's tourism policy and sets targets and structures for the development of the sector up to the end of the century is currently at the stage of its mid-term review.  The opportunity is being taken in the course of this exercise to consider, <i>inter alia</i>, if new directions and alternative concepts might be capable of being developed in the remaining half of the programme.</P>
    <P>While I have said at the outset that openness to innovative thought is essential if we are to compete successfully in the world tourism marketplace, I believe we must, at the same time, be conscious of the fact that our tourism appeal is largely based on visitors interest in our heritage, history, culture, our relatively clean environment and the innate friendliness of our people.  While, therefore, we must always encourage innovative energy, it will achieve best results for as long as we ensure that it is anchored to the tourism strengths that we have and to the ever-present need to maintain high quality of product and service.</P>

      <P>The abandonment of the Grant National at Aintree, due to a bomb alert last Saturday, has come at an important time of the year for attracting visitors and, like all serious incidents of this nature, has the potential to impact to some extent on our capacity to attract overseas visitors.</P>
      <P>While it is too early to assess overall impact, I am advised by Bord Fáilte that inquiries to their office in London are continuing at a very high level and the industry continues to report excellent prospects from Britain for Irish tourism this year.  Bord Fáilte will, nevertheless, continue to monitor the situation closely in association with key carriers, tour operators and product suppliers and adopt, where necessary, appropriate strategies to deal with the situation should it deteriorate. Overall, the board will continue to promote and sell Ireland as vigorously as possible overseas, maximising the benefits of the new Tourism Brand Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy's question refers to the value to Irish tourism of overseas students who come here specifically to study English as a foreign language.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte estimate that some 113,000 English language students, aged 16 years and over visited Ireland in 1996.  This represents an increase of 9,000 or 9 per cent on 1995.  Bord Fáilte also estimate that this sector contributed over £113 million to Irish tourism last year and that further growth is expected in 1997.</P>
      <P>The importance of this sector to the tourism market has long been recognised, most recently in the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, in which specific provision was made for investment in additional language learning facilities as well as for co-operative marketing of Ireland internationally as a centre for learning English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to improve the impact of individual English language schools in the international market, I understand that a group marketing initiative, entitled Marketing English in Ireland, <Col N="894" /> has been established with the support of Bord Fáilte and funding from the Tourism Operational Programme.  The objective of this initiative is to encourage individual product suppliers to co-operate in marketing their business abroad.  At present, there are 48 language schools participating in this initiative.</P>
    <P>While Spain, France and Italy remain the traditional sources of business for the sector, this group marketing initiative is attempting to reduce its dependence on these markets by developing new and emerging markets such as Eastern Europe, the Far East and South America.</P>

      <P>I am assuming the Deputy is referring to the World Trade Organisation whose remit relates to trade liberalisation and whose inaugural ministerial meeting, held in Singapore in December 1996, approved a work-programme for the organisation covering the period until the next meeting in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greater part of the work-programme is dictated by the Uruguay Round Agreements which contains commitments to further detailed negotiations in nearly all sectors covered by these agreements; this is often referred to as the &ldquo;built-in agenda&rdquo; of the WTO.  In particular, the agreements have provisions calling for future negotiations on Agriculture, Services and elements of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), or reviews and other work on anti-dumping, customs valuation, dispute settlement understanding, import licensing, preshipment inspection, rules of origin, sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures, safeguards, <Col N="895" /> subsidies and countervailing measures, technical barriers to trade, textiles and clothing, trade policy review mechanism, TRIPS and traded-related investment measures.</P>
    <P>In addition to the work-programme flowing directly from the WTO's &ldquo;built-in agenda&rdquo;, the conference also agreed to establish working-groups on trade and investment, trade and competition policy and transparency in Government procurement practices and directed the WTO's Council for Trade in Goods to undertake exploratory and analytical work on the simplification of trade procedures.</P>
    <P>The work-programme established by the conference ensures that that WTO will continue to work towards the elimination of the remaining obstacles to trade between countries.  This is of considerable importance to this country because of our heavy dependence on international trade.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>The deseasonalisation premium was introduced under the CAP reform measures of 1992 to assist in overcoming the seasonal pattern of steer slaughterings in Ireland.  The conditions governing the scheme are set down in Council Regulation 805/68 and Commission Regulation 3886/92, as amended.</P>
      <P>As originally adopted, the EU regulation provided for a flat-rate payment on steers slaughtered between 1 January and 30 April.  However, in order to avoid the bulking of slaughtering at the end of April, the European Union amended the regulation from 1995 to provide for a gradual reduction in the premium over a longer period as follows:</P>

    <P>I should point out that I succeeded in having the trigger level reduced from 40 per cent to 35 per cent to allow for the continuation of the scheme this year and subsequent years.  This was a very important concession which is worth some £20 million to Irish producers, particularly winter finishers, this spring.</P>
    <P>Any postponement in the rate of reduction in the premium would require an amendment to the Council Regulation and, in view of the procedure involved, such an amendment could not be achieved, certainly in the short-term.</P>

      <P>There are currently 329 permanent veterinary staff employed by my Department. These permanent staff are augmented by 25 whole-time temporary veterinary inspectors and a further approximately 540 part-time temporary veterinary inspectors.  The whole-time temporary veterinary inspectors are engaged on the disease eradication programmes and the part-time temporary veterinary inspectors are engaged on meat inspection and portal duties.  The number of associated support staff is approximately 636 which includes technical and subordinate grades. The annual cost of these services is approximately £41 million, comprising costs of salaries, overtime, allowances, gratuities and travel and subsistence expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years the Land Commission provided many hundreds of plots of land for use by local communities as sports fields, cow parks, etc. and set up trusts to oversee their management. My Department continues to be responsible for servicing these trusts, i.e., for replacing trustees, etc., when required.  In 1993-94 a review of policy in this area was carried out within my Department and it was decided that, where possible under the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts, responsibility for management and control of trust lands should be transferred to users and that &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; trusts should be revoked.  In order to pursue this course each trust case must be considered in the context of its own individual circumstances and the future of each trust estate must be decided accordingly.</P>
      <P>Over the years no register of trust was kept and it would not be possible, without an inordinate diversion of scarce staff resources, to provide the detailed information sought.  If the Deputy is concerned about a particular trust or trusts, I will arrange to have information on these conveyed to him on receipt of the necessary particulars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the water quality report in question arising out of surveys completed in 1991-94 for the Moyarta River and others.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware local authorities have overall statutory responsibility for enforcing the provisions of the Water Pollution Acts and are empowered to require measures to be taken to prevent water pollution including pollution of the Moyarta River.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition the seven Regional Fisheries Boards, under the aegis of the Department, have statutory responsibilities with regard to the protection of fisheries within their region using powers provided under the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1995 and the Water Pollution Act, 1990.  The <Col N="908" /> boards also have an input, at planning stage, into developments which could affect fish or their habitat.</P>
    <P>The water quality problems in the Moyarta River highlighted in the Environmental Protection Agency report are matters for investigation by Clare County Council in the first instance and the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board in so far as adverse impacts on fisheries are concerned.</P>
    <P>Carrigaholt Bay has the highest water quality classification and remains listed as a Category &ldquo;A&rdquo; area under EC Directive 91/492 which lays down the health conditions for the production and placing on the market of live bivalve molluscs. Category &ldquo;A&rdquo; classification allows live bivalve molluscs, including oysters from the area, to be harvested for direct human consumption. The Department will continue to undertake regular sampling and analyses of molluse flesh from oysters cultivated in Carrigaholt Bay in accordance with the parameters laid down by EU Directive 91/492.</P>
