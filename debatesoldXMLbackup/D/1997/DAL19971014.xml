      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, being taken by his Department and by the Government generally to take account of the findings of the international advisory group on the IFSC.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my appointment as Taoiseach I have retained personal responsibility for the IFSC and have not delegated it to a Minister of State.  This gives effect to the central recommendation of the Report of the International Advisory Group on the IFSC chaired by Deputy Mitchell when he was Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Other recommendations in the report relating to the Government-industry interface, infrastructure, education and training, taxation considerations, marketing and the impact of EMU have already been discussed in relevant IFSC working groups and will provide an input into the ongoing decision making of Government Departments and agencies.</P>
      <P>I recently met the financial services industry representatives on the IFSC Clearing House Group and senior ministerial colleagues to discuss the future development of the centre.  This is the first time since the establishment of the IFSC that a Taoiseach has met such a representative group from the financial services industry.</P>
      <P>The industry agrees with me that now is an opportune time to take a strategic look at the future development of the centre as we move into the next millennium.  As a result of these discussions, I have asked the Clearing House Group to put in place a strategy into the 21st Century for the IFSC to consolidate the success of the centre and develop it for the future.  The Deputy may be assured the excellent work which went into the preparation of the report of the international advisory group will be taken forward in the context of the preparation of this strategy.</P>

      <P>Since the Taoiseach has taken personal responsibility for this matter, can he explain why the Government has abandoned its explicit commitment both in its joint programme and in his party's election manifesto to have a 10 per cent corporate tax rate for the IFSC after 2005?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Taxation is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  Regarding corporation tax in general, the Government has followed what was already agreed, namely, that there would be a single rate of corporation tax.  The Minister for Finance stated in the House last week that this is a matter he is finalising.  Both he and the Tánaiste have meetings in Brussels today on the matter and he will issue his policy statement on it during the budget debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach unaware that his party explicitly stated that there would be a 10 per cent and not a 12.5 per cent rate of tax for the IFSC which he admitted some minutes ago he is personally responsible for?  Can he explain this U-turn?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of whether there should be a single rate and if so what it should be is one for the Minister for Finance.  There is no difficulty arising in relation to that matter.  The Deputy should have been aware that other relevant issues were causing difficulties in Brussels when he was Taoiseach, issues which we are now trying to resolve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the issue.  The issue is the breach of an explicit promise by the Taoiseach and his Government.  Before and after the election he said that the single rate would be 10 per cent.  The Taoiseach has now sent his Minster for Finance to Brussels to argue for the rate promised by the previous Government, namely, 12.5 per cent.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to take personal responsibility for this U-turn and breach of a Fianna Fáil election promise which comes on top of breaches of promises on mandatory reporting and support for the Dundalk residents opposing Sellafield?  Is this pattern of U-turns to be a characteristic of the Taoiseach's Government? Will the Taoiseach answer?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of what rate of tax will apply after 2005 has not yet been resolved. There are ongoing discussions relating to this matter.  What has been decided is that subsequent to 2005 there will be a single rate of tax for the IFSC, the international traded area, the Shannon Development area and other areas which have been the source of debate over the years.  The passive rate of taxation will be 25 per cent.  The rate of the tax as announced in the House last week by the Minister for Finance will be stated in the budget on 3 December.</P>

      <P>A working group has been set up within the Department to examine and assess information systems in relation to the year 2000 problem, that is, the millennium bug.  Estimated costs of £20,000 for work necessary to ensure year 2000 compliance of the Department's information systems have been identified.  Replacement and upgrade work will commence in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware the problem regarding chips inserted in computers prior to 1996 could pose a major problem for the health services in terms of the operation of hospitals and for business in terms of its suppliers, customers and maintenance of business?  Is he aware the ESB has estimated the cost of making the necessary adjustments could be in the region of £10 million?  If this is not properly planned for, the total cost to the Irish economy could run to £1 <Col N="656" /> billion.  What action is the Taoiseach taking as head of Government to ensure there is proper planning to deal with this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That computers in private industry, as well as those in the State sector, are not capable of coping with the millennium change has been highlighted for some time.  A number of groups are working to deal with this problem and in my Department this will be catered for by the change of equipment in 1998-99.  There is no great difficulty from a cost point of view.</P>
      <P>A working group has been dealing with this problem across Government Departments for a considerable time.  We have looked at the cost factors and apart from changes in information technology, equipment and systems, there will be an additional estimated cost of about £12.6 million to ensure that all computers, particularly in the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, and the area of payments in the Department of Agriculture and Food, are accounted for.</P>
      <P>An information group was recently set up to deal with this issue across Departments, including all management and IT unit systems already in operation.  People have also been recruited from the private sector to assist in this and advice has been sought from outside agencies.  This group will report to the Government on a quarterly basis, so computers across all Government services should be accounted for well in advance of 1999.  The Deputy is correct in saying there is a cost factor, but this is necessary so the administration of information technology is compatible with the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware the cost of dealing with the problem is escalating?  As we come closer to the date in question, more firms worldwide are beginning to realise they have to get outside help.  If early action is taken, the problem can be dealt with at a relatively modest cost but if an organisation leaves it until 1999 it may have to pay astronomical consultancy fees to sort out the problem at that later stage.  It is important that all Irish Government services take early action on this matter.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that health boards who want to act on this are unable to do so in some cases because the Department of Health has not given them the necessary instructions?  Does he agree it is his responsibility to ensure all Ministers recognise this is a genuine problem and not a fanciful matter?  It needs to be prioritised by Ministers and particularly by the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to Government Departments, a working group was set up two years ago to deal with this matter.  Since early 1996, all agencies and sections of the Civil Service and semi-State bodies have been involved in changing equipment and revising systems &mdash; using outside agencies where necessary.  I was <Col N="657" /> concerned that in some areas the process was not advancing quickly enough and it was brought to my attention that some areas would not be able to make the changes in advance of 1999 at that rate of action.  The matter should not be left to the last few months.</P>
      <P>Apart from the interdepartmental group and the various sections dealing with office equipment, IT systems and management systems, a group has been set up comprising the Departments, their agencies and outside agencies to deal with the issue.  The Deputy is correct that there is a shortage of people with the technical qualifications needed to address some of the difficulties, people who had worked with the old COBOL systems.  However, I am happy that Departments will be ready for the changes well in advance of the period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little more than two years left before this problem will arise because the systems must be operational by 1 January 2000.  Will the Taoiseach indicate the point at which he expects decisions will be made for the expenditure of the moneys needed to replace equipment?  What timescale does he foresee for the implementation of the changes necessary? On what is the £12.5 million estimated cost to Departments based?  It seems very low when one considers the systems of the Departments of Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs alone.  Some of the systems in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are already out of date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The £12.6 million is additional to the change of equipment.  The change of equipment began in 1996 and will continue to 1999. The purchasing of the new equipment has eliminated the problem in many cases.  Not all the systems faced the problem of not being able to handle the millennium change.  There is extensive hardware and software work ongoing in all areas. As I said, we are endeavouring to make sure that as much work as possible is done before 1999. The outside expertise we have sought is a reflection that the private sector has been dealing with this matter for a number of years and those involved may help us to speed up the process so that arrangements may be in place by 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the majority of organisations in the private sector are behind in preparing for this change and that looking to them to rescue the Government will not yield results?  Is he also aware that this change will be made at the same time as these organisations will be converting to the euro?  The extra burden of dealing with the millennium problem and the euro together could lead to breakdowns in a number of firms with major legal liability costs.  It will not simply entail the cost of remedying defects, but if defects occur and there are failures resulting there will be substantial legal liability on organisations including, for example, <Col N="658" /> health boards and hospitals which may fail to call people for appointments if the computers are not working properly.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that a number of people in the US have been called out of retirement at salaries twice that of the Taoiseach to deal with this matter?  This is the scale of costs faced by organisations, costs for which we are not yet ready and which will increase if we do not act promptly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be guilty of repetition. The Government does not need to be rescued on this issue.  Since 1996, agencies here have worked collectively and individually on this issue.  The millennium bug &mdash; the name which has been given to this problem internationally &mdash; has been dealt with extensively throughout the Government system.  The interdepartmental group and the committee chaired by the Department of Finance are endeavouring to achieve compliance in this matter through the year 2000 project.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs have exhaustive and considerable resources and expertise.  The people from the private sector to whom I referred are not people we are recruiting from companies which are in difficulty; these people have external consultancies and have successfully dealt with this issue in the private sector. They will report to the Government on a quarterly basis.</P>
      <P>The Deputy and the House can be assured this Government is keenly conscious that we cannot have information technology systems which, on 1 January 2000, will not be able to deal with correspondence, cheques, payments and data in relation to revenue.  We are seeking to ensure, well in advance of that date, that the necessary preparation is done and the costs are met.  The £12.5 million is in addition to the substantial changes in the computer software and hardware which will be made between now and the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach name the agencies and Departments he has already identified as being slow?  Has he assigned responsibility to any Minister for this issue?  As has already been indicated, the Minister with responsibility for the public service will also face the awesome responsibility of supervising Ireland's entry to EMU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance is overseeing the work but there are Departments in which a great deal of effort will be required to achieve this; it is not a question of individual Departments being slow.  The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are both very satisfactorily computerised and the level of technology in both is expansive.  Fundamental changes are now required in preparation for the millennium.  We are lucky that we have people in both of those</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> Departments with a high level of expertise in information technology; they are engaged &mdash; in addition to the overall interdepartmental group &mdash; in working to see this issue successfully resolved.</P>
    <P>The plans for economic and monetary union are well advanced by the Central Bank and the economic and monetary institute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Preparing the rest of the economy for EMU will be an awesome task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will.  The Deputy will be aware there have been extensive seminars, training programmes and information sessions to try to bring all sections of the economy up to the required standard.  The Deputy will also be aware that some business opinion polls this year show there is still a great reluctance to invest money as preparation for that.  Many private sector companies are involved extensively and have spent huge amounts of money but others have not.  We must continue to urge them to make the necessary changes to be ready for EMU which will commence at the beginning of 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the Institute of Personnel and Development conference in the Alexander Hotel on Monday, 6 October.  The text of my speech has been released by the Government Information Service and has also been laid before this House.</P>
      <P>The theme of the conference was &ldquo;sustaining high performance &mdash; the people paradox&rdquo;.  The central issue was how organisations cultivate and sustain a significantly higher level of performance from their people.  I answered questions in some detail last week on the progress of the strategic management initiative generally and I will now reply on the performance management system.</P>
      <P>In my remarks to the Institute of Personnel and Development I talked about the need to embrace change at an unprecedented pace.  I pointed out that it is the performance of people, based on their knowledge and skills, which provides the foundations for successful organisations.  I then turned to the experience of managing change in the Civil Service which, in common with many other public service organisations, is looking at more effective ways of working.</P>
      <P>The overall framework for change is provided by the strategic management initiative.  The Public Service Management Act 1997, which commenced from 1 September this year, provides that all Departments must prepare statements of strategy by 1 March 1998.  These statements of strategy will set the goals and objectives for Departments and the strategies to achieve them.  In this context, emphasis is being placed on developing and utilising the skills of the staff to better meet the needs of Departments.  Therefore the key element in ensuring the organisational goals are achieved by Departments will be the development of an effective system for managing performance within Departments.</P>
      <P>Hay Management Consultants have been engaged to work with the Civil Service on the design and development of the performance management system within the Civil Service.  Work is now being completed on its design and development and this will be ready by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The detailed implementation phase is due to start in January 1998.  It will contain the following elements.  As a first step, clear objectives for the organisation will be set.  People will be clear about their role in the Civil Service and the skills and competencies which they require to perform effectively.  Senior managers will be the leaders and the &ldquo;role models&rdquo; for the new performance management process.  It will be &ldquo;owned&rdquo; by all staff.  All staff will be given training to implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is clearly a major agenda for change which will require the active co-operation of many <Col N="661" /> people.  I see the partnership approach as being very important to achieve the trust between managers and staff which is at the heart of a fundamental change process.  I am asking the recently established implementation group to press on with this process which is of benefit not only to customers of the Civil Service but to civil servants.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I do not wish to be in dispute with you, a Cheann Comhairle, but the Taoiseach referred to the need for the Civil Service to be highly responsive to customers and their needs.  Does he regard asylum seekers as customers of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?  Does he regard it as appropriate that they should be left in these disgraceful conditions?  Would Irish born people have been left waiting on St. Stephen's Green in these conditions?

      <P>In accordance with established practice, statistical information on the numbers of prosecutions and convictions under litter legislation is sought from the local authorities at the beginning of each year in respect of the previous year.  This will be done early next year in respect of the current year.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the new Act came into operation on 1 July.  Local authorities are now availing of their strengthened powers under the Act for the purposes of preventing and controlling litter, and my Department has issued implementation guidelines to assist in more effective enforcement against offenders.</P>
      <P>I am confident local authorities will apply themselves more vigorously to tackling litter pollution problems under the umbrella of the new legislation.  To assist them in developing new litter initiatives, including anti-litter awareness activities in their areas, I have decided to make some limited grant funding available for projects this year.  I have already invited local authorities to apply for assistance and am currently considering the applications received.  I will make grant allocations shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be realistic here.  The new legislation came into effect on 1 July, which was three months ago.  The approach to litter and the environment generally has been very lax until now.  This legislation compels local authorities to put in place an implementation plan by the end of the year.  I am confident that, with the grants which will be made available to local authorities and the awareness campaign which will be conducted, we will see a greater involvement by local authorities, who will be compelled to comply with the Act by the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is obviously not going to take action against the 32 local authorities who still do not have a litter warden, although they are obliged to have one under the Litter Act, 1982.  That does not augur very well for how the Minister of State will implement the provisions of the 1997 Act.  Will the Minister of State indicate what kinds of activity he will assist by way of grants?  He said he would offer grant funding to local authorities for certain kinds of activities under the Litter Act, 1997.  How much funding will be provided?</P>

      <P>There is a sum of £400,000 available for litter initiatives this year.  Last year, most of the money was spent on advertising public awareness of litter.  I will spend the bulk of the money available to me to help local authorities to implement well focused local initiatives.  Local authorities must take the lead which is why I will make that money available to them.  Large resources were spent last year on a national campaign by the previous Minister and, while that had a certain effect, we must support initiatives by local authorities through local radio advertising and so on.  I am confident that approach will be successful.  The moneys available this year will be given to local authorities which have their plans in place.</P>

      <P>I am formulating a comprehensive package of measures in relation to local government funding.  Legislation giving effect to these measures will be brought before this House as soon as possible, and will primarily enable the establishment of a local government fund.</P>
      <P>The fund will be made up of a specific percentage of national taxation, which will replace the system introduced by the last Government, of allocating motor tax for the discretionary use of local authorities.  The new fund will also replace other specific grants paid to local authorities. Non-national road works will be funded from motor tax income.  Parts of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997, will be repealed to give effect to the Government's local government funding proposals.  I also propose to require local authorities &mdash; using existing legislative powers &mdash; to limit increases in rates.  This will be done in conjunction with the introduction of the new funding system.</P>

      <P>How much money is now in the specific fund from motor taxation created by the previous Government that was to be distributed to local authorities?  It was approximately £100 million midway through the year.  Will it be given to local authorities?</P>
      <P>What elements of national taxation will be incorporated together before a percentage is divided among the local authorities?  Will it include income tax, VAT, corporation tax or all of these things?</P>

Given that it must be passed by the Government I do not propose to elaborate on it. With regard to his proposals for local government funding, in the last account I received some time ago, it was expected that the buoyancy in motor taxation would amount to approximately £3 million.</P>

      <P>It is surprising the Minister does not have the figure before him regarding the special fund that was created by the previous Government.  All motor taxation went into this fund from 1 January to be released to local authorities. Where is that money now?  Will this <Col N="666" /> important pool of money, which was ring-fenced for local authorities, be available to them in its entirety or will the Minister leak some of it back to the central Exchequer?</P>

      <P>I do not know.  When the Deputy was Minister in the early part of 1997 he provided local authorities with money from the fund.  I do not keep a daily account of the fund, but I assure the Deputy the money has been ring-fenced. At my various meetings with the local authorities I have recognised the achievement by the previous Minister in ring-fencing it.  That money stays within the local government system and I have no intention of leaking it beyond that. There is currently no change in this policy.</P>

Initially they will be paid by the Department on the current basis but a number of other changes will be introduced over time to the local government funding system.

Will the Minister confirm that in addition to this fund, the Government will meet the firm commitment of the previous Administration regarding a separate allocation to local authorities for the county roads special restoration fund?  Local authorities should not be expected to meet those costs from this fund.

      <P>My Department has commenced the process of selecting consultants to undertake a study of the factors influencing increases in house prices and the implications of likely future developments. The terms of reference for the study are as follows: to identify and evaluate the factors influencing the increase in house prices in the period since 1 January 1994 with particular emphasis on the situation in the Dublin region; to assess how the various factors operated in relation to house prices in different areas and segments of the housing market; to evaluate how, and to what extent, these factors or other developments are likely to operate in relation to house prices in the medium term; and to assess the implications of likely future developments in house prices generally and particularly in relation to affordability for house purchasers.</P>
      <P>The final date for the receipt of detailed proposals from the various consultants who have expressed an interest in undertaking the study is 24 October following which the consultants will be chosen.  I envisage the study should be completed within four months.</P>

      <P>I have not included in my review any consideration of the ceilings on contributions to political parties.  I note what was said in the tribunal report, but there were no direct recommendations made by the tribunal on the question of payments.  The tribunal did comment that it did not consider it practical to prohibit political contributions and for parties to rely solely on public funding.  That would accord with my view. The mix of private and State funding we have at the moment, through the parliamentary allowance system, is perfectly legitimate and in accordance with the Constitution.

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>A statutory framework for recycling is provided by the Waste Management Act, 1996.  I am satisfied that adequate progress is being made in the development of waste recycling in accordance with specific regulations under the Act and with targets defined, for example, in the national recycling strategy, Recycling for Ireland, published in 1994.  The National Waste Database Report published by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1996 indicates that the recycling rate for packaging waste increased from 10.3 per cent in 1993 to 15.6 per cent in 1995.  The national network of &ldquo;bring sites&rdquo; increased from 60 in 1990 to 426 in 1995 and is continuing to expand.</P>
      <P>A major stimulus to the recycling of packaging waste is now being provided by the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, which came into effect on 1 July 1997.  These regulations impose obligations on packaging producers to take specified measures to promote the collection and recovery of packaging waste.  They also provide statutory support for the voluntary industry-led REPAK scheme which has targeted a 27 per cent recycling rate for packaging waste by 2001. Similarly, the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations, 1997, which came into effect on 1 August 1997 will support the collection and recycling of waste plastic from farms.  My Department will continue to develop a programme of legislation to promote recycling of appropriate waste streams.  The economic viability of recycling generally will be improved by the application of high standards to waste disposal activities in the context of the licensing system operated by the agency under the Waste Management (Licensing) Regulations, 1997.</P>
      <P>The various recycling grant schemes operated by my Department since 1989 have contributed significantly to the substantial expansion of recycling activities over the period.  Financial assistance is available under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-9 for the provision of recycling infrastructure by local authorities and the private sector and for waste management strategy studies by regional and local authorities to provide a co-ordinated framework for the development of waste management, including recycling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Departments must take appropriate steps in relation to their own activities.  The Green Government Guide published by my Department encourages Departments to use products made from recycled materials and to recycle waste. These and other appropriate national measures will be pursued by my Department to support <Col N="672" /> recycling in the context of the further implementation of national strategy and the Waste Management Act, 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree it is inadequate that the recycling arrangements in place are voluntary?  Will he accept that a co-ordinated national plan should be introduced to address this problem given the increase in the volumes of waste being produced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no recycling rates specified in the Waste Management Act.  The Act provides a statutory framework on a range of measures which can be taken to promote better waste management.  The only statutory targets specified to date are those specified in the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997 which were made to give effect to certain requirements of the packaging directive, including recovery rates established by the directive for packaging waste.  All other targets are non-statutory.</P>

Has a chief executive been appointed and what exactly has been achieved in the past 18 months?  Has REPAK come close to reaching its targets in any area other than glass?  Will the Minister of State agree that success in recycling depends on the availability of recycling facilities for local authorities, companies and individuals?  Considerable investment is required by local authorities to provide a segregated waste collection service and receiving parks for recyclable goods and to subsidise those involved in recycling.  Is the Minister of State in a position to fund this?  Does he believe there is a conflict between value for money audits which is what the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is asking for, and environmental audits which appears to be the road we should take?  Does he recognise there is a definite short-term cost in pursuing sustainable practices in waste management and that local authorities which pursue such practices should not be penalised in terms of the amount they may spend?  They may appear to be faring badly when compared with other local authorities which are making no effort to promote recycling.</P>

A target recycling rate of 27 per cent of packaging waste was set and is to be achieved in a five-year period. The target was accepted by the Minister as it exceeds the target set by the EU Packaging Directive.  REPAK has been established on a voluntary basis by industry.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the commitment in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, I have initiated a comprehensive review of current planning legislation. My Department has invited submissions from the general public in addition to a wide range of representative bodies with an interest in the planning system.  All local authorities and Government Departments have also been invited to make submissions.  Following a review of the submissions I intend to hold a national convention to discuss the main issues arising therefrom and any views received thereon.  I will then formulate my proposals for change which should result in a comprehensive planning Bill next year.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to use the review of the planning process and the resulting legislation to increase public participation in the preparation of development plans.  I will be seeking to make the review of the development plans as inclusive a process as possible in line with the Government's commitment to restoring real decision-making and power to local authorities and people at local level.</P>
      <P>As I said in this House last week, the recommendations of the tribunal of inquiry into certain planning matters will also be taken into account in preparing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, my Department has been engaged in a process of preparing guidelines on land use policy issues for the guidance of local planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála and other interested parties.  As part of that process, my Department is preparing draft consultation guidelines on the scope and content of development plans which will provide, <i>inter alia,</i> a better framework for zoning policy.  I have no proposals at present to issue separate advice on rezoning. <Col N="677" /> The Government is also committed to introducing strategic regional planning guidelines, initially in the greater Dublin area, whereby local authorities will be obliged to have regard to an overall planning framework for their regions. Preparations have already been put in hand for the drawing up of these guidelines for the Dublin area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Since local planning and development is probably one of the most contentious issues I welcome the Minister's action in initiating this review and look forward to progress being made.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might be allowed to express a compliment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, it is good news but there is always the danger that a review will hold up progress.  Would the Minister be more precise in his response?  While none of us had expected that proposals would be implemented this year, to say they will be implemented next year is too vague.  Since the Minister must have some timeframe in mind &mdash; I do not believe it is totally open ended &mdash; can he indicate when precisely in 1998 he is likely to announce their implementation and say when the national convention will be held?</P>
      <P>When will the strategic regional planning guidelines to which he referred be issued to local authorities, many of whom are in a certain amount of turmoil <i>vis-à-vis</i> planning, particularly in the greater Dublin area, and require information and guidance on decisions being taken?</P>
      <P>The last part of my question refers to a very important item in the programme for Government. With the rate of rejection of items within that programme, I am not sure whether we are to take this document seriously.  Will the Minister state how quickly he intends providing qualified planners at local authority level which is not dependent on that review?  It is most important to those local authorities struggling to deal with challenges and on the part of the Minister himself. Does he intend to provide greater resources and planning staff expeditiously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for her favourable welcome of this move before using the word &ldquo;but&rdquo;.  While understanding a certain amount of impatience on the part of Members on all sides of the House and within local authorities with regard to the planning process and its review, my specific aim, although probably giving hostages to fortune &mdash; the closing date for submissions to the planning review was Friday last, 10 October &mdash; is to be as open and flexible as possible.  If anybody has a major submission to make over the next couple of weeks they can be assured it will not be rejected.  Consideration has been ongoing since submissions were first <Col N="678" /> received.  That process will continue and it is hoped the convention will take place before the end of next month.  That will allow us complete the review early in 1998, following which I will be in a position to begin drafting the legislation.  If we can get through that process, we should be able to complete a major planning Bill by the summer recess.</P>
      <P>On land use planning guidelines, the Deputy will be aware the Department has been working on a series of guidelines on land use policy over the past two years.  During the term of the previous Government, guidelines were issued on telecommunications antennae and support structures and on wind farm developments.  Draft consultation guidelines have been published in relation to forestry; the final form of those will be published shortly.  Further commitments have been made to publish guidelines on amenity landscapes, the scope and content of development plans and archaeology.  Those guidelines are in the pipeline but if people believe there is a need for additional guidelines, I am prepared to listen to suggestions.</P>
      <P>Although it was not in the specific question, the Deputy is correct in highlighting one of the commitments in the programme for Government, namely, the provision of more qualified planners at local authority level.  The two professional bodies representing planners, the RTPI and the IPI, have expressed concern about the low number of professionally qualified planners employed in local authority planning.  My Department has advised both bodies that the matter should be raised more appropriately with the Local Government Management Services Board.  We have arranged an introduction to the board for these two bodies and I believe the IPI has made arrangements to meet the board to discuss the matter.  This is an issue to which I will give my attention because it is important that we have suitably qualified planners in each local authority area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware the development plan process has already begun in the Dublin area.  I welcome the Minister's comments on the need for new planning legislation and I am mindful that he intends to introduce legislation next year.  Is that not ridiculous given that development plans will either have been agreed or will be in the final stages of agreement by that time?  This legislation will be put on the Statute Book but it will not have any effect for a five year period.  Will the Minister address that point?  On the new strategic planning guidelines there is a considered view among the seven local authorities that make up the greater Dublin region, if one includes Wicklow, Meath and Kildare, that the level of local representation on this super body is abysmally low.  I advise the Minister to reconsider the representation of local authorities on this body.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to receive the benefit of anybody's wisdom.  If we did a little more listening rather than talking in this House we might learn something.  I take the Deputy's point but as he is well aware the process of development is ongoing with a five year roll-over period.  It would not be in anyone's interest for me to tell local authorities to put a halt to the process of development plans as we could end up with a situation similar to that in County Kildare or in north County Dublin where the revision did not take place within the statutory five-year period. This is the reason I am not going to tell them to stop everything.  However, if there are major implications in the planning review document then I hope they will take these on board for subsequent development plans or, if necessary, amend their plans accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not putting them in limbo as under their present statutory authority they can draft their development plans, which they should do.  When they revise the development plans in four or five years the new planning regime and laws will be in place and I would expect them to abide by those.</P>
      <P>On elected members, the Deputy will be pleased to know that I listened to representations made by Deputies and councillors who are members of my party about the composition of this body and the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area.  I recently wrote to the chairpersons of the local authorities outlining a new proposal which will give them more direct access to the consultants, which will be helpful to them.  I fully accept the Deputy's point about the importance of the local public representative having a greater input.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about what might happen during the next five years.  Will the Minister agree that like me he had occasion to correspond with Kildare County Council regarding its development plan?  If that plan is adopted it will govern development policy and perhaps destroy the character of that county in a way which will not be redeemable in five years.  Does the Minister propose in the interim to give guidelines to local authorities to enable a development plan to be drawn up which would at least predict the thought processes which will come in under the new development plan?</P>

That is best decided locally by public representatives and planners together, as they do efficiently and well in County Meath and other counties.  The preliminary examination of zoned lands showed that in the greater Dublin area sufficient land has been zoned to allow for a population increase of about 65,000.  The problem may not be zoning but servicing and we will look at that area.  Another factor is the availability of zoned land for sale and housing and we will examine that also.  I do not intend to direct any local authorities in regard to individual zonings as they are, with their professional planners, in the best position to decide that themselves.</P>

These limits have not been increased for some time and I agree they are outside the reach of many who would normally have availed of the schemes.  I expect to be in a position to have a favourable decision from the Minister for Finance on my recommendations in the near future.  In saying that, the Deputy should see that I accept part of his argument that these limits were becoming too restrictive and many people were unable to avail of the schemes because the limits had not been increased, and that I have already moved on the matter.</P>

They were a source of funding for many people down through the years but in recent times they were not taken up because of the limits which applied.  Most local authorities actively discourage people from applying for council SDA loans.  The shared ownership scheme was a follow up to housing finance agency loans, which are still being paid by a number of people.  That scheme was not a great success, perhaps because of the economic circumstances at that time whereby people paid up to 20 per cent of their income and there were difficulties with negative equity.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Will the Minister state the timescale for the review and his decision in the matter?  Is he aware of the huge urgency of the housing situation?  Because of the pathetic amount of money made available by central Government to local authorities, there is huge pressure on housing lists.  Fingal County Council only receives money for 85 houses but there are 1,300 families on the list.  Does he know that there is enormous suffering in many families as a result of the shortage and the scandalous rise in house prices in the last two years is putting homes and the basic right of shelter out of the reach of more people?

In regard to housing, the Government is very conscious of the need to ensure there is good housing output, particularly social housing, at affordable prices in order to meet the substantial demand.  In fairness to the last Government, in its years in office housing output increased substantially and I hope to see a continuation of that increase.  Public representatives are conscious of the pressures on people who do not have satisfactory homes in which to rear their families.  All of us who attend weekly clinics are conscious of the demands.  With special responsibility for housing, I hope to make a contribution to alleviate housing needs.  I will bring this matter to the attention of my colleagues in Government and I hope housing output, which has been buoyant, will be increased, particularly in the social housing area.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most anxious to ensure the register of electors is prepared to the highest standards of accuracy.  I recognise that errors and omissions occur.  Changes made by my predecessor in the Electoral Act, 1997, will hopefully reduce the extent of errors and omissions.  The provision for the preparation and publication of a supplement to the register under the Electoral Act, 1992, and the widening of the eligibility <Col N="685" /> grounds for making application for inclusion in the supplements introduced by the Electoral Act, 1997, bring more flexibility to persons wishing to be entered in the register.  It means that a person may now apply to have his or her name added to the register during the lifetime of that register and vote at any poll for which he or she would be entitled to vote at on the same basis as if he or she were included in the register in the first instance.  Under this arrangement, there is in place a mechanism for rectifying omissions from the register at any time during the currency of the register.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I instructed registration authorities to write to individual electors where necessary when it is proposed to delete their names from the draft register.  This measure should assist in avoiding the unintentional deletion of names from the draft register.  The existing arrangements whereby some city corporations employ enumerators to carry out house-to-house inquiries for the purposes of compiling the draft register of electors and other registration authorities utilise the services and local knowledge of their revenue collectors and other staff for this purpose are operating satisfactorily and I see no reason at present to change these arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The final remarks of the Minister are totally out of order.  There are huge discrepancies on the register.  Is the Minister aware, from the most recent election, of the alarming lack of professionalism in compiling the register? Because the election was so drawn out on that occasion one could do a tally of who was present. In my constituency the number of mistakes was not less than 2,000 and could have been as high as 4,000 or 5,000, with whole families missing from the register.  The hit and miss system in operation at present is not good enough.</P>
      <P>I feel sorry for anybody who might lose an election by a couple of hundred or a couple of dozen votes.  If the register was compiled as it should be such people might not lose an election.  I appreciate many improvements have been made such as allowing one's name to be added to the register up to two weeks before an election, but the compilation of the register is still grossly inefficient. There are excellent enumerators who do their job properly, but many are inefficient and serious mistakes are made, causing people to lose elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to minimise the difficulties that arise in various constituencies with the register of electors.  There is no doubt mistakes are made.  I would like to see the register compiled as efficiently and effectively as possible. People had an opportunity to register up to two weeks before the last general election and, statistically, the margin of error throughout the country was about 1.2 per cent.  From anecdotal experience, I would have imagined it would have been much higher.  I take the Deputy's point and, speaking on a personal basis, I would like to see <Col N="686" /> changes in the compilation of the electoral register. I do not know whether we need to continue the system where a new register is compiled every year.  In an age of computerisation it should be possible to put an electoral register on computer and add to or delete from that.  I will pursue that matter with the Computer Services Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept there may be a need from time to time for a dry run mail-out of registration cards to establish the position on the ground?  There are cases where people have been registered under the same address in two polling stations.  On the day of an election they go in good faith to the wrong polling station and are unable to vote.  The principle of a dry run would be useful and, although a possible inconvenience, could pay dividends for democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am delighted to introduce the Taxes Consolidation Bill.  The Bill consolidates the law relating to income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  Thirty years on, this Bill represents the first consolidation of the relevant tax law that has taken place since 1967.  Therefore, it is something of a watershed in tax administration.  I do not intend to go through the Bill in minute detail but would like to deal with the background to the project and the general layout and construction of the Bill.  I know Deputies opposite will agree as we were involved in the previous Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs while dealing with this Bill.  I will be happy to deal with any matter raised.  The proposed way forward is as I have outlined.</P>
      <P>Before turning to the background to this Bill, I would like to bring the House up-to-date on economic and fiscal developments in the current year and the prospects for the period immediately ahead since it is perhaps the truest reflection of whether taxation and general budgetary policies are working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An efficient and effective tax system plays a crucial role in the overall economy and in the progress we have been making.  The Irish economy has performed exceptionally well in recent years, with average growth exceeding both the EU and OECD averages.  At the same time, employment growth has been record breaking, averaging 4 per cent per annum, and unemployment has plummeted to below the European <Col N="694" /> average.  Despite the record levels of growth and falling unemployment, price stability has been maintained with moderate inflation and a modest surplus on the balance of payments current account.  This year is forecast to be another good year, with GNP increasing by around 7 per cent. Further employment growth of over 50,000 is expected and price stability should be maintained. Irish inflation is the lowest in the Europe Union as measured on a harmonised basis.</P>
    <P>At the time of the January budget, tax revenue was expected to increase by 6 per cent and the general Government deficit target was for under 1.5 per cent.  At this stage, a small surplus on the GGD is expected with tax revenue increasing by over 10 per cent.  However, the Government has warned against unrealistic expectations which could be generated by the economy's success.  The Government intends to use this opportunity to achieve a balanced budget over the economic cycle by running budget surpluses when possible.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised that overseas investment has made an enormous contribution to Ireland's employment growth and economic prosperity. Successive Governments have facilitated this by providing companies with a secure corporate tax structure over a long-term investment horizon. Equally of late, there has been growing recognition of the important role played by the indigenous services sectors in generating employment and there is widespread acceptance of the need to reduce the standard rate of corporation tax for these sectors.  Considerable progress has been made on this over the past ten years.  The standard rate has been gradually reduced from 50 per cent to 36 per cent and a lower rate of 28 per cent has been introduced for the first £50,000 of annual profits with the aim of assisting SMEs in particular.</P>
    <P>However, more needs to be done and, if Ireland is to remain competitive in a changing environment, we must adapt our corporate tax system to reflect new and emerging market conditions. Much of our employment growth is being generated by the services sector and there is a general consensus that we must dispense with the increasingly outmoded difference in the treatment between manufacturing and services in so far as corporation tax is concerned.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to confirm that it is the intention of the Government to introduce a single low rate of corporation tax for trading profits with a higher rate of tax for non-trading profits. This will be phased in over the coming years to eventually replace the current regime.  The details of the new corporate tax regime will be decided on by the Government in due course.</P>
    <P>The last consolidation of tax law was the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That Act, which relates solely to income tax, is the only consolidation of tax law to have taken place since the foundation of the State.  The original Income Tax Act, 1967, contained 561 sections and 19 Schedules.  Since its enactment, the income tax code has been amended annually and, on occasion, sometimes <Col N="695" /> twice or three times a year, in various Finance Acts and other fiscal legislation.  Since 1967 we have also seen the introduction of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, and the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.  On enactment, these Acts contained 51 sections and 4 Schedules and 188 sections and 5 Schedules respectively.</P>
    <P>Finance Act changes since 1976 have also seen numerous changes to the capital gains tax and corporation tax codes.  There are 40 separate Acts containing income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax law.  In addition, much of the legislation in recent years has been of a complex nature. Sometimes complexity is inevitable in order to focus a tax measure and to prevent avoidance attempts.  However, the cumulative effect of this is both a very heavy volume and a disjointed approach in the legislation governing our direct tax code.</P>
    <P>The need for a consolidation of income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax law has been recognised for many years.  Various Parliamentary Questions on the subject, from both sides of the House, have been put to successive Ministers for Finance.  As far back as 1985, the Commission on Taxation observed that tax legislation is unique in its frequency.  No other areas of law require the same degree of annual change and the commission recommended that consolidation of tax legislation should take place at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>Other bodies, such as the Institute of Taxation and the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, have sought the consolidation of tax law, both informally in meetings with staff of the Revenue Commissioners, and formally in pre-budget submissions.  In addition, the Tax Administration Liaison Committee which comprises representatives from the Revenue Commissioners, the Institute of Taxation, the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies and the Incorporated Law Society, is on record as wholly endorsing the consolidation of tax law.</P>
    <P>Without doubt, the difficulties of interpretation and administration of the tax code are compounded by the absence of consolidation.  This is a serious hindrance to the improvement in tax administration sought by Government and the Revenue Commissioners.  While there had been a willingness in principle to proceed with consolidation, a number of considerations arose, specifically as regards timing and the resources required.  On timing, it was felt that consolidation should only take place when the basic shape of the tax system was in a relatively settled state. With the introduction of self assessment from 1988 onwards it was felt that this condition was met.  The second constraint, staffing resources, continued to apply for some time, given the relatively small number of specialist drafting staff available in the Revenue Commissioners and the heavy annual demands from the Finance Bill and other fiscal legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> The previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, announced in his Budget Statement in February 1995:</P>
    <P>In pursuit of the simplification and streamlining of tax administration and legislation, I am going to consolidate the existing legislation dealing with income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, he agreed to a proposal by the Revenue Commissioners that, to facilitate the work without interfering with other ongoing activities, a small team comprising staff from the Revenue Commissioners and the private sector should be put together for this purpose.  The team would include a private sector consultant with access to the latest technology.  This represented a new departure and one fully in keeping with the approach adopted under the strategic management initiative for the modernisation of the public service.  The entire process was carefully designed to ensure the Bill would be an accurate consolidation of existing law and the fullest consultation of interested parties would take place.</P>
    <P>As part of this process a distinguished panel of expert referees comprising notable tax practitioners from the private sector and Revenue officials was established.  A draftsman from the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office was assigned full-time to the preparation of the Bill.  On a sad note, I have learned that the draftsman who dealt with the Bill over the last two years had a heart attack recently and is seriously ill.  I know Members will join me in wishing him a full and speedy recovery.</P>
    <P>Work on the preparation of the Bill began in June 1995.  In the first instance, the core project team of expert Revenue officials and a private sector consultant prepared initial drafts of various Parts of the Bill working in blocks at a time. These blocks of draft legislation were then screened by the panel of referees.  The refined blocks of text were in turn referred to the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office for consideration by the draftsman.</P>
    <P>Where the ongoing work of the team produced proposals for desirable changes in the law, whether to simplify the tax system or to facilitate a more orderly consolidation, these had to be processed separately so as not to detract from the consolidation status of the final Bill, that is, its status as a Bill simply consolidating rather than changing the law.  A substantial number of such proposals was processed as pre-consolidation measures.  They were enacted into law in the 1996 and 1997 Finance Acts to allow their incorporation into the final product.</P>
    <P>At all stages of the project, steps were taken to ensure Members of the House and the various interest groups were kept informed of developments. The Revenue Commissioners briefed the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on the work of the project to help prepare the way for discussion of the legislation by the Oireachtas.  I was on that committee when in <Col N="697" /> Opposition and I know Members found it extremely beneficial in understanding the process being undertaken.  The Commissioners also hosted a major work-in-progress seminar on the project last February at which representatives from various professional bodies and individual accountancy firms were present.</P>
    <P>In April of this year a White Paper entitled <i>Government Proposals for a Taxes Consolidation Bill, 1997, to Consolidate Income Tax, Corporation Tax and Capital Gains Tax Law</i> was published by the previous Government.  The White Paper contained a full draft of the consolidated legislation up to and including the measures contained in the Finance Bill, 1997, as initiated.  Publication of the legislation in draft form was designed to allow as much time as possible for tax practitioners and others to examine and familiarise themselves with the layout and content of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the White Paper the draft proposals have been updated to take account of the changes made to the 1997 Finance Bill during its passage through the Oireachtas. Having taken these changes on board the entire Bill was reconsidered by the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General duly certified it as a consolidation of existing law.</P>
    <P>The completed product of the Taxes Consolidation Bill, 1997, is now before us.  Since the last consolidation in 1967 the legislation governing income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax had grown to more than 2,000 separate sections and some 50 related Schedules.  The Taxes Consolidation Bill has succeeded in reducing this volume of legislation to 1,104 sections and 32 Schedules put together in a coherent and logical manner.  This is a major achievement in a short time and in the course of the rigorous process I have outlined.  I remember the discussions that took place as we wondered how many years the process might take or whether it might ever be completed.  Every Member will wish to congratulate those involved in introducing this legislation ahead of schedule and in a welcome format.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go through the Bill section by section.  However, I draw the attention of Deputies to the document entitled <i>Outline of Provisions</i> published with the Bill.  This very useful outline gives a brief description of each of the sections.</P>
    <P>Without getting into the detail of the sections, I will comment in general on the structure of the Bill.  This is the largest single Bill to come before the House.  Despite its size &mdash; and let us not forget that it has succeeded in reducing by one half the quantum of legislation involved &mdash; the Bill is set out in a coherent and logical format which is designed to be user friendly.  Its structure is based upon the principle that the generally applicable tax provisions should appear at the outset and be followed by more specialist provisions, while the administration and management provisions appear later in the Bill.  Finally, the transitional and commencement provisions necessary to <Col N="698" /> ensure a seamless transition from the old to the new law are set out at the end of the Bill.</P>
    <P>While the legislation is divided into 1,104 sections comprises 49 Parts dealing with different aspects of the income tax, corporation and capital gains tax codes a number of novel features are introduced to facilitate the reader and to simplify the language and presentation.  These features include the concept of superheadings or families of related issues; the practice of including definitions in all cases at the beginning of sections and the elimination of archaic language and of the old-fashioned and complex device of &ldquo;provisos&rdquo; to qualify the meaning of a section, sometimes to change the meaning completely.  The drafting approach is thus self-contained, coherent and direct.</P>
    <P>There are six superheadings in all: first, the Interpretation and Basic Charging Provisions in Parts 1 to 2; second, Income Tax and Corporation Tax The Main Provisions in Parts 3 to 18; third, the Taxation of Chargeable Gains in Parts l9 to 21; fourth, Transactions in Land in Part 22; fifth, Other Special Provisions in Parts 23 to 36; and finally, the Management Provisions in Parts 37 to 47.  The Interpretation and Basic Charging Provisions deal with definitions and various construction and interpretation rules.  They set out the provisions which give rise to the charges to income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>The Main Provisions contain the principal rules relating to the computation of income tax and corporation tax liabilities.  These include such matters as the schedular system of taxation, for example, Schedule D for self-employed taxpayers; the treatment of distributions; exemptions from the charge to tax; the treatment of interest and losses; capital allowances; the urban renewal reliefs; the 10 per cent scheme of corporation tax; personal allowances and the business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>All the provisions relating to the specialist areas of capital gains tax and tax on land dealings are encompassed by the superheadings &ldquo;Taxation of Chargeable Gains&rdquo; and &ldquo;Transactions in Land&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Other Special Provisions cover matters such as farming and market gardening, mining and petroleum taxation, the taxation of life assurance companies, unit trusts and pension funds and double taxation relief.</P>
    <P>The Management Provisions address the various administrative provisions in the tax code including returns, assessment and appeals, self assessment, penalties, Revenue's powers of investigation and Revenue offences.</P>
    <P>Finally, Parts 48 and 49 address those matters which do not fit neatly elsewhere into the structure and also deal with commencement, repeals and certain transitional provisions.</P>
    <P>The various Parts of the Bill are broken down into chapters and sections.  For example, Part 10 which deals with tax reliefs for the regeneration and renewal of certain areas is broken down into six chapters covering the schemes of relief applying <Col N="699" /> in the various areas, namely the Custom House Docks area, chapter 1; the Temple Bar area, chapter 2; designated areas and designated street and enterprise areas, chapter 3; qualifying resort areas, chapter 4; designated islands, chapter 5; and the Dublin Docklands Area, chapter 6. A similar pattern is followed in Part 26 which deals with life assurance companies and is divided into three chapters covering general provisions in chapter 1, special investment policies in chapter 2 and provisions applying to overseas life assurance companies in chapter 3.</P>
    <P>To further facilitate the understanding of the new legislation and in particular its relationship with the old, statutory derivations are provided in the margin opposite each section.  These derivations make it possible to identify the new provisions with their corresponding legislation in the old codes.  This provision will be extremely helpful when working from the new legislation to the old and I am sure it will be welcomed by all.</P>
    <P>The separate memorandum published with the Bill sets out in chronological order the various sections of the old legislation and the location of their consolidated counterparts in the Bill.  If a provision has not been re-enacted in the Consolidation Bill, an explanation will be found in the remarks column of the memorandum.  Generally, the reason will be because the provision is spent or has been repealed in earlier law.</P>
    <P>The objective in compiling the structure and the derivations is to enable the reader to &ldquo;drill down&rdquo; in a logical and accessible way to find the legislation in which he or she is interested.  As the relevant provisions will be complete and locatable in one place, considerable saving should be made on time required for research and confirmation work.</P>
    <P>Consolidation of legislation is consistent with the principles of good quality regulation, in particular the need to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of legislation formulated under the Strategic Management Initiative and &ldquo;Delivering Better Government&rdquo;.  One of the main benefits of consolidation will be to reduce the volume of the direct tax legislation by almost one half.  There will be many other benefits.  All direct tax legislation will be available in a single up-to-date Act, in a coherent, orderly and more simplified format and the legislation will be more accessible and user friendly to the business community, tax practitioners, tax administrators and members of the Oireachtas.  This will be particularly advantageous for smaller firms of tax practitioners and smaller businesses.  As part of the consolidation process a significant amount of deadwood and obsolete material has been eliminated from the tax code and there has been considerable simplification in content.  All future changes to the taxes involved should be capable of being slotted into the Consolidated Act by amendment.  Our tax legislation will be more coherent to foreign investors and their advisers <Col N="700" /> and the task of future simplification of the tax system will be facilitated.</P>
    <P>There has already been a general welcome for the Consolidation Bill.  I have no doubt the Members opposite will endorse that welcome. Based on my experience I know the enactment of the Taxes Consolidation Bill, 1997, will bring many benefits to the business community, tax practitioners and administrators, legislators and, less directly, to the public generally.  It will transform the way in which accountants, tax practitioners and the legal profession deal with their client's tax affairs, allowing them to ensure the services they offer are efficient and cost effective. It will also have a significant impact on the young people who are training in these professions, making their research tasks much simpler.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to acknowledge the debt the consolidation project owes the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  It was Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Finance, who initiated the project in 1995 and made available the resources necessary for its successful completion.  He took a keen interest in all stages of the project and provided the necessary drive to ensure its progress. We were happy to support the project while in Opposition and to continue the drive to complete the work since returning to Government. The former Minister helped us while in Government in providing any information required or enabling us to meet officials.  He wanted this project to be completed in time and he was lucky to have a quality team of public service and private sector employees to help complete this project in less than two years, which was an outstanding achievement.</P>
    <P>I and the Government appreciate the tremendous work of all involved in the project, the staff of the Revenue Commissioners and the parliamentary draftsman's office and the personnel from the private sector.  It is truly remarkable that such a huge task has been completed in such a short time and in a most efficient and professional manner.  What is most pleasing is that it was very much a joint venture between the public and private sectors and given the success of the project, perhaps this model can be used when other major projects are being undertaken in the future.</P>
    <P>This is a significant moment as it illustrates we can bring the best and the brightest employees of the public sector together with those in the private sector who seem to think at times that they possess all the skills, which is not the case. This Bill proves that a combination of both sides can get remarkably efficient work done in an extraordinary short period.  I thank all those involved.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to have the Taxes Consolidation Bill made available in CD-ROM format once the Bill is enacted.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners will prepare more detailed notes for guidance on the legislation and will publish these as soon as possible.  As for the timetable for passage of the Bill, it is proposed that the Bill <Col N="701" /> be referred to the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills for consideration on 23 and 24 October.  It is my intention that Report and Final Stages of the Bill be taken in this House on 4 November.</P>
    <P>A number of motions will be included on the Order Papers of both Houses to comply with the various rules and procedures set out in Standing Orders to achieve the timely passage of the Bill. The motions are required to establish the Standing Joint Committee, to facilitate the taking of Committee, Report and Fifth Stages and to shorten the minimum time periods allowed for in Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are also committed to enlisting the techniques and technology used in this project, and the team approach, to undertake consolidation of other areas of tax law. They will make proposals shortly.  I am anxious that we make progress in consolidating capital taxation legislation and further down the line, the complex area of VAT law.  I know the House will support such an initiative.  The State has built up a resource and an expertise which should be put to further use.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to the co-operation of the House in its speedy enactment.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for a clear explanation of the purposes and content of the Bill.  I join him in thanking those involved in bringing it to this stage, particularly Deputy Quinn who performed a thankless task.  There is no great tranche of votes available to a Minister who decides to consolidate legislation.  This mammoth task had not been undertaken since Mr. Haughey's time in 1967.  The House is notorious for passing large Finance Acts and it had become difficult, even for the most professional of practitioners, to find their way, in the drilling down process which the Minister of State described, to the information they required and to be certain of the result.</P>
      <P>Consolidation was necessary and I compliment Deputy Quinn for undertaking the task in the first instance and resourcing those who did the work.  I also thank the former Attorney General, Mr. Gleeson.  There have always been blockages in the parliamentary draftsman's office which prevented consolidation legislation to a large degree because other legislation took priority. Mr. Gleeson geared up the office to a point where items beyond the day to day workings of Government and the Parliament could be dealt with.  I am glad resources were provided for the Bill.  I was sad to learn that the draftsman who worked so hard on it is ill.  We join in the Minister of State's good wishes to him and hope he has a speedy recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was novel that outside professional expertise using the best technology available was used and that approach may be a way forward for the future.  Combining people from the State sector <Col N="702" /> with outside expertise and providing them with adequate resources can produce good results.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a fine piece of work.  It has been certified by the Attorney General that it contains no new elements of law which have not been passed by the Oireachtas but is simply a consolidation of existing legislation.  I presume the certification also guarantees that everything which the Oireachtas has passed is contained in the Bill. Therefore, it is not just a question of not having any extra elements of legislation unscrutinised by the House but of consolidating the totality of legislation over 30 years.  It appears at first glance that it is a competent piece of work which will be of benefit to people in business, legislators and the public.  Although its more arcane provisions will still need to be brokered to the public by legislators or practitioners, it is readily accessible to an intelligent reader.  The intention to make it available on CD ROM is of benefit and I am pleased with the Minister of State's commitment in that regard.</P>
    <P>My remarks will follow the pattern of those of the Minister of State, in that he dealt with the economy in general and elements of corporation tax before discussing the Bill.  It would be foolish not to acknowledge the marvellous legacy of the rainbow Government, on which the Minister of State remarked.  The economy has had another good year in 1997.  GNP has increased by over 7 per cent, there has been further growth in employment of 50,000, price stability has been maintained and inflation is the lowest in Europe when measured on a harmonised basis.  At the time of the budget in January it was expected that tax revenue would increase by 6 per cent and that the general Government deficit would be under 1.5 per cent.  We know now that tax revenue is increasing by about 10 per cent and the Government will be running a small surplus at the end of the year.  What a marvellous Government it was.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State would have a great future in the private sector if ever he had an accident in politics because by the time he has <Col N="703" /> taken the Bill through Committee Stage he will be the person with the greatest familiarity with tax law for the last 30 years.  He may need it because by the time Committee Stage is complete he will not have time for anything else given the timetable outlined for the next three or four weeks.</P>
      <P>With regard to the legacy of the previous Government I would like to raise an issue with the Minister of State.  At the time of the budget it was expected that tax revenue would increase by 6 per cent.  From the third quarter figures it appears that it may increase by 10 per cent.  In round terms, about £700 million will accrue to the Exchequer in excess of what was budgeted for last January.  That is a large amount of money.  In the course of 1997 taxpayers will pay £700 million beyond that which the Government of the day and the House in voting on the budget intended them to pay.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years I have noticed that forecasting in the Department of Finance is quite soft and tax revenues have increased beyond the forecasts.  It is not a science but rather an imprecise art.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether it is the case that the Department got it wrong this year, as in previous years, or is it that they erred on the side of prudence?  It is important to have prudent forecasting on which politicians may base policies.  Is it that the Department thought that politicians were spendthrift in nature and there needed to be an underestimation to keep them in line?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it simply prudent forecasting or getting the result wrong to a significant degree, having applied the best information available in an imprecise art?  Is there an element of deliberate underestimation?  If so, it is a serious issue for policy makers, for the House and, more so, for the taxpayer.  The payment of taxes in a democracy must be premised on the willingness of the taxpayer to continue to pay, otherwise the edifice collapses.  This year taxpayers will pay approximately £700 million more than was intended by the policy makers who put the budget together and by the House which voted for the budget.  It is a serious issue to which we should return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also puts the promises of tax concessions to taxpayers and demands by various sectors in context. What is so marvellous about the prospect of tax cuts of £500 million if taxpayers have paid £700 million in the course of the year beyond what the Government of the day intended?  Is there not a case to be made for a primary clause in tax law which would allow taxpayers to get back what was not intended to be taken from them as a matter of course?  I advise the Government not to underestimate the expectations of taxpayers, in particular those of PAYE taxpayers. They have already discounted £500 million pounds and if there is to be a penny less than <Col N="704" /> that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, need not come to the House on 3 December. That is the level of expectation and it is reasonable because of what has happened since the budget.</P>
    <P>I do not intend adverse reflections on the Department officials.  When I was a Minister I had the utmost respect for the expertise in the Department of Finance.  We are fortunate to have such dedicated civil servants.  There is a core of civil servants in the Department of Finance whose equals are not to be found in Europe.  I admire them greatly for their dedication.  I am raising a serious policy issue here and I would like to receive a serious answer to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State in his speech decided it would be prudent to comment on corporation tax. I understand the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste are in Brussels negotiating or, to put it more bluntly, trying to undo the damage done by the Fianna Fáil/ PD commitment to reduce corporation tax to 10 per cent for manufacturing industry and financial services.</P>
    <P>Former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, said that when an election was over he believed all election promises were null and void.  I am very glad to see the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is clearly in the Lemass tradition, given the alacrity with which he has dumped the Fianna Fáil/PD election promise to reduce the rate of corporation tax for manufacturing and the financial services to 10 per cent.  That promise was made by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in the full knowledge that it could not be implemented.  It was a spurious promise; anybody familiar with what was going on in Brussels in June knew it would be impossible for a Government to deliver on a commitment to reduce the rate to 10 per cent.  The Minister for Finance was well aware of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Government are guilty of a far more serious offence than breaking an election promise.  The previous Government had decided to apply corporation tax at 12.5 per cent after the year 2010.  It informed the European Commission of this and the Commission did not demur.  The Minister has now reopened the issue at a time when other member states and many of Commissioner Monti's advisers are hostile towards Ireland's corporate tax regime.  He did this less than a week after informing the Dáil during Question Time that the Government had made no decision on corporation tax and would not make any announcement on it until budget day.  In the course of answering finance questions, the Minister floundered from one topic to another in his very ambiguous replies and he now appears to have transferred his floundering to Brussels.  He has put the primary incentive for attracting investment to Ireland at risk by the manner in which he has handled events and is now in a very difficult situation.  Had he stuck to the decision of the previous Government the matter would have been closed.  By introducing the element of 10 per <Col N="705" /> cent, the Minister reopened the matter and the mood has changed in Brussels.</P>
    <P>I advise the Minister to look at today's <i>Financial Times</i>&mdash; a newspaper which is usually fairly well informed &mdash; in which there is a suggestion that, as recently as last week, officials advising the Commission were prepared to settle for 13 per cent in respect of corporate tax in Ireland thereby raising the figure a little from 12.5 to 13 per cent. My understanding is that they will not settle at 13 per cent now as sentiment in France and Germany has hardened, as has sentiment in the Commission. The Minister for Finance has been particularly foolish; the way things stand at the moment, he will be lucky to get out of this at 15 per cent.  I wish him and the Tánaiste well in their negotiations in Brussels.</P>
    <P>Former Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, acting on the instructions of the Government, went to Brussels after the decision on corporate tax was taken and informed the Commission of it; the Commission did not demur.  The regime would be introduced progressively over a number of years and we would have had two different tax rates along the lines indicated by the Minister of State in his speech.  The lower rate for manufacturing industry and financial services would have been pegged at 12.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>By reopening this issue, the Minister has been extremely foolish and has made life very difficult for himself.  I wish him well and hope he can settle quickly at the 12.5 per cent decided on by the previous Government and proceed with the detailed proposals for the December budget.  Our corporation tax regime is essential to the country's future economic development.  It cannot be cut off now if we are to sustain the growth, the creation of in excess of 50,000 jobs this year and the low inflation rates which the Minister lauds; all the good news of our economy can be related to the inward flow of investment.  That inward flow will stop for the manufacturing and service industries and for job creation unless we can give certainty to potential investors about the tax regime under which they will live if they invest in Ireland.  That is a vitally important point and the Minister for Finance has bungled seriously.  He bungled after receiving a great deal of advice here last Wednesday when he was told that he was opening a dangerous door.  He was ambiguous and floundering and could not give us a straight answer.  When he told us the Government had not decided on the matter I asked him if he would make a preliminary statement to set jangling nerves at rest.  He said there was no need for such a statement as nothing would be announced on the matter until 3 December.  Within six days of that statement, the Minister is in Brussels trying to pull irons out of the fire which he himself pitched in.  That is extraordinarily imprudent and damaging and when the Minister returns I expect him to explain the position here in this House.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the only element of the speech &mdash; outside of the statement of intent contained on corporation tax &mdash; where there is any development <Col N="706" /> of policy where the Minister said the Government intends to use this opportunity to achieve a balanced budget over the economic cycle by running budget surpluses when possible. I agree with its general tenet.  One does not need to be a financial expert or a leading economist to understand it.  One need only have a knowledge of the Old Testament to understand the position being outlined here.  If there are seven years of plenty, the corn is stored in the barn and surpluses are run; if there are seven years of famine one draws the corn from the barn.  We have had many years of famine and it is time we had some surpluses.  That economic device is as old as the world.</P>
    <P>I find interesting the statement that this will be done over the economic cycle.  There is a developing view that we are not in an economic cycle in the traditional sense, that, as information technology impacts on the economies &mdash; particularly in what were known as the western democracies before the fall of the Berlin Wall &mdash; we are in the middle of another industrial revolution.  As well as dealing with the ups and downs of the economic and trade cycles with which we were familiar, where the good years had to balance the bad, we may be in a situation where there will be a quantum leap in the creation of wealth in the western democracies.  That will give rise to a whole new series of decisions.  We should not necessarily proceed on the basis that we will have the traditional business or economic cycle up to the millennium and beyond.  It is possible to see things differently; it is certainly possible to see them differently at a conceptual level when one looks at all the evidence.  That evidence includes the impact of information technology on the manufacturing process and the service sector, particularly the financial one, the systematic reduction of trade barriers by the great trading blocs like the European Union and the implementation of the last GATT round.  I am not saying there should be any policy change or the language should even be changed when one speaks of running surpluses to compensate for deficits in the economic cycle.  However, it is worth thinking about this from an overall perspective of where Ireland and Europe in general is going.  It is worth pausing for a moment to ask whether something new and totally different is happening.  Perhaps we should keep that in the back of our minds when we speak about running the traditional type of budget strategy up to the millennium and beyond.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has outlined very well what is in the Bill.  It contains nothing new and retains everything old.  There is neither an addition nor a subtraction to it.  We will give the Bill ready passage on Committee Stage and, while we will do our job, we will not hold up the Minister of State by unnecessarily debating issues which have been debated already.  If we want to change the tax law we will have an opportunity to do so after the budget of 3 December by making our proposals for change in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> I am interested by the manner in which the information is being made accessible.  It is encapsulated in the Minister of State's speech and in the introduction to the White Paper which says it will be possible for the individual to drill down to find the item of information required.  That is a good approach and the &ldquo;drilling down&rdquo; concept puts it very accurately.  Going through the Bill one can move from the general to the particular to see what is meant and find what one wants. The commitment by the Minister to enable us to do that by way of CD-ROM will be of great benefit in accountancy offices and businesses.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State also consider incorporating in the CD-ROM the advice and explanatory publications of the Revenue Commissioners, which he says will follow the Bill's enactment?  In addition, will he consider a second CD-ROM, while he has a group of experts in place, to enable the case law of the past 30 years to be made more accessible?  The individual could thus drill down to get at the decision which will cast further light on sections of the consolidated Act?  If that could be done the Minister of State would achieve the same level of recognition as a reformer in the tax area as the former Minister, Deputy Quinn will achieve as a result of all the work he put into consolidating this legislation.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for his courtesy and for the manner in which he explained the Bill.  We will support it on Second Stage and do not envisage any difficulty on Committee Stage. We envisage providing a ready passage for the Bill in accordance with the timetable laid down by the Minister of State and his officials after consultation with our Whips.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan that corporation tax is a serious matter.  In his remarks yesterday in Luxembourg and in avoiding the issue last Wednesday in this House, the Minister did serious damage to the prospects of inviting direct foreign investment in the years to come.  He has damaged the integrity of the political system &mdash; something we should not take for granted &mdash; and his reputation as an administrator and a self-styled straight talker.</P>
      <P>It is worth looking back over recent months to see exactly what happened.  Everyone in the House has been conscious for some time that the European Commission was less than enamoured with our regime of corporation tax as it applies in the financial services centre and generally.  We all knew the Commission did not like the 10 per cent rate and insisted that it be limited in application and increased over time.  The then Government, including the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, agreed some months ago to seek a rate of 12.5 per cent.  This was made known publicly at the time and we got a reasonable response from the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was in the public arena.  It was known to the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil spokespersons at that time, yet both parties in the <Col N="708" /> general election campaign felt able to commit themselves to reducing the rate to 10 per cent in the long-term.  This was always an unrealistic commitment and it was potentially dangerous in so far as it set up a possibility which the Commission had already firmly rejected.</P>
    <P>Whether they knew this or not before the election, the two parties which now form the Government must have known it by the time they came to draw up the priorities for the Programme for Government after the election, yet the same commitment appears.  Whether they knew it then, the Minister certainly knew it when he responded to questions last week.  The Minister styles himself as a straight talker, yet in his responses last week he managed not to give a serious straight answer. He gave the impression the decision has not yet been taken by Government, that the issue is still open and that Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats still want to reduce the rate to 10 per cent.  Yet, he must have known that simply will not happen and is not possible.</P>
    <P>The double talk that worked in the House last week, apparently worked during the election campaign and which governed the putting together of the Programme for Government, clearly had to be abandoned when the Minister came to the Commission's table yesterday and today.  Now we find the Minister, out of the corner of his mouth, admitting that all along 10 per cent was never really on and the previous Government's decision has not been changed.  It stands at 12.5 per cent.  Perhaps the Minister will say that it will be 10 per cent over time but we know it will not and at this late stage it is important for us to acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>It is no secret there were negotiations between the parties in Government earlier this year when we eventually agreed on the 12.5 per cent rate. We agreed that because it was important to have all party consensus on the issue.  We must present a national pitch to potential investors and that pitch should not be destroyed by a Government which does not seem to know what it is doing.</P>
    <P>The integrity of the political and electoral systems is an issue which arises here.  In the last week both Government parties have reversed at least three important decisions which only a few months ago they identified as priorities in their Programme for Government.  We were told that, as a matter of priority, the mandatory reporting of child abuse cases would be introduced.  Now, however, it will not be.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, told us so last Thursday.  We were told the Sellafield case would be fully funded, but it will now be partially funded according to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob.  This was followed by the Minister's utterances in Luxembourg yesterday and today.  None of this helps the integrity of the political system; it cheapens it. The usual excuses are not available.  This is not a case of a Government just in power making promises it suddenly finds it cannot afford.  The Government knew what the figures were and the realities.  There was no reason to make these <Col N="709" /> promises, people were deliberately misled.  Suddenly we see the consequences and, sadly, such is the standing of politicians and politics today that we will all suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important legislation.  The House will forgive me if I repeat that much of the credit for driving this initiative lies with my party colleague, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  I acknowledge the Minister of State was generous in his remarks as was Deputy Noonan.</P>
    <P>It is now nearly three years since the former Minister took the initiative to consolidate income tax, capital gains tax and corporation tax.  The work was directed by the Revenue Commissioners and I understand a number of staff have dedicated a good deal of time to the task.  I commend them for a job exceptionally well done. I also understand the Attorney General's office was involved, at least in the latter stages, and that the private sector was also centrally involved.  I will return to that matter later.</P>
    <P>The result of all this commendable and extensive effort is a comprehensive volume which will make life a great deal easier for many people.  In the first instance the two volumes will be of enormous benefit to accountants, solicitors and tax advisers generally.  As one who has practised law and may do so again I am well aware of the dangers of trying to advise a client in an area of law which sees frequent changes, and tax law is one such area.  I am only too familiar with that awful feeling when a client has left the room satisfied and one then discovers that some obscure amendment or later provision renders every advice offered a complete nonsense.  Clearly at least in this area of law those disasters will be a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>There is a broader and more fundamental issue, that is the question of access to law.  Ignorance of law is not a legal defence but, there are areas of law which are so technical and diffuse as to be almost inaccessible to most of the public. Tax law is so complicated that no normal person can possibly aspire to understand it.  The Department of Social, Family and Community Affairs has made significant progress in recent years in publicising what it does and in alerting people to their entitlements.  Perhaps we need to do the same in relation to tax.  Why is it that most of the information about tax is effectively channelled through professional advisers.  Obviously it is important that people are accurately and comprehensively advised, but it is also important that people should have a basic knowledge of their rights and duties as taxpayers and citizens.  Our democracy can only be enhanced if there is a greater diffusion of information than is currently the case.</P>
    <P>I warmly congratulate those who have been involved in the project to date, but there is scope to go a good deal further.  The first consolidation of the law relating to Customs and Excise was published in 1876, 121 years ago.  It has been amended in most subsequent Finance Bills but it <Col N="710" /> has not yet been re-consolidated.  Surely there is a case for doing so.  Likewise, VAT legislation goes back to the early 1970s and that has not been consolidated, though I welcome the Minister's commitment to do that at an early stage.  As the Minister will be aware, the position on VAT is all the more complicated because we rely on VAT law for at least some interpretation on EU Directives and that obviously adds another element to the accessibility of the legislation.  We got an interesting illustration of that during the controversy about the taxation of child care facilities earlier this year.</P>
    <P>This project was carried out as a joint venture between the private and public sectors.  Perhaps this points to the future.  Perhaps until now we have drawn too rigid a line between what we ask of civil servants and what we ask of the private sector.  I am somewhat critical of the out-sourcing to which some Departments are given in terms of appointing consultants.  The expertise in many cases exists within the Departments and I doubt the need to incur the expense of employing consultants but there are cases where there are obvious advantages of doing that, and this was clearly one of them.  There have been privately produced consolidated volumes doing the rounds for some years.  Without those consolidated volumes most private tax advisers would find life very difficult, if not impossible.  In consolidating other areas of tax law, there is obvious advantage in using that private sector expertise.</P>
    <P>The work cannot stop here.  The technology exists for rolling consolidation of the law and the way in which the law is presented.  The pattern in the past has been that we have enacted law in a piecemeal way and consolidated it from time to time when things got that little bit too confusing. The consolidated Act then becomes the new base measure and it, in turn, is amended.  Given the improvements in technology, it must surely be possible to consolidate as we go along.  Would it not be possible for the Department or the Revenue Commissioners to produce a consolidated package each year on CD-ROM or disk after the passage of each succeeding Finance Act or tax legislation?</P>
    <P>The Minister has responsibility for tax law but I hope he will forgive me if I mention some other areas of law urgently in need of consolidation, the road traffic laws, for example.  To find out the law on drink driving would require one to trawl through at least five Acts, something which most normal people cannot or will not do.  In the same way planning law is rapidly becoming more extensive and in need of consolidation.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to say a few words about tax.  A few things struck me in turning the pages of the Acts.  In many cases the statement of the charge to tax is relatively short but in all cases it is followed by an extraordinary recital of exemptions and reliefs.  Some of these could hardly be relevant any more and surely they can be excised without damaging the initial legislation. Maybe there is a more fundamental question <Col N="711" /> here, one which will appeal to the Minister's reforming zeal: is it not time to dust off the report of the Commission on Taxation?  Maybe it is time to consider whether some reliefs and exemptions are really necessary or fair.  Some of them arose at times of special need and the need has long since been catered for.  In other cases the marketplace has simply moved on.  I am thinking of the housing market as a good case in point.</P>
    <P>On tax and budgetary policy generally, and the way in which we deal with these matters in the House, I would be interested to know this year's budgetary policy.  This is the first year there will be two Budget Statements.  The previous Government stated its intention to publish the Estimates in June or July to facilitate public discussion in advance of the Budget Statement.  It was intended that the Budget Statement would be made in October or November.  The general election obviously intervened and, as a result, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has announced his intention to make the statement on 3 December.  Why has it taken so long to get to this point?  It is the middle of October and by all accounts the Estimates campaign is still continuing.  Has the Minister announced when he intends to publish the abridged Book of Estimates?</P>

      <P>The Minister is looking to spend £15 billion of taxpayers' money.  We are almost unique in Europe in that Estimates are not seriously discussed by Parliament before the money is committed.  At various times all parties in this House have agreed that more time should be allowed for debate in advance for the money being committed.  Now the Minister seems to be going in the opposite direction.  The Estimates will be dealt with in private without any public scrutiny in advance of the Budget Statement.  The time has long since passed when that sort of practice was acceptable and I am disappointed the Minister is treating the budgetary process in such a secretive way.  He said only last week that it was not his money, that it is taxpayers' money, yet decisions as to how this money is spent are made in private.  I look forward to the day when Ministers and civil servants will be required to make their pitch in public.  If we really need to spend more on a project or scheme, why not say so in public?  If we need to spend less, why not do the same?  We have made very little progress in public scrutiny of the way we go about public expenditure in recent years but what little progress there has been seems to have been reversed by the current Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> The Minister will be aware that in 1996 the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs conducted nearly two dozen pre-budget hearings in the last quarter of the year.  Like many others, I was less than fully convinced by the process and the committee later agreed a number of significant reforms.  Despite all its faults, at least the process last year shone a few rays of light into previously unlit territory.  We had the benefit of a briefing from the Secretary and the Department in early September as well as the attentions of one or more of the Minister's officials throughout. In some ways this briefing may have been a step too far in as much as the hearing was televised and lost much of the spontaneity and frankness which it might otherwise have had.  The briefing was, in effect, a public one and not a briefing offered to Members of the Dáil.  It was in stark contrast with the briefing the Minister and I had with the Governor of the Central Bank, which was more frank and conducted in private. To the best of my knowledge, the confidentiality of that briefing was respected by everybody present.  We all found it useful and it could be built on in the future.  Incidentally, I do not intend this as a criticism of the Department or the officials.  The reality is that we must expect caution if meetings are held in public.  For that reason, if for no other, we need to look again at that part of the process.</P>
    <P>I was unhappy about the use of consultants to advise the committee at that stage.  The unfortunate company which did the job last year was clearly ill at ease with the nature of the project, not least because the terms of reference were all over the place.  In the event, the company ended up in the middle of a political row &mdash; in which I was pleased to play some small part &mdash; and the report was emasculated and sidelined.  There was no need for that as all of the necessary expertise is within the Department of Finance.  I hope it will be possible to make that expertise available to the revamped committee whenever it is re-established.</P>
    <P>The Minister cited a number of figures at the beginning of his contribution to demonstrate the success of the economy under the previous Government, which I welcome.  However, as Deputy Noonan said, cautious predictions may be made from the figures before us today.  I would take a bet with the Minister that the GNP growth figure of 7 per cent may be understated.  I might even take a bet that the 10 per cent tax revenue increase is likely to be a little on the low side.  I know the current figure is about 15 per cent and there are factors which will decrease that before the end of the year.  Nonetheless, I cannot help feeling those figures are, to say the least, a little understated.</P>
    <P>One way or the other, the figures are very good.  We will almost certainly not have any Exchequer borrowing requirement this year and we will certainty have a huge current budget surplus. Growth will be at least 7 per cent, even <Col N="713" /> according to the figures supplied by the Minister today.</P>
    <P>On the other hand our health spending is still the lowest <i>per capita</i> in Europe.  We still have 26,000 or 27,000 people on hospital waiting lists. The transport infrastructure in our capital city is still among the worst in Europe, despite the money we have spent on it in recent years.  There are still outside toilets in some rural schools.</P>
    <P>For years, we have told people who depend on public services that we cannot afford anything better.  We have told the poor they have to wait until times get better.  Times are now better.  Let us reduce income tax for those who are earning money, but we must also look at our social services &mdash; not just for those who depend on them entirely but also for those of us who send our children to public schools and depend on the public sector health service, as the great majority of us do.  We have underspent in those areas in years gone by and there are still some areas of very great need.  At this time of economic plenty, we need to look at those areas to see whether improvements can be afforded.</P>
    <P>Nobody on this side of the House is suggesting irresponsible spending sprees &mdash; quite the contrary. I make an important distinction between capital and current spending.  For example, there is no reasonable excuse for not proceeding with the northside Luas line at the earliest possible time and to otherwise improve our infrastructure. These are one-off investments which will improve our future productive capacity and need to be made now when we can afford it.</P>
    <P>Instead, the Government appears to have shackled itself to an utterly daft spending target. We are being told that spending will be limited this year and into the future to a gross figure of 4 per cent, not taking 2 per cent inflation into account.  I do not understand this.  We are being told we must save for a rainy day.  It appears, however, that those who are earning reasonably decent incomes and can look after themselves at the moment will not have to wait in the same way as those who depend on public services.</P>
    <P>It seems the Government is still determined to reduce the upper rate of income tax from its current level of 48 per cent.  It seems it is still determined to go ahead with a tax reduction which is plainly skewed to those who need it least. However, those who depend on public health services and education, and those on low incomes, in the Civil Service and elsewhere, are being told they will have to wait.</P>
    <P>The Minister needs to look carefully at the provisions of Partnership 2000 in relation to exclusion.  Perhaps he needs to look again at the programme for Government and to consider whether a great deal more could be done on those issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Government have shackled themselves with an ideologically driven hatred of public spending.  I listened, for example, to the almost throwaway remarks which the Tánaiste made in Killarney last week when she <Col N="714" /> decried the previous Government's record on public spending.  It is true we employed an extra 11,000 people in the public services while we were in Government, roughly half in the health services and roughly half in education.  I do not apologise for any of that.  We made important improvements, and there is still much more to be done.</P>
    <P>However, the Tánaiste apparently considers public spending to be something which, by definition, is bad.  She should consider what public spending does.  It is not all good and, perhaps, in the past we did not look for value for money as much as we should have done but lessons have been learned.  However, we need to spend more on important social services.  I wish to put down that marker on behalf of my party in relation to the upcoming budget and future economic policy. We cannot just run this country for the benefit of those who pay 48 per cent income tax.</P>
    <P>I join the Minister in commending those who drafted this Bill, which I hope will be the first of a number in the tax area, where there is much work to be done.  The Bill was drafted in a relatively short time, considering the size of the task. I am sorry my colleague, the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, is not here today as I know he would have liked to take the plaudits and see the Bill through, even from this side of the House. However, I acknowledge on his behalf the compliments paid to the work.  The Minister can be assured of our support on Committee Stage to bring the matter to fruition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a magnificent opus.  It is written in a coherent and logical manner and is a tribute to all the people who were involved.  I too pay particular tribute to and congratulate Deputy Quinn, the previous Minister for Finance, who, in February 1995, set out in a determined manner to ensure this came about.  He deserves all the plaudits he has received.</P>
      <P>The Bill will benefit practitioners, particularly, as it will make it much easier for them to examine cases.  It will also benefit tax inspectors and their clients.  The Bill is much easier to use than the previous legislation as there is now no need to flit between the 1967, 1974 and 1993 Tax Acts.  It is a beautiful piece of work.  I understand that future changes to the Act in budgets will be made by amendment of the consolidated Act, which will make it much easier for practitioners to use the legislation properly and to provide a good service to their clients.</P>
      <P>It is great that the legislation will be available in CD-ROM format.  There will also be more detailed guidance notes.  The notes with this Bill were excellent and helped one to read the detail of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill however, lacks a subject index which would be very useful.  There is talk of drilling down the edges of the page.  However, given the state of technology and the publishing programmes it would not be difficult to provide an index.  While the Revenue may say that the Act <Col N="715" /> in its entirety must be taken into account, such an index would be helpful and necessary, even if it was a non-statutory part of the Act.  I was unable to find paragraphs which related to specific items without devoting considerable time to the matter.</P>
    <P>Small and medium sized enterprises have specific concerns.  Owners of small businesses want to reduce bureaucracy.  The Bill will do this because it will ensure that a better service can be provided by the inspectors of taxes and professional advisers.</P>
    <P>Small and medium enterprises consider themselves to be unpaid tax collectors for the Government and there continues to be a plethora of VAT and PAYE forms.  These forms must be addressed and reduced in any consolidation process. They also require the use of simple language in the legislation.  I therefore welcome the elimination or simplification of the archaic language used in the previous Acts.</P>
    <P>Times have changed in the 30 years since the last consolidation Act.  In view of this, the individual sections must be looked at.  While the Bill is a consolidation of all taxation laws some of their provisions relate back to 1967 and before.  These are now archaic.  For example, section 14 provides that no tax is charged on a denomination lower than 1p.</P>
    <P>Businesses can deduct expenses that are wholly and exclusively spent for the business but the employee can only deduct expenses that are wholly, exclusively and necessarily spent for the job.  This relationship must change.  There must be more equality between the business person and the employee.  Employees must sometimes pay expenses which are not necessarily incurred. For example, many employees pay for home computers, travel to seminars and books and magazines which they use to improve their knowledge. All should be tax deductible.</P>
    <P>The presidential election campaign demonstrates that much expense can be incurred in improving one's image.  This is not a sexist remark.  Derek Nally has improved his image through the use of reputable tailors in Pembroke Street and Capel Street.  Questions have arisen as to whether grooming and dress, which must be paid for, should be deductible expenses.</P>
    <P>Businessmen travel approximately 15,000 miles a year.  I understood that, on a discretionary basis, the inspector of taxes allowed 5,000 miles as private mileage.  It is now written into the legislation that if an assessment is being made by the inspector of taxes he will allow 5,000 miles as private mileage.  This provides greater certainty for the small and medium businessman, which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The language employed in parts of the Bill is not simple.  Section 123 provides that all income on termination of employment is chargeable to income tax, subject to section 201.  Section 201 refers to payments for redundancy and leaving employment, which could amount to between £10,000 and £15,000 if a person was in a job for a <Col N="716" /> number of years.  That is normally far greater than what somebody would be paid on termination of employment.  If reference is made to another section there should be a brief description of what it contains.</P>
    <P>Section 126 refers to widows' contributory pensions, orphans' contributory pensions, retirement pensions, old age contributory pensions, disability benefit, unemployment benefit and pay related benefit, all of which are chargeable to tax.  Many people in those income brackets may have a small amount of extra income and may be slightly over the exemption limit.  They then pay tax at the rate of 40 per cent as opposed to the standard rate of 26 per cent.  They resent being in this situation. The matter must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Section 140 provides that profits or gains for stallion fees, greyhound service fees or occupation of certain woodlands are disregarded for tax purposes.  While the Minister is a racing fan he should look at whether these profits should continue to be exempt.  The provision may have been included many years ago but it must now be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan mentioned that Charles J. Haughey consolidated the Taxes Acts in 1967.  In doing so he also introduced tax relief for authors, sculptors and writers in respect of income derived from the creation of an original work.  The section is four and a half pages in length and comprises a significant part of the Act.  Given the size and beauty of the Act could the drafter look upon it as an original and creative work and would he be exempt from income tax on his salary while he was engaged on it?</P>
    <P>Sections 223 and 226 provide that if an employment grant from the IDA, county enterprise boards and back to work scheme is given, including the grant given in respect of the employment of an individual who is more than three years unemployed, it is exempt from tax.  This means that it is effectively valued at more than the net amount.  At times people have produced this in connection with their wages and would, therefore, effectively pay tax on it.  Small and medium business owners should look at this.</P>
    <P>Section 272 refers to the 15 per cent annual allowance for hotels and the 10 per cent annual allowance for holiday cottages used as a trade. There are a huge number of hotels in Dublin.  The tax saving on the 15 per cent allowance pays the interest and some of the capital on a loan secured to finance projects.  With property prices increasing and interest rates decreasing the Revenue ends up fully financing these hotels.  There is no balancing charge after seven years so there is no claw-back of the allowance provided and the balancing charge is disregarded if any capital gains are made.  This is a matter of the rich getting richer; it widens dramatically the gap between the rich and the poor.  The allowance for hotels must be examined.</P>
    <P>Under section 291 computer software is treated as a capital investment.  However, people are aware that computer software comes in a package <Col N="717" /> and is out of date in six to 12 months.  The idea that it can be written off over seven years is ridiculous in this day and age.  It should be treated as a normal expense.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 355, many people are seeking section 23 apartments of which there is a dearth in the city.  People should be made aware that holiday cottages in designated holiday resorts can be set off against rental income from other sources.  It is, effectively, a type of section 23 and people who cannot find such properties in Dublin should consider investments in Lahinch, Tramore or elsewhere because they will receive the same tax benefit.</P>
    <P>The anti-avoidance measures are set out in various sections.  Perhaps all these measures could be contained in one section.  This would make them more obvious and stronger.  The House should also consider if retrospective legislation could be introduced with regard to tax avoidance.  If the Revenue Commissioners believe a provision in the Act is used to avoid tax, the House should consider implementing retrospective legislation so the tax loss can be recouped.  This matter must be examined and addressed.</P>
    <P>There are too many personal allowances and reliefs.  Following the recent CORI report on basic income, a new analysis of this area should be carried out, particularly as the country has surplus revenue of between £500 million and £1 billion.  With regard to reliefs associated with films, 80 per cent of £25,000 is most generous, giving £10,000 relief on tax in one year.  A £20,000 repayment on a £25,000 investment would give an investor in films a reasonable profit quickly. Given the structure of films, perhaps 80 per cent is too high and that amount should be re-examined.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 1003, if one donates an important heritage item a tax credit against past, current and future tax can be given.  The ceiling at present is £750,000 and perhaps it should be increased up to £4 million.</P>
    <P>Section 1065 gives the Minister for Finance the right to mitigate fines and penalties.  I was not aware the Minister had the right to mitigate up to 50 per cent of fines and penalties imposed. Given the existence of revenue audits and that fines and penalties can amount to sums in excess of £1 million, which would not be unusual in this day and age, the power of the Minister to reduce that by £500,000 needs to be re-examined.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a splendid piece of work and I am delighted to contribute to the debate.  I look forward to using the legislation in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  For more years than I can recall I tore out my hair trying to deal with changes in various sections in different Finance <Col N="718" /> Acts.  It was music to my ears in 1995 when the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, announced that a consolidation project would proceed.  The background to the Bill is that the introduction of the legislation relating to capital gains tax in 1975 and the corporation tax code in 1976 had a major impact on the 1967 income tax code.  In addition, successive Finance Acts included numerous changes to the codes.  In all, the three codes comprised 2,000 separate sections and 50 related Schedules.  When one considers those figures, one can understand the problems and headaches the Revenue authorities, accountants and tax advisers experienced.  The decision to introduce consolidating legislation was tremendous and the result is outstanding.  It is now possible to look at one Bill and understand its simple language.</P>
      <P>I commend the former Minister for initiating the consolidation project.  The Deputy almost met his deadline because he hoped to have it in operation during his term of office.  However, times change.  I also commend the Revenue officials and the private sector who worked together to bring this Bill to fruition.  They co-operated extraordinarily well and this shows that great results can be achieved in a short time if people work together.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan mentioned the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, earlier.  Deputy Noonan continued on his merry way, as he has done over the years, raising fears where none should exist.  He tried to scare companies by stating that there will be a rising 15 per cent corporation tax rate.  This is typical of the Deputy but he knows in his heart and soul that this will not happen.</P>
      <P>I commend all those involved in formulating the Bill which will be of tremendous benefit to people involved in business, the Revenue authorities, tax practitioners and accountants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>As my colleagues said, the Bill is a monumental enterprise and I congratulate the Minister and the Government for bringing it to fruition.  I recall when the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, advised the Cabinet that he intended to initiate the consolidation process. There were more than one or two whispers to the effect that people would believe it when they saw it.  The Bill is a great tribute to Deputy Quinn for driving the project forward and to the many dedicated people who worked on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I apologise that I was unable to attend earlier for the Minister's speech and the contributions of the Opposition spokespersons.  However, he referred to this being the first time any tax law has been consolidated since 1967.  In tax terms that is a long time and a great deal of water has passed under the bridge since then.  In 1967 many people had only a passing familiarity with the concept of being taxed or paying tax at all. Whereas a number of people would suggest there are still legacies around from that era, nonetheless there has been a revolution in the taxation system and in its enforcement since then.  It was <Col N="719" /> some considerable time after 1967 when the little old lady in Deputy Deenihan's constituency said, when told about decimalisation, it was a great idea but it would never catch on down there. Income tax was viewed in that way around 1967 by a great many people.  Much has changed since then even if a good deal remains to be done.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a monumental enterprise.  The two previous speakers &mdash; Deputies Ardagh and Ahern &mdash; know more than a little about the taxation code and I agree with much of what they said.  It is laden with nuggets as Deputy Ardagh said.  It will not be just of assistance to the tax advice industry but to Members and to anybody who wants to be able to find some aspect of the tax regime and to have it intelligibly explained. Nonetheless, some of the nuggets will cause raised eyebrows.  Certainly my constituents in Jobstown will be fascinated by the section on stock relief for farmers, the residential requirements to be in the State to pay tax and Deputy Ardagh's fascinating comment about stallion fees. I hope Deputy Ardagh, who knows a little about this area, will not take offence if I say that in tossing off the top of his head, the notion that the stallion fees provision might be changed, he has still much to learn about the hard politics of this House.  However, I support him 100 per cent and believe the time has come to look at the existing provisions for the blood stock industry.  It would be a very productive area for examination and may well add a great deal to our knowledge of the tax system here.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the question of overseas investment and its contribution to the growth and strength of this economy.  I do not know why that issue has been selected for early and prominent mention other than the discussions which are taking place elsewhere about the corporation tax regime.  I do not agree with Deputy Ahern. The comments by Deputy Noonan, if described accurately, are not fantastic.  It is regrettable, having made a foolish promise at the time of the general election, that the two parties in Government have decided to reopen this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right in saying the continued attraction of foreign investment at the rate we have been attracting it in recent years is a critically important factor in terms of the growth of this economy but there are arguments behind why the previous Government decided to look at the corporation tax regime.  It was foolhardy to reopen that issue.  I hope the Government escapes with the agreement the previous Government had in place in terms of 12.5 per cent for the traded sector.  A 15 per cent rate would mean a 50 per cent increase in the existing CPT regime. I take with a grain of salt the remarks today by the IBEC representative about why the Government parties should adhere to the 10 per cent platform announced during the general election but we could have some serious and real problems if corporation tax was increased by 50 per cent which is what a 15 per cent regime would <Col N="720" /> mean.  On Question Time last week we pursued the Minister for Finance on this issue.  I regret he did not tell us then he was in the hot water we have since discovered he is in and from which I sincerely hope he can extricate himself.  It is a foolish mission to change that decision, a decision reached after a great deal of thought and consideration at the time.  In all the circumstances, it was a reasonable compromise and one with which industry and Government can live.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the projections in the Minister's speech in terms of revenue buoyancy, tax revenue specifically, the expectation for a small surplus and so on.  I note the tax revenue forecast at the time of the budget was 6 per cent. If some of us had the Chair's experience around the Cabinet table we might have taken a slightly more jaundiced view of that projection of 6 per cent.  That is not to say I regard other than with the highest esteem, the civil servants who work in this area of the Department of Finance.  They have nothing other than the public good in mind. In an election year, in particular, it is their job to make sure they ride shotgun on the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>When one sees projections of 10 per cent and £1 billion in excess of expectation after the third quarter, one would not be human not to think what might have been and the decisions which might have been made.  The result is the Minister for Finance inherits the most propitious economic circumstances any Minister for Finance has inherited in the lifetime of this State.  That is an extraordinary position to be in.  No previous Minister for Finance has ever been in the situation where a surplus is being budgeted for and where buoyancy in tax revenue is coming through.  Against the projections in the Minister's speech and the figures for the third quarter of £1 billion in excess of expectations, that is a most propitious climate for tax reform.</P>
    <P>If we do not achieve fundamental tax reform during this period, characterised by strong economic growth, buoyancy in public revenues and significant resource transfers from the European Union, when will we have genuine tax reform?</P>
    <P>For my party, tax reform is about taking the lower paid out of the tax net, striking the appropriate balance between thresholds, allowances, bands and tax rates, the interplay between the tax system and the social insurance system and fund and making as little demand as possible on the taxpayer while keeping the European social model intact and maintaining its integrity here. Irish taxpayers consider they pay too much tax and most do.  There are two points I would make. We need to take care that we do not simply cut, or promise to cut, the taxes of taxpayers, thus undermining the ability of the State to provide services.  However, simply to depict the issue as one of cuts versus reform is also misleading.  It is not a question of one or the other.  It is a question of achieving both &mdash; tax reductions for those who are overburdened and a fair contribution from those who pay too little or nothing, while maintaining <Col N="721" /> and improving public services according to the demands and needs of our society.</P>
    <P>The second factor feeding into the feeling that taxes and spending are too high is the behaviour of politicians themselves &mdash; and not simply in Ireland.  Western democracies generally have ended up in a bind.  They, that is to say the voters and politicians, believed that the State could and should provide more public services without reference to the level of national output and, in particular, to trends in the growth &mdash; or lack of growth &mdash; of output.  They engaged in particular in attempting to insulate their societies and economies over decades from enormous external shocks, rather than adapting to such shocks, for example, the oil crisis, but more recently technological and global economic developments. Governments promised corrective measures but patently did not keep their promises.  Ireland was no exception to any of this.</P>
    <P>The result is the politics of the lobby and vested interest.  Farmers rail against public spending and debt, yet want to be fully compensated for bad weather, good weather, every animal disease imaginable and anything else they see as representing a reduction in their rightful &mdash; as they see it &mdash; living standards.  Individual industrialists are no different.  They are equally loud in their similar demands for rectitude.  Spending must go, yet their trade and representative bodies are equally demanding in their pleas for the maintenance of their grants, supports and subsidies, and for more of the same.</P>
    <P>More controversially from my political perspective, the public service system itself is not immune from a tendency to engage in special pleading.  More spending is regularly equated with more service and better service.  The ideas of value for money, evaluation, replacement and even the closing down of programmes where they are shown not to be working, or to have worked and to have achieved their purpose, are notions with which many in the public service and perhaps the political left are not comfortable.  There is every reason why the left should address the idea of controlling and limiting public expenditure. After all, public expenditure is largely funded by ordinary taxpayers and much of it, directly or indirectly, accrues to low or non-taxpayers. For example, one could look at who the real beneficiaries of university access are.  Every year in recent times the <i>Kilkenny People</i> has published the names of the recipients of university grants from the different Kilkenny local authorities. It makes very instructive reading because it is an essay on the class system in Ireland, on who benefits from public expenditure and specifically from university grants.  This cocktail has debased politics, made electorates cynical and unbelieving, sapped civic purpose, cultivated selfishness and made the politics of private desires, rent-seeking and provider-capture the predominant and driving force in the three-way relationship between civil society, political parties and the <Col N="722" /> State.  This is not an argument against either public spending or the creation of debt.</P>
    <P>Society cannot do without public spending.  A fair education system, a decent health service, the provision of clean water and adequate public transport are cases in point.  Deputy McDowell instanced serious weaknesses in all of these areas. For example, the subsidy to Dublin Bus is paltry compared to the public perception of the extent to which Dublin Bus is subvented.  As a result, the very populous area that I represent, or the whole belt of west Dublin that does not enjoy the super DART system, lives with a permanently inferior public transport service.  That is a real issue in the context of the arguments that we have been making.  As to debt, notwithstanding what I heard Deputy Noonan say, the countercyclical case still has substance, while debt-funded public investment can also be justified.  However, in the former case we have to be concerned with ensuring that current deficits are cyclical, while in the latter case we have to look at issues to do with funding and be concerned with the rate of return, however that is defined.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister therefore take courage and go for tax reductions for those who are overburdened and a fair contribution from the dodgers, while maintaining and improving public services according to the demands and needs of this society.  Let him target tax relief on those low to middle income earners who deserve it most and abandon the PD/FF election platform just as he has been forced by the European Commission to abandon the PD/FF election platform on corporation tax.</P>
    <P>Establishing a fair and equitable system of taxation is only half of the equation; ensuring that the system is administered in a fair and effective way is equally important.  Enforcement, evasion and tax avoidance in this economy are critical questions still to be addressed.  Everybody accepts that there have been tremendous advances in terms of enforcement and so on in recent years and I do not doubt the commitment of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that continues to be improved.  Nonetheless, when we have come through a period such as we have come through recently, there are questions in the public mind about how certain things are allowed to happen right under the noses of the Revenue Commissioners. It is a matter of restoring public confidence in the fairness and efficacy of the tax system that the Revenue Commissioners are seen to respond fairly and even-handedly.  It stills remains a mystery, if one were to look at the two tribunals we have had in recent times &mdash; the Goodman tribunal in the first case &mdash; as to why one of the largest employers could have been making tax returns for a very modest small-sized employer and no alarm bells went off.  We know now that the largest organised tax evasion scam in the history of the State was going on.  I think it was Mr. Donnelly who offered before the tribunal certain explanations, some of which were quite persuasive to me in terms of resources, systems and <Col N="723" /> benchmarks not then operating in the Revenue Commissioners.  However, in the Dunnes payments tribunal we have seen it again.  We have seen the reluctance to get clear answers on, for example, the Ansbacher accounts.  Was that purely a tax evasion scam, as it seems to have been?  Are there wealthy individuals who can put through an amendment to the Finance Act on the last day altering the residential requirements in this State?  Nobody will ever convince me, although I am open to listening, that that was not put through for certain specific individuals.  That is still one of the major issues in terms of restoring confidence in the tax system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The consolidation of the taxation Acts is a positive step.  A substantial amount of work has already been done by the previous Administration towards this end.  I welcome the introduction of the Bill which will consolidate the Corporation Tax Act, the Capital Gains Tax Act and the Income Tax Act.  When does the Minister intend to consolidate the law relating to capital acquisitions tax, value added tax and stamp duty? This Bill is the first step on the long road to consolidation of tax law.  I hope we will not have to wait another 30 years for further consolidating legislation.  The process of consolidation should be ongoing.  To avoid a proliferation of tax Acts the Bill should incorporate a facility to allow for consolidation on a yearly basis.</P>
      <P>Consolidation of some of the tax Acts is a positive step and has been welcomed by the accountancy bodies, the Institute of Taxation and the Revenue Commissioners.  It will be of immense benefit to the professionals.  Simplification should be the aim.  The tax regime is too complicated and complex.  This is a disgrace.  I intend to return on another occasion to this matter about which members of the business community feel strongly.</P>
      <P>This Bill should allow for publication of tax Bills in the electronic format.  Does the Minister plan to do this?</P>
      <P>A vital ingredient in economic development is prudent financial planning.  The Government has reneged on its promise made in recent weeks to lower corporation tax rates.  This is appalling and unacceptable and not the way to plan for the future given the need for certainty.  Such changes of mood send the wrong signal to the financial capitals of the world and cause dismay among the members of the small and medium-sized business community here.</P>
      <P>On the issue of rates &mdash; a form of indirect taxation &mdash; there is an anomaly in the system. Regardless of one's ability to pay, members of the business community have no option but to pay the amount demanded.  This is unfair.  Exemptions should be provided for in certain areas where the amount to be paid would be assessed on the profits of a business rather than location. The business community is the only sector now paying rates on property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> With the additional funding available in a booming economy the Minister should have discretion to provide for the designation of small towns and villages to ensure their survival.  This would be of immense benefit in promoting an enterprise culture and lead to job creation.  The urban renewal scheme has led to a welcome boom in our larger cities and on the east coast. This has been at the expense of small towns and villages.  I will fight tirelessly to ensure they get their fair share of the additional funding available. They have been penalised for far too long.</P>
    <P>Failure to provide for the designation of small towns and villages will in the short-term lead to the erosion of small inherited family businesses whose survival is of importance to the economy and the Exchequer.  Their survival is already threatened by the establishment of foreign companies in key locations.  The survival of the small farmer and other symbol groups, such as the small corner shop, is threatened in a similar way.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider providing additional tax allowances to ensure the survival of the small business community, the members of which have to meet high maintenance costs, including electricity which is charged at the highest rate.  Customers in small towns and villages now expect high standards and should not have to drive 15 to 20 miles to a large urban centre to obtain their requirements.  To ensure a service continues to be provided the tax laws should be amended to provide developers with an incentive. In Northern Ireland the urban renewal scheme was introduced first in small towns and villages.  A similar policy was not adopted here.  This matter should be addressed in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>While tax reform is important, simplification is the way forward.  Businesses have to employ full-time staff to keep abreast of tax legislation and to ensure returns are made on time.  This is an added expense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Perry on his maiden speech.  He has demonstrated that he has a good knowledge of how the tax code affects small businesses.  I am sure he will make many more fine contributions.</P>
      <P>This long-awaited Bill is about consolidation and is much needed.  I called for such legislation to be introduced some years ago because of what tax practitioners and others in that field were saying to me.  I compliment both the previous and current Ministers, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, on introducing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also compliment the officials of the Department of Finance.  From my experience in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, it is the officials of a Department who do the hard work in bringing Bills to fruition.  The departmental officials deserve that recognition and they must feel fulfilled that they have brought in this Bill, which is the first of its type since 1967, although other significant legislation in corporation tax and capital gains tax has been introduced since then.  Members have suggested that <Col N="725" /> other taxes should be consolidated under this Bill and I am sure that will happen in the future.</P>
    <P>This Bill will facilitate accountants, tax consultants and the legal profession.  It will make the tax system more user-friendly and thus cut the costs to the consumer.  If people find the system more accessible and more information is available then the time involved in wading through different Bills will also be cut, as this Bill consolidates approximately 40 separate Acts.  With the aid of technology, a cheaper service can be provided to the consumer, as the expense of getting taxes and accounts done greatly inhibits small businesses.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion to have this information on CD-ROM, which is a welcome innovation. It is good to see the Department of Finance moving in this direction and other Departments should follow suit.  It will not only be useful to practitioners in the field but to academic institutions, various pressure groups, groups representing small businesses and chambers of commerce.</P>
    <P>Members have spoken of reform and simplification. More simplification is needed.  The Minister of State understands how taxes affect small businesses.  It should be possible for those small businesses to have a different regime, perhaps a 10-point tax system, that they could operate so that they need not go to professionals for advice. Then they would not have to spend a large percentage of their profits employing accountants, tax consultants and lawyers to do their accounts. We must strive for that situation, even though it may not be easily achieved.  There are simpler systems for small businesses in other countries.  If we cannot reform the tax system for these businesses, there will be more casualties.  A large number of small businesses fail, not because of their expertise but because of cash flow, which is directly related to taxation.</P>
    <P>More reform and simplification is the feedback I have received from the small business community. The tax code is too complex for them. This will help as they can now see where their own family of taxes, as the Minister of State put it, exists.  They can refer to that in the Bill. However, how many small businesses will be able to use this Bill on CD-ROM?  Will this information be available to small businesses?  Will the Minister of State ensure that local tax offices help small businesses to understand this legislation?</P>
    <P>Regarding corporation tax, the biggest advantage we have in attracting foreign investment is our 10 per cent corporation tax.  Foreign businesses invest here because of our educated workforce and our environment, but the greatest incentive is the 10 per cent corporation tax.  We have found it to our advantage when we are compared to our main competitors, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Holland.  If it is as attractive elsewhere to foreign investors, we will lose that advantage.</P>
    <P>The new urban renewal scheme which is to be introduced in 1998 has been mentioned.  That will not favour smaller towns, as a town must have <Col N="726" /> over 6,000 inhabitants before it benefits from the scheme.  Many small towns would benefit from such investment but investment is leaving them for designated areas.  I will raise this with the appropriate Minister, but as currently drafted it does not favour small towns in rural Ireland and will have to be closely examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment, as I have not had the opportunity to do so formally before now.  He will apply his intelligence to this wide brief, which includes the Office of Public Works.  That is particularly important to my constituency, and I know the Minister of State will not forget the flooded areas of Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir, which are the subject of much discussion.  The Minister of State's assistance is needed on this matter, otherwise those paying tax will not be able to do so. They have been washed out of business three or four times in recent years.  I do not doubt that the Minister of State will address this matter as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I join with other Members in commending Deputy Quinn when he was Minister for Finance on initiating this consolidation of taxes.  I commend the present Minister on continuing and completing that work.  It was thankless but important to those of us who are consulted on tax affairs in our clinics.  It is also important for all those professionally involved in advising the taxpayer. If there were no taxpayers there would be no need for taxes or tax officials, nor would there be any public services.  It is a fundamental cog in the administration of Government.  I join with Members in complimenting the officials of the Department of Finance who have worked so hard to ensure that this legislation is completed and continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important and timely motion.  The Fine Gael frontbench considered a number of other issues but this is the most pressing.  In the time available, I will outline the <Col N="727" /> background to this case, the political objections to Sellafield-THORP, the Government parties' political commitments and the purpose behind this motion, to resolve the impasse between the Government and the County Louth residents group.</P>
      <P>It is only a few weeks since I was appointed Fine Gael spokesman on public enterprise.  I have no particular expertise, experience or background in this area but having studied all the papers I could on this matter in the past fortnight, I believe the public owes a considerable debt of gratitude to the four residents from Dundalk and their legal representatives for taking this case on behalf of the people, given the widespread public and political support for the case.  They have nothing to gain should they win the case but they face personal disaster in the present circumstances should they lose.  We should pay tribute to their courage and resilience since the first hearing in the High Court in 1994 as it is the most inspired form of civic spiritedness one could find anywhere.</P>
      <P>This area of nuclear energy and power is the technology of the 1950s and 1960s and with the knowledge we have in the 1990s the question of splitting the atom is acknowledged to be dangerous technology and outdated.  Its only relevant application in the future will be military, which is regrettable.  In 1956 four Magnox reactors, which are now over 40 years old and represent a risk, were built at Windscale and are in the Calder Hall unit of the Sellafield complex.  Its location on the west coast of Cumbria is a mere 100 miles to the east of where we stand, the most densely populated part of this country along the east coast.  In March 1994, the Stg £1.85 million THORP construction opened.  There was no public inquiry and no environmental impact study was carried out on that development.</P>
      <P>On the NIREX development, I commend the former Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, who represented the Government.  I read the Seanad debates on this matter which took place in the past 18 months.  As a member of the last Government, I am proud of the efforts Deputy Stagg and Deputy Gilmore made on this issue, of which I was only recently made aware.  A substantial and concerted effort resulted in NIREX not getting the go ahead and I regret similar approaches were not made in the 1970s and 1980s and at the time THORP was commissioned.</P>
      <P>THORP is one of two such reprocessing plants of spent fuel extracting uranium and plutonium, the other being in France.  Waste from the worldwide nuclear power industry, including Japan, the Far East, the United States and so on, is being brought to the doorstep of the people and to the Irish Sea.  With one quarter of the UK's electricity energy being sourced from the nuclear industry, it is here to stay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever one's view on nuclear energy, it must be seen in the context of the serious accident in March 1979 at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania <Col N="728" /> and on 25 April 1986 at Chernobyl.  We all know about the devastation in terms of congenital deformities which children are born with and the cancerous developments and health hazards for those living in close proximity to these disasters. Because there is no economic benefit to Ireland and because of the potential risk of accident, this is something which the people and the Government must oppose.  The risk of an accident must be highlighted.  There is a possibility of human error, technical failure, failure during transportation and storage and in the cooling plant.  There is no technology for the safe long-term storage of the output of nuclear energy because we do not know what the position will be in 100 or 200 years' time.  The accumulation of nuclear waste is something which must worry us all.</P>
    <P>Radioactivity does not respect national borders or territorial boundaries as we know from the effects and fall out from Chernobyl.  There are no assurances that I or this House can get from British Nuclear Fuels which will satisfy us that there will be a future state of knowledge which will indicate that present technology is safe and foolproof or that there is no risk from an accident.</P>
    <P>The basis of the legal case taken by the residents group is sound.  Their hallmark decision in winning the right of jurisdiction originally in the High Court where they were allowed a plenary summons and subsequently the Justice Barrington decision on 24 October are landmark decisions.  This allows a basis for a substantive case to be taken against British Nuclear Fuels. There is a history of mismanagement and accidents, all of which may not have been fully reported.  I call on the Minister to set in place a proper communication system between the Irish and British Governments for the free flow of information as the RPII cannot monitor Sellafield directly.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to ask the European Commission to review the operation of the Magnox reactors to see if they meet EU basic safety standards under article 35 of the Euratom Treaty.  I call on the Government, leaving aside the court case which is the subject of this motion, to utilise the Paris Convention on the prevention of pollution from land based sources, pursue the opinions under it and to put in place a proper transmission system for the monitoring of information on Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I draw the House's attention to a debate in the Seanad on 30 October 1996 where the former Labour Senator, Pat Magner, moved a motion less than a week after the Supreme Court judgment, to which I referred.  The motion welcomes the court's decision and takes note of the Government's policy.  What is unusual about the debate was that Fianna Fáil tabled an amendment which I am pleased the Government accepted.  I read meticulously the contributions of Senators, many of whom became Fianna Fáil Deputies. They gave glowing support to STAD and the case and should now exert the maximum pressure on the Government to support the case. <Col N="729" /> As part of my research for this matter, I met the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  I refer to the report on Radioactivity Monitoring of the Irish Marine Environment 1993-95.  On page 23 there is a table of all the radioactivity and types of discharges of nucleates from Sellafield &mdash; an admission of discharges into the Irish Sea.  I was amazed this has been allowed to continue. Not being a scientist, a reading of the risk estimates and conclusions on pages 16 and 17 of that report did not at all assure me as to there being a safe radiation dose nor did it reassure me on all the consequent repercussions for the Irish Sea whether in tourism, swimming, fishing, and natural amenity, leaving aside altogether the human health environment, of breathing, eating and so on.  On that reading I became more rather than less fearful and found the RPII an unambiguous opponent and critic of Sellafield.  The large accumulation of radioactive waste being stored here in 21 separate tanks causes me the greatest distress.  We really must become serious about this.</P>
    <P>There was a very non-party political, non-partisan tenor to the debate in the Seanad.  I do not wish to inject a partisan element into this debate. The reason for my tabling this motion was that there appeared to be a clear impasse between the residents' group and the Government.  My purpose was not to score political points but to get that rapport back on the rails and the Government fully committed to the case leading to a successful prosecution.</P>
    <P>There has been much cynicism voiced about politicians in recent weeks.  It has been exacerbated by the abandonment of freely entered into pre-election commitments.  To preserve the collective credibility of politicians it is important that this House vigilantly monitors the outcome of promises made.</P>
    <P>At the launch of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto their environmental and ecological policy document read:</P>
    <P>In Government Fianna Fáil will ensure that the case taken by the Dundalk residents is fully funded and, if required, appealed through the higher courts.  In Government Fianna Fáil will provide the financial and scientific resources to comprehensively research the effects on health and safety in Ireland of the operation of Sellafield et al.  Fianna Fáil in Government will vigorously pursue politically and legally all avenues to have Sellafield and her sister stations shut.</P>
    <P>Those are not my words.  It was not that the Louth residents group went knocking on the door of Fianna Fáil with a begging bowl, but Fianna Fáil approached it with support.  It was a voluntary organisation engaging in its own research, through MacGuill and Company, voluntary fund raising and so on.</P>
    <P>The most invidious and unacceptable aspect of this overall problem &mdash; following a recent Question Time in the House &mdash; is that there is a public <Col N="730" /> perception that the State is fully funding this case, so that now that association is unable to raise money voluntarily.  That Fianna Fáil commitment was given freely and unambiguously.  As part of the wider Fianna Fáil manifesto, the following was said:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in Government will ensure that the case taken by the Dundalk residents is fully funded and, if required, appealed through the higher courts.</P>
    <P>There was no possibility of any misunderstanding about those issues.</P>
    <P>I refer to the amendment moved in the Seanad by Senator Michael Mulcahy calling on the Government to agree in principle to funding the STAD case against BNFL in the courts and to enter immediately into negotiations with the STAD group to ensure the Government is removed as a defendant in the case, thus removing the outstanding obstacle to the Government funding the case.</P>
    <P>There are many things that can and should be done in this case.  Actions taken by the last Government should be acknowledged, including the irradiation nuclear fuel motion tabled at the International Maritime Organisation, the reform of the Harbours Act to prohibit vessels with nuclear fuels on board from coming in and out of our ports and the White Paper on Foreign Policy of last year which included a clear commitment on Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The previous Government took this issue so seriously it established a ministerial task force to deal with it.  From my experience as a former Cabinet Minister, there is no substitute for having a Cabinet Minister with responsibility for an issue at the Cabinet table.  The Department of Finance will be against every proposal &mdash; that is always its stance &mdash; the Attorney General will have his case and one must convince party leaders and others to make things happen.  I say this with no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, doing his best in impossible circumstances but a Cabinet Minister should be dealing with this debate.  I would be quite happy to see Deputy Jacob elevated to the Cabinet but it is not satisfactory in the power-broking manner in which the Cabinet works in the case of all Governments for a Minister of State to be dealing with it.</P>
    <P>The then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, worked with Ministers of State, Deputies Stagg and Gilmore during his tenure of office.  In relation to our commitment I quote from a letter sent by the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, to MacGuill and Company, the solicitors representing LRG on 3 June as follows:</P>
    <P>I wish to confirm that I am willing to propose to Government that the existing offer of assistance of up to £100,000 towards the cost of those research proposals already identified by the Department should be increased to a sum of £200,000 without pre-conditions.  In addition, I will arrange a meeting at an early date between you and representatives of your clients and the <Col N="731" /> ministerial committee on Sellafield.  The agenda will include the position in relation to other costs arising in respect of your clients' actions as well as a mechanism for evaluating future research, including specific proposals already put by your clients to the Department.</P>
    <P>There is quite a paper trail in relation to what that actually meant.</P>
    <P>That takes me on to the change of Government. I have never before encountered a position in which a group insisted on having a stenographer's report of the meeting of 6 October last &mdash; following on a Question Time in the House &mdash; between the Louth residents' group, its legal representatives, the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, some public officials, including those from the Department of Public Enterprise and the legal representative of the Government.  I do not know who Mr. Daly is but, were I Minister, I certainly would not have allowed him take total control of the meeting and state what was or was not to be done.  At that meeting it is fair to say the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, outlined the position in his opening statement.  Whatever is the Government's response to this motion, it is important to know what was its position a mere eight days ago. I quote from page 2 of the statement handed out at that meeting which refers to the £200,000:</P>
    <P>This represents a full and final settlement relating to State financial support for your action against BNFL.  We will need you to acknowledge this.</P>
    <P>Let us please not hear it suggested now that the Government really meant something else.</P>
    <P>I wish to cite the transcript because the detail is significant.  The Government's offer, which was full and final, was £200,000, with no precondition that the Government be dropped as a safe co-defendant. There would be an invoicing system but not a penny more would be given.  That was the Government's position which was fairly straightforward.  The motion refers to &ldquo;necessary financial assistance towards research and legal costs as well as the appropriate technical expertise and information&rdquo;.  Eight research projects have been identified costing £250,000.  A consultant is required for the collating of information technology &mdash; Mason's are the acknowledged consultants &mdash; and the figure for that is in the hundreds of thousands.  That needs a separate item.  In regard to the appointment of a health researcher, which post was advertised but not filled, we are talking about a figure of approximately £50,000 per year with the necessary backup.  We are not talking about tens of millions of pounds.  This is a modest but specific shopping list.  There is also the cost of an engineering consultant &mdash; a Mr. Large was referred to but we are talking about a nuclear physicist &mdash; to do a report as part of the court case.  Finally there is the question of legal costs which are specifically referred to and specifically excluded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> The kernel of this issue, which I will go into shortly, is that the Government either wants to win this case or it does not.  The Minister of State said during Question Time that &ldquo;the Sellafield situation is unacceptable&rdquo;.  If he believes that he must want to win this case.  We do not want a cheapskate case, we want a winnable case and that is what this is all about.  It is not a case of getting rid of a group of residents and getting this issue out of the way for the next six months.  It is about winning the case, having won the right of jurisdiction arising out of the Barrington case.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the opening statement which set out the Government position, when the Minister of State was asked by the individuals about what happened to the Fianna Fáil promise, he said that this was a Government decision and he had to implement it.  I have heard rumours today that this motion will be accepted by the Government. I have also heard outrageous rumours that the Minister of State is being hung out to dry, that he should not have made that statement at the meeting.  It is clear from the verbatim report that the Minister of State acted totally in good faith and in accordance with the Government decision. If there is to be a U-turn on the Government decision, let it be on the heads of the Government and not on the head of the hapless Minister of State who is merely passing on the messages from the Cabinet table.</P>
    <P>The following question was asked by Mr. MacGuill:</P>
    <P>Mr. MacGuill: So, therefore, it is now clear that this is also to be included in the £200,000 offered in full and final settlement of the State's commitment to full public funding, is that so?  Minister, is that so?</P>
    <P>Minister Jacob: That is so.</P>
    <P>We cannot say that was not the final position. That is what was rejected by the LRG.  They could not accept the £200,000 as the full and final settlement.  We cannot get away from that.  It could not be more explicit.  The transcript goes on to detail each item to which I have referred &mdash; the health researcher, Mr. Large, the nuclear physicist, etc.  On being asked about the Government promise, the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, stated:</P>
    <P>The position with regard to that, and I want to make it very clear, is that this has been put forward by the Government, all aspects of it. My Department and the Government has considered this whole issue comprehensively on two occasions, on three, in fact, in the last eight or nine weeks and has come to a decision and that is the decision.  That is where I am coming from.</P>
    <P>On page 33 of the transcript the Minister of State further states:</P>
    <P>I have addressed that in the best way I can to you.  I am dealing with a Government decision here.  Where I am coming from here, I have sought the Government decision, I have <Col N="733" /> the Government decision, I am dealing with it, I have put it in its entirety here before us.</P>
    <P>I am fascinated to know how it is possible to reconcile those statements with any other position.</P>
    <P>I want to quote from page 37 of the transcript where the Assistant Secretary in the Department states: &ldquo;We can not expose ourselves to more than £200,000&rdquo;.  There are many other salacious quotes I could choose from the document but I want to allow the House to debate the motion in full.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that in putting down this motion, the House cannot debate this matter again for six months.  I am not a total sceptic but I am a little cautious.  The next six months are critical because there is the threat of British Nuclear Fuels engaging in counter litigation, given that it has had a year to prepare the case. It may say put up or shut up, the case may drag on and may be lost by default.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to state specifically what he understands the words &ldquo;necessary financial assistance&rdquo; in the motion to mean.  In other words, will it include over and above the £200,000 which would only be sufficient for research?  Will it deal separately with the appointment of a health researcher, including the necessary backup, and the appointment of an information technology consultant so that information can be stored on computerised hardware and software in Dundalk?  Will he indicate that it will deal with the question of the nuclear physicist's report?  It must be remembered that while the State had costs awarded against it, only 20 per cent of LRG's legal costs to date have been met.</P>
    <P>I have found the residents group to be reasonable and flexible.  Even if the Minister of State did not give a damn about the case, it would be possible to save taxpayers' money by concluding that money spent should be in support of the case rather than the Government being in the position of a co-defendant.</P>
    <P>I referred to Deputy Gormley earlier but I see Deputy Sargent is in the Chamber.  I propose to share my time with Deputy Frances Fitzgerald and Deputy Sargent.</P>
    <P>I thank the Independent Deputies.  They are an assorted but friendly group of people.  I wrote to them and the two Deputies present have been helpful and constructive in the interests of resolving the problems of this group.  They have worked with me on this matter.  This is not a cynical political motion.  It is a constructive attempt to resolve a real and urgent problem.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by congratulating Deputy Yates on putting forward this motion which can play an important role in resolving the impasse that has arisen between the residents group and the Government.  That impasse must be resolved.  There is currently a great deal of cynicism about politics.  There has been much talk about the cost of tribunals to the taxpayer.  I do not have the slightest doubt that the public would <Col N="734" /> support money being given to the Louth Residents Group to effectively fight this case.  There is strong public support for what they are doing. Given that this is probably the most important environmental issue this country will ever face, supporting the LRG is good value for money.</P>
      <P>The more one examines what this group has done, the more extraordinary is its story and I have no doubt it will be written about in the future as an example of citizens empowering themselves and using the legal process to ensure that an issue about which they are concerned is addressed.  The members of this group have nothing to gain but the community will gain as a result of highlighting a dangerous facility which could have unknown consequences for this country. It is extraordinary that the Government task force on Sellafield no longer exists.  Why is this the case?  The rainbow Government adopted a vigilant and proactive approach to Sellafield.  I congratulate the ministerial task force and the former Ministers, Deputies Stagg and Gilmore, for the proactive approach they adopted to this issue and for not standing idly by.  The former Minister, Deputy Stagg, gave evidence at a hearing on a planning decision, the first time a Government Minister had done so.  If the then Government had sent a representative to the first hearing on Sellafield in 1977 and had adopted a proactive approach then we might not be dealing with the present difficulties in regard to this plant.</P>
      <P>The Government has gone into reverse gear in terms of dealing with what is probably the most serious environmental issue confronting us.  We should use every means at our disposal to lobby British Ministers.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, whose British counterpart, Dr. Jack Cunningham, is MP for the area, must adopt a proactive approach to this issue.  The Minister is responsible for the protection of our food and there is an onus on him to pursue this issue as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>There is ever growing concern about the increase in leukaemia, cancer and mental handicap. I do not want to be a scaremonger but adequate funding must be provided for research. The State has a great opportunity to be seen to support its citizens in a partnership way by giving adequate funding to this group to carry out the necessary research.  If we are serious about putting forward the strongest possible case with the best back-up and research then the Louth group must be given adequate resources.  The amounts we are talking about are not prohibitive.  The issue demands that such funding be provided. There are such serious concerns about Sellafield that it is incumbent on us to support this local group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Sellafield was closed in February 1996 because of the weather I voiced my concern about accidents at the plant.  It is very disturbing to note that in one year there were 15 accidents about which we know.  Our greatest concern is that there will be a serious accident at Sellafield. As we know from the Chernobyl incident, there <Col N="735" /> are no boundaries when it comes to dealing with the consequences of nuclear accidents.  Every day people voice their concern about pollution of the sea and leaks from shipments of nuclear waste from all over the world to Sellafield.  This raises the necessity to pursue this case not only legally but also diplomatically.  Will the Minister say if this case is being pursued diplomatically and if other countries have been informed of our concerns so that they will no longer send their nuclear waste to Sellafield?  We know the Irish Sea is heavily contaminated and are concerned about the consequences of this.</P>
    <P>The problems of Sellafield continue to grow and multiply.  We are worried about the very old reactors at the plant.  The cost of decommissioning one reactor is £1 billion.  There is a strong case for the Government to support this motion and the residents in their legal battle.  It must provide adequate resources to the group so that it can carry out the necessary research which will help it in its legal case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for sharing their time with me.  I welcome this motion and congratulate Fine Gael on tabling it.  The Green Party raised this matter on the Adjournment and it is timely to follow it up with a wider and more substantive debate.</P>
      <P>What has brought us to this point is the failure of Fianna Fáil to honour the commitment in its election manifesto that: &ldquo;In Government Fianna Fáil will ensure that the case taken by the Dundalk residents is fully funded and, if required, appealed to a higher court&rdquo;.  If, as the Minister of State indicated, this will not happen then the only explanation I can think of is that Fianna Fáil lied when it put this commitment in print or the Progressive Democrats Party said it could not do this. If either explanation is true then the Government is not fit to govern as it has lost its credibility.  I hope that question is answered in the debate.</P>
      <P>If the Government was to follow through on its commitment it would be the first Government to accept this liability.  I would congratulate it if it adopted this course of action.  It is time for all parties to get off the fence and bring to an end the fancy word games on the issue of Sellafield which have resulted in almost no action being taken.  The people in BNFL know that apart from some tweaking at the discharge licences there has effectively been no action.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, must have put the fear of God into BNFL on 30 September when, in reply to a question about the Government's view on increased discharges, he stated, &ldquo;My Department has reserved the right to make further detailed comments on both aerial and liquid discharge authorisations when the UK Government environment agency issues its draft authorisations&rdquo;.  Detailed comments will hardly strike fear in a legal opponent and it is time the Government got real about Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> On the STAD case, the Government has gone from a position of fully funding the case to an incredible statement by a spokesperson for the Minister at the meeting referred to by Deputy Yates that, &ldquo;It is STAD's primary responsibility to pursue the case&rdquo;.  However, it is the State which has the primary responsibility as it is the State and its public who are threatened and deeply affected in terms of their health and economic prospects.  Later at the same meeting the Minister told the solicitor representing STAD, &ldquo;Obviously I think your level of expectation was very high&rdquo;.  However, it is no higher than what was indicated in the promise given prior to the election.  It is time to review what happened at that meeting and for the Government to come clean and live up to this real expectation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this is not the worst example of Government deception to date.  For example, even the £200,000 offer had strings attached to it. No commitment was given as to when it would be paid &mdash; it was all conditional &mdash; or what it was for.  We were left with the feeling that funding would be provided, yet we were given very little to clutch at.  The Government claims there is already research into certain areas of radiation, yet it is not prepared to tell the group exactly what the areas are or to give it access to the research.  This makes life more difficult for these people who have voluntarily given up so much of their lives and resources to pursue this case.</P>
    <P>THORP is an environmental nightmare.  We remember the fire at Windscale 40 years ago and are aware of what can happen at THORP.  We also remember that THORP has increased its Krypton 85 gas output tenfold per annum.  The 1977 Windscale inquiry told BNFL to retain that gas and not to release it, but it is being released. Shipments have been increased, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is being destabilised and this State is effectively a hostage to THORP and will be until we deal with the general question of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to fund this case fully.  The people of Cumbria and of England will thank our Government for doing so.  When I was arrested for protesting at Sellafield, the civility with which I was treated by the British police showed me that our Government must work on behalf of the people of Cumbria and Britain as well as its own people.  The British Government has sold out its people on this issue and this will cost future generations dearly unless we act now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob) Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has decided to accept the motion tabled by the Opposition. I will put this matter in perspective in view of the statements from the Opposition and its vastly changed stance since it left Government. At all times the previous Government sought to have the State removed as defendants in the case. Deputy Yates mentioned U-turns but he has made a major U-turn on his previous viewpoint. The previous Government approved £100,000 <Col N="737" /> research funding for this case notwithstanding the contents of a letter, mentioned by Deputy Yates, which the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, wrote on the eve of the general election.  I do not have the letter to hand but I read it carefully and it is clear in my mind.  It stated the then Minister would propose to Government that the offer of £100,000 be increased to £200,000.  That never happened so £100,000 was all that was offered to the County Louth residents in respect of research for their case.</P>
      <P>The scale of the Windscale fire of 1957 highlighted the potential yet real threat posed to Ireland by the UK nuclear industry.  In the intervening years successive Irish Governments have pursued vigorous campaigns directed at securing the earliest closure of Sellafield.  These campaigns have included several examinations of whether recourse to legal action against BNFL was viable.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that this Government will keep under review the question of taking a legal action against BNFL in respect of the risk to Ireland from Sellafield.  That risk is mainly represented by the ever-present possibility of an accident at the plant resulting in serious radioactive contamination to Ireland.  There is also public concern about the environmental hazard of Sellafield discharges even though in recent years the impact of liquid discharges to the Irish Sea has reduced significantly since the relatively high levels in the mid 1970s.</P>
      <P>It may be asked why a legal action has not been mounted to date by any Government despite receiving the attention of several Ministers and Attorneys General.  As the Opposition knows from its last experience in Government, litigation against BNFL raises complex technical and legal issues.  This Government will continue to draw upon the best scientific and legal advice before deciding on litigation of such a challenging nature.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State I have given urgent attention to the question of financial assistance to the County Louth residents. The House will be aware that the four County Louth residents' independent action against BNFL names the State as co-defendant on the basis that, in the view of the residents, the State has not been as vigorous as it should have been in resisting THORP.  The State's own examination of possible legal action and the fact that the State itself is a co-defendant raises policy dilemmas which the Government has had to resolve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 6 October, I met the residents and offered them, on behalf of the Government, financial assistance in the amount of £200,000 for research purposes towards their case.  Since then, I said in the public arena on a number of occasions that I found those people sincere and courageous in their actions.  I appreciate the financial risks they are running and my admiration for them is high. I told them the Government recognises that they have won the right to a substantive action against <Col N="738" /> BNFL, but I pointed out that it was their responsibility to prosecute the case.  Bearing in mind their independent freedom of action and in an effort to be co-operative and supportive of the residents' efforts, particularly in their attempts to assemble research, I made a bona fide offer of financial assistance subject to the State being removed as co-defendant in their action.  This offer allowed the residents complete discretion to identify the precise research which they see as a priority relating to their conduct of the case.  I also told them that other Departments and the RPII would make themselves available to advise and assist them regarding the content and scope of research they may wish to undertake.</P>
    <P>Further Government assistance was offered relating to the computerised management of the great volume of documents contained in my Department's affidavit of discovery and this assistance would be extended to any other State documents included in the discovery process.  I believe the House should recognise the positive aspects of the Government's willingness to fund research while giving complete discretion to the residents to select those elements of research which they see as most relevant to the pursuit of their case.</P>
    <P>Since my meeting with the County Louth residents the Government has been considering its response to the residents' rejection of the offer I made them on 6 October last.  Because of the Government's wish to be as helpful and co-operative as possible to the residents &mdash; I have sought to use terminology such as &ldquo;helpful&rdquo;, &ldquo;co-operative&rdquo; and &ldquo;supportive&rdquo; in dealing with this matter &mdash; it has asked me to initiate further discussions with the residents about the level of support which would be appropriate.  In any public statements since that meeting, to which I exhorted the residents to come, I always called that our &ldquo;first&rdquo; meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to having the opportunity to meet the residents again to discuss this support as early as possible.</P>
      <P>In addition to possible legal remedies there is a range of opportunities at bilateral and international level to further our interests, articulate our views and bring about change for the benefit of our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986, there was greater global recognition of nuclear power's potential for damage to health and the environment.  There is growing recognition too of the difficulties associated with disposing of a legacy of 50 years of radioactive waste.  Ireland and many other states have rejected the nuclear energy option. We recognise however that more than half of our EU partners and many of the major western and eastern industrial nations have opted to use <Col N="739" /> nuclear power for electricity generation.  Increasingly also many developing countries, including India, China and Pakistan, see nuclear power as a vital component of their energy policy.  How does a non-nuclear country such as Ireland deal with the pace of growth in the worldwide use of nuclear power?  How do we combat proponents of nuclear power who point out that the low CO2 emissions of nuclear plants are the answer to global warming which is the great environmental challenge facing us in the 21st century?</P>
    <P>In common with other like-minded non-nuclear countries, we actively participate in those international organisations which can shape an improved international safety culture in the use of nuclear power.  We believe that the states which have opted for the use of nuclear power have an obligation to ensure the highest standards of safety and radiological protection are employed.  The Government is committed to giving absolute priority to promotion of an effective international nuclear safety culture with wide adherence by nuclear states, operators and national regulatory bodies.</P>
    <P>Recently Ireland played an active role in the negotiation and conclusion of three new international conventions which will enhance nuclear safety worldwide and which represent the type of significant international commitment which Ireland and other non-nuclear states have been trying to establish for many years.  Ireland was among one of the first signatories of the International Convention on Nuclear Safety which was drawn up under the auspices of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency.  The convention became effective for Ireland on the date of its entry into force, 24 October 1996.  The aim of the Nuclear Safety Convention is to ensure all landbased civil nuclear installations are safe, well regulated and environmentally sound, to promote a high level of nuclear safety worldwide and to strengthen international co-operation in the field of nuclear safety.</P>
    <P>Under the convention, each contracting party is required to take adequate national measures to ensure nuclear safety and to report to the other contracting parties on the measures taken.  The convention will present Ireland with a unique opportunity to participate in a nuclear safety &ldquo;peer review&rdquo; process every three years.  The review will assess how participating countries are complying with the obligations of the convention. Furthermore, it will provide Ireland with an opportunity to query the country reports of the UK and others in relation to their compliance with the convention.  We see this convention as a major breakthrough in fostering a global nuclear safety culture and providing a forum for extensive information exchange on nuclear safety matters.</P>
    <P>In September this year Ireland was again among the first signatories of a new Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. <Col N="740" /> This convention places new and extensive obligations on contracting parties such as provisions relating to general safety requirements, siting, design, construction and operation of facilities and disposal of spent fuel and radioactive waste.  The convention establishes a &ldquo;peer review&rdquo; process similar to that applicable to the Nuclear Safety Convention.</P>
    <P>A significant feature of the new convention, and one in which Ireland was active in negotiating, relates to the inclusion within its scope of reprocessing facilities such as those at Sellafield. Contracting parties can make a voluntary declaration that reprocessing is an intrinsic part of spent fuel management.  I welcome the UK's commitment to the effect that it would voluntarily extend the convention's scope to reprocessing activities. From an Irish perspective it will be possible to address public concerns about UK reprocessing facilities, in particular the THORP plant at Sellafield during peer review meetings.</P>
    <P>The new joint convention also obliges neighbouring countries to consult countries in close proximity on the siting of proposed facilities. These consultation obligations are relevant to Ireland's long-standing objections to the siting of new radioactive waste disposal facilities in Britain.  On its entry into force the convention will give firm backing to consultations by the UK with Ireland on such facilities.</P>
    <P>Another convention which was also adopted in September this year relates to the issue of nuclear liability.  Ireland as a non-nuclear country has a clear interest in securing the widest possible liability regime to include the operators, insurance companies and the installation states concerned. This regime should provide for the highest possible levels of compensation and simple, effective, speedy and impartial mechanisms for settling claims.</P>
    <P>The Chernobyl accident and its trans-boundary effects revealed the inadequacy of existing nuclear liability law with many countries unable to obtain adequate compensation for the damage caused by the accident.  In September this year, under the auspices of the UN, a protocol to revise the existing Vienna Convention on Compensation for nuclear damage and a new Convention on Supplementary Compensation for nuclear damage were adopted.  The new instruments will provide increased funds for compensation for nuclear damage.  They also provide for an enhanced definition of nuclear damage, inclusion of environmental damage and economic loss, increased operator liability limits and longer time limits for bringing claims.</P>
    <P>However, while we are pleased agreement has been reached on the new instruments, Ireland remains concerned about the adequacy of the funding to be made available to victims of nuclear damage under the protocol and the new convention. We would have preferred to have seen the inclusion of a system of unlimited liability whereby all nuclear damage would have been compensated, but it was only possible to gain <Col N="741" /> agreement on limited, albeit increased funding. Notwithstanding these concerns, it is my sincere hope that the protocol and the convention will provide a framework for the modernisation and strengthening of the international nuclear liability regime and thereby improve nuclear safety internationally.</P>
    <P>While the new conventions will make a significant contribution to nuclear safety, we cannot rely on them exclusively.  We must, by means of bilateral contacts with the UK authorities and supported by our emergency preparedness programme, be in healthy readiness to deal with risks associated with a nuclear accident and be equipped to protect the Irish population from the potentially harmful effects of radioactive contamination.  If the circumstances are right, we may also be obliged to have recourse to litigation with the objective of preventing or ending nuclear activities which present a risk to our citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years, the expansion of the Sellafield complex and its nuclear activities have been a cause of concern to successive Governments. These concerns relate to the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at Sellafield's THORP plant, the ageing Magnox reactors, and the ongoing question of radioactive discharges from Sellafield into the aerial and marine environment.  There has been consistent opposition by successive Governments to the THORP reprocessing plant which began operations in 1994.  The plant, which reprocesses spent nuclear fuel in order to extract uranium and plutonium for reuse, was recently granted permission by the UK nuclear installations inspectorate to operate at full capacity. The Government opposes the continuation and expansion of these reprocessing activities, particularly because of the risk of an accident.  In addition, the plant's reprocessing activities can only serve to increase proliferation risk and cause potential hazard because of the transport of spent fuel to Sellafield and plutonium back to the country of origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the RPII that the most significant risk to Ireland from a nuclear accident overseas would arise from atmospheric releases from an installation in the UK or elsewhere in Europe. In recognition of this risk, long-standing agreed arrangements are in place whereby my Department is notified of incidents of a radiological nature as soon as the UK authorities are informed by the British nuclear operators.  Generally, the notification arrangements have been working satisfactorily since 1986, although I would like to see the scope of formally notifiable incidents extended to include incidents not involving a release of radioactivity.  This matter is being addressed in the context of discussions with the UK authorities on the establishment of a formal bilateral agreement on nuclear safety and radiation <Col N="742" /> protection matters which will formalise incident notifications.</P>
    <P>The Government, for its part has prepared a plan of action in the event of a nuclear accident. The main elements of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents are published in a booklet available from my Department.  The plan is designed to provide a rapid and effective response to accidents involving the release or potential release of radioactive substances into the environment which could give rise to radiation exposure.  The national emergency plan outlines the measures in place to assess and mitigate the effects of nuclear accidents which occur in the UK or elsewhere and which might pose a radiological hazard to Ireland.  As Minister responsible for nuclear safety matters, I am responsible for the emergency plan and for ensuring the co-ordination of the responsibilities and functions of relevant Government Departments, the RPII and local authorities.</P>
    <P>Emergency preparedness is underpinned by a constant monitoring programme carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. This programme includes measurements of radioactivity levels in air, on the ground, in live sheep, foodstuffs and in a range of samples from the seas around Ireland.  I am advised by the RPII that their current monitoring programme enables a healthy state of readiness to be maintained so that a rapid and effective response can be provided in the event of a nuclear emergency.  The vital co-operative emergency arrangements with our EU partners are tested every six to eight weeks.  At least one of these every year includes the transfer of simulated radiological data between EU member states.  Ireland participates in all of these tests and the experiences gained to date have led to improvements in the international arrangements.</P>
    <P>In November 1996 and April this year the RPII took part in the international desktop exercise INEX 2, organised by the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  INEX 2 comprises a series of international exercises to take place in 1996, 1997 and 1998.  Over 30 countries, the European Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency have participated in INEX 2 to date.  In Ireland's case, the INEX 2 exercise proved to be helpful in reviewing the operation of our plan.</P>
    <P>Following the recent emergency exercises, a fundamental review of existing arrangements is currently being undertaken by my Department and the RPII and some procedural and practical improvements have been suggested.  While it is my sincere hope that I will not be called upon to initiate the national emergency plan, it is my intention to ensure we are adequately prepared and can provide an effective and speedy response to any nuclear incident.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that radioactive discharges from Sellafield have declined significantly since the mid-1970s, but any discharges are objectionable. <Col N="743" /> In November and December 1996 BNFL applied to the UK Environment Agency for a variation of the aerial and liquid discharge authorisations from Sellafield.  While the significance of the changes for Ireland in radiological terms is likely to be small, any additional contamination of the environment must be opposed. I have reserved the right of the Irish Government to make a detailed submission on the aerial and liquid discharge variations when the Environmental Protection Agency issues its draft authorisations for public consultation.</P>
    <P>In July 1997 BNFL's chairman wrote to me concerning Sellafield's radioactive discharges and announced that BNFL had withdrawn its application for increased gaseous tritium emissions from the THORP plant.  While I welcome this partial improvement, I have called upon BNFL for a greater reduction in discharge levels for all radionuclides using the application of best available abatement technologies so that all atmospheric and marine emissions are kept as low as possible and ultimately eliminated.</P>
    <P>The recently reported steep increases in the levels of the radionuclide technetium-99 in lobsters and other shellfish in areas of the Irish Sea close to Sellafield have received media attention. While the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland indicates that this level does not represent a hazard to shellfish consumers, the institute is intensifying its programme of monitoring of technetium-99 in the Irish marine environment.</P>
    <P>The question of radioactive discharges from Sellafield was raised by Ireland at a recent joint meeting of the Oslo-Paris Commission for Pollution in the North East Atlantic.  Ireland tabled a motion, co-sponsored by Denmark, calling for a reduction in technetium-99 discharges from Sellafield to the Irish Sea.  As a result, the UK is to report on how it is complying with its obligations under the convention.  I hope to meet the UK Minister for the Environment, Mr. Michael Meacher, soon to discuss a wide range of nuclear-related matters, including the question of aerial and liquid discharges into the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Among the Government's concerns is the safety of the long-term storage of highly radioactive liquid waste in tanks at Sellafield.  High radioactive waste stems directly from reprocessing. The RPII has identified the tanks as posing the greatest risk of an accident at Sellafield.  The liquid waste is stored in 21 tanks awaiting vitrification, a process whereby liquid high level radioactive waste is processed into glass blocks for long-term storage.  In my view, the tank emptying programme needs to be accelerated and the third vitrification line needs to be brought into operation as soon as possible so that waste will be vitrified at the same rate at which it is created. Officials at my Department have raised the matter at bilateral meetings with their UK counterparts and the matter is being investigated further.</P>
    <P>The House may be aware of a proposal by British Nuclear Fuels to commission a new nuclear <Col N="744" /> fuel production plant at Sellafield.  The new fuel is called MOX and is a mixture of plutonium and uranium.  It will be used for conventional reactors and the bulk of the plutonium is expected to come from the fuel reprocessed from the UK's Magnox reactors at Sellafield and from the new THORP plant.  This is apparently the final justification for producing yet more plutonium, although the world has already stockpiled more than it can ever peacefully use.  The UK Environment Agency has engaged in a consultation process relating to the justification for the commissioning and operation of Sellafield's MOX plant.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length with the Government's efforts to promote an international safety culture for the benefit of our citizens and the actions we are taking to protect our citizens from the environmental hazard of nuclear power activities in the UK and elsewhere.  This is being done to provide a broad view of Government policy on radiological protection in so far as the nuclear industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>The most immediate issue raised in the motion is support for the County Louth residents who are making a committed stand on nuclear matters.  I hope to arrange a meeting in the near future with the County Louth residents to discuss financial assistance and other support in light of their responsibility to prosecute the case.  I trust that these contacts will be fruitful and that I will have positive news on my discussions when I next have the opportunity to speak to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Half way through this century scientists split the atom and declared to the world that, when the energy released was harnessed, an unlimited supply of free, clean energy would be available.  Scientists were wrong as they have been before and since.</P>
      <P>The first manifestation of that massive energy was displayed when it was used to vaporise over 1,000,000 men, women and children when atom bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The post-war period led to a nuclear arms race between the superpowers and enough weapons were produced to wipe out the human race and all life on the planet ten times over.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the so called peaceful use of nuclear power was developed to produce electricity. This &lsquo;peaceful use&rsquo; was closely associated with the arms industry and was cloaked in secrecy; the hope of clean, free energy was cruelly dashed.  Instead, we got a proliferation of nuclear weapons and power stations which supplied neither free nor clean electricity.  These stations produced waste which can neither be stored safely nor neutralised.  It is waste with which scientists cannot deal.  These stations, which appeared like mushrooms all over the industrialised world, were belching poisonous radioactive materials into the atmosphere, regardless of the effects on humanity or the environment.  Once these stations were put in place there was no knowledge as to how they would or could be decommissioned.</P>
      <P>We then had a series of nuclear accidents &mdash; the explosion at Three Mile Island in 1979, the fire at Windscale in 1957 and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.  There has also been a litany of lesser accidents.  The effects of the nuclear disasters at Three Mile Island and Windscale were shrouded in secrecy and, 40 years later, we are only now getting information as to the health and environmental effects.</P>
      <P>Chernobyl is in a different category.  While there has been a degree of official denial, the Chernobyl Children's Project ensured that the scale of that tragedy and the effects of the resultant radiation on children, in particular, were known.  The world was aghast at the scale and seriousness of the disaster and the nuclear lobby was dealt a near fatal blow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All political parties are opposed to nuclear power and Ireland has taken an honourable stand on nuclear disarmament.  However, it has long been recognised that it is not just nuclear nations <Col N="746" /> that are at risk from radioactive pollution.  Ireland and other nuclear free countries are equally at risk.  Radioactive clouds know no boundaries as was evidenced by the accidents at Windscale and Chernobyl.  Our people are at as much risk from nuclear power as those living in the shadow of the cooling towers.  Hence our concern arising from the nuclear complex at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The Sellafield complex on the west coast of Cumbria, about 100 miles east of Ireland, contains a British Nuclear Fuels reprocessing plant. Spent nuclear fuel is recycled to extract uranium and plutonium for civil and military use.  The new THORP plant which opened in 1994 forms part of the complex.  There are also four magnox reactors called Calder Hall on the site as well as a vitrification plant for high level radioactive waste. There are 21 large tanks holding highly active liquid waste awaiting vitrification.</P>
    <P>How are these installations a threat to the health and well-being of the Irish people?  The magnox reactors are 40 years old and are past their sell-by date.  They are of an inferior design and are vulnerable to terrorist attack or air crashes.  They have been kept in commission simply to save the very high cost of decommissioning, estimated at £1 billion each.  If that cost was factored into the price of electricity it would be far from cheap.  The consequences of a reactor exploding or being blown up would be disastrous for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister of State, I am seriously concerned about the safety of the long-term storage of highly active radioactive waste in tanks at Sellafield.  The UK regulatory authority has also voiced its anxiety about storage arrangements at Sellafield.  The liquid waste is stored in 21 tanks awaiting vitrification, a process whereby the product is turned into glass.  The backlog will not be cleared until 2015.  The situation is totally unacceptable and an accident at even one of the tanks would have catastrophic consequences for Ireland.  These tanks must be cooled at all times or they will explode.  If the cooling system failed, there would be a chain reaction explosion of all 21 tanks that would make the Chernobyl and Windscale disasters fade into insignificance.  If this occurred, and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has identified it as the greatest risk to Ireland, there would be large numbers of immediate deaths in the country; there would be long-term deaths from cancers; our agriculture would be permanently wiped out and our tourism industry would end.  This is how serious the problem is.</P>
    <P>There is pervasive and corrosive pollution of the Irish Sea and the environment caused by the daily radioactive emissions from this nuclear complex. No level of emission is acceptable and I am glad to hear the Minister reiterating this.  It must stop and it is the Minister's job to see that it does.</P>
    <P>There is a large volume of evidence to demonstrate that these radioactive pollutants have caused serious illness among Irish people and as recently as this month new evidence to this effect <Col N="747" /> came to light.  Further research is required and it should not be left to a few Irish citizens to provide it.  Research will cost millions of pounds but it will be money well spent as our future may depend upon it.  We should also be aware that British Nuclear Fuels and the international nuclear lobby have unlimited funds available to them.  The Government cannot ask private citizens to do this work for them.  It should, in consultation with the Dundalk residents, carry out detailed health studies, specialised engineering studies and more detailed atmospheric and environmental studies.  Above all, the Government must resolve to take action.  That resolve seems to be lacking in this Administration. However, earlier last year Fianna Fáil, aware of the widespread public concern about Sellafield and in what we now know was a purely cynical, vote getting exercise, inserted the following into their election manifesto:</P>
    <P>In Government, Fianna Fáil will ensure that the case taken by the Dundalk residents is fully funded and, if required, appealed through the higher courts.  In Government, Fianna Fáil will provide the financial and scientific resources to comprehensively research the effects on health and safety in Ireland of the operation of Sellafield et al.</P>
    <P>That message could not be clearer or more positive. It was widely welcomed, particularly by the Dundalk residents and won support for the Fianna Fáil candidates in the general election. The Progressive Democrats also jumped on that bandwagon.  The previous Government who were involved in ongoing discussions with the Dundalk residents had already indicated that an unconditional £200,000 was available.</P>

      <P>What was that decision?  The Government who had promised full funding for the legal case decided no assistance, not a single penny, would be provided for legal costs.  No payment of any kind would be made unless the residents drastically changed the nature of their case. An absolute cap would be placed on the £200,000 <Col N="748" /> offered as an interim payment by the previous Government or in the words of the Minister of State &ldquo;full and final settlement&rdquo;.  Even this paltry sum could only be spent on research approved by the Government and was tied up with red tape to a degree that would make its use nearly impossible.</P>
      <P>This is a betrayal of the Dundalk residents, the general public who accepted the Minister's undertaking and those who have fought against the might of British Nuclear Fuels.  I oppose this betrayal and I will not let Fianna Fáil forget its spectacular U-turn.  Where was the Minister, who was vocal on this issue, when it was decided to jettison the Dundalk residents?</P>

      <P>There is so much public concern about Sellafield that I feel it necessary to fund research to investigate the long-term consequences of radiation for current and future generations of Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil environmental policy document published before the election indicated that when in Government Fianna Fáil would ensure the case taken by the Dundalk residents would be fully funded and, if required, would be appealed through the courts.  That was a clear promise from Fianna Fáil prior to the election.  I call on that party to fulfil that commitment and not to let down the people of Dundalk.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fox is to be complimented for her forthright and plain statement.  I understand she has contacted the Taoiseach and, borrowing a phrase from the Tánaiste, has expressed her grave concern.  She has been assured the matter was considered by the Government and the decision we heard from the Minister of State was conveyed to her.  I accept Deputy Fox's genuine concern for the Dundalk residents and the issue of radioactive pollution.  It was in that context that she spoke out.  I am sure she and others are as shocked as I am by this brutal betrayal, this unbelievable U-turn and by the fact that the Government expected her to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fox has more power in this matter than the entire Opposition.  She should not be taken for granted.  She should use the power given to her by the people and make sure this dastardly decision and betrayal is reversed.  I ask Deputy Fox to vote for this motion and to withhold her <Col N="750" /> support from the Government until it reverses its decision and honours its solemn promise to the Dundalk residents and to the Irish people to fully fund the legal and research costs of the case against BNFL.  If she does this she will have done a good day's work and sent a message that she cannot be taken for granted.</P>

      <P>It now seems the Government has made yet another U-turn and is prepared to accept the motion before the House.  What does this mean?  It indicates that the Government does not know whether it is coming or going.  Before the election it was prepared to fully fund the case. After the election practically no funding was to be provided.  Now, a week later, we may be back to a full funding commitment, although I am not sure.  It is said a week is a long time in politics but it would seem that an hour is a long time for this Government.</P>
      <P>I have the highest regard for the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, but this means he could be hung out to dry as the fall guy on this issue.

      <P>Does this mean we are back in the Haughey era when decisions taken by the House were blithely ignored by the Government?  The House will recall motions calling for funding for haemophiliacs who had contracted AIDS from blood transfusions which were passed by the House and ignored by the Government.  The Government must state in clear and unequivocal terms how it will proceed with this case.  It must inform the Dundalk residents how much money it will provide and for what.  It must accept responsibility for the damage it has done to the case and through misleading the residents.  The Government has sent clear signals to BNFL and the British authorities that Fianna Fáil is not and never has been serious about tackling Sellafield.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil cosied up to BNFL in private meetings in Dublin when, as Minister of State, I successfully opposed the building of a massive nuclear dump at Sellafield.  It is not to be trusted on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not able to be present this evening.  I would like my views to be conveyed to her.</P>
      <P>We all know that mergers lead to rationalisation and rationalisation invariably leads to job losses.  I am particularly worried about the so-called merger of the Avonmore/Waterford food groups which are primarily dairy groups.  I do not believe that rationalisation there will be based upon the relevant factor involved, namely, the efficiency of the various plants.  The dogs in the street are saying that the plants in Dungarvan and Kilmeaden, County Waterford, are those most likely to be adversely affected, if not closed.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that the rationalisation is carried out on the basis of the various plants' efficiency.  There are eight milk plants &mdash; if what I read in the finance page of yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> is correct &mdash; within the merged entity.  The Dungarvan and Kilmeaden plants are the two most likely to suffer in terms of job losses.  An overall figure of 1,000 jobs has been mentioned; that figure does not merely allude to the Dungarvan, Kilmeaden and Kilkenny operations; it also refers to other parts of the operation in Ireland and Britain.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister carry out an assessment to ensure that the efficient elements of the operation and the jobs, in particular, are retained? We, in Dungarvan, believe our plant is the most efficient in the merged group.  I use the word &ldquo;merged&rdquo; in inverted commas because we believe it is a virtual take-over by Avonmore of the Waterford Group with Avonmore calling the shots.  When it comes to redundancies, rationalisation and job shedding, it will be the Waterford end of the operation which will suffer, irrespective of its efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dungarvan operation, in particular, employs a considerable number of people because it is in the centre of a very large milk pool.  Dungarvan and County Waterford in general would be regarded as the premier milk producing area in all of Ireland.  Since 16 million gallons <Col N="752" /> of milk are produced per annum in the Dungarvan vicinity, it is incredible to think that milk would be moved 50 or 60 miles to a less efficient plant in north County Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>The Dungarvan and Kilmeaden plants produce value added products.  The Dungarvan plant produces lactic butter which is unique to any milk processing plant in Ireland; the product &mdash; all of which is exported &mdash; is the sole supplier of the German market.  The Kilmeaden plant produces Kilmeaden cheddar &mdash; familiar through the television advertisement &mdash; and a white cheese, which are also exported and are the utmost in value added products in the dairy industry.  We feel particularly aggrieved that there is talk of these two plants being closed down.  Where initially there was talk of voluntary redundancies, there is now talk of voluntary and compulsory redundancies. That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, last July the Minister gave her blessing to the merger.  That is why I am raising this matter tonight and why I regret she is not present.  I ask her to investigate and ensure that there is no victimisation based on parochial or regional grounds, and that everything is done according to the book.  We are entitled to that.</P>
    <P>I want to see the best components of the operation retained.  We accept that there will be job losses in a rationalisation plan but we want to see it done in an even handed manner.  I ask the Minister to oversee the manner in which the rationalisation is carried out and the way in which the redundancies are created, and to ensure that no favouritism is shown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for raising this matter.  I understand his reason for raising it and I recognise the common sense with which he has addressed the issue.</P>
      <P>I apologise for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who is with the Minister for Finance in Brussels conducting business on behalf of the State, and I am glad to take the issue on her behalf.</P>
      <P>The Deputy stressed that the Tánaiste, with almost everybody, gave her approval to the merger when it was announced because it was seen to be a progressive move.  I regret that there is now talk of redundancies this late in the day.</P>
      <P>I accept the way the Deputy put forward his argument, that, while he accepts some redundancies, he wants them based on a proper review of the whole procedure so that it will be seen to be fair and to take note of best practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Avonmore/Waterford Group is currently in the process of examining each sector of the business with a view to merging them into an efficient structure capable of competing successfully in the international marketplace.  The outcome of the assessment, into which the Deputy asked the Minister to inquire, on the future structure required for the various business units is not yet completed.  Consequently, it is still <Col N="753" /> too early to say what the jobs impact will be in existing plant locations.</P>
    <P>Rationalisation of the dairy industry is taking place internationally and Ireland is part of that. The Deputy will be aware that discussions are ongoing between the Avonmore/Waterford Group and the trades unions involved.  The Deputy can rest assured that the State industrial development agencies are monitoring the Avonmore/Waterford situation and that everything possible will be done to assist any potential redundant workers.  That is the strong commitment which was given by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's words struck a chord with me. He said that in the assessment which is being carried out the efficient proven elements should be retained.  In that regard, he put forward the Dungarvan and Kilmeaden plants, where there are a large number of people employed and there is access to a strong milk pool.  He hoped the assessment would be done fairly and on efficient rather than parochial or regional grounds.</P>
    <P>I shall bear the Deputies comments in mind when I am talking to the Tánaiste tomorrow and I will convey to her his strong opinions and comments on the matter.</P>

      <P>The purpose of raising this matter on the Adjournment is to get the Ballinspittle Garda station contract moving.  Everybody knows of Ballinspittle because of its moving statue, yet it seems virtually impossible to move this Government to get the work on its Garda station under way.</P>
      <P>In November 1996 approval was given by the last Government for the expenditure of over £42,000 on the necessary improvement work. However, all is quiet a year later on the Ballinspittle Garda station front.  Not a single nail has been driven; there has not been one iota of movement. As the seanchaí would say, things have rested so.  That is my concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having the village garda living in the area in which he or she polices is a sensible policy and has many advantages.  However, the married quarters in Ballinspittle were last occupied in 1988 and they are in a very bad state of repair. The last Government took action.  It appointed a married officer on a temporary basis to the Ballinspittle subdistrict last year.  A decision was made in November on the improvement expenditure and that officer was offered a permanent appointment.  He was prepared to accept it because he thought the work would be completed reasonably quickly.  There followed the necessary tendering.  Perhaps it is coincidental, but since the new Government came into office nothing has happened.  That is very unfair to the people of Ballinspittle who want their local garda and his family to live in the area.  There are the usual problems common to any village which need to be attended to and the people would feel happier <Col N="754" /> if this were done by a garda living in the married quarters attached to the Garda station.  They also want the work done to bring the Garda station up to date.  Apart from these problems, unusual problems arise now and again from the point of view of traffic congestion as there are ceremonies in Ballinspittle of which the Minister will be aware.</P>
    <P>It is also very unfair to the officer concerned. It is now a condition of his employment that he live in Ballinspittle, yet this Government will not have the work done to bring the married quarters up to scratch.  In the meantime he has to live in rented accommodation.  I am not sure of his personal circumstances but I understand that under Garda regulations, he must carry the expense of his rent.</P>
    <P>I understand that, by an amazing coincidence, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated locally through his colleague, the local Deputy, that finance was being made available for renovation and refurbishment and that the contract had gone to the Office of Public Works.  I would regard that as a breach of privilege but at the same time I want the work done. Whether it is a breach of privilege, it is sharp practice.  The Minister is not here to justify himself and the Minister of State is probably going to read that into the record.</P>
    <P>I have four questions for the Minister.  Why was there a delay of a year in getting the contract moving?  On what date will the work start?  On what date will it finish?  When can the Garda officer move in?  Although I have no instructions or brief from the garda concerned, I think I should raise the reimbursement of the rent paid by him.  The Government has some answering to do on this matter.  It is time to get work on the Ballinspittle Garda station moving.</P>

      <P>The Minister was aware that conditions at the station were less than adequate and he did something positive about it.  The Deputy will be glad to know that a contract for improvement works to the station and the married quarters, valued in excess of £65,000, was awarded last week to Kilmoney Constructions Limited, Carrigaline &mdash; last year's allocation would have been a bit short. These works include the following: reslating of the roof, replacing the ceilings, drylining of the walls, the provision of central heating, new windows in the married quarters and the station proper, built-in wardrobes, new kitchen units and bathroom fittings, new fencing around the site, and decoration of the premises.</P>

      <P>It is all good news for the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress that a great deal of work has been done in recent years in improving standards of accommodation at Garda stations right around the country.  It is, however, a large-scale operation.  This programme of improvement has a high priority with the Minister and with the Government.  This year, for instance, more than £9 million have been provided for the building and maintenance of Garda stations.  The Garda occupy 704 Garda stations and other accommodation, including married quarters, large complexes like Templemore and Garda Headquarters, and a variety of smaller units.  Many of the buildings occupied by them are old RIC and DMP stations designed for a different era.  Many need major upgrading or replacement.</P>
      <P>As I said, a great deal of work has been carried out in recent years and I am sure Members are aware of examples of improvements to Garda stations and of new stations built in recent years around the country.  The Deputy, I am sure, knows, for instance, that an extension and refurbishment works at Clonakilty district headquarters are nearing completion.  The Minister is very pleased to be in a position to say that work on Ballinspittle Garda station will commence next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this problem.  There seems to be a particular problem in Carlow this year where bangers are being put through letterboxes and so on.  I am sure that is great fun for the young people involved in it but it is not very funny for people who are advancing in years and are frightened by it.</P>
      <P>When I inquired what could be done about it I discovered we rely on section 80 of the Explosives Act, 1875, to deal with the throwing of fireworks etc.  I do not want to be a spoilsport as boys will boys and girls will be girls but it is important to be very careful when using fireworks and I do not want that part of the Act to be used very severely against young people, unless they deliberately throw fireworks into dangerous places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My worry is that we must rely on section 4 of the Explosives Act, 1883, to deal with those who have explosives in their possession or control.  It is over 100 years since the last legislation on fireworks was enacted and it is time to update that legislation.  Parents should be able to advise their children about the use of these items but, unfortunately, <Col N="756" /> in some cases they do not.  Apart from the annoyance they cause to elderly people, sometimes children also suffer.  One child recently lost some fingers as a result of playing with fireworks and another damaged their eye.</P>
    <P>These fireworks are imported from China.  I am sure that in 1875 and 1883 China had more to think about than the making of fireworks.  In my view, the standard of these fireworks is not what we would expect.</P>
    <P>I am raising this matter in the hope that new legislation will be enacted to deal with the sale of explosives and bangers.  They are not generally sold in shops but in open markets.  The Garda do a great job confiscating them &mdash; they recently confiscated £8,000 worth of fireworks in Athy &mdash; which saves people from injuring themselves while they are trying to have fun.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for raising this timely matter.  I know his concern in genuine.  Under the Explosives Act, 1875, which is operative in this instance, a licence is required to be issued by my Department for the importation of fireworks.  It is a longstanding policy that such licences are only issued for organised fireworks displays conducted by competent and professional operators.  Under such controlled conditions, injury and mishap are a rarity and rarely detracts from the enjoyment of the spectacle.</P>
      <P>Despite this restriction, it is clear that supplies of fireworks continue to be imported illegally into the State, especially leading up to and around the Hallowe&rsquo;en period and that they are finding their way into the hands of young people.  Much of what comes in is of dubious quality.  Unscrupulous individuals seek to flood the market with as many of these fireworks as they can sell in order to make a quick profit with no regard for the safety of the young people using them.</P>
      <P>At this time every year a concerted effort is made by the Garda Síochána to control the illegal possession, sale and use of fireworks.  Special measures are also taken in addition to the normal routine policing measures, which include attention to known trouble areas to deal with the problem, liaison with other services and arrangements for media publicity aimed at parents and teachers regarding the dangers of handling fireworks.  In addition, all divisions throughout the country have been advised to pay particular attention to this problem and the special Garda unit which operates in Dublin at this time each year has been increased.  Also, community police officers will visit schools to educate teachers and pupils on the dangers of fireworks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A close watch is kept by the Garda Síochána on this illegal trade and gardaí do not hesitate to act where necessary.  As a result, the gardaí have made significant seizures in recent years.  Through their vigilance amounts varying from £100,000 to £155,000 worth of fireworks were seized each year between 1993 and 1996 and subsequently destroyed.  This year the Garda are increasing their efforts in this clampdown on the pre-Hallowe&rsquo;en <Col N="757" /> trade.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Commissioner and the members of the force on their recently successful operations which included the confiscation of illegally imported fireworks in north Dublin with an estimated street value in excess of £500,000.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the current restrictive licensing policy allied to the seizures by the Garda is the best way of protecting the public from the inherent dangers of fireworks, while ensuring that it is not deprived of the enjoyment of the spectacle of fireworks operated by knowledgeable persons in a controlled environment.</P>
    <P>However, it is incumbent on us all to take a share of the responsibility with regard to this problem.  Vigilance cannot be left to the Garda alone and parents in particular, and adults in general, should ensure that their children are aware of the dangers imposed by fireworks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking the trouble to attend the House to respond to this matter.  Last Saturday, 2,000 applicants for asylum status were force to queue in the rain for periods of four hours to renew their identity cards at the headquarters of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  This is unacceptable. It is not good enough to keep any customer or individual waiting for that period.</P>
      <P>I am unable to accept that this matter could not have been handled better by means of a small amount of planning and thought.  Why could the Department not have staggered the registration process of these asylum seekers over a longer period? Why could the applicants not have been grouped so that they could be taken in slots of 50 or 100 at various stages over the weekend?  Why could it not have learned from the Department of Foreign Affairs which, a few years ago, produced an effective way of tackling the large numbers of people queueing for passports at the peak of the tourism season?  That problem appears to have been tackled effectively.</P>
      <P>I doubt if this treatment would be accepted or tolerated if Irish people were exposed to it.  The refugees must have felt completely humiliated last Saturday.  Their experience must have been made worse by the fact that they had to queue in the rain and that people took photographs of them in their misery.  I am sure people would be appalled if Irish men or women were subjected to this type of treatment in another country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The events last Saturday are another example of the ineffective manner in which the refugee problem is being handled.  The Department appears unable to cope with the increased number of people seeking refugee or asylum status.  I understand that approximately 60 cases a year were handled up to 1994 but in excess of 2,000 people are seeking asylum status at this point.  It is important procedures are put in place now to allow quick decisions to be reached in relation to these applicants.  It is wrong to keep asylum seekers <Col N="758" /> in a state of uncertainty for prolonged periods. It is also costly in terms of expenditure by the social services.</P>
    <P>The events of last Saturday are contrary to the objectives of the strategic management initiative for the Civil Service.  They are in total conflict with the aims of the SMI which has been in place for the past few years and is designed to achieve the delivery of an improved quality service to the public.  They make a mockery of the sentiments expressed by the previous Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, in the foreword to the latest SMI report.  I was encouraged by the remarks of the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, during today's Order of Business when he expressed his concern about the events on Saturday.  I hope his comments will trigger an appropriate response.</P>
    <P>The refugee problem has been allowed to fester for more than a year.  It was a major issue during the last general election for Deputies representing Dublin city centre constituencies.  It is time the problem was properly addressed through engaging sufficient and competent staff to process the backlog and attend to new applications in an efficient and speedy manner.  Approximately 90 per cent of the people who arrive in Ireland seeking asylum status will not be granted it.  This has been the experience to date in Ireland and also internationally.  It is most important that plans are made to deal effectively with applications as speedily as possible.  The current position is grossly unfair to people who will be accorded asylum status.  It is also unfair to those who will not qualify because they are kept waiting excessively long periods.  In addition, it is unfair to the overworked and under resourced staff of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who appear to find the entire process difficult to handle at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for raising this important issue and for the opportunity to outline the circumstances which gave rise to the events last Saturday and the previous Saturday.  On Saturday, 11 October, 727 identification cards were issued to asylum seekers.  A further 721 cards had been issued the previous Saturday.</P>
      <P>I wish to explain why the people concerned were asked to be at the Department in the first place.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for processing applications from persons seeking asylum in Ireland.  The Department issues each applicant admitted to the asylum process with an identification card.  This card is used by asylum seekers in their dealings with the Department and also with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most unfortunate that those concerned suffered any distress in the process.  There were, as one might expect, a number of contributory factors which led to the situation.  To facilitate the reissue of out of date identification cards and taking <Col N="759" /> account of the large number of asylum seekers involved, it was decided that the best way of dealing with the matter was to set aside a couple of days for the task.  A further consideration was the need to ensure that the day to day work of the asylum area of the Department, and the work of the Department as a whole, would not be unduly disrupted.  Yet another consideration was the fact that a significant number of asylum seekers change their addresses on a regular basis without informing the authorities.</P>
    <P>In light of these considerations and the fact that it was necessary to have access to the Department's files on the applicants, it was decided to reissue identification cards on Saturday, 4 October, and Saturday, 11 October.  Over the two days set aside for the real issue of identification cards only 1,450 people approximately turned up. A further 115 cards were issued yesterday and more turned up today: this has caused great difficulties in the Department as new applicants have to be processed at the same time.  In all, some 1,700 new cards have been issued over the past ten days.  This begs the question of where are the other 2,000 or so persons registered as asylum seekers.  One of the issues which arose over the past two Saturdays was the significant number of persons who were identified as making multiple applications for asylum.</P>
    <P>The problems facing this Department and other Departments and agencies of the State in the area of asylum are substantial.  At its core is the fact that for the most part this country is dealing not with a major influx of refugees but with a major influx of illegal immigrants.  The distinction is important.  A refugee is a person who has a well founded fear of persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality, etc.  Without wishing to prejudge the outcome of those applications awaiting processing, it is clear many of our so-called asylum seekers are economic migrants and/or illegal immigrants.  It must be noted that if one was to <Col N="760" /> operate on the basis of international comparisons alone, one would expect that something of the order of 10 per cent, or less, of asylum seekers would be granted refugee status at the end of the day.  Even if we were to be generous and say that 25 per cent of our applicants would obtain such status, only about 900 persons of the Department's current case load would obtain asylum status.  This problem leads to a situation where those people who are genuine refugees are suffering because of illegal immigration, some of which is clearly organised.</P>
    <P>In an effort to cope with the serious backlog of applications on hands, most of which dates back over the past 12 months, the Minister has obtained the agreement of his Cabinet colleagues to the recruitment of additional staff to process this backlog of cases and this recruitment process is in hands.  New accommodation is also being procured with the aim of providing badly needed additional space for the persons involved in processing asylum applications, better conditions for asylum seekers to present their cases and as a one-stop-shop for asylum seekers in their dealings with State agencies.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is being consulted on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring all cases are processed in accordance with our international obligations.</P>
    <P>Any distress caused last Saturday is regrettable. People should not have to undergo avoidable inconvenience when it comes to renewing identification cards.  Lessons have been learned and a better procedure will be in place when a mass reissue of cards is next required.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, wished to take this Adjournment but he is attending an international conference of European Justice Ministers in Prague on the subject of illegal immigration, trafficking in humans and related issues.</P>
    <P>I hope the reply is of assistance to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 15 October 1997.</P>

      <P>I have already dealt with aspects related to these questions in my reply to Priority Question No. 6 on today's order paper.</P>
      <P>The new Litter Pollution Act came into operation three months ago on 1 July.</P>
      <P>It provides a streamlined and expanded range of powers for local authorities to tackle the widespread problem of litter pollution.  It spells out more clearly what occupiers of property must do to keep their property free of litter.  It also sets out what local authorities must do as statutory authorities with responsibility for the prevention and control of litter in their own areas.</P>
      <P>The new legislation replaces the more limited Litter Act, 1982 and deals with the shortcomings that were identified by local authorities in the old legislation.  It is now a matter for local authorities to apply the new laws in their functional areas and my Department will be monitoring local authority progress in achieving this task.  I firmly believe that local authorities want to tackle the problems of litter pollution.  While I am confident that the new Act equips them with the necessary statutory powers for the purposes required, I will continue to monitor its operational effectiveness.</P>

      <P>Under section 63 of the Electoral Act, 1997, registration authorities are required to enter in the postal voters' list the name of every elector who applies to be so entered and satisfies the authority that the circumstances of the electors' occupation, service or employment are such as to render it likely that he or she will be unable to go in person on polling day to vote at the polling place for the polling district.  The closing date for entry in the postal voters' list is 25 November prior to the coming into force of the register of electors.</P>
      <P>The Act specifically provides that the terms &ldquo;service&rdquo; and &ldquo;employment&rdquo; include participation by a student in a full-time course of study in an educational institution in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1997 Act also amended the Electoral Act, 1992 to provide that an elector who qualifies for entry in the postal voters' list but who is not entered in the postal voters' list may apply for entry in a supplement to the list at any time during the currency of the relevant register of electors. Applications for entry in the supplement to <Col N="764" /> the postal voters' list must be received on or before the date of the dissolution of the Dáil in the case of a general election, and on or before the date of the order appointing polling day in the case of any other poll in order to have effect for the poll in question.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a report from Threshold suggesting that more than one in ten householders fell behind with their mortgage repayments in 1996 and that three houses per week are being repossessed by building societies; the steps, if any, he will take to address the problem of spiralling house prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The overall trend in mortgage arrears has been downwards in recent years.  The reference in the Threshold report to households in arrears is somewhat misleading as it includes cases where payment was made late, possibly by only a matter of days, and cases where only partial payment of the amount due was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of repossessions has also declined in recent years and the 1996 total of 178 quoted <Col N="771" /> in the Threshold report was the lowest in any year since 1990.  Indications are that the decline in repossessions has continued in 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>A comprehensive strategy is in place to address the contribution of nutrients, particularly phosphorus, to eutrophication problems in rivers and lakes.</P>
      <P>In the case of agriculture, nutrients such as phosphorus are essential to crop and animal production and are obtained from various sources including animal manures and chemical fertilisers. Nutrient management planning is a key management tool for farmers with the objective of achieving the correct balance between crop nutrient requirements, fertiliser application rates and the prevention of water pollution.  Statutory powers are available to local authorities to require the preparation of such plans where appropriate.</P>
      <P>My Department was instrumental in having a review undertaken of recommended phosphorus fertiliser application rates leading to the adoption by Teagasc of revised lower rates for grassland. These are now being taken into account in the preparation of nutrient management plans, including plans prepared under the rural environment protection scheme administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>In promoting nutrient management, emphasis is being placed on the potential significant cost savings available to many farmers, as well as the environmental benefits as a consequence of a more responsible and planned approach to the use of fertilisers.  Teagasc has estimated that annual purchases of phosphorous chemical fertilisers could be reduced by £25 million without affecting production.</P>
      <P>Farmers can also reduce phosphorus inputs to waters from the landspreading of animal manures by adhering to the precautionary measures, including recommendations about the timing and rate of spreading contained in the code of good agricultural practice to protect water from pollution jointly produced by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to phosphates in detergents, changes beneficial to the environment made over recent years include the reduction of the phosphate content from 35 per cent to 20 per cent and the introduction of a new range of phosphate-free concentrated products.  The installation of phosphorus reduction facilities in sewage schemes, <Col N="776" /> where appropriate, as part of the Department's major programme of investment in improving treatment arrangements is making an important contribution to minimising phosphorus losses to waters, including inputs associated with the use of detergents.</P>
    <P>I understand, however, that the extent of market penetration achieved by phosphate-free detergent products has been somewhat disappointing from the environmental perspective and consequently the potential reduction in phosphate losses from detergents has not been fully realised.  My Department has been in discussions with the Irish Detergent and Allied Products Association about the matter with a view to the adoption of measures on a voluntary basis.  I will consider the imposition of statutory controls to achieve further reductions in the phsophorus input to waters from detergents in the absence of an early and satisfactory outcome to these discussions.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the planning authorities to set out policy in their development plans in relation to the location and regulation of development of different kinds and in relation to the provision of public open space and other such amenities in new housing areas.

These are matters best left for decision at local level and I have no plans, therefore, to change existing arrangements.</P>
      <P>The provision of open spaces and amenity areas in local authority housing schemes is a matter for the individual housing authorities in the first instance.  Appropriate facilities of this kind in housing schemes are financed from my Department's capital allocations.  Local authorities have been advised, in guidelines issued by the Department, that new housing should comprise smaller well-designed schemes, integrated as far as possible with housing and other development in the area and resulting in the creation of a good living environment for the residents, convenient to all important services and amenities.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether far too many developers are applying for planning permission without having completed previous developments to the satisfaction of the planning authority; and if he will quickly bring in new legislation or legislations to ensure that developers must complete housing estates and other developments to the satisfaction of the community and the planning authority prior to being granted new planning permission for subsequent applications in view of this problem.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Planning Acts specifically allow for conditions designed to ensure that developments are completed to the satisfaction of planning authorities.  These include conditions relating to the giving of security, the phasing and completion of works and the occupation of structures.  Effective use of such conditions by local authorities and follow-up enforcement action can do much to obviate the kind of problems that arise.</P>
      <P>Under the Planning Acts, decisions on planning applications must be based on physical planning criteria, and for this reason, refusal of permission on the grounds of the character and past record of an applicant, or requiring developers to finish a housing estate before applying for permission to build another, would not be possible under existing law.  However, this matter will be examined in the present review of planning law which I have initiated.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of planning control is a matter for the planning authority concerned. Where a development has been carried out without the benefit of planning permission or where conditions attaching to a permission are not being complied with, it is a matter for the relevant planning authority to take enforcement action.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is open to any person to seek an Order in the High Court or the Circuit Court under Section 27 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, as amended, requiring compliance with conditions laid down by the planning authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>Under the European Communities (Vehicle Testing) Regulations, 1991 to 1996, compulsory roadworthiness testing already applies in Ireland, consistently with EU requirements, to goods vehicles, large trailers, buses and ambulances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> Testing is carried out by authorised testers &mdash; generally private garages, who are appointed and supervised by the main local authorities.  Testers must have suitable premises and equipment and appropriately qualified staff.</P>
    <P>Directive 96/96/EC requires the extension of roadworthiness testing to private cars.  It is intended that such testing will be carried out at dedicated test centres established and operated by a franchisee to be appointed on a national basis, following an open competitive tendering process.  Preparations for this new scheme have reached the stage where the appointment of management consultants will be made shortly, to assist my Department in relation to the franchise competition and the appointment of the franchisee.</P>
    <P>It is intended to appoint the franchisee early in 1998 and to introduce car testing as soon as possible thereafter bearing in mind the EU deadline of 1998-99.</P>

These changes will include the introduction of systems to develop and encourage such performance and development.  The implementation of these changes will be a matter for discussion between management and staff representatives.</P>
      <P>Report No. 37 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Service recommends the introduction of performance-related pay for local authority managers and assistant managers. It recommends that a performance appraisal board be established which would be given the task of developing and operating a performance-related pay scheme for managers.  The report recommends that responsibility for appraising performance of assistant managers be assigned to their respective managers and that performance targets should reflect the targets agreed for their managers.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>On 10 July last I briefed the House on revelations by the UK authorities that radioactive material was dumped in the Beaufort Dyke during the 1950s.  I reported to the House on that occasion on my meeting with the UK Secretary of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Dr. Jack Cunningham MP, at which Dr. Cunningham indicated that an intensive archival investigation was being carried out by the relevant UK Departments. I also announced that I had established a task force to assess the archival material received by me from the UK Government and to advise me on the extent and impact of all information becoming available and the measures necessary to ensure marine life and human health are fully protected.</P>
      <P>On 30 July, 1997 Dr. Cunningham advised me of the results of the archival searches carried out by the UK authorities.  This revealed two further instances of dumping in the Beaufort Dyke.  It also detailed dumping in a number of other locations around the British coast including the Firth of Forth, the North Sea, the Firth of Clyde and off the Isle of Arran.  In addition, a number of instances were identified where liquid wastes containing small amounts of radioactivity were dumped at sea.  These instances occurred in the North Sea, the Firth of Forth, Liverpool Bay and possibly Morecambe Bay and the Humber Estuary. Finally, on 7 October, 1997 the UK authorities advised my Department of evidence that had come to light of a dumping operation in the Holyhead Deep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> A scientific assessment of this archival material, which will, among other things, detail the nature and quantities of the materials dumped, is being carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  This will be considered by the Task Force on Radioactive Dumping which has been asked to review and assess the information that has become available and, based on this review, to advise on survey and/or monitoring and management measures so as to ensure maximum protection of our marine resource and restore public confidence in the quality of the marine environment.  I expect that the task force will report to me before Christmas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 81, 82 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>Mussel farming, both suspended rope mussel culture and bottom mussel culture, is carried on right around the coastline from the north-west to Carlingford Lough in the north-east and down to Waterford and Wexford.  The main mussel growing areas in the south and west include Bantry Bay, Roaringwater Bay, Ardgroom Harbour, Kilmakilloge Harbour and Killary Harbour.  The industry makes a significant contribution to jobs and wealth creation in coastal communities.  As well as supplying fresh mussels to home and international markets, the industry is the basis for significant added value processing.  Mussel production in 1996 totalled over 15,000 tonnes valued at £4.7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mussel farming operations require to be licensed under the Fisheries Acts in respect of the fish culture aspect of the development and a <Col N="784" /> licence under the Foreshore Acts to occupy State foreshore.  The Department has on hands a number of proposals for additional mussel farming projects in a number of areas.  The main areas involved are Dunmanus Bay, Kilmakilloge Harbour, Waterford Harbour, Wexford Harbour and Lough Swilly.</P>
    <P>All applications for aquaculture licences are subject to a rigorous process of evaluation by the Department's Aquaculture Licence Vetting Committee, a multi-disciplinary group comprising representatives of the Department, Marine Institute and the Central Fisheries Board.  Comments or objections on aquaculture development projects are invited through a public consultative process, which includes advertising in the local press, and consultation with the local authority, as well as other relevant bodies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Board Fáilte, the local Regional Fisheries Board, the Commissioners of Irish Lights and Forbairt.  The objective is to secure the broadest possible range of views on aquaculture development prior to decisions on licensing.  The decision making process must seek at all times to strike the right balance between sustainable development and local and environmental concerns.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997 enacted on 14 May of this year, establishes a new licensing and regulatory system for the aquaculture industry. The Act provides for, amongst other things, strict penalties for undertaking aquaculture without a licence and for non-compliance with licence conditions together with new Ministerial powers to revoke licences where the licence holder is in breach of licence conditions and significantly enhanced powers to tackle unauthorised development. Intensive work is under way to deliver the necessary regulations and other arrangements including the establishment of the Aquaculture Appeals Board, which will enable the new Act to be commenced before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Where unauthorised aquaculture developments are brought to the attention of my Department, the matter is investigated and the fish farm owner is instructed in writing to remove any unlawful structures erected.  If the operator fails to comply with such instructions the matter can be pursued through the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  The Department, through the Chief State Solicitor's Office, currently has legal proceedings in train against a number of unauthorised aquaculture operators.</P>
    <P>With regard to impacts on the environment, shellfish farming generally is considered an environmentally benign activity and it is worth stressing that the industry itself requires a pristine environment in which to prosper.</P>
    <P>The strengthened powers in the Fisheries (Amendment), Act, 1997 represent a firm commitment to tackling unauthorised developments and breaches of licence conditions by licensed operators.  Furthermore, the Department has been devoting resources to regularising all aquaculture developments by processing as speedily as <Col N="785" /> possible all applications on hand, having regard to the very necessary comprehensive consultation process involved.</P>

      <Quest>if he has instructed officials in his Department to review wild salmon fishing licenses; and whether he intends to ban estuary fishing of this species for rod and net during the 1998 season.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to introduce a ban on estuarial fishing for salmon during the 1998 season.  Overall policy is aimed at maximising on a sustainable basis the value of the wild salmon resource.  The basic premise underlying policy is that the balance of advantage, on conservation ecological and economic grounds, should lie increasingly with redirecting salmon exploitation towards the rivers and estuaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> In that context, as I have previously advised this House, my immediate priority is to review the various salmon conservation measures introdcuced for the 1997 season.  My decisions in relation to conservation measures for 1998 and future years will be informed by a comprehensive analysis by our salmon scientists of the state of Irish salmon stocks as well as of the international data; the impact and effectiveness of the conservation measures taken this year, and an assessment of fishing effort, enforcement and compliance levels.</P>
    <P>The international prognosis on the worrying state of salmon stocks in the North Atlantic and the initial reports available to me on Irish catches and stocks this year underline the need to continue at minimum with the existing conservation measures.</P>
    <P>On salmon management strategies generally, I have already announced my intention to move to a catchment-based approach for inland fisheries management, involving and empowering all users and beneficiaries at local community level.  The catchment approach will address the specific and localised impacts of salmon management and conservation strategies, through ongoing review and consultation with all stakeholders in the salmon resource.</P>
    <P>In that context, the Marine Institute recently submitted practical proposals for the introduction of a total allowable catch, a quota system and a tagging regime for salmon.  These proposals will be the subject of further consultation with all the relevant interests, both commercial and angling as well as the fisheries boards in the short-term. The outcome of the consultative process will critically inform considerations of the legislative licensing, funding and technical issues inherent in a quota based management strategy for salmon.</P>

    <P>I have been advised that Regional Boards are considering prosecutions in several cases; in some other instances it has not been possible to establish the precise source of the pollution.  I have also welcomed the positive response of Teagasc and the farming community to the issue of water quality, as illustrated in the recent announcement by Teagasc and the Irish Farmers' Association of a nutrient management code.  Prevention must be our primary objective, and any measure which contributes to prevention is to be commended.</P>
    <P>In addition, in relation to the major fish kill on the Mulcair, I have already advised the House that I have requested the Central Fisheries Board and the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board to commission a scientific investigation into the incident. The study, involving the University of Limerick, will provide a comprehensive assessment of the causes and effects of the fish kill and will inform fisheries pollution prevention strategies for the Mulcair catchment and elsewhere.  The fisheries boards are currently completing consultations with the Environmental Protection Agency, Teagasc, the local authority and the farming organisations as well as angling groups in order to ensure the fullest co-operation and involvement with the investigative work by all the relevant agencies and interests on the ground.</P>
    <P>The Department and the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards are also working to deliver on the action plan which I announced in August to ensure that the resources of the fisheries service and all relevant agencies are efficiently and effectively deployed and mobilised to prevent fisheries pollution, deal with the causes of pollution and provide incident response.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to the procedures followed by the ESB in the carrying out of the eel survey, it first submits a request to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources for an authorisation under section 14 of the 1959 Act to fish for eels. After consultation with the local Regional Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute for their scientific advice on the possible effect on stocks, I consider whether to grant the authorisation and what conditions to attach to it, in the light of local circumstances and the requirements of conservation. Having received an authorisation, the ESB then secures licences from the regional board, nominates fishermen to fish those licences and issues permits to each nominee.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that all conditions attached to the authorisations are complied with in carrying out the survey, and that it is in keeping with the conservation regime in place.  The survey's purpose is to provide a foundation of reliable data on eel stocks, which will allow the introduction of increasingly focused and sophisticated management measures, with substantial benefits for conservation.</P>

      <P>The law on freedom of conscience and religious associations was signed by President Yeltsin on 26 September last.  The law confirms the right to freedom of conscience, freedom of religious creed and equality before the law.  However, areas of concern arise in relation to the requirements in the law for the registration of religious communities as well as the distinction drawn between religious organisations and religious groups and their associated rights.</P>
      <P>Together with our European Union partners Ireland has made our concerns known to the Russian authorities about the possible negative implications of the law, both in terms of its practical implementation and in regard to commitments undertaken by Russia in international organisations and in international agreements.  The first draft of the law was amended following representations from the EU and others, but concerns remain with regard to the text of the law which has now been adopted.  In our contacts with the Russian authorities we will continue to stress the need for an open and flexible approach to the implementation of the law so as to ensure freedom of conscience and non-discriminatory treatment of religious communities within the Russian Federation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keenly aware of the concerns of people around the country in relation to the erection of mobile phone masts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> I should point out, however, that the construction of new masts for the provision of mobile telephone services is subject to planning legislation with limited exemptions.  I do not have any role in relation to the location of masts.</P>
    <P>Government policy in relation to mobile phone services is that these should be available as far as possible on a country-wide basis.  In line with this policy, both Eircell and Esat Digifone are obliged by their licences to provide wide population coverage and the provision of such coverage necessitates the erection of a large number of masts.</P>
    <P>The Government is, however, committed to promoting the sharing of such masts where possible as a means to reducing the number of masts needed.  In this regard, a set of guidelines entitled Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures &mdash; Guidelines for Planning Authorities, published by the Department of the Environment in July last year, provide that planning authorities should encourage the sharing of facilities.</P>
    <P>The recently adopted EU Directive on Interconnection (97/33/EC) also requires member states to promote the sharing of facilities and for arbitration of disputes in relation to sharing arrangements.  Regulations to give effect to the directive will be signed before the end of this year and will provide for a role for the telecommunications regulator in settling disputes.</P>
    <P>Arising from the increasing number of inquiries being received in my Department about the health aspects of mobile phone towers, MMDS masts and other transmission infrastructure, it has been decided to hold an international conference on this issue early next year.  The conference is, as of yet, at the early planning stage and I will keep Members of the House informed as progress is made.</P>
    <P>On the question of emissions, compliance with international non-ionising radiation emission standards is a condition attached to all telecommunications licences for mobile telephony services issued in Ireland.  The Director of Telecommunications Regulation, who was appointed pursuant to the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, is responsible for ensuring compliance with licence conditions and will arrange for monitoring of non-ionising radiation emissions.</P>
    <P>I understand that the director is currently looking at the issue of monitoring and intends to put in place suitable arrangements in the near future. In the meantime, however, should any local committees wish to have monitoring undertaken for them, I understand that the National Electronic Technology Centre at Forbairt (01-8370101) offers a monitoring service which has been fully accredited by the National Accreditation Board. The cost of the service and other details may be obtained direct from Forbairt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my response to Question No. 61 on 1 October 1997, the programme for Government, under the transport heading, says that key priorities will include resistance to EU plans to abolish duty free shopping after June 1999.</P>
      <P>On my part I am very concerned about the economic and social consequences for Ireland of the scheduled abolition of intra-Community duty free sales, in particular the effects on employment and access costs for tourism and trade.  For this reason I am taking an active role in the campaign to raise awareness of the duty free issue.</P>
      <P>At the Duty Free in Europe Conference in Brussels on 24 September 1997 I highlighted the Irish Government's position and I called on the EU Commission to conduct an EU wide study into the economic and social effects on Europe of ending duty free sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> I believe the results of such a study could pave the way for an open-ended derogation, which can be reviewed as circumstnces change.</P>
    <P>At their Council meeting in June this year, Transport Ministers supported the concept of this EU wide study.  Moreover, at my first Transport Council since taking office, held last week in Luxembourg, I took the opportunity of emphasising my position on this issue in the context of a discussion on a draft directive on airport charges. I should point out, however, that reversal of the scheduled abolition is primarily a matter for Finance Ministers and requires a proposal from the EU Commission and unanimous agreement of the Council of Finance Ministers.</P>
    <P>In response to concerns relating to Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports, I should point out that Aer Rianta, which has responsibility for the management and operation of the three State airports on my behalf, is leading a campaign, at industry level, to retain intra-EU duty free sales. It is also actively pursuing a range of activities to mitigate the loss of revenue in the event that efforts to retain duty free sales are unsuccessful. This includes looking at alternative commercial activities at the three airports and examining opportunities overseas to provide additional revenue to the company.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is currently awaiting the report of a study, commissioned by his Department, to establish the impact of the loss of duty free sales on Irish employment, transport and Government revenues. This study is expected to be completed by the end of the year.  The results will be used to inform the debate at national and EU level. Other member states have undertaken studies in areas particularly relevant to themselves. However, as I mentioned before, the key, I believe, is to convince the EU Commission to commission an EU-wide study.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a priority for me to ensure that the current BSE related restrictions on our exports of live cattle to Egypt are removed.  Egypt has been an important market for live cattle which has been closed to imports from Ireland since the beginning of January 1997.  A commitment in principle to reopen the market for Irish cattle was communicated on 4 June to my predecessor, subject to agreement on a number of conditions.  In the first instance therefore, discussions at a technical level on these conditions were necessary. These culminated in the visit of two delegations from my Department to Egypt in August.  Many of the veterinary requirements for the resumption of trade were agreed and a package of proposals was offered including assistance for the removal of specified risk material.  The latter was of importance in terms of allowing the Egyptian authorities to provide the same type of guarantees as available to European consumers.</P>
      <P>Final agreement on reopening the market was delayed due to increasing concerns in Egypt relating to food imports generally.  In view of this I contacted the Egyptian Deputy Premier and Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Wally and met him in Cairo on 28 September.  I also met the Minister for Trade and Supply, Dr. Goweily.  As a result of my meetings, the Egyptian Authorities agreed to consider accepting a trial shipment of live cattle.  A detailed proposal for such a shipment is at present being formulated by my Department in conjunction with the Live Cattle Exporters Association for consideration by the Egyptian authorities.  I would hope that a trial shipment, properly controlled, will convince the Egyptian authorities to reopen the market fully to Irish cattle imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> I should make the point that exports of frozen beef to Egypt have increased substantially this year.  The quantity of frozen beef exported in the first half of the year, estimated at 30,000 tonnes or equivalent to almost 100,000 cattle, exceeds the total for the full year 1996.  This shows increasing acceptance by Egypt not only of the quality of Irish beef but of the controls on its production. The increased demand for frozen beef is of course to be welcomed and our trade with Egypt is adjusting accordingly.  This is also a factor which obviously influences the continuing negotiations in relation to this market.  It does not, of course, diminish our resolve to have the restrictions on live cattle removed.</P>
    <P>As regards cattle prices, it is not open to my Department to appoint a regulator to set the price paid by meat factories to farmers.  Prices paid by meat factories to farmers are determined by a number of factors such as returns from the main export markets and competition for cattle on the Irish market.  With regard to the latter point, my Department has referred the possible existence of &ldquo;concerted practices&rdquo; in the beef industry to the Competition Authority.  I am awaiting the outcome of these investigations. However, I believe that there is a case for a greater level of transparency and understanding between producers and processors about cattle prices and I will be doing everything in my power to encourage that.</P>

      <P>The early retirement scheme is a structural scheme which provides an incentive for farmers between the ages of 55 and 66 to retire from farming and pass their holdings to younger farmers.  It commenced in 1994 and is paid for a maximum of ten years or until the applicant reaches 70 years of age.  The incentive is in the form of an annual sum of up to £10,000 payable before the farmer reaches the normal retirement age of 66.  At that age the pension is reduced by the amount of any state pension payable.  There is no provision in the scheme for further payments to supplement any national pension after participation has ceased.</P>

      <P>I am acutely conscious of the importance of arable aid payments to cereal producers particularly this year in view of the very difficult harvest conditions.  However, under EU regulations these payments cannot commence until 16 October.  I am ensuring in so far as it is possible that arable aid payments will be made as quickly as possible starting from that date.  It is my hope that the vast bulk of all arable aid payments will be processed and issued within a week from 16 October, which will be a substantial improvement on the position which obtained last year.</P>
      <P>Payments under the 1997 disadvantaged areas headage schemes (both cattle and sheep) commenced recently.  Some £29 million has now been paid under these schemes which is ahead of the position at a similar date last year.  In addition further BSE/agri-monetary compensation payments will be made this week.  It is expected that these payments will amount to some £15 million nationally.  Therefore, there has been no question of delaying payments.</P>

    <P>The above payments represent the amount due in each case for the first half of 1997.  It is intended to pay the amount due for the second half of 1997 to the above local authorities before the end of this year.  Payment will be made to the remaining authorities as soon as it has been confirmed by them that they are carrying out the relevant functions.</P>
    <P>Under section 35 of the Abattoirs Act 1988, it is the responsibility of each local authority to appoint one or more wholetime veterinary inspections to carry out the relevant functions under the Act.  In addition, it is the responsibility of each local authority to appoint so many other veterinary inspectors as it considers necessary. Information on the number of wholetime and part-time veterinary inspectors employed by each local authority, specifically in relation to functions deriving from the Abattoirs Act, 1988, is not readily available in my Department.  This information is being assembled and I will convey it to the Deputy when it becomes available.</P>

      <P>With nearly six months of the present milk quota year still to run, it is not possible to accurately forecast the extent, if any, of a super levy fine which will be incurred.</P>
      <P>Super levy liability is calculated in accordance with EU legislation and there is no provision under the EU Milk Quota Regulations for an exemption from the super levy penalty for any producer in respect of whom a super levy liability has been established.  This applies irrespective of whether the levy relates to over production in volume or in butter fat terms or both.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that it is each producer's individual responsibility to manage his or her own quota.  In this context, producers who have exceeded their quota and their individual butter fat reference level should take both matters into account in planning their milk deliveries for the remainder of the milk quota year.</P>

    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also informed me that the construction of an incinerator would not qualify for the business expansion scheme (BES).  However, I will consider the Deputy's suggestion in the context of the budget, later this year.</P>

      <P>The PAYE system is designed to ensure, as far as possible, that the right amount of tax is collected from employees during the course of the year, with adjustments to tax payable being made by the employer in the course of the year as necessary. However, overpayments and underpayments will arise where the correct allowances have not been given in the certificate of tax-free allowances.  In such cases, any refund due or additional tax payable will be dealt with by way of review, normally after the end of the tax year. Revenue is prepared to adjust taxfree allowances <Col N="806" /> in the course of the year if the employee's circumstances change.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that PAYE overpayments are refunded as quickly as possible and that this process has been speeded up considerably as a result of computerisation. PAYE underpayments on the other hand are generally collected by way of an appropriate reduction in the employee's allowances in the subsequent year or years &mdash; to facilitate the taxpayer and to avoid undue hardship from having to pay the balance due in one lump sum. Interest is not added to PAYE refunds, but neither is interest charged on PAYE underpayments.</P>
      <P>I understand that the UK legislation provides for a &ldquo;repayment supplement&rdquo;&mdash; which is akin to interest &mdash; in limited circumstances but that is not an across the board scheme.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for dealing with PAYE overpayments and underpayments here have been operating very satisfactorily and I have no plans to introduce a provision on the lines referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The level of cardiac services available at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, has been the subject of ongoing discussions between my Department and the hospital for some time. The reasons for the increasing pressure on this service have been identified as being the lack of theatre space and ICU beds, shortage of ICU trained nurses and the advances in surgical and interventional techniques which have resulted in increased demand.</P>
      <P>At a meeting in April 1997 the Department invited proposals from the hospital for the spending of £500,000 to be made available from the 1997 waiting list initiative to alleviate the pressures on this speciality.  The hospital submitted a proposal which was accepted by my Department and funding was provided to support it.  In a recent progress report on the initiative the hospital stated that: &mdash; following the appointment of a locum consultant paediatrician the hospital has experienced an increase in its Cardiology Out Patient Department's activity and in the number of echocardiograms performed.  The combination of both these factors will result in an additional 545 procedures being carried out in 1997.</P>
      <P>Building works on four additional ICU beds commenced in July and are expected to be completed this month.</P>
      <P>An additional training programme for ICU nurses commenced on 22 September and six candidates have been selected for participation.</P>
      <P>A project team (consisting of officials from my Department and hospital representatives) is currently working on a development plan for the provision of additional theatres at the hospital.</P>
      <P>The question of additional consultant manpower is being considered in the context of the wider review I am currently undertaking of the further development of cardiac services generally. I am confident that all of these initiatives will have a positive impact on the service levels of this speciality.</P>
      <P>Inquiries have been made regarding the individual child referred to and I am informed that this case was recently reviewed.  A further review by the consultant cardio-thoracic surgeon will take place next month.  As the Deputy may be aware the scheduling of surgery is the clinical decision of the consultant concerned.  Should the parents of the child feel that her condition has deteriorated they should contact her general practitioner who would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant directly.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the problems being caused in the management of wards by the excessive use of agency nurses with a high rate of turnover which disrupts the continuity of care; the extent to which agency nurses are currently being used; whether his Department applies any ceilings on the use of agency nurses within individual wards; and the proposals, if any, he has to deal with this problem.</Quest>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for the formulation and development of health policy.  The management of health services, including the direct employment of staff and the utilisation of agency staff, is a matter for the individual health agencies.</P>
      <P>The use of agency nurses is, to a significant degree, related to the unanticipated absence of nursing staff which, of itself, impacts on the continuity of care.  My Department does not apply ceilings on the use of agency nurses nor are there any plans to do so, since such a measure could adversely affect the flexibility that health agencies have to arrange appropriate nursing cover, as and when required.  I would also make the point that agency nurses, must be suitably qualified and registered with An Bord Altranais, which is the statutory regulatory body for the nursing profession.</P>

      <P>My Department's Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001, which is based on information from the National Intellectual Disability Database, provides information on the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap.  That assessment identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential/respite places and 1,036 new day places over the next five years.  It is estimated that the cost of providing these services would be in the region of £63.5 million over the period. Additional funding of £12 million was made available in 1997 to begin the process of meeting these needs.</P>
      <P>This Government's commitment to the continued development of services for persons with a mental handicap is clearly set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  I will be seeking additional funding for 1998 so that the process of meeting these needs can continue.</P>

      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy comes from the National Cancer Registry Board which published its first set of national data earlier this year. The data relate to a single year, 1994, and must be treated with some caution until information for subsequent years becomes available.  It is important to examine trends over time before reaching definitive conclusions regarding the incidence of cancer, particularly in relation to a specific area of the country.</P>
      <P>The National Cancer Registry Board has indicated to me that the incidence of cancer in males, but not females, was slightly greater than would be expected statistically in Cork county for 1994. However, the difference was not very great and would not give cause for concern.  The National Cancer Registry Board will review the situation with regard to Cork county when the 1995 data are available.</P>

      <P>St. James's Hospital have been invited to participate in the 1997 waiting list initiative which provides £1.6 million specifically for cardiac surgery patients.  The main aim is to reduce the existing national cardiac surgery lists and I expect that patients on the waiting list of St. James's Hospital will benefit from the opportunity which it provides. My Department's strategy for achieving this aim involves the purchase of additional cardiac procedures and the selection of suitable patients for medical cardiac therapies.  I must emphasise that high standards of evaluation and audit will be applied to the initiative.  Participating agencies will be required to demonstrate clearly how the additional activity has impacted upon existing waiting lists and a full report will be required from each hospital on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the recent Europe Against Cancer Week, which I launched on 3 October.  This is a Europe wide annual event and each year a different focus is taken from the European Code Against Cancer. The aim of the 1997 campaign was to create a public awareness of breast and cervical cancers and to encourage women to talk about these specific cancers.  The activities for the week were co-ordinated centrally by the European Commission and in Ireland represented a joint initiative by the Irish Cancer Society and the Health Promotion Unit of my Department in association with the health boards, the National Women's Council and the Irish Countrywomen's Association.</P>
      <P>The key practical elements of the week included the national launch on 3 October encompassing media publicity at national and local level.  Public information materials were distributed by the Irish Countrywomen's Association, the National Women's Council, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the health boards. Public meetings, seminars and workshops were and continue to be organised by the various health boards in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society.  Conferences and seminars for health care professionals and the public will run from 29 September to 9 November 1997.  A freephone helpline at the Irish Cancer Society was also made available.</P>

    <P>The above events complement the recommendations in my Department's national cancer strategy which sets out plans in relation to prevention, early detection, treatment and palliative care services <Col N="813" /> for cancer in Ireland.  One of its key initiatives was the establishment of targeted national programmes of screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer.  Plans to commence the first phase of the national programme for breast screening are under way.  Phase I will cover the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas. It will target 120,000 women in the 50 to 64 age group, which represents some 50 per cent of the national target population.  All women in this age group living in the pilot area can be expected to be contacted about the programme.</P>

      <Quest>if any of the health boards automatically issue a medical card to children with Down's syndrome; if he will favourably instruct health boards to automatically issue children with Down's syndrome with medical cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Health boards do not issue medical cards automatically to children with Down's syndrome.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970 medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable without undue hardship to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>In addition, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision.  I do not think that it is justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means particularly in view of the very many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.</P>
      <P>Every person who is in genuine need of a medical card, must of course, receive one and I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to point out that children with a mental handicap, including Down's syndrome, are entitled to a long-term illness book.  The long-term illness scheme caters for those individuals who have been diagnosed as suffering from any of 15 specified illnesses.  This scheme allows such <Col N="814" /> persons to obtain, without charge, the drugs, medicines and appliances required for the treatment of their condition.</P>

Hence, my Department has decided to have an examination of the operation of the home help services carried out by independent consultants which will advise on how the services can be developed in tandem with the other community based services.  Work on the review has commenced and the project is being overseen by a consultative committee of the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  It is hoped to have a report finalised early in the new year.

      <P>The Health Strategy &mdash; Shaping a Healthier Future published in 1994 expressed concern about the increase in the rate of suicide.  In November 1995 a National Task Force on Suicide was established to address the growing prevalence of this tragedy in our society.  In September 1996, the task force published its interim report.  It contained a detailed analysis of statistics relating to suicide and attempted suicide in Ireland and a preliminary analysis into the factors that could be associated with suicidal behaviour.  It identified young males aged between 15 and 24 as a suicide risk group.</P>
      <P>The final report of the task force, which will contain a national suicide prevention/reduction strategy, is at an advanced stage of preparation and will be published shortly.  A key feature of the strategy will be the establishment of a suicide research group to research all aspects of the incidence of suicide.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the protocol for the prescribing of methadone, general practitioners who become involved in the treatment of opiate dependent persons are required to list those persons' details on a central treatment list.  Under this arrangement any general practitioner who is considering prescribing methadone for a patient can check whether the patient's name is on this treatment list and so minimise the possibility that the patient concerned may receive methadone from more than one source.  At the end of September 1997 there were 2,512 persons on this central treatment list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware the aim of all of our drug treatment services is to make the patient drug free.  Where methadone treatment programmes are concerned this would also require the provision of aftercare and rehabilitation services in order to broaden the range of options available for those on such programmes.  Ultimately, however, the decision as to the length of time on which a person should be maintained on methadone is one which should be taken by the patient's clinician.  This decision would be made taking into account such relevant factors as the <Col N="816" /> patient's determination to remain drug free, the availability of back-up after care services and the patient's own domestic circumstances.</P>

When the services transfer to Tallaght, the hospital site, like the sites of the Adelaide and the National Children's Hospital, will be sold as the premises will no longer function as acute hospitals.  Since agreement was reached on the development of the new hospital &mdash; the Adelaide and the Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital &mdash;<Col N="821" /> it has always been understood that the three constituent hospitals would close once the new hospital is opened.  However, my Department, together with the Eastern Health Board and the hospitals concerned, is currently examining the health service needs of the south inner city catchment population following the transfer of the acute hospital services to Tallaght.  The Eastern Health Board has identified the need to provide secondary rehabilitation, extended care and day hospital facilities for older people living in the area surrounding the Meath Hospital.

      <P>The health board orthodontic services are currently being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan.  The action plan provides for the phased improvement of orthodontic treatment services through a consultant led orthodontic service in each health board.  A primary task of the consultant is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to sub-consultant level for health board dental staff.  This enables health boards to provide a greatly increased volume of service and a service of high quality.  I will, in conjunction with the health boards, continue <Col N="822" /> to develop the consultant led orthodontic services over the course of the dental health action plan. The ultimate objective is to bring the level of service provision in line with the level of treatment need.  The provision of orthodontic services to eligible children at St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork and the maintenance of waiting lists is the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board.  My Department has provided funding to the board for the development of its orthodontic services in accordance with the dental health action plan.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Southern Health Board that the waiting list is segregated into patients awaiting assessment and those awaiting treatment.  The current numbers on both lists are 2,200 awaiting treatment and 4,900 awaiting assessment.  Those who have been assessed as category A, the category of greatest need, receive immediate treatment.</P>
      <P>I understand that the board is at present reviewing its position regarding the provision of orthodontic services and is considering a number of options, including the temporary appointment of a senior registrar and registrar.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is based on residence and means.  Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1, i.e. medical card holders, or limited eligibility category 2 for health services.  Health boards normally regard a person as ordinarily resident in Ireland if he-she satisfies the health board that it is his-her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.</P>
      <P>Under EU regulations, persons taking up permanent residence in Ireland who are in receipt of a social security pension from another EU member state, who are not in receipt of an Irish Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs pension as either a recipient or dependant and are not employed or self-employed here are entitled to a medical card irrespective of means. Otherwise, they are entitled to health services on the same basis as persons normally resident here.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are drawn up by chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, those whose income exceeds these guidelines may qualify for a medical card if their health board considers that they are unable to provide necessary medical care for themselves or their family.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 164, 165, 166 and 167 together In 1991 Limerick County Council submitted to my Department a proposal to extend the Shannon estuary water supply scheme to serve the areas of Askeaton, Kildimo and Pallaskenry. Phase 1 of the scheme, costing £3.4 million, was approved earlier this year and is under construction at present.  This will provide a 16 kilometre trunk main extension from Aughinish to Askeaton and Dromore Hill.  To augment existing supplies to areas adjacent to Dromore, Limerick County Council, earlier this year, also sought approval to carry out additional pipeworks to the phase 1 contract at an estimated cost of £160,000 and this has been approved.</P>
      <P>Phase 2 costing approximatley £2.6 million is designed to provide a new reservoir at Dromore and new distribution mains for Kildimo and Pallaskenry but, having regard to the existing high level of commitments under the water and sewerage investment programme, I cannot say when it may be possible to approve it.  The planning of water supplies to local areas is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.</P>

      <P>It is recognised that the transportation of milk from farms can be a contributory factor in damage caused to non-national roads.  The maximum axle and vehicle weight limits for goods vehicles which now generally reflect corresponding EU limits are governed by the Road Traffic (Construction Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963-97.  There is no proposal at present to amend these.  The application of road traffic regulations to limit use of public roads by certain categories of vehicle <Col N="826" /> would be a matter for the relevant local authority to consider.</P>

These criteria vary in relation to new and existing taximeter areas and provide for the addition or deduction of points, as appropriate, for holding a taxi licence, a hackney licence, a public service vehicle driving licence or an ordinary driving licence.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173, 174 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>A new urban renewal scheme will come into operation on 1 August 1998 when the qualified extension of the current scheme expires.  The new scheme will largely be based on recommendations made in the consultants' study on the various schemes which have been in operation since 1986.  In summary, the scheme will be more targeted than previous schemes, with cases for designation being considered on the basis of integrated area plans to be prepared by local authorities for priority areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> Draft guidelines for the new scheme were issued to local authorities last June and I have arranged for a copy to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.  Together with the observations received on them, the draft guidelines are now being considered by an expert panel which I established last week to advise me on aspects of the new scheme.  The application to which the Deputy refers relates to the guidelines which indicates that towns with a population of less than 6,000 would be likely to have difficulty in meeting the relevant criteria and this together with suggestions about the grouping of small population centres has been passed to the expert panel for consideration.  The panel's examination of the draft guidelines and related submissions is now well under way and I expect to be in a position to finalise guidelines very shortly, having regard to the panel's recommendations.</P>

      <P>A detailed examination of the issues that arise in relation to the sale of local authority flats concluded that no practical arrangements could be made which would be satisfactory to tenant purchasers or local authorities or even to other tenants in a flat complex who would not wish to purchase.  The three main reasons local authority flats would be a bad buy for tenants relate to: the level of service charges that would be necessary; public liability insurance; and the future saleability of purchased flats. <Col N="829" /> These matters are outlined in greater detail in the policy document Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead (May 1995), copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  Local authorities were advised that, while flats should not be offered for sale under the 1995 tenant purchase scheme, consideration should be given to the sale of maisonettes, particularly those which do not have common areas, where satisfactory arrangements not involving the difficulties that arise in the case of flats, could be devised.</P>

      <P>My Department does not compile statistics on water pollution incidents.  However, records in respect of incidents resulting in fish kills are maintained by the Marine Institute's Fishery Research Centre from reports furnished by regional fisheries boards and local authorities. According to these records, the number of fish kills in each of the years since 1992, and to date in 1997, was as follows: 1992, 51; 1993, 33; 1994, 32; 1995, 84; 1996, 47; 1997, 36 (to 10/10/97).  Primary responsibility to prevent pollution incidents rests with those engaged in activities that could entail a pollution risk.  However, local authorities, as statutory pollution control authorities, have a key role in protecting water resources and avail of an extensive range of powers to give effect to their responsibilities in this area.  At 31 December 1996, a total of 1,882 licences issued by local authorities in respect of the control of effluent discharges were in force.  During 1996, local authorities carried out more than 6,000 inspections or investigations into activities that posed a pollution risk and issued 1,346 statutory notices specifying measures to be taken in order to prevent pollution.  They also issued advice or warnings in 5,195 cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of my concern about the number and impact of pollution incidents during the summer, I wrote to local authorities in August 1997 urging them to intensify their efforts to identify potential pollution sources and to take appropriate follow-up action to eliminate the risks involved.  They have particularly been asked to ensure that industrial effluent discharge licence conditions, operational practices and material/waste storage facilities are adequate to safeguard water resources.  In relation to agriculture, I have asked local authorities to pursue a programme of visits to <Col N="832" /> farms/intensive production units and to give special attention to the management of animal slurries, silage effluent and sheep dip facilities including disposal arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have drawn the attention of local authorities to the need to ensure that water and sewerage treatment plants are maintained and operated to design specification to prevent pollution.  This is essential in order to achieve maximum benefit from the major programme of capital investment being undertaken by my Department in conjunction with local authorities in the provision of new and improved sewage treatment facilities.</P>
    <P>The State has provided a total of almost £96 million 1995 and 1996 for this purpose.  In addition, about half of the £150 million earmarked for expenditure on water and sewerage schemes this year will be spent on new and ongoing sewerage projects.</P>
    <P>I have urged local authorities to use the statutory provisions available to them to recover costs associated with the prosecution of offenders, including the cost of measures to mitigate or remedy the damage done; these provisions offer a mechanism to offset the effects of pollution and augment the deterrent value of penalties imposed by the courts in line with the polluter pays principle.</P>
    <P>I also conveyed my concerns about the extent to which agriculture continues to be responsible for pollution incidents to the presidents of the two main farmers' associations.  I drew attention to the substantial State financial support made available under the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the rural environment protection scheme, as well as the improved capital allowances for targeted investment by farmers in pollution control measures.  This support has assisted farmers in providing waste storage facilities and in making other improvements to prevent pollution. I emphasised the necessity for farmers to make full use of these facilities and urged farm leaders to intensify the efforts of their associations to promote environmental friendly farming practices among their members.</P>

      <P>Difficulties are currently being experienced in Ireland and internationally in relation to the recycling of paper as a result of a reduction in the demand and price for waste paper.  Certain materials such as cardboard and high grade papers are being collected but the collection of lower grade papers has been suspended by some recyclers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> The successful development of waste recycling depends to a significant extent on the development of more extensive and stable markets for recyclable materials.  Initiatives in this regard include the commissioning and financing by my Department, in association with National Newspapers of Ireland, of the recently published report by Teagasc on &ldquo;The Safety and Suitability of Shredded Newspaper as a Bedding Material for Dairy Cows&rdquo;.  The report confirms that shredded newspaper is both suitable and safe for use as bedding material, and seeks to encourage the expansion of such use and the recycling of waste newspaper.  An increased demand for recycled paper is also being supported in Ireland by the Green Government Guide circulated last year. This initiative seeks to promote better environmental management by all Government bodies, with particular emphasis on the use of recycled materials and the recycling of wastes.</P>
    <P>Financial assistance is being provided by my Department by way of grants, which are co- financed by the European Union, to support capital expenditure by local authorities and the private sector on infrastructure for waste recycling.  Several of the projects approved to date include the provision of facilities to recycle paper.</P>

      <P>A self-employed person who enters social insurance for the first time after age 56 can claim a refund of the pension element of his-her social insurance contributions on reaching age 66, provided s-he has no entitlement to either a contributory or non-contributory old age pension.</P>
      <P>The person concerned recently applied for an old age contributory pension.  As he was over age 56 when he entered insurable self-employment his application was rejected.  A decision on whether a refund of PRSI is due cannot be made until his entitlement to old age non-contributory pension is determined.  In the event of him not qualifying for a non-contributory old age pension he would be due a refund of the pension element of PRSI contributions paid for 1988-89, 1989-90 1990-91, 1991-92 and 1992-93.</P>

      <P>The qualification conditions for a widow's or widower's contributory pension are less onerous than those pertaining to old age contributory pension reflecting the different nature of the contingencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  A claimant must also satisfy a minimum yearly average condition from the date they first entered insurance.</P>
    <P>To qualify for a widow's or widower's contributory pension a person may use the full insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years to satisfy the yearly average condition. Also a widow or widower can qualify on his-her own or on the late spouse's record.  The two records cannot be combined to qualify for payment.</P>
    <P>Estimates of the cost of extending the widow's widower's contributory pension to those with a yearly average of between ten and 23 are not readily available.  However, initial estimates suggest that the cost could be of the order of £2 million, and, therefore, could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <Quest>if he will ensure that rent allowance provided by community welfare officers is not reduced when a woman has more than one child in view of the fact that rent allowance is currently decreased consequent to an increase in a single parent's payment arising from the birth of a second child; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent.  Entitlement to the supplement is determined by the health board in the light of the circumstances of the case and the payment is normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of the rent has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their circumstances, less £6.  Weekly needs are considered to be the appropriate rate of SWA for each family size.  All cash income a person has in excess of this amount is calculated as means when determining their entitlement to a rent supplement.</P>
      <P>Any increase in income over and above the levels provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme will result in a decrease in the rent supplement rate payable.  Single parents are paid £15.20 per week in respect of each child whereas the rate payable under supplementary welfare allowance is £13.20 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a single parent has a second or subsequent child and is awarded an increase of £15.20 per week, her rent supplement is reduced by £2 per week, that is £15.20 less £13.20. The <Col N="837" /> result is that her overall income increases by £13.20 per week.  This reduction has always been a feature of the rent supplement scheme.  It would cost approximately £9.2 million per annum to abolish this clawback and it could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The person concerned in this question is currently in receipt of a preretirement allowance which is a means tested payment.  Prior to that she was looking after an elderly relative who was in receipt of a prescribed relative allowance.</P>
      <P>A retirement pension is payable at age 65 while an old age contributory pension is payable at age 66 subject, of course, to the fulfilment of the normal statutory conditions.  There is no provision for payment of these pensions, in any circumstances, at an earlier age.  Providing special pensions for carers when the caree dies, regardless of the carer's age, would have significant cost implications.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996 provided for the extension of class A PRSI to community employment workers.  Class A PRSI provides cover for the full range of benefits and pensions available under the social insurance system including, for example, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, maternity benefit, retirement pension, old age contributory pension, widow's contributory pension, treatment dental and optical benefits and occupational injuries benefit.  The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> In the case of persons who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit, their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them. However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I should mention that provision was also made for existing community employment workers, i.e. those who had commenced their scheme prior to 6 April 1996, to be given the option of paying class A PRSI, if they wished, or of continuing with their existing class J PRSI.  In the case of the person concerned she opted to switch to class A PRSI, and consequently qualified for full rate unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I should mention also that secondary benefits can, however, be retained if the person transfers from a community employment scheme to a back-to-work allowance scheme or Jobstart, etc. As regards income-related secondary benefits such as rent allowance or mortgage supplements and the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance available under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, medical cards and differential rents, the position is that, in the normal course, former community employment workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment should continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.</P>
    <P>The introduction of special concessionary arrangements for former CE workers would have both legislative and cost implications.  I will keep the issue raised by the Deputy under review.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to access to the free schemes administered by the Department.  Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years, or over, and also to certain people with disabilities under the age of 66.  The other free schemes are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition, widows between the age of 60 and 65, whose late husbands had entitlement to the free scheme, retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>

      <P>Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years or over, and also to certain people with disabilities under that age.  Entitlement is not contingent on the person's means.</P>
      <P>The other free schemes are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are either living alone, or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition, widows and widowers between the age of 60 and 65 whose late spouses had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
      <P>A change in the qualifying conditions for the free schemes was introduced in the 1996 budget. This allows new applicants over age 75, who were previously required to satisfy more rigorous household composition rules, to be assessed in the same way as all other persons in that age category. This means that their household composition will not affect their eligibility for the free schemes.  Effectively now all persons over age 75 who are in receipt of a qualifying payment may qualify for the free schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the free schemes were extended in July 1996 to include low-income pensioners who were not in receipt of a social welfare type payment. <Col N="840" /> The weekly income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension currently £78 per week, plus any increases for dependants, plus £30.</P>
    <P>The fuel schemes are historically different in nature to the free schemes and, therefore, qualification conditions differ significantly.  The fuel scheme is a means-tested payment which is not age-related.  The free schemes, on the other hand, are mainly payable to pensioners.</P>
    <P>The national fuel scheme and the smokeless fuel scheme are tailored to provide assistance to qualified householders who are unable to provide for their own solid fuel heating needs.  Persons who are in receipt of a means-tested payment automatically satisfy the means-test for these payments. However, in the case of contributory pensioners, if they, and members of their household have a combined income of more than £15 per week or savings-investments of £8,000 or more above the appropriate maximum Irish contributory pension rate, they do not qualify for either of the fuel schemes.</P>

    <P>The process of the mid-term evaluation of the Tourism Operational Programme is not yet complete. However, for the Deputy's information, progress to date on the projects funded under sub-programme 1 of the Tourism OP has been slower than planned.  The difficulties which contributed to this situation have now been largely overcome.  These difficulties resulted, inter alia, from the legislative changes in regard to planning permission and the implementation of fire, health and safety regulations.  The expenditure currently amounting to almost £32 million will accelerate <Col N="841" /> over the immediate future and it is anticipated that it will reach the relevant targets within the appropriate timeframe.  As the Deputy will be aware the projects to be funded typically involve the upgrading of infrastructure and existing visitor facilities.  I regret that a detailed comprehensive analysis categorising the facilities being funded under the sub-programme into new and additional services as opposed to existing facilities is not readily available.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the expenditure to date represents poor tourism value for money.  To enhance the tourism potential of the projects in sub-programme 1, significant funding will be allocated shortly to international marketing.  Finally, for the information of the Deputy, the total expected European Regional Development Fund contribution to expenditure on the cultural development incentives scheme under the programme is of the order of £17 million.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for proposed natural heritage areas and special areas of conservation now lies with my Department. Officials from my Department met the person referred to by the Deputy on two occasions and discussed matters with him.  He subsequently requested a further meeting on site with an official from head office the next time that official was in the area.  That meeting has not yet taken place but I expect that it will be held next month.</P>

    <P>The person in question first wrote to the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in January of this year and contacts and discussions between my Department and the person concerned have taken place on a number of occasions since then.  I met the person referred to on 8 October 1997 in order to allow him the opportunity to give me a personal briefing on his proposal to establish a cable-only Irish based popular music channel.  During the course of the meeting I indicated that I was sympathetic to the proposal.  However, in the course of considering the proposal, my Department consulted the Independent Radio and Television Commission (IRTC) as a matter of courtesy.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission have asked me <Col N="843" /> to defer a decision until they have had an opportunity to meet and discuss the matter with me.  I believe that it is not unreasonable to afford the Independent Radio and Television Commission this opportunity and I hope to meet them shortly. I will make my decision following the meeting.  It is a matter for the promoter of the proposal to determine its feasibility.  I personally hope that the channel can be established and that it will be a success.</P>

EU Structural Funding has been provided for canal restoration and development and the present programme of infrastructural works will be completed in 1999.

      <P>In January last, my predecessor requested the Heritage Council to undertake a review of licences issued under section 26 of the Act.

      <P>However, within these constraints, funding provided by my Department to the National Archives, excluding staff costs and own resources, has increased by almost 20 per cent since 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the specific case referred to, the request for a copy of the grant and schedule of assets was processed by the National Archives in the usual way.  However, because of restrictions on space available for the storage of such records at the Bishop Street premises, temporary storage arrangements &mdash; which are less than satisfactory &mdash; have had to be made in respect of certain documents not used by the public to any significant extent.  Requests for such documents are dealt with in a manner that minimises disturbance to the records.  It is expected that the schedule in question will be furnished by the National Archives to the applicant by the end of this <Col N="848" /> month.  I understand that such delays affect only a relatively small proportion of cases where documents are required for legal purposes.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the particular restrictions on space giving rise to the need for the present storage arrangements will be overcome in the coming months.  Thereafter, copies of documents in such cases will be supplied within two weeks of an order for them.</P>

      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established under the Environmental Protection Act, 1992, and is an independent public body under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  It is organisationally distinct and operates independently of my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is responsible for the conservation of proposed Natural Heritage Areas and Special Areas of Conservation and, in this regard, its brief is very specific, that is, to safeguard the conservation status of species and habitats which are considered to be of national or international significance.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has, of course, a much wider environmental role, with more emphasis on what can loosely be termed general environmental &ldquo;cleanliness&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The opening hours of Athy Garda station are from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. each day except for two one-hour periods when it closes for meal breaks. At all times when the station is closed a telephone call diversion system linked to the District Headquarters at Carlow Garda station comes into operation.  In addition, there is a public call box at Athy Garda station to cater for callers to the station outside of opening hours.  I am informed that the station party at Athy provide a policing service in the area for up to 23 hours daily and this service is augmented by patrols based at the District Headquarters at Carlow.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that there are no plans at present to open Athy Garda station on a 24-hour basis.  However, I understand from them that the policing arrangements for the Athy area are constantly reviewed to meet changing demands and that they will continue to monitor the situation.  They have also assured me that as additional personnel become available for allocation the needs of the Athy area will be considered in conjunction with the needs of all other Garda districts and divisions in the country.</P>

Most of the letter-writers wrote identical or very similar letters to all of their constituency TDs who in turn wrote to me.  This has led to a situation where the same initial letter can require up to five separate replies.  To reply to all these letters means that staff who should be dealing with asylum applicants are diverted to replying to circular letters &mdash; surely this is not what was intended by the writers.</P>

      <P>Midleton GAA Club was allocated a grant of £15,000 under the recreational facilities scheme in May 1997.  Payment of the grant is subject to the club providing confirmation, part of which was supplied in August 1997, that the development complies with the terms and conditions of the scheme.  However, some essential documentation in this regard is still outstanding, and final payment is pending submission of same.

      <P>The report on &ldquo;Equality and the Structural Funds&rdquo;, jointly published in 1996 by the Community Workers Co-operative and the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action was a useful input into the community structural funds mid-term review process.</P>
      <P>In the context of this review, it is important to bear in mind that the basic objective of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 is to strengthen the Irish tourism sector in order to increase the contribution of overseas tourism revenue to the Irish economy and thereby create jobs.</P>
      <P>The programme has three main strands of activity &mdash; product development, marketing and training and is intended to benefit all geographical areas of the country.  While the programme, of its nature, tends to have a strong economic rather than a social thrust, focusing mainly on the development of infrastructure and the marketing of Ireland as a tourism destination, it does not neglect the more social issues through the provision of training for the disadvantaged and through the provision of infrastructural product suitable for the physically handicapped visitor.</P>
      <P>In line with the commitment of both the Government and the European Commission to improve the position of the socially disadvantaged, support is available to hotel proprietors to help meet the additional costs of providing suitable access-friendly accommodation for the disabled and related facilities in existing hotel premises, where the hotel plans to market and develop international tourism business in this specialist area.</P>
      <P>Help is also available to assist hotels and major visitor centres to provide access for the disabled, where this can be provided on a cost-effective basis.  Assistance towards the cost of modifications to existing structures, including the provision of ramps, suitable toilet or other facilities to allow access by the disabled, is eligible for European Regional Development Fund grants.</P>
      <P>The training sub-programme has specific targetes in relation to the unemployed and these targets are largely being met.  In 1996, 85 per cent of those who completed their training were placed in employment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the acknowledgment in the report that the training sub-programme addresses disadvantage. Furthermore, all courses offered under the programme show high rates of female participation.</P>

It is my firm intention that this should continue to be the case.</P>
      <P>Indeed, in view of the Deputy's obvious concern for the child in question, and notwithstanding the resource constraints which I have already outlined in the earlier replies, I have requested a member of my Department's inspectorate to contact the child's parents as a matter of priority to discuss possible options for addressing the child's needs.</P>

To date in 1997, a total of £714,676 has been expended on the provision of computer equipment in second level schools under this scheme.  This scheme will continue to operate in the post-primary sector as heretofore.  Notwithstanding this, the Government in the Action Programme for the New Millennium commits itself to the integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs) across curricula in first and second level schools.  My Department will shortly publish a comprehensive policy framework document on ICTs in the school system which will ensure that pupils in every school will have the opportunity to achieve computer literacy and equip themselves for participation in the Information Society. <Col N="861" /> The Department of Education and Science's forthcoming policy proposals on ICT's in first and second level schools will reflect a major Government investment in the future of Irish education and in our nation's future economic wellbeing.</P>

      <P>The enrolment at Clarecastle National School on 30 September 1996 was 254 pupils.  This warrants a staffing for the 1997-98 school year of <Col N="862" /> a principal and eight assistant teachers.  Accordingly, I regret that I am not in a position to sanction the appointment of an additional assistant teacher at this time.</P>
      <P>The school management has recently made application to my Department for a special teacher for traveller children.  In the particular circumstances of this case, and given the number of traveller children attending the school, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have sanctioned a special teacher for travellers for the school.</P>

      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.  For the current school year, a total of 31 additional resource teachers have been allocated to primary schools.  This brings the total number of resource teachers in the primary system to 77.</P>
      <P>My Department's capacity to allocate concessionary posts or resource posts in any year is entirely dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand across the special needs area.  Where such posts do become available, they are allocated on the basis of priority of need.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I am not in a position to allocate any further such posts to primary schools at present.  I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that in the event of additional posts becoming available, the needs of the school in question will be considered.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to a grant under the higher education grant scheme for the 1997-98 academic year is based on a candidate's reckonable gross income in the tax year ended 5 April 1997.  In the case of certain social welfare payments, a candidate is required to produce a statement from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs indicating the amount which the person received by way of the social welfare payment in the relevant tax year.  In this regard, a number of social welfare payments are not accessable as reckonable income, and, therefore, it is not necessary <Col N="866" /> to provide statements for child benefit, family income supplement, one parent family payment, disability allowance, where paid to the candidate, blind pension, where paid to the candidate, orphans' pensions and third level allowance.</P>
      <P>I am advised that it would not be appropriate to waive this requirement where the relevant social welfare book is presented as this book may not accurately reflect the person's income in the preceding tax year and could thus adversely affect a student's entitlement under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The standardised charge of £150 was levied by the third level colleges as a contribution towards the cost of examinations, registration and student services.  The charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years and set for review this year.</P>
      <P>The universities have argued that the true cost of these charges would, on average, amount to £400 in the 1997-98 academic year and that, increasingly, the services have required subvention from other areas of their income.  The need for improved student services has also been highlighted by both the universities and the technological sector.  In the light of these arguments and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250.  Students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>At my request, the chairman of the Higher Education authority has reconvened the working group which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.  I expect that this framework will be available by the end of November and in anticipation of the publication of the framework, I have requested all institutions to consult with students' unions on the application of funding for improved student services.  I have also increased the level of student representation on this working group.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I cannot accede to the Deputy's request.</P>

      <P>The pace at which general purpose rooms can be provided to primary schools is dictated by the financial resources available to me. The priority always has to be the provision of essential classroom accommodation and the elimination of substandard classrooms.  I am anxious to extend the provision of general purpose rooms to existing schools which have four or more classrooms such as St. Patrick's School in Calry. In order to achieve this, there is a policy of including a general purpose room in a building project at such schools where the project involved is also providing additional essential permanent classrooms.  Regrettably, therefore, it is not possible to approve funding towards the cost of a general purpose room at St. Patrick's National School, Calry, County Sligo, at this time. However, I assure the Deputy that the proposed project will be considered again in the light of future capital allocations.  I understand that my Department explained the position in a letter to the manager of St. Patrick's in May of this year.</P>

      <P>In addition to these student supports which are administered by my Department, the Office of Science and Technology provides scholarships, in the form of an annual grant of £2,000, to doctoral students in science and technology subjects.

      <P>Any extension of the free fees initiative has of necessity to be considered in the context of available resources and other competing needs in the education sector. At present I am precluded by overall resource constraints from considering any extension of the free fees initiative <Col N="875" /> to part-time courses.  Part-time students can, however, claim tax relief, at the standard rate, in respect of their tuition fees for approved part-time third level courses.</P>

      <P>The person to whom the Deputy refers is attending a new PLC course in international teleservices in one of the centres selected for this new initiative.  I have introduced a new student support scheme towards the cost of the overseas placement which is an intrinsic part of this new PLC course.  The scheme will apply to all participants on the PLC course in the selected centres, and will cover essential insurance costs, 75 per cent of the apex air fare, and a grant of £100 per week towards living expenses overseas, subject to a maximum of £300 for the air fare and £1,700 per student for living expenses.</P>
