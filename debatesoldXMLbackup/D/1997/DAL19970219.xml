      <P>Yesterday Deputy O'Donoghue published the Punishment of Aggravated Robbery Bill, 1997.  Since I believe there is agreement on all sides of the House to deal with the serious issue of attacks on individuals with syringes and since Deputy O'Donoghue has drafted a comprehensive Bill which is adequate to deal with the matter, will the Taoiseach agree to take it in Government time next week?</P>

      <P>In his reply to me yesterday the Taoiseach made some vague constitutional reference to transposing European directives. Will he confirm that the transposing of directives takes place under the European Communities Act?  Is it intended to amend that Act to ensure openness, accountability and transparency in the transposing of European Union directives and to bring it before the Dáil in advance of it being enacted into Irish law?</P>

      <P>As Members will recollect at the time we entered the European Union &mdash; Dr. Hillery was Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; arrangements were made for the examination of secondary legislation.  That led to one of the first committees of the House, the Joint Committee on European Affairs, being established which has the responsibility of scrutinising all delegated legislation arising from EU obligations under various treaties of the European Union.  If the Deputy has concerns in that matter I suggest he raise them with the relevant member of his party who serves on the committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation amending the Nurses Act will follow any new arrangements which might be made arising from the examination of the nursing profession which the Government wishes to institute.  There is a nursing Bill, consisting of 85 heads, which addresses the restructuring of An Bord Altranais, fitness to practise procedures, registration provisions and assignment of education functions.  We may be able to proceed with some of these provisions in advance of the report of the commission but other provisions may more prudently be retained until we receive the report so that any recommendations which go further can be incorporated in the legislation.  The proposal at this stage is to have the nursing Bill in its present form ready by the end of the year.  However, it may be necessary to defer the Bill or to make arrangements for further provisions to be added to it in light of the commission's report.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I asked the position in regard to the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill.  Given that previous deadlines were only aspirational, was the May-June deadline announced yesterday by the Taoiseach an aspirational or definite one? The Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) (Amendment) Bill is related to the wildlife Bill as it deals with the patenting of living species. When is it proposed to publish this Bill?</P>

I have given the Deputy the best estimated deadline for the publication of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill.  I hope the plant varieties legislation, which will allow us to ratify UPRV, will be ready by the second half of the year.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 21, line 33, after &ldquo;employment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, training and education&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 24 (2) (b) (xi) provides that the implications of the master plans on the employment of people living in the docklands area must be assessed.  The amendment will extend this requirement in so far as it will also require an assessment of the training and education implications of the master plan for the people of the docklands area.  A number of similar amendments were made to the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I tabled an amendment which proposed that the Minister would appoint, on nomination of the board, a person to be the educational officer of the Authority whose remit would be the promotion within the local community of the educational and employment opportunities within the area.  The Minister said he would give further consideration to my amendment before Report Stage.  While his amendment is an improvement it does not go far enough.</P>
      <P>Reports on the socio-economic and employment structures in the Dublin docklands area refer to the massive levels of unemployment and poor opportunities for local people.  One of the reasons is a lack of educational qualifications. People from the docklands area have stated that if the Authority does not make a real input into local schools then the renewal scheme will bypass the people of the area in the same way as other urban renewal schemes, which we all welcome, have by-passed people in other areas in recent years.  I ask the Minister to appoint a person who will deal with this issue.  The principals of primary schools in the area have stated that if parents are not aware of the educational and training standards required then their children will not be able to avail of the opportunities in their local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Ryan.  I wish to draw to the attention of the House the particular problems experienced by local schools in the area.  The boys' national school in Ringsend which is at the edge of the Dublin Docklands development area, but nonetheless is probably one of the primary <Col N="290" /> schools most concerned with the future of young children on the southside of the city, is hopelessly underfunded.  I do not want to digress too much from the subject matter of this Bill but the fourth, fifth and sixth classes are being taught by two teachers.  One teacher has to deal with the behaviourally problematic and educationally disadvantaged children and another with three classes of children who are making progress.</P>
      <P>The extent of disadvantage in that area is significant and I contrast the amount of effort being put into infrastructure development with the complete absence of progress on social development in the area.  This is a huge problem because there will be a colossal social injustice if people in deprived areas live cheek by jowl with massive investments in urban renewal.  It is of the utmost importance that resources are put into education in the local communities so that they can take advantage of the economic potential in terms of jobs which this new development will bring.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to castigate the Minister's proposal but if we do not move on two fronts at once &mdash; the infrastructure and redevelopment of the area and, on the other hand, the social development of the communities involved &mdash; we will create great resentment, bitterness, unhappiness and, in the last analysis, opposition to the docklands development project.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to talk about absence of resources in education but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish that the Deputy would not stray too far into educational matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Another Bill before this House proposes to establish ten regional education boards which will siphon £20 million into bureaucracy.  If one school in our constituency cheek by jowl with this development suffers educational deprivation, then the Dublin Docklands Development Authority must be organised to progress social development through educational help because there will be a huge problem if we proceed down the road of developing the docklands in Dublin and having resentful, embittered and marginalised communities in the middle of the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see the addition of training and education in the context of employment because it is important to start at grassroots level.  We cannot talk about employment in the area unless we provide skills, education and training. This has been a particularly disadvantaged area on both sides of the Liffey.  The previous two Deputies spoke about Ringsend but on the northside of the Liffey, there are the areas of Sheriff Street, East Wall and Séan McDermott Street which are perhaps the most deprived in the city. They have 80 per cent endemic unemployment and this is our last opportunity to foster social integration in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Custom House Docks development is very much an oasis in an area on which it has not made <Col N="291" /> any significant impact in terms of the quality of life of the indigenous population and we do not want to see the docklands development go down that road.  A great deal of thought and work has gone into achieving broader social integration in the docklands area but it needs to be done in a structured fashion and we need to ensure contact is made with school principals, teachers and parents. All schools in the area should be contacted but it must be done in a holistic and comprehensive fashion so that the likely skills and employment opportunities that will come on stream will be utilised.  Parents must be made aware that if the youngsters stay in school and follow the curriculum they will find employment in the areas in which they live.  That is what social integration is about.</P>
    <P>There is no sense in talking about bricks and mortar and great ideas unless we put the people first in terms of the development and this issue is central to the Bill.  The docklands area is massive, comprising 1,300 acres, and it is the last single major development that will take place in the inner city.  I exhort the Minister to ensure that those responsible at present for drawing up the plans and those who will be responsible in future are given every support in this Bill and that they do their work in a comprehensive fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with any of the views put forward by the Deputies.  Too often in the past we have seen major investment in physical structures where social needs and education and training needs of people were either ignored or forgotten.  The Government addressed this issue in a positive way under the urban initiative, which provides a major programme in regard to education and training and supporting people through social services.</P>
      <P>The regional education boards are bringing education to the people and have been widely supported by consumers.  As a result of comments on earlier Stages of the Bill, this amendment is included to reflect almost all the views expressed. The Authority will have an obligation to address the training and education needs of the people of the area as well as the physical development of the area.  This is a good amendment and I ask that it be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were very few amendments to this Bill because it was widely accepted and supported.  I tabled only two amendments and the most important one concerned education.  We got a progress report on the master plan yesterday. The crazy waste of taxpayers' money on the publication of a full colour brochure detailing the progress made on the master plan is outrageous. We are halfway through the master plan and we <Col N="292" /> are saying that the training and education elements proposed in the amendment will be incorporated in it.  If a person is not appointed to deal with this issue on a full time basis the proposals will not work.  There are endless examples of where urban renewal has not worked.  The Minister for Finance supports the idea and it should be put in place.  One person should deal specifically with training and education and the employment opportunities that will accrue.  That is not covered in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 31, lines 20 to 22, to delete &ldquo;section 15 (inserted by the European Parliament Elections Act, 1993) of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;section 19 of the European Parliament Elections Act, 1997,&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I want to express considerable reservation about the education issue.  I am not happy that it has been dealt with satisfactorily. I accept the Minister's amendment is some progress in that way but if we are talking about regeneration, not merely of the 1,300 acres involved, but also of the hopes of the communities in these areas, more has to be done than is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the same theme, the prospects for employment for inner city young men in particular are dim.  A holistic approach must be taken to the question of inner city regeneration.  A strong <Col N="293" /> stance must be taken by Government to integrate the futures of these young men with the physical regeneration of their areas.  The Bill does not go far enough along those lines.</P>
    <P>If all we succeed in doing when regenerating these areas is &ldquo;yuppify&rdquo; south and north inner city areas and make them look nice, and if we leave in being deprived communities where there is 60 per cent to 80 per cent endemic unemployment, problems with drugs, social marginalisation and educational disadvantage, we will produce a disillusioned, alienated and hostile community cheek by jowl with the new development.  The cost in terms of delinquency, drug addiction and other social problems will be enormous.  The hap'orth of tar that will save this ship is expenditure, not simply on physical regeneration of the area but on social regeneration also.  The key to that is making sure boys' and girls' national schools in these areas educate children so that they will attend training courses and that those courses will educate them into taking a meaningful part in the renewal promised in the Bill.  If we do not do that, the Bill will achieve far less than could otherwise be done.</P>

      <P>The Bill, is a welcome initiative but it behoves us to draw to the Minister's attention, and particularly to the attention of those currently compiling the master plan, any lacuna in it.  My concerns about the Bill have always related to its effectiveness in addressing the entire needs of the community with which the master plan will deal.  Section 4 states that the Minister may alter the docklands area so as to include an area of land contiguous to and wider than that prescribed in the Bill.  In terms of the master plan that should be done at an early stage.  The planned area on the northside should have been widened to include Sean McDermott Street, Summerhill, Foley Street, Corporation Street and Railway Street.  Those disadvantaged areas are in need of regeneration and the only way to do that is to include them in the overall plan.</P>
      <P>The area identified for this development has been a blackspot for the past 30 years.  It has a high level of unemployment as well as major drug abuse and joyriding problems.  For that reason we should have treated it not merely as a docklands development but as a blackspot area.  It has potential, however, in terms of development.</P>

I am aware that the people involved in drawing up the master plan have consulted with local politicians and the local <Col N="294" /> authority, but we must ensure that this area is properly developed.  This is our last opportunity to do so and I urge the Minister to bring that to the attention of those currently drawing up the master plan.  He must ensure that the broadest consultation takes place with the community as well as educational and training interests.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  A large area of Dublin is in a run-down state but I am disappointed that the educational and training aspect of the Bill is not sufficiently strong.  The reports prepared for the Dublin docklands area master plan indicate that 30 per cent of the population is unemployed.  These people are living in the middle of an area where there is a high level of employment.  They have a tradition of working on the docks but, unfortunately, the Dublin Port &amp; Docks Board no longer employs people in the way it did in the past.  Irish Shipping, the Irish Glass Bottle Company, Guinness's and the other traditional employers in the area have either gone out of business or are producing more with fewer employees.  Those traditional industries no longer provide employment for the young people of the area; they must find employment elsewhere. School principals in the area have highlighted this problem.</P>

What is the purpose of the Bill if it does not provide employment for the people of that area?  It does not make sense to pass legislation dealing with education and training when the master plan is nearly complete.  We should progress at a slower pace to ensure that correct decisions are taken.  The educational aspect of the Bill is not strong enough.</P>

      <P>I agree with most of the comments because similar difficulties arise in my area.  This legislation will enable the authority to uplift the economy of the docklands area.  The locals are confident the area will benefit economically as a result of this legislation and the setting up of the authority.  The Government is conscious of the educational and training needs of the people involved.  The report is an interim one.  Educational and training matters will be an integral part of the final report which will be published by the end of March.  The authority as a whole, not one person, will be responsible for developing educational and training programmes for the area.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 6 to 10 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  For the purposes of the Central Bank Acts, 1942 to 1997, 'deposit', on or after the commencement of this section, means a sum of money accepted on terms under which it is repayable with or without interest whether on demand or on notice or at a fixed or determinable future date.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Banking Business&rdquo; is defined in Irish law as the taking of deposits.  A number of exclusions to the definition are listed in the Central Bank Acts, 1971 and 1989.  However, no Irish legal definition of what constitutes a &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; is provided for in <Col N="296" /> law.  The Bill, as published, provided for such a definition to be incorporated into Irish law.  This was necessary because, as the savings market becomes more competitive, the distinction between deposits and other forms of investment is becoming more blurred and the lack of a legal definition of a deposit is causing concern.  This anomaly caused particular concern during a recent successful prosecution of a finance company by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>As I notified the House on Committee Stage, representations were made to the Department and the Central Bank by the banks and the Incorporated Law Society in regard to possible difficulties concerning the definition of &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; as set out in section 2(2) of the Bill as published. Following consultations between the Department, the Central Bank and the Office of the Attorney General it was decided to tighten the definitions to provide that only deposits &ldquo;taken from the public&rdquo; would be covered and to broaden the list of exclusions as already provided for in the 1971 and 1989 Acts.  The opportunity has also been taken to include a provision to allow the Minister for Finance to amend the list of exclusions if the need arises.</P>
    <P>For purposes of clarity and for the sake of ease of reference, I have decided to substitute an entirely new section for the existing provisions related to the definition of &ldquo;banking business&rdquo; which are currently spread across the existing banking legislation, from the 1971 Act to regulations in 1995.  Accordingly, whereas the provision I am presenting today is lengthy, technical and amends several existing provisions, for the first time, it brings all the provisions on banking business along with the new definition of deposition into one provision.  However, the number of amendments to the existing definitions are few and primarily related to the new definition of &ldquo;deposit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Banking Business is defined essentially as the taking of deposits.  There is, however, no Irish legal definition of what constitutes a deposit. Amendment No. 3 provides for such a definition to be incorporated into Irish law.  The provision encompasses all sums of money accepted from the public on terms under which they are repayable, with or without interest, either on demand, on notice or at a fixed or determinable future date.  Amendment No. 10 amends a number of provisions in the 1971 Act to cater for the new definition of deposit that I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) substitutes a new subsection (1) in section 7 of the 1971 Act.  The new subsection encompasses the amendments made to the original section 7(1) in the European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) Regulations, 1995 and takes into account the new definition of &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; and the changes to the definition of &ldquo;banking business&rdquo;, set out in paragraph (b).</P>
    <P>The new provision is that subject to the provisions of the Act, a person, other than the bank shall not, in or outside the State, carry on banking business or hold themselves out or represent <Col N="297" /> themselves as bankers or as carrying on banking business or on behalf of any other person accept deposits or other repayable funds from the public, unless they hold a licence.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) provides for a substitution in section 2 of the Act of 1971 of a new definition of &ldquo;banking business&rdquo;.  The new definition incorporates amendments made to the original definition in the 1971 Act by section 29 of the Act of 1989 and takes into account the new definition of deposit set out in amendment No. 2.  The new definition provides that &ldquo;banking business&rdquo; means: (a) the business of accepting deposits or other repayable funds from the public on own account, whether involving the issue of securities or other obligations howsoever described, or (b) as provided for in (a) and any other business normally carried on by banks including the granting of credits on own account.</P>
    <P>The following are excluded from the definition of banking business: (i) as already provided for in the 1971 Act, deposits with a trader from persons employed by him in his trading business or from his customers in the normal course of his trading business and deposits or instalments in respect of the letting, leasing or selling of goods under hire-purchase agreement or a leasing agreement or a credit-sale agreement, or (ii) a sum or sums of money accepted as security or collateral or as a bond for the repayment of a debt or the performance of a contract related to goods or services, (iii) a sum or sums of money accepted by way of advance or part payment under a contract for the sale, hire or other provision of goods or services, and repayable only in the event that the goods or services are not sold, hired or otherwise provided; (iv) &mdash; as already provided for in the 1989 Act &mdash; a sum or sums of money accepted solely as a premium in respect of the issue or renewal of a life assurance policy issued by a holder of an authorisation under the European Communities (Life Assurance) Regulations, 1984 (S.I. No. 57 of 1984); (v) a sum or sums of money accepted as a contribution within the meaning of the Pensions Acts, 1990 to 1996; (vi) &mdash; as already provided for in the 1989 Act &mdash; a sum or sums of money accepted by a person where it can be shown that (I) no part of the business activities of the person so accepting or of any other person is financed wholly or substantially out of those funds, and (II) such funds are, in the normal course of business, accepted on a casual or incidental basis only; (vii) a sum or sums of money accepted under financial contracts, within the meaning of the Netting of Financial Contracts Act, 1995, which may include the acceptance of collateral.</P>
    <P>Sub-paragraphs (ii), (iii), (v), and (vii) are being added to the list of exclusions as a result of developments since 1989.  Paragraph (c) inserts a new subsection (2) into section 2 of the 1971 Act and provides that the Minister for Finance, where he considers it consistent with the proper and orderly regulation of banking, may, by order, amend the list of exclusions, either by addition or deletion, from the definition of banking business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> Paragraph (d) substitutes a new paragraph (a) into section 8(2) of the 1971 Act taking account of amendments made to section 8 in the 1989 Act and provides that the bank may exempt any person or any class or classes of person from the requirement to hold a licence in respect of the issuing of any category or categories of securities or other obligations, howsoever described, where (i) the requirements would arise only out of the issuing of such securities or other obligations to which the definition of banking business relates; and (ii) the bank is of the opinion that the exemption would not conflict with the orderly and proper regulation of banking.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) substitutes a new section for section 27 of the Act of 1971, as amended in the 1989 Act and in the European Communities (Licensing and Supervision of Credit Institutions) Regulations, 1992, which deals with the advertising for deposits.  The amendment incorporates the necessary changes to take account of the new definitions of &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; and &ldquo;banking business&rdquo; and provides that: subject to subsection (2) of this section, a person shall not advertise for or otherwise solicit deposits or other repayable funds from the public on his or her own behalf or on behalf of any other person; subsection (1) of this section does not apply to advertising for or otherwise soliciting deposits or other repayable funds from the public (a) by the holder of a licence or the bank or a person to whom, by virtue of section 7(4) of the 1971 Act, section 7(1) of the Act of 1971 does not apply, (b) by a person authorised by virtue of the European Communities (Licensing and Supervision of Credit Institutions) Regulations, 1992, to carry on business in the State, or (c) by any person on behalf of a person specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection; if an advertisement or other solicitation for deposits or other repayable funds from the public is published and it does not include the name and address of the person who arranged with the publisher for the advertisement or solicitation, the bank may, at any time within the period of 12 months after any publication of the advertisement, request the publisher to supply the name and address of that person to the bank and the publisher shall forthwith comply with that request; in this section &ldquo;deposits or other repayable funds from the public&rdquo; does not include the acceptance of a sum or sums of money excluded from the definition of banking business under section 2 of the Act of 1971, as amended by this Bill &mdash; I refer to my comments on amendment No. 10; reference in this section or section 58(3) of this Act, as amended by section 9 of the Act of 1989, to the solicitation of deposits, however expressed, includes every form of solicitation for deposits including, in particular, the display or publication of any such matter by way of notice, leaflet, circular, pamphlet, brochure, photograph, film, video, sound broadcasting, television, electronic communication or personal canvassing.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 is a technical one which amends the current section 76 of the Bill to cater <Col N="299" /> for the amendments to the 1971 Act outlined in amendments Nos. 3 and 10.  The provision is, essentially, the same as the original section 76; only cross-references to the amending legislation have changed.</P>
    <P>By way of background explanation, a recent prosecution by the bank against a finance company, although successful, highlighted a weakness in the Central Bank's powers.  The offence related to the advertising for deposits by a company which had no authorisation to do so.  A substantial delay occurred between the date on which the advertisement was first noted by the bank and the final hearing of the prosecution, during which time the bank had no power to prohibit the company from accepting deposits.  Section 76 overcomes this delay by providing for the conferring on the bank of a statutory power to apply to the civil courts for an injunction in respect of the taking of, or advertising for, deposits by a person not licensed or authorised to do so under the Central Bank, Building Societies, TSB, ACC or ICC Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to take the Minister's word that all these provisions are necessary. Amendment No. 10 states: &ldquo;In page 33, to delete lines 34 to 43 and substitute the following&rdquo;, and the following contains about two and a half pages. The change, therefore, must be fairly significant, or perhaps there is another explanation for the amendment.  The deletion of nine lines is a small matter, but the insertion of two and a half pages of an amendment gives grounds for believing that the amendment is substantial.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that matter.</P>
      <P>It is not a good idea to introduce such a substantial amendment on Report Stage, although I recognise that between the initiation of a Bill and its passing matters come to light as a result of representations made by organisations and further research.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it should not be standard practice to substitute nine lines with about 110 lines.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept this seems a rather comprehensive amendment to bring forward on Report Stage, but it is not so in terms of incorporating new material.  I decided to substitute a new section for the existing provisions because defining the term &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; for the first time in the Bill necessitated extending the definition of banking business.  As the definition of banking business is <Col N="300" /> currently spread across four or five different Acts from 1971 and regulations in 1995, we decided to consolidate them in this Bill so that law agents and other legal advisers would not have to search through four or five pieces of legislation.  This Bill now incorporates the definition of deposit for the first time and the extended definition of banking business.  This is a tidying up exercise.</P>
      <P>The seven or eight exclusions I mentioned are already included in legislation, but we have gathered them together in this new subsection and added a few more.  I mentioned four new exclusions which have been included because of the complexity of banking today in comparison to when the legislation was first introduced.  This is in response to demands in the banking business and as a result of the new services being provided by credit institutions generally.  We want to ensure that by tightening our definition of banking business and including a definition of deposit, we do not inadvertently exclude legitimate business. That is why we broadened our definition to cater for all the services provided by credit institutions. Our purpose is to consolidate.  We are including existing exclusions and adding three or four more to ensure we do not inadvertently exclude the legitimate services provided by legitimate credit institutions.</P>

      <P>(a) in section 101 by the insertion after subsection (6) of the following subsections&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(7)  The terms of a conversion scheme may, if it has been approved by the board of directors of the society, specify that if the Central Bank considers it in the commercial interest of the successor company the successor company may allot or agree <Col N="305" /> to allot any shares in or debentures of the company so as to enable more than 15 per cent. and up to 100 per cent. of the shares in or debentures of the company to be subscribed for or acquired and held by, or by nominees for, any one person.</P>
    <P>(8)  The Central Bank may, in contemplation of the intended exercise of its powers under section 102 (4) undertake by notice to a building society that conditional upon and immediately following approval, confirmation and registration of a conversion scheme in accordance with Part XI, it will consider it in the commercial interest of the successor company to direct, and that it will direct by notice in writing to such successor company that subsections (1), (2) and (3) of section 102 shall cease to apply to such successor company, forthwith upon registration of the society as a company, pursuant to section 106, so as to enable more than 15 per cent. and up to 100 per cent. of the shares in or debentures of the company to be subscribed for or acquired and held by, or by nominees for, any one person in accordance with the provisions of the conversion scheme.&rsquo;,</P>
    <P>(b) by the insertion after section 101 of the following section:&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We had a good debate on this issue on Committee Stage.  This amendment seeks to change the building societies Act.  The Irish Nationwide lobbied the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment and myself in relation to this issue and this amendment was tabled to accommodate its concerns.  I and my partner have a mortgage with that building society and I declared that interest on Committee Stage under the Ethics in Public Office Act.  The Minister knows my views on ethics in Government which are reflected on all sides of the House.  We must be careful to declare everything under this Act because people are waiting to catch us out if we forget something.  My parents always taught me to bless myself every time I passed a church.  I feel like blessing myself every time there is something to declare under the Ethics in Public Office Act.</P>
    <P>I also received representations from other building societies which did not want me to table these amendments.  I met one building society in the past week and I had correspondence with another.  Since I named the Irish Nationwide, it is only fair to state that the Educational Building Society and the First National Building Society also lobbied me during the past week because they are opposed to the change.  Yesterday morning I received a letter from Norwich Union which supports the amendments I tabled.  It seems that opinions are evenly divided among the building societies.  As I said on Committee Stage, opinions in the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment and the Central Bank are probably <Col N="306" /> evenly split, although I understand the Central Bank has no strong views one way or the other on this matter.  This shows there is a difference of opinion about these amendments.  On Committee Stage a fortnight ago the Minister argued forcefully against the proposed changes to the Building Societies Acts while I argued forcefully that changes should be made.  Since then I have given the matter further thought and am still convinced of the merits of my argument.  On balance, the proposed changes should be followed through.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister about this matter.  It is his view this Bill is not an appropriate vehicle for a proposal which would involve a major change of policy towards the mutual building society movement.  Building societies come within the remit of the Department of the Enterprise and Employment.  The question has been raised during the years whether that Department should be the sole regulator or the parent Department with responsibility for initiating or amending legislation. This matter would be more appropriate to the remit of the Department of Finance than any other.</P>
    <P>There are some strange anomalies in the system of regulatory control.  The Investment Intermediaries Act, to which it is proposed to make changes in this Bill to resolve the problems which have arisen following the collapse of the Taylor companies, is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  It would be more appropriate to the remit of the Department of Finance.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment is processing the Credit Union Bill and the accompanying financial instruments.  That too would be more appropriate to the remit of the Department of Finance or perhaps the Central Bank.  I presume the reason the Credit Union Bill is being processed by the Department of the Enterprise and Employment is that the Registrar of Friendly Societies came within the remit of the old Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The Government or an incoming Administration should consider making changes in this area.  Politicians often make the flamboyant gesture of changing the names of Departments.  Yesterday, the Minister of State at the Department of Education proposed that a new Administration should consider the establishment of a Ministry of Sport.  This has also been advocated by my party. Following the negotiations on the formation of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party Government I was appointed Minister at the newly established Department of Tourism and Trade.  Other changes were also made at that time.  The Government or an incoming Administration should look at the functions performed by various Departments to see if they are still appropriate to am well aware of the rule in the public service that what one has one holds and that one should not give anything away to the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> The reasons advanced in support of these amendments on Committee Stage are still valid. Building societies have changed dramatically since the Minister of State and I were in University College Dublin together.  One of the reasons customers are getting such a good deal from building societies and banks in seeking mortgages is that they are far more aware they are in the driving seat.  Following her student days I do not know if the Minister of State was better off than I was but I had difficulty in obtaining my first housing loan.  One was required to leave money on deposit for a year to a year and a half and was only allowed a multiple of one's earnings.  Even if one had friends who were well in, it was still considered to be a big deal.</P>
    <P>We should contrast this with the position today when one cannot turn on the radio without having one's ears blown off by one financial institution after another advertising their deposit rates for handing money over to them and the great deals on offer in seeking to borrow money from them, be it for a motor car, a foreign holiday, a first or second house or an apartment.  Competition has led to these miraculous changes.  I am sure the Minister of State remembers the days when one was brought by one's parents to the big town and when only those who were well in got in to see the bank manager.  Nowadays they come out on to the street to ask if one wants to borrow money.</P>
    <P>As an aside, stupid mistakes are being made by the financial institutions in the way they are pursuing the residential house market.  I have no wish to be a prophet of doom but history, both here and abroad, teaches us that this may all end in tears, if there is a turn in the market.  The financial institutions are helping to push up house prices but that is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>These amendments would give building societies another option.  Under the law, as it stands, a building society wishing to expand can either stay as it is or go public.  The Irish Permanent Building Society took this route.  For a period of five years no one individual can accumulate a shareholding greater than 15 per cent.  At the end of this period it may be taken over.  There are people in this town who are holding on to their shares in the belief that there is a big suitor waiting to offer a colossal sum.  I am sure the price of shares in the Irish Permanent reflects the earnings of the society but a large number of people are holding on to shares on the basis that that will happen. When it does, an individual or company anywhere in the world will be able to buy Irish Permanent shares and nobody else will have a say in it.</P>
    <P>This amendment would allow another option to be taken by a building society.  It would allow a building society to make its own arrangements with a potential suitor, another financial institution, either by becoming a subsidiary of that financial institution or making some other arrangement with it.  All other financial institutions <Col N="308" /> in the State, including the State's financial institutions, are allowed to do this.</P>
    <P>Not long after we discussed this matter on Committee Stage the Industrial Credit Corporation announced its results and I am sure its chairman, Mr. Phil Flynn, for whom I have the greatest respect, will not be offended when I say that he is not regarded as a rabid capitalist.  Far from it, Mr. Flynn comes from the other area of Irish life which believes that the State should have good control over many activities and that no financial institution could head off in a particular direction which would be to the detriment of the ordinary mortgage holder or lender.  A report in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Tuesday, 11 February 1997, regarding the ICC results stated:</P>
    <P>ICC Bank is now worth at least £100 million, according to bank chairman Mr Phil Flynn.  The bank would like to form a strategic partnership to support future growth and Mr Flynn would favour a partnership with a foreign-based bank ...</P>
    <P>Irrespective of all the talk of a third banking force, it looks like ICC Bank will remain a State bank for some time as the idea of any change in that regard has been put on the back burner. Therefore, one of the State banks is heading in that direction and it is allowed to do so.  There is nothing in law to prevent it from doing so or to prevent the Agricultural Credit Corporation from heading in the same direction.  I support the views of the chairman of ICC.  He is right and I hope he will be able to form a strategic alliance with a strategic partner, home or foreign based.  I have no objections to his contention.  I am only using the example of the ICC chairman's comments regarding a partnership to enforce my view about what my amendments will achieve.  All they will do is allow a mutual building society to form a partnership with either a home or foreign based institution.  It will put them on the same footing as any other financial institution in the State.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, built into the amendments which I have tabled would be three fences which a mutual building society would have to clear before it could head in that direction.  First, the society policy holders or deposit holders would have to give their consent.  Second, the mortgage holders would have to give their consent.  Of course, the board of directors of the building society would have to give its consent and approve the deal at the outset.  Finally, it would be subject to the overall consent of the Central Bank.  For example, if a case was approved by the board, the mortgage holders and policy holders, but the Central Bank, acting in the national interest, said it was not the appropriate time to do it and the Central Bank had reasons for not allowing it, it could veto it.  I have no objection to changing my amendment so that it could be subject to the final approval of the Minister for Finance nor have I any objection to incorporating a final fence which must be cleared, either the Central Bank or the Minister for Finance, who could say that this is <Col N="309" /> not the proper course for the building society concerned at present.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Educational Building Society and the First National Building Society who disagree with these amendments.  I had a very thorough briefing by representatives of one of those building societies and I was most impressed by the way they put forward its case, not heckling or lecturing but in a forceful way, and I can readily understand their point of view.  I was impressed by their presentation and their belief in their arguments but their view is short-sighted because we must take the overall broader interest into account.</P>
    <P>Two building societies are in favour of my change and two are against it.  None of the representatives on either side of the argument referred to competition, but some of their objections definitely relate to it.  The building societies who are arguing against my changes are short-sighted. Think of the logical progression.  If my amendments are not accepted, the building societies who want to develop more business will head the route of becoming public companies.  If they do it will guarantee increased competition after the five years are up.  The people who say &ldquo;no change&rdquo; give the example of what has happened in the UK but I believe the financial market has become so global that if the narrower view is taken you will get nowhere.</P>
    <P>None of these building societies is a State organisation but this type of argument, about keeping things as they are, was used by many illustrious State organisations in a wide variety of areas to influence Departments and Ministers over the years.  I readily recall when it was proposed many years ago in the Department of Transport that there could be other carriers the argument of Aer Lingus was that it could prove it was catering for the market.  However, people know what happened since Ryanair came into the market.  The market has grown and the customer and the taxpayer have benefited.</P>
    <P>I remember the arguments put forward over the years by the major cement supplier in the State to the effect that it was supplying all the cement needed here and that the IDA should not grant-aid anybody else.  That argument worked to protect it, but look what happened when other players, some Irish, came into the market.  The market has grown, there is better competition and everybody has benefited.</P>
    <P>Whereas I can understand the views of the building societies who do not want to change, they are short-sighted and looking at it from too narrow a focus.  In years to come they will regret not having gone this route.  I do not believe they or Irish mortgage holders have anything to fear because the situation is not like it was 20 years ago when the building societies cartel fixed interest rates. Those days are gone.  Even if they wanted to do that now, it would make no difference because there are other players in the market who would be running after the customer.  That is the result <Col N="310" /> of competition.  While Mr. Flynn might be more on the left side of Irish politics, I make no secret of the fact that I support competition in all sectors. These amendments would help to achieve that.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced by the arguments put forward against this amendment on Committee Stage or by those put forward by the two building societies that argued in favour of the <i>status quo.</i> I respect the legitimacy of their viewpoints, their entitlement to make them known and thank them for doing so, but we should proceed along the lines set out in my amendment.  I commend my amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for the fervour with which he argued his case.  It will not come as any surprise to him that I will not be accepting his amendments.  As I indicated on Committee Stage, these amendments are intended to effectively remove the protective provisions of section 102 of the Building Societies Act, 1989 which prevent any one person or institution holding more than 15 per cent of the shares in a building society for five years after conversion to plc status.  The five year waiting period was introduced to ensure that a building society, having converted to plc status, was not exposed to take over within the five year period.  It was also introduced, and more importantly in this context, to protect mutual building societies from speculative pressures to bring about a conversion with a view to takeover.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy appears to argue that his amendments will lead to greater competition.  I do not agree.  If his amendments were accepted it would be open season on the remaining mutual building societies and very quickly none would be left.  The only agencies providing housing mortgage finance here would be those seeking to maximise the return to their shareholders at the expense of borrowers and savers.  The Government has to consider the broader public interest, particularly from the housing policy point of view. The proposed amendments would lead to a loss of diversity and competition in the mortgage market, a monopoly position by plcs and, ultimately, to higher mortgage interest rates.  That is not just an academic argument, there is evidence that would be the case.</P>
      <P>At present societies committed to mutual status offer significantly lower mortgage rates and higher returns to savers than those available from other lending agencies.  In addition, mutual building societies tend to be more even-handed in their treatment of new and existing borrowers, unlike other lending agencies which, in their efforts to increase market share, offer discounted rates to new borrowers at the expense of their existing borrowers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The likely result of the proposed amendments would be that all building societies, including those committed to mutual status, would be forced to convert to plc status.  The Deputy talked about the representations he received for and against his amendments by different building <Col N="311" /> societies; two for and two against.  I believe I am right in saying that those supporting Deputy McCreevy's arguments have committed themselves to a certain line of action and development in this regard.  The two that are against them have not indicated this is the road they wish to travel. It is interesting that even though there is an even keel in terms of representations for and against his arguments, quite a different agenda is being played out by the two that support Deputy McCreevy's arguments as distinct from the two who do not support him.  That distinction deserves to be put on the record.</P>
    <P>The loss of mutual building societies would have adverse consequences including loss of competition and diversity in the mortgage market and higher mortgage interest rates than would otherwise be the case.  Moreover, if building societies converting to plc status were taken over by UK or any other institutions, there is a real risk that higher loan ratios, negative equity problems on a market downturn and a significantly higher repossession rate, which are features of the UK market, would become more prevalent here.</P>
    <P>It is also wrong for Deputy McCreevy to suggest that the Central Bank or the Minister for Finance would be in a position to protect the broader public interest, if these amendments were accepted.  These amendments would enable the directors of a building society to include in a conversion scheme a provision which would effectively require the Central Bank to sanction the takeover of a society on conversion to plc status solely in the commercial interests of the company and regardless of any adverse affects on mortgage holders or the mortgage market generally.  This would mean that if it were shown to be profitable for the successor company, the Central Bank &mdash; or for &ldquo;Central Bank&rdquo; to read &ldquo;Minister for Finance&rdquo; as Deputy McCreevy suggested &mdash; would have to give permission.  Inevitably it would be profitable if the successor company could charge higher interest rates in a situation of reduced competition.  The proposed amendments appear to ignore the long-term interest of borrowers and savers in mutual societies and are contrary to the overall need to have a diverse and competitive mortgage market.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McCreevy mentioned, building societies legislation is under the aegis of the Department of the Environment.  I do not disagree philosophically with his point about tidying up all legislation relating to financial institutions, but that is a debate for another day.  Generally I would be sympathetic to the Deputy's case in that regard.  As of now, as we discuss mutual building societies and Deputy McCreevy's amendment, building society legislation is a matter for the Department of the Environment.  What the Deputy is suggesting would be a major policy change.  Major changes in policy which would drastically affect mortgage holders and the mortgage market here should not be made by way of an amendment to this Bill that is not being sponsored <Col N="312" /> by the parent Department responsible for building societies, the Department of the Environment, but by the Department of Finance. However, I am not saying the door is closed on further discussions in this area, but this is not the right Bill under which to amend building societies legislation.</P>
    <P>We may not agree on the impact of such a policy change on the competitiveness of the market or on mortgage holders and the mortgage market generally, but at the very least I suggest this is not the correct time for that debate nor would we be doing justice to such a major policy change by introducing it by way of a mere amendment and, with the greatest respect to Deputy McCreevy's intellectual rigour, with he and I deciding the future of mutual building societies and mortgage holders.  That is not the proper way to handle this policy change.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy might interest himself in the building societies legislation under the aegis of the Department of the Environment or speak to his party's spokesperson.  The debate properly lies between the Minister for the Environment and his party's environment spokesperson.  The Deputy and I are stepping into another territory. There is a precedent for taking on board an amendment which might properly be sponsored by another Department, but this is too major a policy change to contemplate by way of a short amendment to the Bill we are debating.  There will be another day to debate this matter.  There are two sides to the argument.  I accept the Deputy's point that this is not a black and white case, but the jury is out.  This is neither the time nor the place to make such a major policy change.  I cannot accept the Deputy's amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I guessed the Minister would not accept my amendment.  I do not necessarily agree that this amendment should not be incorporated in this Bill.  The debate about this change has been ongoing for some time.  Representations were made to the Departments of Finance and Environment over a long number of years.  What is good about this new era of openness, transparency and accountability is that everyone knows the arguments and who is putting them forward.  It is a backhanded compliment to the Minister of State and me that we are open about who put forward these contentions on both sides. As she correctly pointed out, there is not universal agreement among the building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should building societies, which are independent financial institutions, be treated differently from other such institutions?  With competition between the lending institutions, past arguments no longer apply.  The Irish Permanent Building Society, the largest operator in the market, has become a plc and in two years' time the Government will not be able to lay a glove on it. That building society retains the greatest share of the market because of the route it took.  The Irish Civil Service Building Society was a major force in the market some years ago but legislation was <Col N="313" /> introduced to allow it to be taken over by the Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Governments of the day have interfered in the lending market.  I accept that the debate should be broadened and perhaps there is time for further discussion.  However, in a number of years building societies who forcefully oppose this change will realise that they were very short-sighted.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is correct. A number of vested interests are connected with this matter.  It would be foolish for organisations to believe that everyone considers people's general interests.  If legislation was introduced to reduce the number of Deputies from 166 to 110 &mdash; this would not necessitate a constitutional change because, in line with constitutional provisions, there would still be one Deputy per 30,000 members of the population&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that legislation would not be passed by the House, despite the fact that it could be in the national interest to do so.  This is similar to cases put forward by the building societies or other institutions which have vested interests at stake.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the proposed change would lead to a loss of diversity.  I do not agree with the Minister of State's arguments which were also put forward by the building societies who oppose the change.  The Minister of State made the case that if the amendment was accepted a building society would be able to structure the case in favour of its being taken over in such a way that the Central Bank would be obliged to agree.  I would be surprised if the parliamentary draftsmen and officials &mdash; who were able to draw up amendments to remove a word and substitute another word followed by full stops, semi-colons and commas &mdash; were unable to ensure that would not happen.  I have no doubt that the sponsoring Department could include a section in the legislation to guard against such eventualities.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister of State is not in a position to accept the amendments.  I thank her for her openness during the debate.  We both know that universal agreement does not exist in respect of the arguments put forward.  I am certain that this matter will be revisited in time.</P>

      <P>I wish to reply to Deputy McCreevy's point about the ICS Building Society.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, the case of the ICS does not form a precedent for current proposals from, for example, the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The ICS was unique in that investment shares in the society, which were limited <Col N="314" /> in number, were quoted and tradeable on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I was not aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Shareholders in the ICS &mdash; savers in normal building society parlance &mdash; had no voting rights.  The structure of the society was quite different from traditional mutual societies such as the Irish Nationwide Building Society, the EBS and others.</P>
      <P>In 1984, the Bank of Ireland approached the ICS with a view to purchasing the investment and so gaining control of the society.  The Government of the day decided to oppose the take-over by the Bank of Ireland on the grounds that it would reduce competition in the mortgage market. In the interests of consistency, my greatest difficulty with the Deputy's amendment would be the likely reduction in competition.  Legislation was drafted to effect the then Government's decision but the Attorney General's office advised that this might give rise to constitutional difficulties because of a potential infringement of the constitutional property rights of ICS investment shareholders.  It was, therefore, not possible to prevent the take-over but certain modifications to the structure of the society, such as voting rights for ordinary shareholders, were agreed with the Bank of Ireland.  In recognition of the bank's large investment in the ICS and its rights in that regard, section 74(9) of the Building Societies Act, 1989 retained a provision enabling the bank to refer proposals for special resolutions &mdash; which relate to fundamental structural changes in the affairs of the society &mdash; to arbitration where they are made by savings shareholders and considered to be contrary to the interests of the investment shareholders, namely, the Bank of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I place this explanation on record because the Deputy introduced to the debate the history of the ICS and the Bank of Ireland in the mid-1980s. His example cannot be used as a precedent in respect of current proposals from the Irish Nationwide Building Society because the cases are different.  The ICS was unique among building societies during the period in question.</P>

We are not acceding to the change proposed <Col N="315" /> by the Deputy because we are concerned that it would reduce competition in the mortgage market and would not be in the best interests of mortgage holders or the housing market in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I mentioned to Deputy McCreevy and his colleague, Deputy Cullen, that I was prepared to revisit a couple of issues about which there was some dissension. Amendments were not subsequently tabled by the Opposition which would have allowed the debate to be opened up on Report Stage.  I will refer to those points because I said I would come back to them, and I do not want to appear disingenuous to those who do not understand procedure in the House by not referring to them when I said on Committee Stage that I would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Cullen raised the question of the role of the Central Bank as regulator and player in payment systems in the State as provided for in Part II of the Bill.  This is a reference to section 15.  I appreciate the Deputy's concerns in some areas.  He rightly pointed to the regulation of health insurance.  I reiterate, however, that the purpose is to ensure the stability of the markets by reducing systemic risk in the processing and settlement of payments and obligations between financial institutions.  The Central Bank is the central counterparty in the current payments system, in that the clearing institutions all hold accounts with it.  Also the bank issues liquidity into the market through the system.  It is obvious, therefore, the bank must be <Col N="316" /> a member of the system.  The question is whether the Central Bank should also regulate the system. The simple answer is yes.  Taking into account the bank's role as supervisor of the markets and the banks statutory function to ensure the stability of the market and the currency, there is no other alternative.  I would emphasise that the Competition Authority and the European Commission have already certified the proposed structure of the new system as not being anti-competitive. That was the basis of Deputy Cullen's concerns. Both institutions will retain the authority to examine any payment system in the State from a competition point of view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen inquired on Committee Stage whether the provisions of section 20 dealing with electronic settlement of accounts are covered by the Data Protection Act.  Following consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, I can confirm that they are.</P>
    <P>Much concern was expressed on Committee Stage about the provision in section 50 relating to crossed cheques.  I undertook to revert to the House on Report Stage on whether it would be possible to tighten up the provisions in the Bill which confer legal status on crossed cheques. Deputies will recall the reasoning behind this provision is that such cheques should only be valid between the payer and the payee and should not be available for the use of an intermediary without the consent of the payee.  While I have previously advised the House of the assurance received from the Attorney General that the provision does not impose any legal impediment to payees who do not hold bank accounts cashing such cheques in banks, some Deputies have asserted that the banks will still use the provision as a smokescreen and will refuse to cash them.  In this context it should be noted that the opening of cheque encashment shops &mdash; there is one in Dame Street now &mdash; might indicate that banks are already becoming more reluctant about this sort of business.</P>
    <P>I have consulted the Attorney General concerning production of the text of an amendment which would provide for the avoidance of doubt that a payee would not be required to hold an account for the purposes of encashment of a crossed cheque, even in instances where that cheque has been endorsed by the originally named payee to another.  The Attorney General has responded by advising that such provision would serve no useful legal purpose in that it would not add to what is already the legal position regarding crossed cheques and may, indeed, have unintended consequences.  He has reiterated his advice that there is nothing in the current provision which would prevent a bank cashing a crossed cheque across the counter.  It is very important that we state this clearly today.  It would be a retrograde step if banks were to use this legislation as a cover to refuse to cash crossed cheques from people who do not have accounts. That is not implied by this Bill.  There is no change in this Bill which changes the right of <Col N="317" /> people to have their cheques cashed, and I would urge banks and credit institutions not to pretend this legislation changes anything in relation to cashing crossed cheques.  This legislation, once enacted, will not interfere with the position of banks cashing crossed cheques for people who do not have accounts with them.  I would not like to see the banks or the credit institutions using this legislation in any untoward way, because there is no provision in this legislation that changes the present position.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies McCreevy, Cullen and other speakers who have taken the time to debate this important legislation.  Although we have not agreed on all matters, we do not disagree vehemently on how matters should be dealt with. There will be another time and another place, and other legislation to further debates that commenced here today.  I thank my officials in the Department of Finance for their forbearance and particularly for the amount of work they did between Committee and Report Stages in tick tacking with the industry, with banks, the Incorporated Law Society and the other institutions involved in technical financial legislation such as the Bill we have before us today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was I who made an issue of the question of crossed cheques both on Second Stage and on Committee Stage.  I believe the banks will make an issue of this in years to come and will go very much the way they have gone in the United Kingdom.  Agencies will set up &mdash; in the UK they charge a minimum of 4 per cent for cashing a crossed cheque, and that is what will happen here.  I did not think there was any need for the section in the first place.  Given what the Attorney General has now said about the proposed amendment &mdash; and I can see his reasons for so saying &mdash; it would have been simpler to have deleted the section in question because, as was pointed out by the Minister, the section was only included as a result of representations made by members of the Insurance Federation to get over their problem.  There are many other ways of solving their problem.  That matter may have to be revisited.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Department of Finance that a new explanatory memorandum be issued when the Bill has passed through the Seanad.  Some Departments are now going to the trouble of issuing new explanatory memorandums, and I commend that strategy.  I recommend it for the simple reason that this Bill began with about 70 sections and has finished up with 87 sections.</P>

      <P>I am not being critical, but I remember receiving an updated explanatory memorandum after a Bill had passed through both Houses.  It may even have been the Department of Finance who issued it.  It is a practice that could be taken on board by all Government <Col N="318" /> Departments because it would be easier for practitioners to refer to the explanatory memorandum if it corresponded with the Bill than to refer to the Bill itself.  However, the explanatory memorandum is usually published when the Bill is initiated and another is not issued despite the fact that the Bill undergoes a variety of changes during its passage through both Houses.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for a range of measures to assist local authorities in addressing problems arising on their housing estates from drug dealing and related serious anti-social behaviour.  The Bill forms part of a wider range of measures which are being taken by the Government to deal with the issue of drugs and related crime.  This Government is the first to seriously address the drugs problem.  We recognise that the illegal drugs trade is damaging and destroying many young lives.  Vast quantities of money are being made at the cost of the future of young men and women.  Even babies suffer and die as a consequence of this scourge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our approach is multifaceted.  Changes in the law are exposing those who traffic in illegal drugs. The Criminal Assets Bureau is a newly established statutory body and a package of tough legislation is in place.  The ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs was established to address issues that create a <Col N="319" /> demand.  Its recommendations in areas of treatment, education and rehabilitation and estate improvements were accepted fully by the Government and £14 million was allocated to carry out a programme which is based in the communities that are most severely affected.</P>
    <P>To effectively tackle the drug problem we need to rebuild communities, improve their physical and social infrastructure and revitalise them economically. To succeed we need to create a new dynamic and trust between statutory agencies and local communities.</P>
    <P>I have stressed to the local authorities the importance of good estate management.  Tenant participation is part and parcel of estate management, as is the importance of an integrated approach which draws all interested bodies into the process.  Considerable progress is being made in this regard and will continue to be made.  This Bill must be seen as one element in a wider strategy which is aimed at building communities and making them safe from drugs.</P>
    <P>There is broad agreement in the House that the extent to which the residents of many local authority estates have suffered at the hands of drug dealers and those working with and for them is unacceptable.  There is also broad support for the main purpose of the Bill which is to provide local authorities with improved legal powers to help them deal with drug dealing and serious anti-social behaviour in their estates.  The Bill will assist local authorities to discharge their estate management function in a positive manner so that all local authority tenants may reasonably aspire to living in an estate that is free from drug dealing and associated violence.</P>
    <P>Before I elaborate on the specific measures in the Bill I want to outline briefly some of the background and context within which these proposals have been prepared.  On 4 July last, the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs considered the issue of local housing estate management. At that time, I indicated that existing legislative provisions, drawn up when the problem of anti-social behaviour was much less serious, were no longer adequate to address the significant difficulties, often drug related, that local authorities now face.  I told the committee that I had been examining possible changes in housing legislation and that I hoped to announce specific measures urgently.  Subsequently, on 9 July, the Government announced a broad-ranging package of measures to respond to the wider problem of drug dealing and related serious crime.  The measures in this Bill formed part of the Government's package.</P>
    <P>Why is this legislation needed?  The following quotations from a report made in June 1996 to Dublin Corporation's housing committee may help answer that question:</P>
    <P>...the victims of anti-social behaviour (including drugs related activities) and their families endure enormous distress and are <Col N="320" /> unable to enjoy peaceful occupation of their dwellings...</P>
    <P>...anti-social behaviour reinforces the spiral of decline in certain difficult estates...</P>
    <P>...continued toleration of drug related activity on estates and in flat complexes places tenants and their children at risk of involvement in the drugs scene and imposes an unreasonable burden on tenants and residents ...</P>
    <P>...the perception that effective action is not being taken has encouraged the perpetrators, demoralised the victims and, thereby, exacerbated the problem.</P>
    <P>These are not extracts from a treatise on social breakdown in the future but relate to the situation as it is now and has been in recent years in certain Dublin Corporation housing estates.</P>
    <P>We are well aware of the serious threat drug dealing poses to individuals and to society.  In areas where drug dealing gets a foothold everyone is a potential victim.  There is reason to believe many major heroin dealers began their evil careers in local authority housing estates and that much of their nefarious activities are centred there.  We must make it clear that the Government and the statutory agencies will no longer tolerate publicly funded housing being used as a base for drug pushing and related anti-social activity.  We must ensure that a new generation of barons do not have local authority housing as a nursery in which to develop their ugly trade.  We must also ensure that those who are enriching themselves by bringing misery, distress and violence to their neighbours can no longer be allowed to undermine and destroy their communities.  We have a duty as legislators to see to it that communities are not denied protection as a result of deficiencies or constraints in the law.</P>
    <P>Constraints and deficiencies have been identified through practical experience.  Regrettably, the existing statutory response has been seen as ineffectual in the face of an increasing drug problem and, in recent times, some communities have sought to impose their own remedies.  Particular areas of concern include the unsuitability of existing approaches in certain instances, for example, where the existing sanction of eviction may be too blunt and sweeping an instrument; no effective immediate action against squatting by persons engaged in anti-social activities; difficulties with the exchange of information between relevant authorities; slow procedures such as delays in the service of summons and intimidation and risks to witnesses.  The Bill seeks to rectify these deficiencies through a combination of increased powers, targeted measures and more streamlined and effective procedures.</P>
    <P>In preparing this legislation I have taken into account the experience of local authorities in their attempts to deal with anti-social behaviour on their estates.  I met the elected members of Dublin Corporation who represent the worst <Col N="321" /> affected areas and they were emphatic about the need for urgent and effective measures.  I or my officials have also met representatives of other interests, including the voluntary housing sector. I have had the benefit of widely divergent views ranging from unfounded fears about the possible impact of the Bill to a concern that the measures in the Bill do not go far enough.</P>
    <P>The definitions of &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo; and &ldquo;estate management&rdquo; in section 1 are of particular significance and are central to the purposes of the Bill.  They form the basis for the application of various powers under the Bill, including exclusion orders, vetting of tenancy applications and for social welfare assistance.  I have made every effort to frame these definitions as tightly as possible. &ldquo;Anti-social behaviour&rdquo; has been carefully defined with particular reference to drug pushing and related serious violence or threats of violence to individuals.  Possession of illegal drugs solely for personal use does not come within this definition, nor does vandalism or damage to property unless the damage was being used to intimidate or threaten.  There are two elements to the definition and these are essential because the measures in the Bill are designed to deal with anti-social behaviour related to drug dealing and the serious violence associated with it, both of which are offences under the criminal code.  The activities included in the definition are very serious in nature &mdash; matters such as nuisance or noise are not included &mdash; and their effect must be to cause &ldquo;significant or persistent&rdquo; danger, injury, damage, etc.  to persons rather than to property.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;estate management&rdquo; is defined as including the securing or promotion of the interests of tenants and other occupiers, whether individually or generally, in the enjoyment of the local authority houses they occupy and the avoidance, prevention or abatement of anti-social behaviour in that context.  The term &ldquo;good estate management&rdquo; is a long standing concept in common law and in the landlord and tenant code but has not been defined in statute.  The concept is being given specific statutory recognition in this Bill in a very positive way so that housing authorities can actively promote the interests of their tenants and work towards the avoidance, prevention or abatement of anti-social behaviour.  The concept of good estate management is currently used by housing authorities as a reason for seeking repossession of dwellings where anti-social type behaviour is involved.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with an important aspect of legal procedures, delays and difficulties in the serving of summonses in housing cases.  This section provides that, where it has not been possible to serve a summons by registered post, it may be served by ordinary post without the delay of having to go back to the courts for specific permission to do this, as is the case at present.  This section also provides for summonses to be issued by a District Court clerk instead of having to be signed by a judge &mdash; a procedure that already applies in criminal cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> The single most important measure in this Bill is probably the introduction of a new &ldquo;excluding order&rdquo; procedure.  The relevant provisions are contained in sections 2 to 12.  A local authority tenant will have a right to apply to the District Court for an excluding order against a member of his or her household who is engaged in anti-social behaviour.  A housing authority will have power to seek an excluding order where it believes the tenant would be intimidated in doing so.  Excluding order proceedings can only be taken by housing authorities after consultation with the tenant and the local health board.</P>
    <P>The excluding order procedure will allow a more targeted response than is currently available to local authorities.  Up to now, the only action a local authority could take in cases of serious anti-social behaviour was to seek to have the entire household evicted with, as it were, both the innocent and the guilty subject to the same legal sanction.  The new procedure is intended to meet a situation where only one or some of the members of a household are engaged in serious anti-social behaviour.  It also recognises the reality that there are instances where not only does the tenant not have effective control or influence over an individual in the household but the tenant and the rest of the household may be intimidated by that individual.  Hence the provision for local authority intervention where a tenant is too fearful to take proceedings.</P>
    <P>Under section 3, the court will have power to exclude a person engaged in anti-social behaviour from any specified house or housing estate and to prohibit intimidation or other interference with a tenant or other occupant of the house.  Under section 4, the court may make interim excluding orders where there is immediate risk of significant harm to a tenant or other occupant.  The court will also be empowered to hear excluding order cases <i>in camera</i>.  There are a number of important safeguards such as provision for appeal and for variation and discharge of orders where appropriate.  This new procedure will make a major contribution to the fight against anti-social behaviour in local authority housing, by providing a means to target the perpetrators, to protect the victims and to leave the innocent in their homes.</P>
    <P>Under section 13, local authorities will be empowered, on grounds of anti-social behaviour, to refuse to let a dwelling or to sell a dwelling to a tenant under a purchase scheme.  Consent to the resale of tenant purchase dwellings may also be refused on these grounds.  This will provide valuable legal backing to the efforts of housing authorities to prevent known drug dealers from moving into their estates.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for exchange of information between relevant agencies &mdash; housing authorities, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Social Welfare, health boards and voluntary housing bodies. This provision is designed to overcome difficulties created by different statutory agencies acting blindly and without access to relevant information <Col N="323" /> which is available to another statutory agency.  It is incomprehensible to residents that one State agency would be aware that an individual was a drug dealer, yet another agency would be totally unaware of the fact.  The exchange of information in this area is essential for the operation of various measures under the Bill, such as the excluding order procedure, vetting of applicants for housing, tenant purchase or for supplementary welfare assistance towards rents of private accommodation.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides discretion for health boards to refuse or withdraw SWA rent or mortgage interest supplementation for private housing in the case of persons evicted, excluded or removed from, or refused local authority housing on grounds of anti-social behaviour.  Health boards must have regard to any information provided to them in relation to such persons by housing authorities or other specified bodies.  There has been severe criticism that, on occasion, drug pushers evicted from local authority housing, with the help of SWA rent allowance from the health board, have been rehoused in private accommodation in the same area and from which they have continued their illicit activities.  Health boards argue they simply had no option but to provide SWA rent assistance in these cases.  However, in future, the health boards will not be obliged to fund private accommodation in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 16 amends the Social Welfare Acts to allow, in certain circumstances, for deduction of local authority rents at source from social welfare incomes.  This will allow for timely pro-active intervention when rent arrears are building up. There will be power for the Minister for Social Welfare after consultation with the Minister for the Environment to make regulations providing for mandatory deduction of local authority rents from social welfare payments where rent is unpaid for a certain period or arrears exceed a certain level.  This is an important and practical measure to minimise the need for eviction proceedings to obtain payment of rents and will greatly reduce the need for local authorities to have to threaten or go to court for repossession in rent arrears cases.</P>
    <P>Section 17 prohibits intimidation of, or other interference with, staff of a housing authority or a health board or members of their family, or intimidation of witnesses in proceedings under this Bill or in eviction proceedings.  This is an important provision designed to address the sort of real difficulties which have been encountered by local authorities and tenants.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is in the nature of a back-up to the repossession powers of housing authorities.  It provides that any payment made to a housing authority by a squatter or a former tenant who has been given notice to quit but still remains in occupation of a local authority dwelling, will not create any tenancy rights in the dwelling.  This is to remove a possible loophole whereby such persons <Col N="324" /> might claim rights on the basis of such payments.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides a new power for the Garda, on notification by the housing authority, to direct people squatting in local authority accommodation and engaged in anti-social activity to leave the accommodation.  Non-compliance will be an offence and the Garda will have powers of search and arrest without warrant.  This is separate from, and does not affect, the due process of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; repossession procedures under section 62 of the Housing Act, 1966, which are excessively lengthy to deal effectively with squatting where drug dealing is involved.  Existing legal powers have been found ineffective against recurrent squatting which is associated with drug distribution, drug parties and, in some instances, serious intimidation of new tenants.  The new powers are designed to provide a direct and effective means of addressing this serious problem.  The new powers do not apply to &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; squatting cases where no anti-social behaviour is involved.</P>
    <P>Section 20 is designed to help address the question of obtaining evidence of anti-social behaviour where witnesses are in fear of serious injury or worse.  It provides for acceptance by courts of statements by the Garda, housing authority or health board officials as evidence of anti-social behaviour in proceedings for repossessions or excluding orders where the court is satisfied there are reasonable grounds for this and that other possible witnesses would be prevented from giving evidence through intimidation.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is unrelated to the other provisions. It is a technical amendment to put beyond doubt that a housing authority's general power under section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, to repossess, in the event of default on a loan, applies to certain loans made prior to 1986 under section 5(2) of the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>Section 22 contains a minor amendment of section 3 of the Housing Act, 1966, to provide that documents such as notices and orders under the housing Acts may be served by ordinary post where a registered letter is returned undelivered. The measures being provided for will apply only in serious circumstances and will be used sparingly but where necessary.  Local authorities are in the business of housing persons in need, not evicting them except where there is no other course open to them.  Indeed, local authorities are often severely criticised for the length of time it takes them to act against even the most blatant and serious cases of anti-social behaviour.  It is simply scaremongering to suggest that local authorities will use their powers in a cavalier manner.</P>
    <P>The Bill is only one part of a broad ranging overall response by Government to the problem of drugs and anti-social behaviour.  That broader response involves measures to tackle both the supply and demand aspects of drug abuse.  The Government has put in place a package of measures to tackle the supply side &mdash; drug dealing and the serious criminal activity that it spawns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> Equally significant are initiatives to reduce the demand for drugs.  These are being pursued in the context of a special ministerial task force and new structures that have been established at national and local level to ensure an effective response to drug abuse.</P>
    <P>The task force, of which I am a member, put forward a comprehensive, co-ordinated package of measures comprising treatment, rehabilitation and prevention.  The Government approved our recommendations and allocated £14 million for their implementation.  These recommendations included a new local authority estate improvement programme which will improve the physical fabric and environment of local authority housing estates and flat complexes.  The Government has approved an overall allocation of £3 million for this programme for 1997-8, £1.5 million of which has been allocated for this year.  The programme will focus on aspects of estate design and layout that are conducive to anti-social behaviour and seek to enhance the living environment and ensure better estate management.  I have already given approval in principle to proposals for a programme of priority works by Dublin Corporation for which I will provide a grant of £1.25 million. I have also approved a grant of £500,000 to Fingal County Council and a grant of £750,000 to South Dublin County Council.  These grants cover 1997 and 1998 and will be matched in each case by the authorities from their own resources.  I envisage the allocation of further grants to Cork and Limerick Corporations.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the Bill is not the total response of the Government or the local authorities to drug dealing and anti-social behaviour in local authority housing estates.  Since taking office as Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, one of my main objectives has been to encourage and assist local authorities to improve their overall estate management, not only in terms of dealing with problems but also in terms of raising standards and involving tenants positively in the management of their housing estates.  To support local authorities in this respect, I have introduced a number of initiatives including a housing management grants scheme and the setting up of a housing management group to promote best practice in housing management.  Authorities are also being assisted to undertake a programme of training and development for their tenants.</P>
    <P>The housing management group has prepared best practice guidelines on housing management and workshops are currently being held for local authority officials.  The guidelines are aimed at promoting new approaches to the delivery of housing services which place the emphasis on service quality and customer satisfaction.  This is very much in line with the thrust of the recent policy document on the future of local government, A Programme for Change.</P>
    <P>I am glad some local authorities have already put in place arrangements to work with representative tenant groups in the management of their <Col N="326" /> estates.  This involves the local authority and the tenants in a two way process of sharing information and ideas and enables tenants to deal with their local authority in a co-operative rather than a confrontational way.  Tenants can thus influence decisions affecting them and their estates and bring their skills and knowledge to bear on these decisions.</P>
    <P>Improving communication between the local authority and the tenants is a priority if housing management is to be made more responsive to needs.  One means of achieving this objective is through publication of a tenant's handbook which sets out information on the services provided by the authority and the respective responsibilities of the authority and the tenants.  A number of local authorities have produced or are in the process of producing tenant handbooks.  This is a welcome initiative and one which has been assisted by financial contributions from my Department.</P>
    <P>I regard improved housing estate management as a crucial step forward which will pay substantial dividends not only as fire brigade action now but, more importantly, in helping to prevent the same scale of problems emerging in the future. Local authorities deserve credit for the extent to which they have developed their estate management role over the past two years.</P>
    <P>I have tried to give a reasonably full account of the Bill and its background.  It is only part of our response to a very serious, complex and multilayered issue but it is an important and positive part of that response.  The one message I want to convey above all is that the chief purpose and <i>raison d'être</i> of the Bill is to serve and protect the well-being of communities in local authority estates and to help ensure that their daily lives can be free from the oppression, abuse and fear that stems from drug dealing and the anti-social behaviour that goes with it.  The Bill will have a strong deterrent effect and will prevent some from embarking on the type of behaviour which would be damaging to their community and, ultimately, result in their being forced out of that community.  I am pleased to commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to strong support for it and the objectives it seeks to attain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Chairman.  We do not know if the Bill has been properly thought out or whether it provides for the necessary corrective action without going overboard.</P>
      <P>The many individuals and groups who have an interest in the legislation range from hard pressed residents and community groups who are trying to do their best in difficult circumstances in housing estates and flat complexes to local authority and statutory agencies, the owners of private rented dwellings, the various voluntary agencies dealing with the homeless which will obviously have to deal with the problem if the legislation is successful and various groups dealing with civil liberties etc. who are concerned about how the legislation will be operated in the future.  The legislation could be regarded as watering down the current eviction system on the one hand, or very wide ranging, on the other.  Some civil liberties groups are concerned that an individual could be deprived of the right to shelter without proper recourse to an appeals system.</P>
      <P>Whatever about the future, we can make definite statements about the past.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill and the recognition that we have a problem in our housing estates.  To some extent the Minister of State has been slow to recognise it.  During Question Time on 13 June 1996 the Minister of State said adequate legal powers were currently available to the authorities to take action where there was a breach of the letting agreement.  She went on to say anti-social behaviour in housing estates, including drug related issues and incidents of this nature, were primarily a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Many people have been slow to deal with this problem.  If the Minister of State tried to introduce this legislation ten years ago, I am sure people who share her political viewpoint would have been up in arms but they are wiser than they were then.  The Minister of State's position has changed since June after the sad murder of Veronica Guerin and her meeting with the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must recognise that we are introducing legislation that acknowledges the failure of the Garda to deal with the problem of drug dealing <Col N="328" /> and anti-social behaviour.  This Bill ignores the central role of the Garda as the principal force responsible for ensuring the right to a drug free environment.  Local authorities have traditionally enforced various regulations but it is arguable if they should be involved in studying social behaviour. There are differing views on that.</P>
    <P>We have to reflect on what we have allowed to happen in recent years in large housing estates.  I am not making excuses for anti-social behaviour. Poverty existed for decades, yet people respected their neighbours and the elderly.  However, bad planning resulted in the construction of large housing estates without the necessary infrastructure, such as pubs, shops and recreational facilities. This is despite the existence since the 1930s of housing estates which matured into respectable middle class estates and did not degenerate in the way newer estates have.  Building is not the entire problem.  In some of these estates the law of the jungle rules and people have retreated into their homes hoping not to be noticed or appear different so as to avoid drawing attention to themselves or their families.  Residents fear that if they are noticed by offenders they will be seen as being different or weak because they have a job or have hopes for their children.  If they maintain some standard of decency or respect for the law or sense of community they will be targeted and their lives will be made a misery.</P>
    <P>This may not be the time to analyse what went wrong or why certain areas have become socially excluded but, depending on our beliefs and backgrounds we would probably put forward several reasons.  These include a lack of basic employment; the lack of an adult male in the household structure; a lack of discipline and a lack of hope being offered to young people.  We have tried various ideas to deal with these problems.  In the mid-1980s the £5,000 grant scheme was a godsend to many families, enabling them to purchase private houses and vacate local authority dwellings, but it created other difficulties.  It helped to remove many employed people from estates, turning them into wastelands with only those on social welfare living on them.</P>
    <P>There are vibrant community activists in some of these areas who are trying to pick up the pieces.  They must be helped and resources have to be provided for them.  Some people are very fond of blaming local authorities.  We went through a spell in the late 1980s when a financial squeeze was put on local authorities.  Money has never been ploughed back into them, even with a booming economy over recent years under different Governments.  Other Departments and other budget headings have had resources allocated to them but local authorities have not received the money they once had.  We must work with these communities and involve not just voluntary community activists.  They should be employed either in full time jobs or in many of the job creation schemes available, such as community employment schemes, CORI proposals, jobs initiative or any offshoot of them.  We must give hope and <Col N="329" /> employment where there is none.  We must take firm action and implement the proposals in this legislation against the worst offenders where they seem uninterested in conforming to the norms of the community.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been slow to take action under existing legislation and that has in some cases been assisted by &ldquo;do-gooders&rdquo; and, until recently, left wing politicians.  Ten years ago when one talked about trying to evict a family it was often the left wing members of the city council who objected, but that has changed drastically.  I accept that over the last five years times have changed and local authority officials, following the combined urgings of local representatives, have taken a firmer line and have commenced a process for legal evictions.  They have brought about some evictions to date but unfortunately progress has been slow and the huge delays in processing cases through the courts is a big problem. These delays are most frustrating for local authority officials and for good tenants interested in improving the quality of life in their community.</P>
    <P>This seemed to have been accepted by the Department.  The first point made in last July's press release announcing this legislation was that consultations would be held with the President of the District Court to have amendments made to the District Court rules and to put in a request for separate District Court sittings to speed up procedures.  What progress has been made with the President of the District Court?  Currently, it takes a local authority four or five months to get an order from the District Court and it takes as long again if it is appealed to the Circuit Court. A week is a lifetime if one lives close to a tenant who engages in anti-social behaviour.  We cannot expect decent tenants to put up with this behaviour for months on end waiting for an order to be processed through the legal system.  We must be seen to be speedy and, while I welcome the section dealing with squatters, we must be more urgent in our action in these cases.</P>
    <P>There is a growing drug problem, mainly located in a number of local authority flat complexes and housing estates in the greater Dublin area.  This legislation is designed to deal with that problem and the anti-social behaviour emanating from it.  Provision of treatment centres for addicts and greater Garda enforcement etc. have to be the main planks of Government policy but this Bill deals with estate management and trying to rid estates of anti-social behaviour.  More recently, local authorities have tried to grapple with the problem in a concerted way by working with people living in harassed communities.</P>
    <P>It is only in more recent times that the idea of estate management has been taken seriously. People now have a better understanding of what it means but in the past some thought it meant cutting the grass.  Some community activists saw it merely as a way of taking over control of the budget from the local authorities.  That may happen but we all must become involved in a community <Col N="330" /> partnership made up of public representatives, local authorities and community activists.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made recently on this issue and the local authority with which I am most familiar, Dublin Corporation, has achieved a great deal in this regard.  The plans it is putting in place have enormous potential and more officials are dealing with the complaints of local communities. In the past the perception was that these officials were far removed from the problems experienced by communities, and they had nothing to do but sit in their plush offices.</P>
    <P>On the £3 million allocated to the programme recommended by the ministerial task force for dealing with the drugs problem, I hope that allocation will be increased because the task force report stated that eight of the 11 areas experiencing the worst drug problems were in the Dublin Corporation area.  Public representatives and officials in the corporation wanted to get their hands on that £3 million and were sorely disappointed at the way it was distributed; the majority was spent on flat complexes.  Districts such as Ballymun and certain housing estates will not benefit because that money is being spent in the inner city.</P>

Some people might be of the view that the Minister of State hoodwinked the Minister while he was distracted by the group water scheme controversy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister had a difficult job but there was concern at Dublin Corporation level that some areas did not get their fair share of the money.  If the Minister increased the funding to £30 million, local authorities would come forward with worthwhile suggestions to address the overall problem.</P>
      <P>This new legislation will allow us issue excluding orders to the worst offenders and thereby rid our housing estates and blocks of flats of people involved in anti-social behaviour.  I hope it will be passed, but has the legislation been thought out? I agree threats may frighten these people into behaving but they should not be issued if we cannot carry them out.  If the legislation is passed and people are evicted from estates, what will we do with them?  Is it right for any public authority to implement a measure without considering its knock-on effects?  If a local authority cannot handle a problem in its estates or blocks of flats, how do we expect the statutory and voluntary agencies caring for the homeless to deal with it? Homeless people currently go to the statutory agencies and voluntary bodies who accommodate them in bed and breakfast accommodation or hostels, but if rent allowances are withdrawn, the bed and breakfast option would no longer be available.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware of the resources provided for the unit for the homeless in Dublin; the numbers attending the unit recently increased.  Can the existing system deal with an influx of people evicted from estates or blocks of flats?  I understand various voluntary and statutory groups working in this area are concerned about the implications of this legislation on homelessness and services for homeless people.  As the providers of services for the homeless, some of these agencies are concerned that this legislation will merely shift the problem on to their doorstep and that they are not prepared for the scale on which that might happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, traditional means of accommodation for the homeless, mainly hostels and night shelters, have been developed and given more funding to meet the needs of the homeless.  Some hostels have been transformed to provide improved personal accommodation and modern communal facilities.  New types of housing projects have also been built.  The transformation of older hostels, however, is leading to two somewhat different types of services being offered. The services currently available to the long-term homeless would not be suitable for people evicted from local authority housing.  Presumably people <Col N="332" /> who have been evicted will be sent to short-term hostels or night shelters.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that when replying because we may be solving one problem but creating another.  Has she considered the ramifications?  Where will these people live when they are evicted?</P>
    <P>While I am pleased that health boards have been given the power to refuse or withdraw rent allowances from persons evicted, excluded or removed from local authority housing because of anti-social behaviour, the owners of private rented accommodation want to be included under this provision.  They do not want the legislation to cover one sector of social housing and not another.  The private rented sector forms part of the social housing programme.  Owners of private rented accommodation argue that it is not enough to say a person who has been evicted or excluded will not get rent subsidy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision to withdraw rent subsidy from those evicted from local authority housing. It is unacceptable that a person evicted from a local authority house could rent a house for £100 or more per week and get a rent allowance from another authority.  I will table amendments to this section on Committee Stage to ensure that the private rented sector is included.</P>
    <P>Civil liberty and legal groups have expressed concern about certain aspects of the legislation. It has been suggested in the media that the new law is contrary to Article 40 of the Constitution in that it gives local authorities the power to deprive people of the right to public housing and financial support.  It has been argued that it is unacceptable to deprive people of a home and shelter in circumstances where the facts grounding the decision cannot be tested or verified.  This measure contrasts with many other aspects of life where independent appeal mechanisms have been set up to adjudicate on official decisions.  It has been argued that, in seeking evictions for anti-social behaviour, housing authorities assess a person's alleged misbehaviour on the basis of secretive, primarily hearsay and untested, evidence and that the persons affected are not afforded the rights conferred by the principles of natural justice.  These groups have expressed many concerns, some of which I may not share.  I am merely articulating their concerns.</P>

      <P>Many different viewpoints must be considered under this legislation.</P>
      <P>While we are united in trying to solve the problems in this area, when putting legislation on the Statute Book we must ensure it incorporates certain principles.  I will table a number of amendments in this regard on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the legislation should extend to tenant purchasers.  While it may not be possible to apply them to existing tenant purchasers, surely we can include a clause covering new tenant purchasers.  A tenant excluded from his or her house under an exclusion order can pretend to live with a neighbour who may be a tenant purchaser. Most serious problems in local authority housing involve people living in tenant purchased houses.  Will the Minister of State extend this provision to tenant purchasers?</P>
      <P>Who will enforce exclusion orders?  Who will report a person for returning to his or her house? I am also concerned about the age of a person who can be excluded under the legislation.  Is it possible to exclude 14 or 15 year old gurriers under an exclusion order?  Many of them cause mayhem in estates and believe they are immune from the law.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the section that deals with information exchange, it must also be amended. It is appalling that up to now State agencies have not been able to exchange information.  Local authorities have had difficulty getting information from members of the Garda, some of whom are helpful although others quote the Data Protection Act.  This section should be extended so that landlords can obtain information.</P>

      <P>The labour force survey provides annual information on employment and unemployment in each region.  The results of the survey relate to the position in April.  The number of people at work in the Border region, which comprises the six Border counties, was 127,200 in April 1994.  The corresponding figure for April 1995 was 132,900 and for April 1996, 131,700.  This represents a net increase of 4,500 in the number of people at work in the Border counties between April 1994 and April 1996.</P>

      <P>That is a separate question.  I am addressing the number of people at work, which presumably is based on the number of jobs created.  In 1991 there were 121,500 people at work in the region; 1992, 124,000; 1993, 124,000; 1994, 127,000; 1995, 132,000 and 1996, 131,700. The net increase in the number of people at work in the Border counties between 1991 and 1996 was 10,000.  I understand that the intention was to ask how many people were unemployed, and the answer to that question is, 1991, 26,100; 1992, 26,000; 1993, 26,500; 1994, 24,600; 1995, 20,500 and 1996, 25,500.</P>

      <P>I do not have that information, but I gave the reply to the specific question asked in regard to the six Border counties.  The Minister set up a task force which reported and made recommendations.  That report, which was the driving force behind the economic resurgence in the Border region, resulted in the implementation of a co-ordinated policy, one stop shops and so on.  If one looks at the recent performance in Border counties, there has been a considerable improvement in the general economic position. Considering the number of planning permissions and applications in a whole range of economic activities, the Border counties are experiencing an economic renaissance and resurgence which was not evident ten years ago.</P>
      <P>With the introduction of a quarterly labour force survey, as from the middle of this year we will be in a position to monitor the figures on a regular basis.  From the point of view of the objective definition of unemployment, the labour force survey is recognised as the most accurate gauge of the number of people at work and the number unemployed.</P>

Will he accept that the reason the number of jobs decreased in the past two years and the number unemployed increased by 5,000 during 1995 and 1996 is that that is the only driving force?  Will he accept that, despite the fact that the Border region has been targeted by the IFI, US funds and peace and reconciliation moneys, little has been achieved because there is a fundamental flaw in Government policy?</P>

The survey is carried out on a range of 45,000 houses on a regional basis.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the Border counties have gained from the rising tide of economic performance, good public finances, low inflation and monetary stability which has been reflected across the spectrum of economic activity.

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>This initiative arises from a recommendation in the first report of the Ministerial Task Force on Measures to Reduce the Demand for Drugs.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government established this task force last July to review the existing arrangements for a co-ordinated response to drugs demand reduction and, in the light of that review, to identify for governmental action any changes or additional measures needed to provide a more effective response.  The task force produced its first report last October, copies of which were laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report concentrated primarily on identifying the areas where the drugs problem, particularly opiate abuse, is most acute and preparing appropriate recommendations to deal with the problem in these areas.  Arising from one of the recommendations in the report, local drugs task forces are being established in 12 areas in Dublin and in north Cork city.  These task forces, comprising representatives of the statutory, voluntary and community sectors, will pull together the <Col N="338" /> resources that are already available in these sectors to produce a more focused response to the drugs issue, in terms of treatment, rehabilitation and prevention.</P>
    <P>The Government has allocated £10 million to support the implementation of development plans, which are being prepared by the task forces to build on existing programmes and services available in the priority areas.</P>
    <P>As I already mentioned, the task forces will comprise representatives of the statutory, voluntary and community agencies.  This partnership between agencies such as the Garda, the health board, the housing authority and local voluntary and community groups, which have been combating the problem for many years, is an important development.  The sheer scale of the problem in some communities has led to a feeling of abandonment by the institutions of the State and wider society.  Through their participation in the task forces, local communities can now contribute in a focused and tangible way towards tackling the drugs scourge in their areas.  Understandably, the bringing on board of community groups and organisations involved a wide consultative process which is now almost completed and the vast majority of the task forces have commenced the work of preparing service development plans for their areas.</P>
    <P>In endorsing the recommendations in the first report of the ministerial task force, the Government also set aside £3 million to implement an estate improvement programme, to assist local authorities in tackling the problem of severely run-down housing estates and flat complexes. This scheme is being administered by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, and already proposals from a number of local authorities have been approved.</P>
    <P>The ministerial task force is currently preparing its second report, dealing with issues which were not addressed in the earlier report.  These include the misuse of non-opiates, such as cannabis and ecstasy, which is a nation-wide phenomenon.  Recognising that the use of these so-called soft drugs could in time lead to the development of a serious opiates problem outside the current priority areas, the Government, in approving the first report, allocated additional funding of £1 million in 1997 to assist relevant health boards in preparing anti-drugs strategies outside the areas I mentioned.</P>
    <P>In its second report, the ministerial task force will look at the treatment services available to prisoners who misuse drugs and the development of alternatives to prison as a way of dealing with such misusers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that early last year I tried to get him and his colleagues to set up such a committee, so I am glad the Cabinet subcommittee has now been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> How much of the £10 million is additional funding or how much is taken from existing subheads?  Perhaps he could also tell me how much of the £3 million will be used to tackle the problem of run-down local authority housing and flat complexes because there is confusion as to whether it is part of the existing allocation for such schemes?  Does the initiative have the confidence of the public and the local groups working in each of the 12 areas he mentioned?  Following publication of the first report of the ministerial task force the Minister of State remarked that difficulties were being experienced in setting up the task forces.  When I raised the matter on 28 January I said it was unfortunate that they were being distracted from the job they were being set up to do, to tackle the drugs problem, and that their time was being taken up with administrative wrangles.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that all the difficulties have been fully resolved?  What difficulties, if any, are being experienced with the local authorities and the Garda Síochaná?  As the Minister of State is aware, the perception put forward in the ministerial task force report is not shared by the communities concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the wrangling among the agencies involved and the difficulties experienced in putting the task forces in place.  One of the purposes in putting the new structure in place is to ensure optimum co-ordination rather than competition between the agencies involved, as happened in the past.  There has been no wrangling among them in putting the new structure in place.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to my remarks about the timelag between publication of the report on 11 October and putting the task forces in place. A major debate has taken place in each of the affected areas on who should be nominated to represent the community and how they should be selected.  I was critical of the delay at the time but I am satisfied that the process was an immensely valuable one.</P>
      <P>Communities, which have felt alienated up to now, have been given an opportunity to participate. They have conducted a thorough and extensive debate.  There is a necessity for the agencies involved to continue to co-operate.  It would be unfair if my remarks and those of Deputy Ahern were seen to reflect on them.</P>
      <P>The moneys for improvements to estates and flat complexes are separate and distinct.  This is an acknowledgement that some of the estates most seriously affected manifest all the signs, with which the Deputy is familiar, of neglect and being run down.  The purpose of the allocation is to effect improvements within these estates which are experiencing difficulties provoked, for example, by activities such as joyriding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation can be put in context by looking at the figures allocated to the Eastern Health Board for this purpose.  In 1992 it was allocated a figure of £1 million.  Last year it was allocated £9 <Col N="340" /> million by the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan.  The purpose is to co-ordinate the activities of the health board and those of the local drug task forces.  There will, inevitably, be an overlap as they will address gaps in the treatment structure and consider questions such as prevention. Some schools are running courses with the assistance of community organisations to promote awareness of the dangers associated with opiate abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably, we will see the plans, when agreed.  If a sum of £10 million is allocated, this will work out at between £700,000 and £800,000 per task force.  Is the Minister of State happy that this funding will be properly targeted? As he is aware, we have been living with the drugs problem for many years in urban areas and, increasingly, in rural areas.  The problem is not the lack of resources; money has been poured into many of these areas by various agencies and bodies.  Rather, it is the failure to direct resources at the groups with which we might resolve the problem which continues to get worse.  What structure does the Minister of State hope to put in place to produce meaningful results?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Drug task forces have been set up in eight of the ten areas nominated in Dublin. For various reasons drug task forces have not yet been set up in Crumlin and Ballymun.  Their remit is to prepare a plan for the immediate community, be it a local treatment centre for drug abusers, a particular category of staff required to work in the community, recreational schemes and so on.  In this context, I hope they will think along the same lines as the Minister, the local authority, the health board and the Garda Síochána.  The plans will be submitted to the national drugs strategy team which will validate all applications and submit them to Cabinet for approval.</P>
      <P>The national drugs strategy team, uniquely, comprises senior civil servants in the Departments involved, representatives of the Garda Síochána, FÁS and the health board as well as the community nominees, who were selected by me.  They are Fr. Seán Cassin of the Merchant's Quay Project and Mr. Fergus McCabe of ICON.</P>
      <P>From meetings which Members of all parties have attended, there has been a visible lifting of morale and a positive response in the communities concerned which have felt neglected, particularly during the past four to five years as the problem continued to get worse.  They feel for the first time that they are involved and have access to the top.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister of State said, the establishment of the task forces and, in particular, the appointment of Mr. Fergus McCabe and Fr. Seán Cassin to the national drugs strategy team.  The Minister must surely be concerned that two of the task forces are not yet up and running.  Has the Minister set a timescale within which the funding which he has made available will get to these communities which are clearly in desperate need?  While there is a great deal of understanding as to the process of establishing the task forces, there is equally a great deal of frustration that the funding which was announced last October has not reached any of the communities concerned.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that £3 million for estate and environmental improvements in areas where there is massive social deprivation, including over 50 per cent unemployment in some areas in Dublin, is totally inadequate, although it is welcome? It will only scratch the surface.  In view of the slow progress to date since his report was announced, is it not unlikely that the target of providing treatment for every addict who seeks it by the end of 1997 will be reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I am disappointed that the task forces in Crumlin and Ballymun are not up and functioning like the others throughout Dublin.  I have learned the hard way that it is a little unwise to intrude into the reason that is the case but I am advised that in both cases the problems are likely to be sorted out over the next couple of weeks.  I sincerely hope that is the case because it is relevant in another matter in terms of one of the supplementary questions put by Deputy Bertie Ahern.  The moneys will not be spent on the basis of dividing the £10 million between the ten task forces but on the basis of the plans approved.  If some task forces take so long arguing interminably about who should represent the area, there may be no money by the time they submit plans.  That is another incentive to the two task forces concerned to put their houses in order.</P>
      <P>On the question of funding, of course I would like to see the money issued as speedily as possible. That is why it is available.  It also must be issued in a manner that will be productive.  It is not simply enough to write to the Minister and say &ldquo;I am in a drug-afflicted area so please send me a cheque&rdquo;.  We must issue the money on the basis of a coherent plan that will improve the lot of people who are addicted to opiates in the Dublin area and that must be thought out before the money is issued.  As soon as the plans are received by the national drugs team, I can assure the Deputy there will be no delay on the funding issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for the Minister for the Environment to comment on the question of the allocation of £3 million for estate improvements and I am not really competent to do so.  My recollection is that the subhead provides for £100,000 and <Col N="342" /> an additional £3 million is a significant injection. I entirely accept what Deputy Gregory says, that if one looks at the stages of neglect of some of these areas in his and my constituency, one will acknowledge that £3 million will not put the matter right.  However, a line of funding has been established and I hope more will be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>This is a national problem, lest the question, the Minister's reply and the supplementary questions would give the impression that this problem of drug abuse is only within these designated areas where task forces are to be appointed.  What exactly is being done, particularly in the area of prevention?  Members are conscious in our constituencies, towns and villages of the problem of drug abuse and the resultant loss of young lives.  The Minister has placed great emphasis on co-ordination between the various agencies.  He talked about the Garda and the health services and other agencies, but he has omitted the whole area of education.  Surely hope for the future is in the areas of prevention and education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the problem of drug abuse is not restricted to the 11 areas identified in the report.  However, I would make this distinction. The report was absolutely satisfied that the heroin problem, which is the problem to which we decided in the first report to give priority, is a Dublin phenomenon.  The question of drug abuse outside Dublin is one of non-opiate abuse exclusively, according to the information available to us.  The 11 areas were selected on the basis of the figures provided by the relevant agencies in terms of opiate abuse and that is why the focus is on those areas.  The second report which is being prepared relates to the question of non-opiate abuse and drug abuse in the prisons.  It will address the area which Deputy Burke identified.</P>
      <P>An entire section of the first report is devoted to the question of prevention and education measures and it is probably one of its strongest sections.  There are a range of measures, from Breaking the Cycle at the primary school stage to educative work both by the schools and the Department of Health.  The Minister for Education has received too few plaudits for the work she has done in terms of initiatives, such as the home/school liaison scheme.  She has provided money for additional teachers to work with parents and schools in the most disadvantaged areas of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Burke that the challenge facing society is to avoid a whole new generation of young people falling into the clutches of the drug barons.  It is a very extensive problem in Dublin and, whereas we may do no more than <Col N="343" /> contain it in terms of the present generation of abusers, it is imperative that we try to prevent a new generation of young people going down the same road.  As the Deputy said, education and preventative measures are imperative in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Funding for capital improvement projects on offshore islands is available under various schemes operated by a number of Departments as part of their responsibilities for specific areas of policy.  The sum of £1.75 million is available from the Department of the Taoiseach Vote for capital projects on islands.  At least £1.3 million has been allocated for marine works on Tory Island, funded from the Vote of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Under the funding allocations made by my Department, non-Gaeltacht islands are in receipt of grants for access and infrastructural development for the first time.  Capital improvement projects on islands may be funded from other Departments' programmes, subject to normal selection processes. As these programmes are project-led, it is not possible to say exactly what the final allocation will be for capital projects on islands in 1997.</P>
      <P>The Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development, which I chair, coordinates the response of Departments in respect of the economic and social development of the offshore islands, in accordance with the recommendations of the islands report which was published last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the recommendations of the report, new mechanisms have been put in place whereby access and infrastructural projects for islands are selected and prioritised at a local level by the islands committees of the relevant local authorities. These prioritised projects are assessed by the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee, thus ensuring that the most effective use is made of available funding.  As well as carrying over funding of approximately £0.75 million from 1996, £1 million is being made available from my Department towards the costs of infrastructural projects on the offshore islands in 1997.  The relevant local authorities have submitted lists of proposed <Col N="344" /> infrastructural projects for their islands.  On completion of assessments by the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee I hope to be in a position to allocate funding from the £1 million available towards the cost of these projects.</P>
    <P>Last year I approved nearly £600,000 for priority projects to develop access services to offshore islands.  Funding has also been put in place this year to ensure the completion of these projects.</P>

      <P>A number of questions arise from the reply.  Will the Minister of State indicate how much of the special allocation of £1 million he told me in reply to questions tabled last year he would allocate to the islands was spent during 1996?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately £170,000 was spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the major lack of infrastructure on the islands and the crying need for a range of infrastructural measures, why was only £170,000 of the £1 million allocated by the House for the islands spent during the year for which that sum was passed?  Can the Minister of State give an adequate explanation why island communities were not given the opportunity to use that money during the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahern knows full well that capital projects take some time to gestate.  As a former Minister for Finance, he is well aware of the amount of capital he pulled back from Departments and of underspending in them during his time in office.  Underspending in a Department is not a new phenomenon.  A new structure was proposed and it took some time to co-ordinate work with islanders who put forward the proposals and the island committees of the county councils, some of which were slow to set up committees.</P>
      <P>Weather is also a concern on islands.  Bad weather interferes with the progress of projects. A Dublin Deputy would be well insulated from that, but those of us who come from the west coast know all about it.  We frequently have to endure very bad weather conditions.</P>
      <P>The timing of capital projects is important for island ventures.  Most of the proposals put forward for which £600,000 was allocated this year will be completed early this year.  I was successful in ensuring that the £600,000 allocated last year was carried forward to this year.  That was a major achievement.</P>

      <P>We are grateful to the Chair. Eighty two per cent of the allocation to the islands for 1996 was not spent.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, was probably touring the world that year and did not know what was happening on the islands, but he will recall it was quite a good summer.  Surely there were plenty of projects on which to spend the money allocated. It is unheard of that 82 per cent of the funding for a capital project on infrastructural developments was not spent.  I cannot recall that ever happening in any Department.</P>

I am the first Minister of State who has been given special responsibility for their islands.  I have put in place an agreed structure for their development.  It was difficult and it took some time to reach agreement on a new formal structure with the islanders, county councillors and various Departments of State but Rome was not built in a day.

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rapid and nationwide expansion which the Legal Aid Board has undergone since 1992 has been undertaken to ensure that an effective civil legal aid and advice structure is in place nationally and locally to provide, among other matters, legal aid and advice to couples whose marriages have broken down.  This expansion can now been seen as necessary and timely having regard to an anticipated increase in applications to the board for legal services on the introduction of divorce.  Funding for the Legal Aid Board has increased from just under £2.7 million in 1992 to £8.3 million in 1996, an increase of more than three times the 1992 figure.  Over the same period staff numbers increased by two-and-a-quarter from 99 to 224, and I amended the scheme of civil legal aid and advice to enable the Legal Aid Board introduce a scheme for the use of private solicitors in delivery of legal services to legal aid applicants.  This provision is now reflected in the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995.  The recent addition <Col N="347" /> of a further two law centres at Newbridge and Tullamore brings to 30 the total of full-time law centres in the nationwide network as compared to 16 in 1993.  These include two full-time centres in the north-west at Letterkenny and Sligo.</P>
      <P>My achievements to date in expanding and developing the Legal Aid Board is evidence of my determination to ensure that subject to budgetary considerations sufficient resources are made available to the Legal Aid Board to enable it to provide an adequate response to all challenges which it may face in the future and, in particular, the challenge posed by the introduction of divorce.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to quantify the projected case load of the Legal Aid Board in 1997 arising from the enactment of the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  It is reasonable, however, to assume that a proportion of the approximately 4,000 judicial separation cases legally aided by the board to date will revert to the board for services in respect of divorce, as well as an unknown number of first time requests for legal aid for divorce proceedings.</P>
      <P>The family mediation service of my Department has also made significant progress in equipping itself to meet the challenge of divorce.  Family mediation is a professional confidential service which enables couples who have decided to separate or who have already separated to negotiate their own separation agreement with the help of a trained mediator, without resorting to adjudication through the courts.  All issues are included in the negotiations, such as ongoing parenting of the children, the family home, family finances, pensions, property and any other issues relevant to the separation.</P>
      <P>The first stage of the programme for development and expansion of the Family Mediation Service is almost complete.  A new service co-ordinator was appointed on 4 November 1996.  The new post of area mediation co-ordinator for the new centre at Mill House, Henry Street, Limerick, was filled on 2 December 1996 and the appointment of an area mediation co-ordinator to the existing family mediation centre at the Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin, will be made during the coming week.  The persons appointed will be responsible for delivery of a quality mediation service, with the assistance of a team of mediators, each for his or her own geographical areas of responsibility.  With the management structure in place it is now possible to proceed with the recruitment of further staff for the service and this is proceeding apace.  Deputies may be aware of recent advertisements in national newspapers, and in some provincial newspapers, seeking applications for positions as part-time mediators with the Family Mediation Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of area mediation co-ordinators will also facilitate the establishment of a scheme for the use of mediators in private practice, who have the necessary training and experience <Col N="348" /> and otherwise meet the standards set by the Family Mediation Service, to provide family mediation at locations distant from a family mediation centre or to relieve pressure on the centres at Dublin and Limerick.  The allocation of cases to private mediators will be done through the Family Mediation Service.  Mediation services for the north west will be provided for in the context of the development of a national service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there were three separate sections to the divorce referendum &mdash; namely, counselling, mediation and the courts?  Does he also agree that mediation is entered into when counselling has broken down?  Is it not correct that mediation is vitally important?  A message should issue from the Minister's Department that it is vitally important to avoid litigation if possible.  Consideration must be given to the fact that children are invariably involved in litigation proceedings. Children are most traumatised when cases come before the courts, particularly if such cases are highly publicised.</P>
      <P>The Government should make it known that it is encouraging the mediation service and will be providing further funding, if possible, towards this area.  Of the three areas to which I referred at the outset, would the Minister not agree that this is the most vital if we are to avoid traumatising children by involving them in court cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to prioritise these areas because counselling, mediation and the courts service and free legal aid are each extremely important.  Deputy McDaid is correct that mediation arises if and when counselling has broken down to see what negotiations can be concluded. It is an extremely important facet but, in the case of divorce, it does not entirely avoid the litigation procedure.  Unlike a judicial separation application, any divorce application must go to the courts which are the only bodies authorised to grant decrees of divorce.  It is possible to arrange a judicial separation by agreement.  This is negotiated by a mediator without the necessity of going before the courts provided the parties are enabled, through the mediation, to agree on all aspects of matters for determination such as property, income, pensions, children, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of divorce, it would be helpful were the parties to mediate and secure the maximum agreement possible before the matter comes before a judge.  My Department disseminates the message in every possible way in respect of the availability of services provided by the Department in the areas of free legal aid and mediation and the aid facilities it has made available to many counselling agencies throughout the country. The legislation dealing with divorce and judicial separation requires the respective solicitors representing an applicant and respondent to provide information on counselling and mediation.  The solicitors are obligated to do so and certify to the courts that they provided the <Col N="349" /> information and suggested to their clients that the possibility of counselling and mediation is open to them.  People are informed of the matter in that fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister highlighted the arrangements his Department has made in respect of mediation services.  However, these seem to be confined to larger urban areas.  Does the Minister agree that adequate provision has not been made for the remainder of the country? I have not encountered any major advertising campaign which states that mediation is now available in rural areas.  Is the Department not focusing on larger urban areas where there is a greater need?  It must be recognised that a problem exists in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of counselling, there is a wide provision of services in all parts of the country.  Deputy McDaid is correct, up to a point, as far as mediation is concerned.  There are two Family Mediation Services, operated and financed on a fully comprehensive basis by the State, in Dublin and Limerick.  Each centre serves a large hinterland and people from adjoining counties and regions avail of the services provided. In respect of other parts of the country, I intend to arrange, under the auspices of the Family Mediation Service, that private mediators in practice in Dublin or Limerick will be brought in on a contract basis to undertake mediation cases on referral.  This will be done in instances where the services of such mediators can be secured.</P>
      <P>However, the number of private mediators available on that basis is limited.  This service is in its infancy, but the agencies are doing all they can to expand it and provide the necessary training for more people to undertake this very skilled, detailed and professional work.  It takes a long time to train a professional mediator.  It is not such a major undertaking to train a counsellor who can be trained in a much more modest period of time.  Mediation is a different profession requiring years of professional skill, training and practice.  We are endeavouring to improve the availability of the skilled professional people that we need.  It will take some time.  In the meantime I intend to make the best possible use of the skilled personnel available.  That can and will be addressed in the two ways I have indicated, through the two centres in Dublin and Limerick, and by making the maximum possible use of the services of private mediators of whom there are no more than 16 or 20 in private practice at various locations around the country.</P>

      <P>The administration of the courts is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  However, where all aspects of property, child custody, pensions, assets and so on have been dealt with and amicably resolved as a result of mediation, I would think that would operate on a fast-track basis because the net issues for determination by the court would be substantially reduced.  In such a case the court would be left with little more to do than ensure that the constitutional requirements and the requirements of the Family Law (Divorce) Act had been complied with.</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Bill, which has now passed all Stages in the Dáil, prohibits discrimination in the context of employment on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, including colour, nationality and national or ethnic origin and membership of the travelling community.  The Equal Status Bill, which was recently published, prohibits discrimination outside the workplace on similar grounds.</P>
      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the definition of disability in both Bills and to the inclusion of gender, race and colour as prohibited grounds of discrimination.  The definition of disability would extend to a condition that will exist in the future or may be imputed to a person.</P>
      <P>I also understand that case law of the European Court of Justice has regarded job discrimination based on sex change as amounting to unequal treatment on the gender ground.</P>

      <P>This area is not covered in the Minister's Bill.  Some people might regard it as a &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo; type of issue.  However, with genetic engineering making headway as it is &mdash; and a <Col N="351" /> recent BBC programme pointed this out &mdash; it will be statistically possible to earmark people who will have specific conditions in years to come, and insurance companies, for example, might demand to use genetic profiling in the future.  Could legislation be introduced to prohibit insurance companies using genetic profiling to load people who may have specific conditions i.e. diabetes, blood pressure and so on?</P>

It prohibits discrimination in respect of a condition which may exist in the future or which is imputed to a person.  In so far as insurance companies may be inclined to discriminate in respect of their premiums, they will only be allowed to do so under the terms of both Bills where they have an actuarial basis that would reasonably justify that, and that is a matter that in the case of dispute, could be examined and adjudicated on by one of the equality officers appointed under the legislation.</P>

      <P>It is not clear to what specific facilities the Deputy is referring.  The Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities entitled &ldquo;A Strategy For Equality&rdquo; contains recommendations in many areas which will promote equality for people with disabilities, including children with disabilities.  I have established an interdepartmental task force to prepare a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities based on the Commission's report and this plan is due to be completed around mid-year. I will also set up a monitoring committee to oversee the implementation of the Commission's recommendations.  The monitoring committee will be representative of people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers, as well as the social partners and Government Departments.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is somewhat inadequate.  He asks about specifics.  I refer him to the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which made many recommendations regarding education.  On the one hand the Minister is trying to ensure there is no discrimination against people with disabilities and, on the other, the State appealed to the Supreme Court in a case relating to the education <Col N="352" /> of a disabled child?  What is the Minister's view on this?  Why was it necessary to fight this case? Does the Minister not think that was contrary to natural justice?  It is my understanding from previous replies that the Minister expected the task force to report earlier in the year.  I am disappointed it will not do so until the middle of the year.  When exactly will it report?</P>

      <P>The interdepartmental task force has been appointed and its remit is to prepare an action plan which is due to be completed in the middle of this year.  I understand the group is on target to complete the plan and when that is done it is my intention to submit it to the Government for consideration.  I will also set up a monitoring committee, which will be broadly representative and which will have an ongoing role, to look at the implementation on a phased basis of the numerous important recommendations in the commission's report.  The matter must be tackled on a prioritised basis and that is the reason for the interdepartmental task force which comprises representation from the relevant Departments. The task force will work in conjunction with the monitoring committee.</P>

      <P>I do not agree.  The Minister has the responsibility to champion the plight of disabled people.  He set up the commission, accepted its report and now wishes to priorities its recommendations. It is within the Minister's responsibility to ensure disabled children have the same rights of access to facilities as any other child. That is a matter for the collective responsibility of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a broad comment which is not particularly helpful.  There are many specific recommendations in the commission's report and <Col N="353" /> they must be addressed on an item by item basis. There are over 400 recommendations affecting the Ministers for Education, Health, Social Welfare and Justice.  The only practical approach was to set up an interdepartmental task force to examine the recommendations carefully, prepare an action plan and priorities items that may be dealt with quickly by the relevant Ministers.  The task force has already had meetings, I hope the action plan will be produced by the middle of the year and we can set about the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
      <P>My ministerial colleagues have responsibilities for different aspects of this matter.  It would be counterproductive to ask me the detail of the administrative responsibilities of other Ministers because do not have that information.  However, those Ministers are readily available to deal with queries.  Another Deputy has taken advantage of that availability by putting a question on this point to the Minister for Education.  Any particular issue that arises within the ambit of another Minister should be addressed to the relevant Minister.</P>
      <P>I have an overall responsibility to see to the implementation on a phased basis of the recommendations in the commission's report.  The task force has been set up for that purpose and we will progress in a measured and careful way on that basis.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to detract from the Minister's commitment in this matter.  Is it not supremely ironic, to say the least, that the Government put the commission in place on the one hand while on the other hand it challenged the right of a disabled child to be educated?  That is an incredible contradiction and it should not go unchallenged.  It is not the Minister's specific responsibility but as a collective decision by the Cabinet it was very bad.  The Minister should ensure the Supreme Court decision is implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be more of a comment than a question.  As I understand it, the Minister for Education has satisfactorily dealt with the subject matter of the court case.  She replied to a question on the matter in the House. The issue has been resolved satisfactorily.  I see no contradiction in the Government having set up the commission and taking a practical, progressive and proactive approach to deal with the commission's many recommendations on all aspects of the lives of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keogh is seeking to highlight the case of one child in a particular circumstances involving an education issue which was resolved.  If the Deputy is unhappy with that resolution, I invite her to take the matter up with the Minister for Education.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to introduce legislation in view of the diverse nature of the modern family unit in Ireland and the disadvantage suffered by families other than those based on the married couple in respect of a range of issues such as inheritance, pensions and other matters.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4599/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the requirements of the provisions in the Constitution are such that there may be constraints on what can be done to deal with the position of those who live together outside marriage.  The position has been the subject of examination in the recent report of the Constitution Review Group which, while appreciating the point of view of those who feel that persons living in family units not based on marriage should have constitutional recognition, points out that the constitutional protection of rights of any family unit other than a family based on marriage represents significant difficulties of definition and policy.</P>
      <P>The group makes certain recommendations which fall short of equating the position of, say, cohabitants with married couples.  It recommends retention of Article 41 of the Constitution to guard the institution of marriage with special care, subject to a provision that this should not prevent the Oireachtas from legislating for the benefit of families not based on marriage.  The group's final report now falls to be considered by the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Our inheritance laws give special rights to spouses, children &mdash; including children of a non-marital union &mdash; and certain other relatives. While those special rights do not extend to cohabitants, the law in relation to testate succession already permits succession by cohabitants where those special family rights are not infringed.  It may be a matter for consideration as to whether the law can and should go further in the case of intestacy but there could be considerable difficulties in framing such a law.  I have asked the Law Society for views on the operation of our succession laws and I propose in due course to take those consultations and other relevant views into account in any proposals for amending legislation that I may bring forward. My Department has no responsibilities in relation to pensions other than in relation to provisions which I initiated in the context of marital breakdown in our judicial separation laws as contained in the Family Law Act, 1995, and in our divorce laws as contained in the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  The Departments of Finance and Social Welfare have responsibilities which shape overall policy in relation to pensions.</P>
      <P>In so far as policy generally in relation to the family is concerned, as well as the changing nature of the family, the Government established the Commission on the Family to examine needs and priorities.  The commission has been asked to make its final report to the Government by June 1997 and its recommendations will fall to be considered by relevant Departments in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> Relevant aspects of the law in relation to cohabitants, taking into account the constitutional restraints, is the subject of review on an ongoing basis in my Department.  That approach has resulted in the important safety and barring order provisions in the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, being extended to cohabitants for their protection from violent partners.  Garda powers of arrest in cases of violence against cohabitants have also been strengthened.  I initiated also provisions now contained in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, 1996, the effect of which are that certain cohabitants may, in fatal injury actions, claim damages as compensation for loss of pecuniary benefits, for mental distress and for funeral expenses where the death of the other cohabitant is caused by the wrongful act of a person. There are aspects of the law in relation to guardianship which I have also had reviewed by my Department and the results will be announced as soon as possible in the context of publication of the Children (No. 2) Bill.  Other aspects of the laws which apply to cohabitants will be developed, with a view to legislative changes, as may be feasible and warranted as other legislative priorities permit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the nature of society is complex?  I framed the question by referring to families other than those based on the married couple who had not made wills.  While the Minister focused his reply on cohabiting couples, my question was directed at those on the margins of society where a dependency and an injustice can arise as a result of our laws.  Outside the family unit and the cohabiting unit there are other units, for example, two elderly brothers or an elderly brother and elderly sister living together.  Existing law can result in a number of injustices for those people.  On the death of one or other, the survivor may have to sell the farm in order that it may be made divisible among a multitude of others who may arrive from different areas.  Will the Minister consider setting up a register of people who have not married and have not made a will so that they will find it easier to provide for the person who has looked after them?  There are a multitude of areas in the family unit where injustices can arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDaid raised a broad-ranging question.  As I understand it, he is referring to two brothers who share a house.  It is difficult to give an answer on an issue that is not more specific.  A difficulty arises where one of the people has failed to make a will.  It is extremely important that a person in that situation makes a will.  The Law Society has been active in recent years in trying to promote and encourage the making of wills.  It is a simple and cheap procedure for the most part and should be availed of.  In many cases there are unforeseen and undesired results in the administration of property when a will has not been made.  I do not think it <Col N="356" /> would be possible to cover by legislation every vagary and every situation that could arise.</P>
      <P>In the case of brothers there could be a particular family background where it would be reasonable, proper and appropriate to divide the property on a wider basis other than the two brothers when one dies intestate.  If one of the brothers is the sole owner of the property that person would be well advised to make a will.</P>
      <P>As far as the generality of cohabiting is concerned, it is a broad and difficult issue.  Anybody who reads the comments of the Constitution Review Group will realise its complexity.  In the legislation I prepared in my Department, I have identified a number of issues where special attention and understanding had to be given to cohabitants, normally between men and women.  I instanced the case of domestic violence where a right to obtain a barring order until that Act was in force did not apply for the benefit of a cohabitant. As a result of the Act that right now applies in certain circumstances, likewise in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, 1996, where people have been cohabiting for a certain minimum period and one is killed by a wrongful act.  Until that Act came into force &mdash; which it did recently &mdash; it was not possible for the other cohabitant to bring a claim.  We are also examining aspects of the law in relation to guardianship in the context of the Children Bill.  Where it arises in specific instances we are happy to examine it carefully.  It is a difficult area and one has to define what is meant by a cohabitant.  The Constitution Review Group raises the rhetorical question: what is meant by a cohabitant?  Is it people who have been living together for a week, a month, a year, three years, five years or ten years?  All these questions come into play.  It is a complex area but it will have our ongoing attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister about the definition of cohabitant.  Outside the sexual context there is cohabitation in rural Ireland.  The ESB operates a policy for its employees whereby any benefits accrued from contributing to the scheme go to the spouse.  If that person is single and living with an elderly person there is nothing for that person.  What is the position in the case of cohabitants where the gentleman dies and there is nothing left for the partner?  In the ESB, benefits which would normally accrue are paid to the spouse but in certain instances, such as that of the elderly father living with the daughter or son, they do not pertain to that family unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with the provisions of the ESB pension scheme.  The provisions of pension schemes vary.  For example, where a person does not have a spouse it is open to him to nominate the beneficiary while in other cases the benefits can be disposed of by way of a will.</P>

Schemes vary and I could not comment on a particular scheme without more information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the beneficiaries. Does he think it would be possible within the existing legal framework to provide that a person must nominate a beneficiary?  The Minister said the definition of &ldquo;cohabitee&rdquo; is being examined by the Constitution Review Group.  The domestic violence legislation sets out a certain period after which people are regarded as cohabitees.  Is there a general provision which states that people will be regarded as cohabitees after, say, three months or does the time vary according to the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no generalised specific period; it is a definition matter for determination by the Oireachtas in respect of individual legislation. If I recall correctly, the period set out in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act is three years.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether it would be possible to legislate in the way proposed by the Deputy in regard to pensions, I would have to consider that.  The question of pensions legislation comes within the ambit of the Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare.  I dealt with the pensions aspect of marriage breakdown in the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  However, the specifics of pension schemes, which are complex are the responsibility of another Minister.  Pensions are basically contracts and the people who form and participate in them have a contract.  Schemes differ greatly and while they are formed to suit the needs of members they can be varied with their agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>I am heartened at the very positive nature of the conclusions and observations in the report of the independent evaluator appointed by ADM Limited to evaluate my Department's pilot child care initiative.</P>
      <P>The pilot child care initiative commenced in 1994 and has continued in each subsequent year, including this year.  The scheme is intended to assist the initiation of projects on a pilot basis for the establishment of child care measures utilising the skills of trained local people and to enable local residents to undertake education, training, retraining and employment opportunities which they would otherwise be unable to undertake in the absence of a child care facility.</P>
      <P>It is a condition of the scheme that grants are confined to groups in disadvantaged areas.  It has been agreed that these be defined as those areas in which there are area based partnership-local community groups currently in receipt of funds from the global grant for local development.  The scheme is being administered, on behalf of my Department, by Area Development Management ADM Limited, an independent company designated by the Government and the European Commission to support integrated local economic and social development in co-operation with relevant area partnership companies.</P>
      <P>To date, 109 projects have been approved for funding in two tranches.  In the initial period encompassing 1994 and 1995, a total of 73 projects were approved and a further 36 were approved in 1996.  A total of £1.85 million was made available to fund these projects.  The impact and the results of the initiative were evaluated on my instructions.  This exercise was carried out by an independent evaluator during 1996 and, naturally, it covered only those 73 projects in the initial tranche.  I will confine my comments on the report to a small number of the more significant conclusions in it.</P>
      <P>Projects aided under the initiative were able to generate, on average, an additional £1.33 from other sources for each £1 allocated under the initiative.  The report estimates that the number of children being cared for by projects assisted under the initiative has more than doubled, from 1,679 before funding to 3,650 after funding, an increase of 1,971 children.</P>
      <P>While more than half of the projects, 65 per cent, cater for pre-school children only, the proportion of projects making provision for school-going children has nearly doubled since the commencement of the initiative and now accounts for more than one third, 35 per cent, of all projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Staffing ratios in child care projects aided under the initiative, particularly in the case of children under one year, have improved considerably since funding from the initiative was made available.  The vast majority of projects now meet the Department of Health's recommended staffing ratios in each age category.  The employment potential of assisted child care projects was highlighted <Col N="359" /> by the report.  It estimated that the total number of persons working in all 73 projects funded by the initiative increased by 90 per cent, from 349 before funding to 663 after funding.  The average number of people working in each participating child care project increased from 4.7 to 9.</P>
    <P>The majority, 66 per cent, of mothers of children being cared for by projects funded by the initiative are involved, mainly on a part time basis, in some activity outside the home, notably work, 22 per cent; education and training courses, 24 per cent; community employment, 16 per cent and other 4 per cent.  It is worth noting that in addition to promoting labour market integration and the uptake of courses, the projects, in a minority of cases, support families under stress where the child is referred, and paid for, by the local health board.</P>
    <P>It is clear from these findings that the initiative has been instrumental in bringing about a radical transformation in the child care projects which benefited from its funding and in the related communities. The evaluator's report, which was launched on 7 February, is being studied in my Department.  In due course I will determine the manner in which the child care initiative can be best progressed, having regard to the material furnished in the report and the results of its consideration by my Department.

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the appointment of an independent evaluator to evaluate what appears to be a very successful initiative.  Will he agree it would be more advantageous to have all projects under one Department? I mean no disrespect to the Department of Equality and Law Reform but the initiative may be better progressed under the Department of Health which has responsibility for pre-school and créche facilities, etc.  The Minister may believe it will get more attention in his Department.</P>

      <P>This is a matter which could be considered but the Department of Health is primarily responsible for families under stress, children at risk, etc.  I initiated this measure at the commencement of my term as a Minister under the previous Government and it has progressed extraordinarily well.  It has been heartening to go around the country and visit many of these projects. One such project in Deputy McDaid's constituency, the naíonaire outside Letterkenny, impressed me very much.  It was encouraging to see what had been achieved there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also interesting to emphasise the level of support received by these projects.  For every £1 of grant assistance which may Department gave them, they were able to raise a further £1.33.  It has been a source of great enthusiasm in my Department.  Since its inception in 1993-4 this initiative has blossomed as over 100 projects have <Col N="360" /> been possible as a result of this funding.  We have to examine the evaluator's report carefully to see how we will proceed with this worthwhile initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14, 23, 25 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>I published the code of practice on measures to protect the dignity of men and women at work, also known as the code of practice on sexual harassment, in September 1994.</P>
      <P>This code of practice was prepared by the Employment Equality Agency with the full co-operation of IBEC and ICTU.  In accordance with an undertaking in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> the code is being promoted, monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis by the agency.  In attempting to ensure the widest possible dissemination of the code, the EEA has distributed almost 33,000 copies to employers, trade unions, individuals and other interested parties since its publication two and a half years ago.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Bill, 1996, which completed its passage through this House a fortnight ago, makes provision for the approval of codes of practice in the furtherance of the elimination of discrimination and-or the promotion of equality in employment.  Codes so approved may be admissible in evidence and taken into account in any proceedings.  As I mentioned in this House on a number of previous occasions, I am disposed to having the 1994 code of practice reviewed when the Bill is enacted so that it can be given appropriate statutory recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Employment Equality Agency has a code of practice on measures to protect the dignity of men and women at work <Col N="361" /> and the Minister stated that he hoped to put it on a statutory basis.  Is he satisfied that the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, gives it a statutory basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not transform the code into a Statutory Instrument.  The Bill makes provision that codes as approved can be designated by me so that they can be used by a court or tribunal. Account of the content of such an approved code can be used as a guideline on proper and best practice in the determination of any case that comes before a court or tribunal where the code is relevant to the individual circumstances of the case before it.  Judicial notice would be taken of the code in those circumstances if I approve it under the powers given to the Minister in the Bill. As I said in my reply I am disposed to having the 1994 code of practice reviewed when the Bill is enacted so that it can be given appropriate statutory recognition but I cannot do that until the Bill has completed all Stages and becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it agreed that such a code of practice in the workplace would be to the benefit of employers and employees and that employers would welcome such a code of practice because it would go some way towards exempting them in sexual harassment incidents which occur among their employees in the workplace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the Deputy.  That was the reason I arranged with the EEA to set about the preparation of this code and they consulted and secured the agreement of IBEC and ICTU for its preparation and launch. It has been published and 33,000 copies of it have been circulated.  It is a valuable instrument in the hands of employers and employees.  It is my wish to take it further by giving it statutory recognition. That is the reason I put a provision in the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, to enable me to do that.</P>
      <P>That position need not be confined to this code.  It may be possible to prepare codes dealing with other aspects of equality, such as pay, employment, etc. which could be given a statutory basis and used in tribunals in the same way as this one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>My party supports the Bill but there are a number of areas where we consider the drafting to be rather loose and in respect of which we will table amendments on Committee Stage with a view to making the Bill more enforceable.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important that drug pushers are apprehended and brought before the courts. Drug pushers are serious criminals.  They are merchants of death who must not be allowed to ply their evil trade in the future in the manner in which they have done in the past.  They should be dealt with more rigorously in the criminal law system.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the need for this kind of legislation which will ensure local authority houses are not used as a base by drug pushers.  There is a sufficient body of law already in place to allow local authorities evict individual tenants, but it is seldom applied.  It is unfortunate that local authorities have been slow to use that mechanism to evict anti-social tenants.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the effect of the Bill as currently drafted will be to move the problem from one area to another.  If that were to happen, it would defeat the purpose of the Bill.  There is an onus on all of us to close any loopholes we may detect in that respect on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not make any sense if drug pushers who had been evicted from houses in public ownership ended up living in houses in private ownership.  That would not solve the problem and it is not the intention of this legislation.  It would not make sense either if people evicted from local authority houses under the exclusion order that is central to the Bill ended up homeless on the streets because the voluntary organisations would then have to respond.  The problem would be solved at local authority level but another would be created in a different area.  I hope that will <Col N="364" /> not be the effect of the implementation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Parents of young children, who are trying to raise them in areas awash with drugs, are concerned that we as legislators use every procedure available to us to ensure drugs are not sold in their areas.  They want to live in crime free communities.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the definition in the Bill of &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo;.  It will not be difficult to identify drug pushers &mdash; I hope we can always depend on the Garda in that respect &mdash; but it will be more difficult to clearly define the term &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo; in a way that will stand up to any challenge in the courts.  That problem must be addressed in the context of the Bill because anti-social behaviour is not confined to people who peddle drugs.  There are many forms of anti-social behaviour in local authority housing estates and the problem is getting worse.  As Deputy Noel Ahern said this morning, in the past, poor families lived in neighbourhoods where older people were respected and children protected. That is no longer the case.</P>
    <P>People come to my advice centres every week appealing for a transfer out of the area in which they live on the grounds that they cannot get a night's sleep or endure the noise emanating from neighbouring houses or apartments.  That type of behaviour cannot be tolerated and the problem is a challenge for local authorities.</P>
    <P>Historically, local authorities did not manage or maintain housing estates well.  They can build houses, an activity often driven by the Construction Industry Federation, but they appear unable to make provision in their budgets for a proper estate management and maintenance plan.  I appreciate the Minister is tackling that problem and putting more resources into estate management programmes.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will have to draw up tenancy agreements that put an obligation on tenants to respect and consider their neighbours.  That must form part of all tenancy agreements and if tenants breach those agreements they should be dealt with severely.</P>
    <P>We must implement better estate management practices.  We could learn a good deal from what has happened in Britain where a number of estate management programmes were introduced, some of which collapsed.  We can improve oil the measures adopted in Britain and implement practices that would create an environment in which law abiding citizens could go about their business and get a night's sleep without gross interference from their neighbours.  As landlords local authorities cannot claim great credit for the estate management practices they have implemented. They should be given responsibility for devising an ISO requirement for that purpose.</P>
    <P>This Bill stemmed from the desperation of families as a result of a tidal wave of drug pushing and I hope it will deal with that problem.  My party will table reasonable amendments to improve it.  Our combined efforts should ensure <Col N="365" /> that proper legislation is enacted to improve conditions for young and old people living in private and local authority housing estates.  Tenants in private housing estates must also be subject to the law of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill for many reasons, but mainly because it has been introduced as a result of demands from some of our most disadvantaged communities.  Some years ago people living in St. Joseph's Mansions in Killarney Street told me a network of criminals were getting involved in drug pushing and taking over their community.  They were concerned that effective action was not being taken to deal with these criminals and wondered why Dublin Corporation could not evict them.  That flat complex is currently semi-derelict with only one-third of its tenants still living there.  While some of the drug dealers still live there, most of them have made their money and left.  However, they have not gone to hostels for the homeless, they have bought private luxury houses or flats here or in Britain and the decent tenants have been left to live in dreadful conditions.</P>
      <P>That community was taken over by drug dealers simply because effective laws were not in place to deal with them.  The corporation had only limited powers to evict people and they were difficult to pursue in the courts.  Action against some drug dealers who lived in that complex is still winding its tortuous way through the courts.</P>
      <P>Because of the failure of the State to take action, the problems associated with heroin are entrenched mainly in local authority estates and flat complexes, not in private housing estates.  I am pleased the Minister of State emphasised that evictions would take place only for activities of a serious nature.  While having the necessary powers to evict people for drug dealing is not the solution to the drugs problem, it is an essential part of it.  If effective action is not taken against drug dealers, whom the State is subsidising by providing them with houses, no strategy will be effective.</P>
      <P>This Bill will act as a deterrent.  Garda drug units have indicated on many occasions that drug dealers are concerned about losing their homes. Because effective action was not taken against those who used flat complexes to deal in drugs many people were sucked into the drug dealing network.  However, when Dublin Corporation called for powers to evict people for such crime, many of those peripherally involved ceased to be involved.  When this Bill is enacted its provisions will not have to be enforced in the manner in which some agencies suggest.  It will be used in the case of serious drug dealers and act as a deterrent in the case of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the Criminal Assets Bureau and a number of other legislative measures, this Bill would probably not have been introduced if Veronica Guerin had not been murdered.  It is an indictment of the system that many new legislative measures were not introduced until after that <Col N="366" /> dreadful event.  I do not want to dwell on that, but that is what galvanised Governments and agencies into action and forced them to bring in measures which they seemed reluctant to introduce. I argued in this House on numerous occasions for the Criminal Assets Bureau and everybody said it was a great idea, but nobody was prepared to set it up.  Local authorities argued for years for this power in the Housing Bill, but nobody was prepared to grant it.</P>
    <P>Once it became clear that the Government was prepared to do something about the matter a small lobby group, which has never represented the interests of tenants who are victims of harassment but has represented the interests of people whom the corporation attempted to evict for intimidation, tried to influence Government to water down this Bill to make it ineffective.  Some weeks ago I attended an anti-drugs conference at which I said there was a possibility that a small lobby group which represents no-one might in the long run have greater influence on Government than disadvantaged communities.  It was felt that the group put members of the Government under pressure to change the legislation, but I am glad that has not yet happened.</P>
    <P>This Bill empowers disadvantaged communities. It gives power to decent people in communities to say there are certain activities that are unacceptable, such as drug dealing, intimidation and harassment of people who want to live in peace and make the most of their circumstances. The Bill is very important in that regard.  The communities that suffer from drug dealing and those who represent them have won the battle in trying to get this legislation through.</P>
    <P>Last week I visited a part of my constituency for which I have not been elected yet &mdash; it was included in my constituency in the change of boundaries.  I refer to Gallanstown in Cherry Orchard, part of which has been taken over and is controlled by heroin dealers.  The vast majority of people living there are decent people who despise drug dealing and criminality but live in fear of an entrenched group of criminal drug dealers.  While I was there, at 9.30 a.m. last Friday, with corporation officials and other public representatives, taxis arrived with addicts who were desperate for heroin, but when they saw us they moved on.  In that location there are 12 houses, built only six years ago, half of which are derelict and cannot be refurbished or occupied because of the terror waged by a handful of drug dealing criminals in the area.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that that huge estate in the Dublin 10 area is shown that the State is not powerless in dealing with those criminals. Whatever powers are required to deal with them should be made available to the local authority so that the decent people in the area can regain their community and bring their children to school without having to pass people on the footpath selling heroin.  I have been known in recent times to criticise the Garda &mdash; I am not anti-Garda, I want them to do the work required of <Col N="367" /> them by the people &mdash; but I visited the local Garda station in Ballyfermot this morning with a delegation of residents and I am glad that in recent weeks, perhaps belatedly, in that part of Dublin the gardaí have taken the issue seriously and are working with Dublin Corporation, the health board and the community in an organised effort to try to regain the area for the decent people who live there.</P>
    <P>There is another important element in this Bill. I have attended meetings with gardaí who say that they want to give information to Dublin Corporation about individuals but do not feel they have the power to do so.  This Bill gives such authority. We all agree that an integrated response is needed, involving the Garda, the corporation and so on, but in many instances they do not have the structures, framework or powers to deal with the problem.  I welcome the important provision which allows for the exchange of information in the interests of the community to ensure drug dealers and such people are dealt with speedily.</P>
    <P>I could not speak on any aspect of the drugs problem without paying tribute to community activists and organisations throughout the city which, in the past six or eight months, have taken a courageous stand against drug dealers.  In my area in the centre of Dublin, the Inner City Organisation Network, ICON, is one of the organisations that has reclaimed the streets in the area from drug dealers.  I pay tribute to those community activists who, out of commitment to their children and their communities, have organised to rid their areas of drug dealing.  Active community organisations will see this legislation as vindication and support of what they are trying to do, as recognition by Government that the drugs problem will be dealt with only if everyone plays a part.  They will see it as a very good example of the State empowering and working with communities to rid their areas of what is probably the greatest scourge of this century.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £3 million for environmental improvements was mentioned this morning.  During Question Time a Government spokesperson pointed out that the amount available to the local authorities for such work was in the region of £100,000, but said that £3 million is now being made available as part of the anti-drugs measures. Most people would say that will only scratch the surface of the problem given the large scale deprivation which underlies the heroin problem in Dublin.  However, £3 million is much better than £100,000.  I have seen details of the work Dublin Corporation intends to do with half of that money in some of its flat complexes, such as Mountain View Court in Summerhill.  It will transform them.  I hope when the Government sees the use to which this money is put, whether in inner city flat complexes or in areas such as Cherry Orchard and Gallanstown which have huge unemployment problems and lack amenities, it will increase the amount each year and make available the necessary <Col N="368" /> resources.  I welcome this initial injection of £3 million.</P>
    <P>No one should refer to the drugs problem without dealing with its source.  Although this Bill is welcome, it will not solve the heroin problem which is entrenched in local authority estates and in the most disadvantaged and deprived communities in Dublin.  Cherry Orchard has a population of 5,500.  There are approximately 1,000 children under the age of five in that community yet there is no school in the area.  Its only amenity is a small community centre.  Groups of committed local community activists are involved in a number of youth projects, some of which received State grants.  Dublin Corporation has an action plan to introduce amenities in the area and it has also tried to get European funding to provide employment.  The Eastern Health Board has plans to set up a nursery, but these are only plans on paper.  This community has been in existence for 15 years or more without any amenities.  Such deprivation leads to heroin problems and causes many people to be sucked into drug dealing networks who would not otherwise be involved.</P>
    <P>Unless areas such as Cherry Orchard, the north and south inner cities and other deprived communities in Dublin are directly targeted with financial resources, this problem will continue.  We constantly hear about the greatest economic boom since the foundation of the State.  Yet that boom has had no impact on Cherry Orchard.  I visited that community at 9.30 a.m. last Friday and there was no evidence that the benefits of the economic boom have reached it or that the Government has targeted it with a view to making the necessary resources available to deal with its problems.  If we do not deal effectively with the heroin problem in Dublin, it will spiral out of control.  Indeed, it is doing so already.  I appeal to this Government and to whatever Government takes office after the general election to provide the resources to the communities in Dublin which desperately need them so that another generation of young people are not lost to heroin addiction.</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  Together with the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, it is probably the most valuable legislation to come before the House.  It is a powerful new weapon in the armoury of the State and its agencies in the fight against the scourge of drug abuse and the effect it has on many disadvantaged and deprived communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the extent of the problem and how it has corroded life in the north inner city and in large sections of my constituency such as Gallanstown, Cherry Orchard, St. Michael's Estate, Summerhill, Sheriff Street, Seán McDermott Street and O'Devaney Gardens.  We need a weapon to <Col N="369" /> deal with this problem in the flat complexes and local authority housing estates.  Dublin Corporation recommended the introduction of this legislation because it has been frustrated in trying to deal with serious anti-social behaviour caused by drug abuse.  It is important that this legislation be put in place.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of the level of frustration and the inability of existing measures to deal with the problem.  The worst flat complex in Dublin, St. Joseph's Mansions, is in my constituency.  It has running water but no bathroom facilities.  The residents must wash themselves and their children in the kitchen sink or in a bath in the kitchen.  Dublin Corporation attempted to refurbish that block of flats three years ago.  It put in new windows and carried out a pilot scheme on the four corners which have blocks of four flats in each.  The process came to a halt as the complex is over-run with drug pushers who have made life a misery for the tenants.  It has remained untouched since then.  The number of occupied flats has dwindled; approximately 70 flats are unoccupied.</P>
    <P>With the assistance of the tenants and the Garda Síochána, the corporation has produced a package of proposals under which the complex will be refurbished when all the drug pushers have been evicted.  Many have left but 14 still remain against whom the corporation has instituted proceedings. On 11 February, I received a letter from the corporation which states:</P>
    <P>A number of court cases involving tenants in St. Joseph's Mansions were listed for hearing in the District Court on 24th January 1997 and 7th February 1997.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, one of the Dublin Corporation officials required to give evidence in all these cases was not available to attend Court due to serious illness.</P>
    <P>The three cases listed for hearing on 24th January were adjourned to 14th February 1997. It will be necessary to adjourn these again.</P>
    <P>The five cases listed for hearing on 7th February 1997 were adjourned to 2nd May 1997.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation are currently awaiting court dates for four appeal cases.</P>
    <P>A further two cases have yet to be listed for hearing in the District Court.</P>
    <P>The process of issuing summonses and awaiting court hearings which may have to be adjourned and re-entered because of the non-availability of officials due to illness is time consuming and frustrating. Court decisions are also subject to appeal. The corporation is unable, as a result, to refurbish the complex for tenants.</P>
    <P>If the provisions of section 8 under which cases will be fast-tracked through the courts prove effective, it will be a major victory in the fight against the drug pushers in local authority housing. If not, we will have to go back to the drawing <Col N="370" /> board.  They should be tightened, if necessary, to enable local authorities deal with the problem swiftly and effectively.  The complex mentioned is located at the junction where a Christmas tree was erected as a beacon of hope in the north inner city for a future free of drugs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision under which local authorities will have the right to exclude an individual or individuals from a local authority house or flat.  Up to now the entire family was evicted because of the sins of a son or daughter.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from organisations such as Threshold, the Merchant's Quay Project and the Franciscan Social Justice Initiative in which they voice their concerns about the legislation under which they believe people will be denied accommodation.  It is essential, however, that local authorities have the right to refuse to sell or let accommodation to known drug pushers who are killing young people in our communities.  No other word can be used.  Heroin is a killer.  In this context, we are obliged to adopt ruthless methods.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 3,000 homeless people in Dublin.  When suitable accommodation has been provided for these as well as for those living in inadequate housing, the question of providing accommodation for drug pushers might be considered.  We have a responsibility to our communities and must not allow them to be poisoned. There is a need to take protective measures.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to withdraw supplementary welfare allowance, payable by health boards, from tenants in private accommodation who are involved in peddling drugs.  In Dublin many drug pushers have moved out of local authority housing into accommodation provided by the health board in new apartment blocks constructed under the urban renewal scheme because communities from Hardwicke Street to Sherriff Street have said they will not tolerate them.  We must be careful not to create new ghettos in which they will find fruitful markets in areas they have not exploited before.</P>
    <P>We must keep drug pushers on the move as this will make it easier for the Garda Síochána to deal with them.  Many have moved out of the north inner city to the suburbs and further afield to England, the Netherlands and Spain while others have moved the short distance to O'Connell Street where it is easier for the Garda Síochána to monitor their activities.  It is easier for drug pushers to peddle their trade within the confines of a flat complex than in places such as O'Connell Street.  Therefore, we must not allow them to rest.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that we put together a package of proposals in addition to this Bill to eliminate the black spots in the city because the problem arises in these areas.  Resources and a proper programme of development and employment would go a long way toward eliminating the causes which allow drug pushing to proliferate throughout these deprived areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, on bringing forward this Bill.  It will be an excellent vehicle to deal with the problems with which I deal every day in my clinics in Dublin South-West.  She is to be congratulated on the detail in the Bill.  She has listened for some time to representations on the matter.</P>
      <P>It would be unfair to suggest, as Deputy Gregory did, that this Bill has only been brought forward as a result of the death of Veronica Guerin.  I have made representations to the Minister for over three years on many of the issues in this Bill and some of them have been included.</P>
      <P>I thank her for including the provision which deals with Eastern Health Board subsidies because there was a serious problem for a while in a private estate in Springfield, Tallaght, where a majority of houses were let to people receiving Eastern Health Board subsidies who were involved in anti-social behaviour, drug-dealing and drug-trafficking.  I made strong representations to the Minister of State and she included a provision which allows the Eastern Health Board to withdraw these subsidies.  That is an important element of the Bill which allows us to protect certain communities that have been plagued with this problem.  It also stops the strange practice of people who have been involved in anti-social behaviour moving from a local authority house to one in a private estate with the help of a subsidy.  It is time that message went out to such people and I appreciate the inclusion of that provision in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Serious intimidation of people in housing estates is widespread throughout the city.  It is mainly directed against women who are lone parents. We must look seriously at this problem. Many thugs will not act in this way if there is a man in the house.  They will do so with people who are vulnerable, such as the elderly, particularly old women, who have no means of defence. They are continuously harassed by young thugs who stay outside their homes and destroy their lives to the point where many of them say it is not worth living any more, it is a hell on earth. That is not overstating the matter.</P>
      <P>Handicapped children are targeted by these thugs, and not all of it has to do with drugs.  Some of it is simply thuggery and it needs to be dealt with firmly.  A handicapped child in my constituency is constantly taunted by such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another person had all the windows in her house broken by rocks, not stones, and a tree was rammed through the front window.  She was injured and taken away by ambulance.  When the driver got in to drive off, the thugs got into the back of the ambulance and attacked her further while she was on the stretcher.  These were only young thugs between the ages of 16 and 17 who live in a local authority estate and they had no fear.  What should we do with those people?  I say we should rid the estate of them.  That woman will never be the same again.  She was threatened at gun point recently.  A shotgun was pointed at <Col N="372" /> her forehead as she opened her front door.  The same thugs organised it.  All she had done was try to organise the youth of the area.  I do not want to exaggerate the problem in one area but to highlight the magnitude of the problem which the Bill must address.</P>
    <P>Many areas are worthy of compliment.  In Brookview, Tallaght, which had many problems, the people organised themselves and a group, mainly consisting of women, have patrolled the estate every night for the past two years.  They have eliminated all aspects of crime from their environment and removed many of these undesirables simply by patrolling every night, watching, observing and reporting to the Garda.  Many other estates will have to take upon themselves the same type of activity in conjunction with the Garda.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to implement the Bill as quickly as possible and to send out a message to people who are under serious threat in their communities that there is hope and something will be done.  We can promise people that when they come to our clinics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the general thrust of the Bill.  It is, as Deputies on all sides said, an important part of our armoury to tackle some very serious social problems.  So far nearly all of the Deputies who have spoken on this matter have been from Dublin and one could be forgiven for thinking that problems only exist in large housing estates in Dublin.  I would not deny the fact that the most serious drug-related problems arise in large urban estates but there are similar problems, although not on as great a scale, in housing estates in every town.</P>
      <P>Deputy Walsh referred to a woman who was repeatedly assaulted and threatened with a gun. Unfortunately, this happens not just in estates in Dublin but in estates in rural constituencies.  We all have had experience at various times of where the elderly, in particular, have been singled out, intimidated and frightened on a constant basis by thugs between the ages of 13, 14 and 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the problem not even being tackled at present?  Fianna Fáil in Government with the Labour Party introduced the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, which was regarded by Opposition Members who are now in Government as draconian, and we were criticised for doing so.  We were told by the Garda at the time that they needed those powers to move people on, take drink away from them in public places and question them when they were found gathered together intimidating people or shouting abuse.  It would be interesting to know the number of prosecutions which were brought under that Act.  The only case I recall was one which was brought against Youth Defence because it received a certain notoriety.  This legislation could be deemed draconian.  People who support the Bill realise that if, when enacted, it was abused, it would cause serious problems.  They accept the need for it, but realise problems could arise if <Col N="373" /> some officials were over-diligent.  Why was the Public Order Act not used in cases such as those cited by Deputy Walsh and in a case I learned of recently where an elderly tenant in a housing estate in my constituency was being consistently harassed by three or four young people?  Are the gardaí using the Public Order Act and the armoury of other legislation available to them?</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill which contains many positive measures that will help to alleviate problems experienced currently in housing estates throughout the country.  It may be construed from my contribution that I question some of the provisions of the Bill.  However, I generally welcome it although I have some criticisms and doubts about its constitutionality.  If I had an hour to make my contribution, I could give a balanced presentation of my views, but in the short time available I wish to raise doubts and fears about it, particularly its constitutionality.  I have studied the Bill in some detail.  I hope it will not be construed from my contribution that I am being negative about the Minister of State's measure. We have one shot at introducing this legislation, if we do not get it right and the Bill is referred by the President to the Supreme Court or if it is challenged and brought through the courts when the first case is brought under it, it might be struck down and that would make matters worse. It is in that spirit I make my comments.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Gregory and other Members who have greater experience than I in this area said, this legislation is urgently needed.  The trampling by the rotten apples in the barrels on the rights of the many hundreds of local authority tenants throughout the country must be addressed.  While the Bill may be popular and could be described as a populist measure, I want to ensure we do not go too far and end up with it being struck down and being back to square one.  The popular opinion may be that this is a wonderful Bill which will solve all the problems in this area.  However, as legislators, we have a duty to take a cold hard look at the legislation and make judgments on it. I may disagree with the Minister of State on some points and she may disagree with me on others. The legislation is a matter of judgment.  When the Bill is passed by this House, it will not matter what the Minister or I think.  It is what the courts what the Minister or I think.  It is what the courts and the lawyers think that will count.</P>
    <P>In the case of the ethics in public office Bill, the Minister indicated in good faith in reply to a question put to her that the provisions of the Bill would not apply to a particular item, but we were subsequently told by the Attorney General that it does.  I am anxious to ensure that the Bill when passed will work, be effective and do the job we all want it to do.  We must ensure it is constitutional and that it will not fall at the first hurdle. For the measures in the Bill, which are undoubtedly welcome in most cases, to be effective, they must be constitutional.</P>
    <P>We realise that all legislation infringes somebody's rights.  In passing legislation we try to balance the conflicting rights and individual rights <Col N="374" /> with the common good.  The validity of any legislative steps to balance those conflicting rights has been considered by the Supreme Court and other courts in many cases.  The Supreme Court judgment on the TF <i>v</i>.  Ireland, the Attorney General and MF 1995 which dealt with the constitutionality of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, states that in a challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute in the enactment of which the Oireachtas has been engaged in balancing rights, the role of the courts was to determine from an objective stance whether the balance contained in the impugned legislation was so contrary to reason and fairness as to constitute an unjust attack on some person's constitutional rights.  It also states that none of the personal rights of citizens was unlimited and that the decision of the Oireachtas on the reconciliation of the exercise of personal rights with the common good should prevail unless it was oppressive to some or all of the citizens or unless there was no reasonable proportion between the benefit which the legislation would confer on the citizens or on a substantial body of them and the interference with the personal rights of the citizens.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Supreme Court judgment that citizens do not enjoy unlimited rights.  It is also clear that those rights are delimited by the Oireachtas.  That limitation must not be unjust and must be in proportion to the object to be achieved.  The issue is not what we consider is proportionate, it is what the courts will consider proportionate.  I accept what the Minister of State said in that regard.  The Bill must contain a stricter definition of anti-social behaviour.  All the previous speakers agree that the problem of anti-social behaviour is drug-related.  I accept the definition and explanation given by the Minister of State in that regard, but it is does not appear to be clearly set out in the Bill.  The section defining anti-social behaviour and estate management should be reconsidered and tightened up.  The definition in the Bill is non-exhaustive.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it is not her intention that drug addicts should be treated in the same manner as drug dealers, but the Bill, as drafted, could be interpreted differently by the Supreme Court or other courts.  It provides for the eviction of addicts and the loss of supplementary welfare allowance.  We must ensure that is set out clearly in the Bill.  The Minister of State did not hear the earlier part of my contribution, but I am sure her officials will tell her what I said about striking the right balance.  She clearly set out her intention in her speech.  I am referring specifically to how the courts might interpret the Bill.</P>
    <P>Many drug addicts are victims.  The current definition is so broad there is a danger they could be further victimised.  Other Members referred to problems which could arise following the eviction of dealers and said it could lead to homelessness, etc.  I suggest that the definitions be tightened to overcome possible problems in respect of legal challenges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> In section 1 (1) (b), the definition of anti-social behaviour includes other matters likely to cause offence to neighbours.  That is acceptable if it is placed in the context referred to by the Minister of State, but I do not believe the definition is sufficiently clear.  The section could inadvertently give local authority housing officials a general and unwanted policing role.  The Bill should adhere to its intended remit in respect of drug related activities.  I received legal advice which stated that the Bill does not focus sufficiently on drug related activities and its definitions are not clear.  The definition relating to anti-social behaviour should be tightened.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to anti-social behaviour occurring in the vicinity of or adjacent to local authority housing estates.  How will this be policed?  The Bill does not provide any clues in this regard and I fail to see the practicality, need or appropriateness of this provision in respect of local authorities that have no jurisdiction in estates that are not under their control. Will the Minister of State clarify the position?</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with exclusion orders.  In a welcome new approach, a tenant may apply for an exclusion order against an individual on the basis of anti-social behaviour.  A local authority can do likewise on the grounds of anti-social behaviour and good estate management.  It is not clear whether section 3 deals with drug dealers and drug related offences and the position should be clarified.  The fact that a housing authority can seek an exclusion order on the basis of good estate management also introduces some uncertainty. Estate management includes the securing and promotion of tenants' interests.  Who determines the criteria for &ldquo;securing and promotion&ldquo;? That definition is very general and an application for an exclusion order need not be concerned with drug related issues.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it achieves its objectives.  I have fears about various sections to which I referred and also section 4 and others. The Minister of State will receive full co-operation from this side of the House.  We will table amendments to try to improve the Bill because we want to ensure, when enacted, the legislation will stand up to constitutional challenge and have the desired effect for communities experiencing these problems.  I give the Minister of State categorical assurance that we will co-operate with her.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to applaud my party colleague for presenting this Bill to the House.  Drug addiction and lawlessness of frightening proportions have wreaked havoc on communities in the inner city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on introducing the Bill and listening to the views of those Members who work closely with constituents.  I welcome the fact that we now have something to show to the brave community leaders in some of the housing estates and flat complexes to which other Members referred.  These people should <Col N="376" /> have thrown in the towel long before now but they continue to fight for the quality of life to which everyone is entitled.  They have been fighting an uphill battle.</P>
    <P>I have vivid memories of the Rathland Flats complex in Crumlin which stood for 35 years.  By any standard, this was a fine, low density public housing scheme reminiscent of duplex accommodation. The estate was destroyed by the inability of Dublin Corporation to manage it and the fact that it was tenanted by a small minority of anti-social criminal elements.  When these families were accommodated by the local authority in the complex, it rapidly went downhill.  The criminal element demanded fees from those being placed in vacant flats by the local authority.  If these were not paid, the flats were vandalised and toilet bowls and sink units were smashed.  This resulted in Dublin Corporation relocating tenants and demolishing the site.</P>
    <P>If this legislation had been enacted many years ago by Fianna Fáil, which was in power for extended periods, there would have been no need for Dublin Corporation to demolish N Block in Fatima Mansions.  It is interesting to note that in certain cases the local authority, with Government sanction, has attempted to rebuild, refurbish and provide tenants with a satisfactory quality of life, to some degree.  Some of these projects have been very successful and I compliment Dublin Corporation on the work carried out at Marrowbone Lane Flats.  This is a shining example and should be copied by other local authorities.</P>
    <P>However, there are other complexes where up to £6 million of taxpayers' money was invested. Without mentioning the site in question, a vast amount of the excellent work carried out has been undone and approximately 50 to 70 flats are vacant and have been boarded up.  These places went downhill because of the inability of the landlords, in this case Dublin Corporation, to deal adequately with elements who engaged in anti-social and illegal behaviour, costing the taxpayer in excess of £6 million.  We are left with the job of rebuilding a community there.  It is against this backdrop that taxpayers ultimately pick up the tab in the absence of a strong landlord dealing in a fair and authoritative way with deviants who happen to be their tenants.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill the Minister of State said that it will assist local authorities to discharge their estate management functions in a positive manner so that all local authority tenants may reasonably aspire to living in an estate that is free from drug dealing and associated violence.  That is all we are looking for.  We want to give every one of our tenants the right to coexist peacefully with their fellow tenants.</P>
    <P>This Bill is but one element of a total package, a very successful programme, that has been put together during the short lifetime of this Government. It is worth reflecting on the achievements of the Government.  It is the first Government to seriously tackle the issue of drugs.  It is quite outrageous &mdash; it will not be long before the political <Col N="377" /> historians begin to write the history books &mdash; that Fianna Fáil did nothing to tackle the heroin epidemic that has been festering since the mid 1980s. This Government has made £10 million available to the area partnership drugs task forces.  The creation of these task forces and the funding of projects they designate are a phenomenal achievement, as is the increased funding which has been made available to the statutory and voluntary agencies, including the Eastern Health Board, Community Response, Merchants Quay Centres and other agencies that are tackling the drugs issue, and the most recent allocation of £3 million which is being matched by the local authorities, making it £6 million, to enable environmental improvement works to be carried out in flat complexes and housing estates that are afflicted by the drugs problem.  This money will play an important role in enhancing the physical quality of these complexes and estates, and I applaud the Minister for working so hard and targeting those areas that are in such need of environmental improvement.</P>
    <P>I also applaud the Government on the incredible strides it has made in tackling criminals at the upper end of the market and on the massive successes to date of the Criminal Assets Bureau of which everybody should be proud.  I congratulate the new Garda Commissioner and his assistant, who has charge of policing in Dublin, on the relative success to date of Operation Dóchas.</P>
    <P>This Bill is another element of an integrated approach to the drugs crisis in this city.  It is important to applaud the Government for responding so positively to the frustration, anger and tragic loss of so many communities plagued by the problems of addiction.  I do not applaud vigilantes.  I applaud communities who, in hail, rain and snow, peacefully patrol their estates in an attempt to keep drug pushers out and protect the lives of their children.  Everyone who marched was not a vigilante or a member of the provisional IRA.  The majority of people who took to the streets around Dolphin House, Maryland in Cork Street and other areas were honest, decent citizens who were expressing their anger in the only way they could at being, to a large degree, betrayed by the establishment.  Unfortunately their frustration and anger got some of them into trouble with the police.  This would probably not have happened had this legislation been passed sooner.  The frustration in these communities stems from the physical presence of thugs and gangsters in their areas who were clever enough to use the law for their own benefit when the local authority moved against them. Notwithstanding notices to quit or ejectment notices, they were able to hang on for at least 12 more months plying their trade in drugs.  This legislation is important because it will empower landlords, in our case Dublin Corporation, to act affirmatively and quickly.</P>
    <P>Tenants who are behaving in an anti-social manner will have choices.  They will be quickly confronted with the choice of whether to behave <Col N="378" /> themselves in a civilised manner or be evicted and possibly be homeless as a result.  If they are to reform their behaviour, however, it is important that the other statutory agencies have treatment services in place to help them.  If they are to comply with acceptable basic standards of behaviour, they will have to be encouraged, if they are on drugs, to give them up.  With the developments that are taking place in local authority estates and with Dublin Corporation becoming involved in a more sophisticated way in estate management, there is greater bonding between community activists, the Garda Síochána and Dublin Corporation. This augurs well for the future of communities but not for those deviant tenants who wish to destroy the quality of life of other tenants.</P>
    <P>There is another very important reason to support this Bill.  There are no greenfield sites left within the city boundaries.  Therefore, Dublin Corporation has to buy houses on the open market. Because of the bad public image of local authority tenants, there is understandable fear among people that if the corporation buys a house in their estate the tenant will be a drug dealer or pusher.  This could not be further from the truth.  The vast majority of local authority tenants, although not capable of purchasing their own house on the open market, are honest, decent citizens, and this Bill is aimed at the gurrier element that is giving them a bad name.  When Dublin Corporation or other local authorities purchase houses in private housing estates it is important to be able to tell concerned neighbours that, with the passing of this legislation, they are more secure having a local authority tenant as a neighbour than somebody who buys the house privately, possibly with the proceeds of drug dealing.</P>
    <P>An encouraging and important section of the Bill deals with the eviction of squatters.  People can squat in a newly built corporation house for six months while the legal process to remove them takes effect.  They can leave before the sheriff arrives and go to squat in another corporation house.  Some people are playing cat and mouse with Dublin Corporation by moving from one house to another.  The Bill empowers the Garda Síochána to move quickly against squatters.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not solve all the problems.  It may have a negative impact on the agencies that deal with homelessness.  The eviction and banning of local authority tenants coupled with the restriction on the availability of rent supplements will impinge on these agencies.  I am sympathetic to their case.  However, the primary purpose of this Bill is to guarantee, as far as it can be guaranteed, local authority tenants, many of whom pay substantial rents, that they will be allowed to live in reasonable security.</P>
    <P>After the enactment of this Bill, perhaps the Minister of State will establish a committee to monitor the requirements of agencies such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Salvation Army and the Eastern Health Board which operate night shelters.  There should be a mechanism <Col N="379" /> in place to monitor the effect of the Bill's provisions on homelessness.</P>
    <P>We are at one on this legislation.  We want decent people who pay substantial rents to local authorities to be allowed to sleep peacefully at night and not be subject to intimidation by a small gurrier element.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is designed to help local authorities deal effectively with problems caused by drug pushing and anti-social behaviour in their estates.  The current legislation in this regard which is used by the local authorities is ineffective as far as the eviction process is concerned.  More powers are needed.</P>
      <P>A case was brought to my attention recently where a drug dealer was openly selling drugs from a local authority house.  The parents in the vicinity were concerned and afraid.  I reported the matter to the housing estate management section of the local authority several times.  Unfortunately, no rapid action was taken and the drug dealer continued dealing.  The law is not effective and it is difficult to explain that to civic minded parents who were doing their duty in bringing the matter to the attention of a public representative and were fearful for their own safety.  I had to inform them that the matter had been reported but that nothing seemed to be have been done.</P>
      <P>In Dublin Corporation only a handful of cases relating to drug pushing come before the courts. A report outlining the procedure for the eviction of known drug pushers was considered by the housing committee of the corporation at the end of 1995.  It indicated that complaints were investigated by the housing estates section.  This means that a complaint has to be made in the first place which points up a weakness right away.  An investigation is then carried out in conjunction with Garda drug units.  The report indicated that there were 33 cases under investigation at the end of 1995 but only four cases of drug dealing had been brought before the courts.  I suggest that represents the tip of the iceberg.  The procedure seems to have been ineffective.  The report indicated that at the end of 1995 the corporation was awaiting court dates for six further cases and that the remaining 23 cases were at various stages of investigation.  Even the investigation procedure seems ineffective.</P>
      <P>Many people are unhappy about taking the first step of making a complaint about alleged drug pushing.  I understand that evidence must be given in court in order to secure a conviction.  It would be almost impossible to persuade people to give evidence in court in such a case.  Will the Minister of State indicate if people are required to give evidence in court?  Because of the nature of the cases this will present difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public representatives in urban areas come across horrendous cases of intimidation.  People or families who are well known in local authority estates can make life intolerable for their neighbours <Col N="380" /> by engaging in constant intimidation. Hopefully, the Bill will tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increasing involvement of communities in tackling the drug problem but I wonder if any action would have been taken if the communities had not demanded that something be done.  As the Minister of State said, there is a need for communities to build trust with the statutory authorities, particularly the Garda Síochána.  In some communities such trust does not exist.  I agree with Deputy Eric Byrne that the vast majority of people associated with the community anti-drug movement are honest and decent &mdash; a fact of which the statutory authorities should take cognisance.  Much work is needed to build up that trust.</P>
    <P>People often find it hard to understand why the Garda Síochána does not pursue small-time drug pushers.  People tell me the registration number of a car, van or motor cycle and the time it will arrive at a certain venue each evening.  I pass on that information to the Garda Síochána but nothing happens. The unofficial reason is that the Garda is not interested in the small people but wants to get at the big people.  I suspect that has changed under Operation Dóchas and, if so, it is welcome. Parents were infuriated that nothing was done about the small drug pusher on their street.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion on estate management. It took a long time for that concept to be accepted by local authorities, including Dublin Corporation which has brought forward the basis of an effective estate management system and has appointed 19 executive housing officers who will work closely with tenants and residents' associations, deal with all aspects of allocation, maintenance, cleansing and so on.  That is a most important development.  The aim should be cooperation, partnership and the utilisation of local knowledge.  The people sitting at desks in the civic offices in Dublin Corporation are not aware of who is who or what is what.  If the estate management system is to be effective, local knowledge, which can play an important part when it comes to allocations, will have to be fully utilised.</P>
    <P>I have great hope for the future.  A few years ago the concept of estate management was alien to bureaucrats who thought tenants' associations and communities were irritants and got in the way of their plans.  I am grateful that has changed and the concept of estate management has firmly taken route.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion about the estate improvement programme which the Minister announced recently.  We had a small hiccup in December 1996 when Dublin Corporation submitted a list of works, under the estate improvement programme, to the Department of the Environment costing over £5 million for which a grant of 50 per cent of the cost was sought.  The Department indicated in February 1997 it will make available a sum of only £1.25 million but this will be matched by Dublin Corporation bringing the total to £2.5 million for the programme <Col N="381" /> for the years 1997-8.  Dublin Corporation drew up a list of 40 flat complexes in need of improvement which would have been financed out of the £5 million.  Unfortunately the funding provided did not live up to expectations and only 14 flat complexes can be included in an estate improvement programme for 1997-8.  Many of the flat complexes in Ballybough lost out.  This demonstrates that much funding is needed to deal with estate improvement generally.  The programme which provides for the lighting of stairways, removal of graffiti, environmental works, cleansing, redesign and so on is welcome.  Money spent on these schemes can pay dividends later as flat complexes get older.</P>
    <P>So far as Dublin Corporation is concerned, mistakes have been made in the past in relation to an allocations policy.  Because of the insensitive nature of this policy and lack of thought in some parts of the city, ghettos have been created.  This is not a reflection on the people who live in these areas.  According to Deputy Ahern, large estates are not necessarily a problem but they have not helped in dealing with the drug problem and many problems of social exclusion associated with them.</P>
    <P>The tendency to allocate flats, maisonettes and even houses in certain areas to lone parents exclusively was not thought through.  The idea of a social mix was thrown out the window.  I do not want to mention particular estates, several of which are in my constituency.  In the past there had been a policy to allocate families of two to particular areas.  That did not make for strong community leadership, a balance of interests or a balance in community life generally.  It was a mistake and has finally been recognised as such.</P>
    <P>The £5,000 new house grant scheme caused problems in some of the same estates, to which I have referred, in that many community leaders left and hence were not available to initiate programmes and community activity.  We realise our mistakes and are attempting to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The refurbishment programme financed by the Department of the Environment has been a success, particularly in Darndale and in Dublin 17, albeit a slow process.  It has rescued community life in certain areas and has encouraged a sense of civic pride.  The initiative is welcome and the more funding that can be provided for refurbishment the better.</P>
    <P>Community spirit is important when dealing with drug pushing.  There is a lack of community spirit, a breakdown in parish life and families in urban areas and the statutory authorities must try to retrieve that situation.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work of FÁS, particularly community employment schemes which are at the centre of community life.  Many projects which would not normally have the finance required get under way and many voluntary organisations can utilise the community employment scheme.  The invaluable work they do is obvious to anyone who witnesses the scheme in operation.  I ask anybody who might try to reduce expenditure in that area <Col N="382" /> to view the situation on the ground.  Most active public representatives would be aware of that.</P>
    <P>We have received submissions from the Franciscan Social Justice Initiative, the Merchants Quay Project and Threshold, all of which were alarmed and disturbed by the Bill.  If we are to be successful we need to alleviate their concerns.  It is obvious that a Bill such as this is required but the points they make should be addressed.  Those involved in the Merchants Quay Project suggest that addicts need to engage in small scale drug dealing to feed their habit.  This is alarming as the problem moves quickly from being one of drug user to drug pusher.  All forms of drug pushing are wrong and there must be zero tolerance of this problem.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's views on this point.</P>
    <P>It also states that the level of proof in regard to anti-social behaviour is very low.  This point is repeated in all the submissions I received.  It is even suggested that in some cases proof is on the basis of hearsay.  If this is the case it is unacceptable.  Concern has also been expressed that the legislation will lead to an increase in homelessness.  I welcome the Bill but if people working in disadvantaged areas believe certain provisions need to be reconsidered then we should listen to them.</P>
    <P>I am glad it will no longer be necessary to evict all the members of a family.  Some vigilante groups operating in the city &mdash; I am not referring to the community groups to which I alluded earlier &mdash; may wrongly blame innocent people who happen to be related to a drug pusher.  Most reasonable people would agree that this is unacceptable and an entire family should not be tarnished because of one person.</P>
    <P>On the exchange of information between State agencies, we are learning from our mistakes.  The example given of the Eastern Health Board paying a rent supplement to a drug pusher who had been evicted by a local authority highlights this point.  I welcome the provisions on the exchange of information between agencies.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to a possible constitutional challenge to the legislation.  The editorial in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> on 16 February stated that the Bill may breach Article 40 of the Constitution.  I disagree with many of the points made in that editorial.  For example, it states that adequate powers are in place to deal with the problem but is obvious to those working on the ground that the laws dealing with anti-social behaviour are inadequate.  I hope there is no constitutional challenge and that the legislation will be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There are long delays in bringing cases involving the eviction of alleged offenders before the courts.  People do not understand why it can take so long to deal with a problem, and one of the reasons for this is the delays in the courts.  This is a major issue which must be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>A large number of organisations have submitted detailed presentations in <Col N="383" /> which they set out their objections to certain provisions of the Bill.  I have received submissions from Threshold, the Merchants Quay Project and the Franciscan Social Justice Initiative.  They believe that the severe sanctions in the Bill will further marginalise homeless people and lead to a significant increase in the demand for housing by the voluntary housing agencies.  They also refer to the possibility of eviction cases being brought before the courts on the basis of inadequate proof and the refusal of health authorities to pay a rent supplement.</P>
      <P>For the past decade I have been working on behalf of people in need of housing, while for the past five years I have predominantly represented people in local authority housing estates.  It would be very informative for some of the authors of the submissions I received to visit certain parts of my constituency at night time to see at first hand the terrible lawlessness, vandalism, serious harassment and intimidation of some citizens.  Drug related crimes account for a major part of this problem but they do not account for all of it.  In many cases, families are harassed merely because the head of the household is a lone parent or is a member of a different race or because one of the children has a disability.  A culture of intimidation can build up around such households.</P>
      <P>The perpetrators are usually small in number and it is long past time action was taken to deal with them.  The sanctions proposed in the Bill are necessary, even if they are severe.  The authors of editorials in Sunday newspapers usually live in middle-class suburbs and they have no idea what it is like to live in areas where there is intense and terrible suffering.  We have a responsibility to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>In some cases the number of ringleaders in drug feuds and crime is very small.  For example, a deviant family or a family with a few dysfunctional members can wreak havoc on up to 1,000 families, while an area the size of Arklow can be badly affected by a few such families.  Unlike the authors of some of the submissions I received, I do not expect the legislation to lead to a massive increase in homelessness.  If the sanctions proposed in the Bill are used to deal with seriously deviant families many areas will be relieved of major problems.  In many cases the threat of these sanctions will bring people to their senses.</P>
      <P>The cases made in some of the submissions should be addressed.  Some years ago, the Dublin Corporation housing welfare officer proposed that vigorous action be taken to deal with a number of anti-social individuals and families and that health boards and educational agencies concentrate their resources on measures to help them. He then proposed to rehouse them in a normal local authority setting.  Competent local authority officials have given much thought to this.  They have asked what can be done with grossly dysfunctional, anti-social people who cause intense suffering and hassle for their neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should be able to explore certain <Col N="384" /> solutions with the better housing departments in our local authorities.  As Deputy Haughey said, public representatives have also been queried as to whether the requirement of proof under this Bill will be small, thus swinging the pendulum too far against an anti-social householder.  At present, the resources of the legal system weigh in the opposite direction.  The housing department of Dublin Corporation tried over the years to evict people on anti-social grounds.  It has evicted a number of families involved in drug pushing. However, the legal system operated in such a way as to make this task almost impossible.  This Bill will redress the balance.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, on bringing it forward.  It is one of a number of measures, including the Children Bill, 1996 and the estate management programme, being brought forward as a response to a rapidly deteriorating situation.  This legislation could have been passed ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  It would have been appropriate in the mid 1980s but our predecessors blithely carried on and the concerns of urban areas were totally ignored and neglected.  I say that as somebody who was a community worker and activist in the early to mid 1980s. Intense anti-social behaviour went virtually unpunished and very good people, including community leaders, were forced to leave their localities because of this grotesque behaviour.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the Labour Party formed a coalition with Fine Gael, the Workers Party, the community group and the Green Party on Dublin City Council and drew up a civic charter with them.  One of its demands was for estate management. The city was crying out for that.  We visited various estates at night to attend party or community meetings.  Our cars were wrecked, rocks were thrown at houses, people wearing balaclavas broke into houses but for some reason nobody seemed to take any action.</P>
    <P>There are many associated problems in the city's estates which have contributed to the climate of crime which we must address.  The most fundamental problem is the appalling design of many local authority estates.  The architects of one or two important estates on the northside with huge populations should probably have spent five or ten years in jail so appallingly stupid and foolish were the designs.  It is impossible for people to live in safety.  There are no secure spaces.  This happened in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  The late Deputy Neil Blaney sanctioned one of these schemes when he was Minister for Local Government.  I met him when he visited the scheme and pointed out that the design of the estates was appalling.  At long last we have learned from that.</P>
    <P>Bureaucracy was centralised at local government level.  I congratulate the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State who have introduced their programme on better local government.  It is under discussion at present by all local authorities.  For the first time, the need <Col N="385" /> for full time politicians at local level is addressed. It allows for aspiring politicians to have a full time career at local level which would give them control over what happens in their communities.</P>
    <P>All aspects of housing were dealt with in Jervis Street in Dublin or in the civic offices but no resources were available in the estates.  They were let go to rack and ruin over the years.  There were other ancillary problems, such as massive unemployment. A number of Deputies mentioned the attempts of partnerships and other local bodies over the past ten or 12 years to deal with this. Massive industrial zones were designated on the northside of Dublin while estates with huge unemployment rates were built beside them.</P>
    <P>In regard to drug related crime in local authority estates, a constant refrain heard at the recent Drugs in Dublin conference organised by Dublin Corporation was the fact that so many schools were able to expel students, particularly in junior classes at second level schools.  Children were on the streets with nothing to do other than get into serious mischief and eventually serious crime.  This area needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>We have had poor policing in Dublin.  It is only recently that the community Garda programme was introduced.  Resources in Dublin were often stretched.  Up to 70 per cent of gardaí are stationed outside the capital even though 70 per cent of all crime is committed there.  It is ludicrous. The community gardaí programme, including Operation Dóchas, did not receive enough resources.  In my constituency there are a few hundred gardaí trying to look after 80,000 people. This area needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>A number of sections will improve the likelihood of processing evictions where serious deviant and anti-social behaviour takes place.  There have been a number of such evictions over the past year.  There are grave difficulties associated with this but Dublin Corporation, under its new city manager, operates a policy whereby complainants will not have to face the people about whom they complaint in court.  This Bill strengthens that immeasurably and will be another important weapon in the corporation's armoury.</P>
    <P>Anti-social behaviour, which is defined in section 1, is often displayed by a teenager or young adult in a family who, for whatever reason, is totally out of control and making matters extremely difficult for the rest of the family.  They are often involved in drug related crime.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is welcome in that it provides for the issuing of exclusion and interim orders.  I welcome also the sections which provide for action to be taken against people who contravene such orders. In that respect the Bill provides some recourse for families suffering the effects of the anti-social behaviour of another member of the family.</P>
    <P>Under section 14 the various State agencies will be required to provide the necessary information to the housing authority.  That is a major weakness in the current legislation in regard to taking steps towards eviction.  Housing authorities must have all relevant information from health boards, <Col N="386" /> the Garda and the various voluntary bodies when making such decisions.</P>
    <P>A key aspect of the Bill is the provision for putting in place an effective system of estate management. I thank the Minister of State for the efforts she has made over the past two years in encouraging local authorities to establish such a system.  Dublin Corporation, under our new City Manager, John Fitzgerald, has finally put in place a system on various local authority estates around the city; approximately 40 now have their own manager and the larger estates have offices.  In the past, householders were intimidated and parts of estates were used to sell drugs, but estate managers can now liaise with the Garda, the health boards and even public representatives to deal with such problems before resorting to the powers under this legislation, which should only be used as a last resort.</P>
    <P>Estate management is in operation in Dublin and is working well.  Estate management committees have been given the power to screen new tenants.  It is appropriate that local estates, including the Kilmore estate in my constituency, know who is about to take up residency in their areas. Criminals or people with a history of anti-social behaviour should not be given local authority housing.  The developments we have made towards a partnership on the ground are essential.</P>
    <P>I welcome the sections dealing with the powers in relation to supplementary welfare allowances and rent supplements.  Budgetary problems arose over the years with section 16 which deals with reductions in respect of housing authority rents. Money could be deducted for unemployment assistance but not for some of the social welfare payments.  The Minister of State is to be congratulated on that.</P>
    <P>The Bill is one of a large number of measures we must take to end the appalling anti-social behaviour and drug related crime which has made the lives of so many of our fellow citizens, particularly on the north side of Dublin, unbearable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seldom find myself in almost complete agreement with Deputy Broughan; I do not agree with his view on local communities vetting prospective tenants.  I agree entirely with his comments on this measure and I congratulate the Minister of State on introducing it.</P>
      <P>I am baffled as to the reason such a measure was not introduced a long time ago.  The Labour Party has been in Government longer than my party in the past 25 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so we all must take a share of the blame for the failure to initiate this legislation. This is the first time Democratic Left has been in Government, and it is seldom I find myself congratulating its members on their policy positions, but I must on this occasion.  The Minister <Col N="387" /> is brave to introduce the legislation in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker gave a good analysis of some of the submissions made to us by those who have reservations about this measure.  I understand those reservations, but anybody who spends more than 30 minutes in a local authority housing estate will know the views of the residents who live in these areas and the terrible traumas they endure, so well described by Deputy Broughan. We must address that problem and enable people to build their own communities in those districts. We cannot do that without using the big stick as well as the carrot.  I assume that is the purpose of this measure although I know the Minister of State is interested in providing the carrot, particularly in this election year.</P>
      <P>The Minister will not want to be remembered for introducing a big stick measure but it was necessary.  There were deficiencies in the existing arrangements and the Bill attempts to address them.  Any Bill of this type must be scrutinised with great care because, as legislators, we must draw a balance between the social interests that exist in addressing the drugs problem and the long-standing problem of nuisance created by tenants in local authority estates and other tenants who do not have the means to take a law suit to deal with it.  Those tenants looked to the local authorities to deal with this problem but they were unable to do so for many years.</P>
      <P>This measure is part of the response to the drugs problem.  Last summer we saw local communities taking their own initiatives to exclude persons from their areas.  It happened most noticeably in the north inner city, in west Tallaght and, to a more muted extent, in Clondalkin. Those communities were desperate because drug dealers were openly selling drugs in their districts and acting as the pillars of a drugs culture. Decent, law abiding people in those districts were unable to deal with these people.  They were fearful for the safety of their families and concerned about the lack of moral example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was a difficult measure to draft.  I asked the Taoiseach about it on the Order of Business on one or two occasions and he told me it would be brought forward at the beginning of the parliamentary term last September.  That has not been possible but the reason was obvious on reading the Bill.  It is difficult to draw a balance.  The main objective of the Bill is to deal with the problem of drug pushing but it is clear that there was also abuse of the rent allowance scheme and mortgage interest supplement.  Perhaps the Minister might indicate where the end lies in that regard.  If a person is evicted from a local authority house and, as the Bill provides, is refused rent allowance by the health board, where does the person go? How does that square with the right of the homeless enshrined in earlier legislation?  There appears to be a contradiction between this and previous legislation dealing with the rights of the homeless.  While I do not wish to strike too close <Col N="388" /> to the bone on this matter, the Minister must address this practical problem.</P>
    <P>The social pattern of life in this city has become well established in recent years.  As a result of voluntary action by local communities, many drug pushers and suppliers have been excluded from local authority estates.  Some of them have resettled in private houses and receive rent allowance and, in extreme cases, mortgage interest supplement from the State.  If they are deprived of that benefit where will they go?  This is a difficult question for the Minister to address.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the service of summonses. I have some reservations about the way section 2 (1) (a) has been formulated in regard to a substituted service of a summons.  This is essentially a matter for the courts.  Provision is made in the Rules of Court and most well drawn up legal enactments to allow a court to permit substituted service in an appropriate case.  I am not sure it is appropriate for the Legislature to determine what is appropriate for substituted service.  This subsection appears to prescribe the circumstances in which a substituted service by ordinary post, instead of by registered post, would be appropriate. The circumstances in which service is effected are best left to the courts.  Would a more general provision simply enabling a court to direct substituted service be more appropriate in that subsection? I am not sure it needs to be drafted with such prolixity.  Will the Minister address this matter on Committee Stage?</P>
    <P>The heart of the legislation is contained in section 3 which provides for exclusion orders. While there is a major difference, an analogy has been drawn here with matrimonial barring orders.  When a person applies for a barring order he or she wants the other party out of the family home.  In this case there is no assurance that any party wants to leave the family home.  The language of section 3 was also borrowed from the legislation dealing with barring orders in that the court must believe reasonable grounds exist for believing a person has engaged in anti-social behaviour.  That is a reasonable criterion.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations also about section 4(3) which provides that an interim excluding order may be made <i>ex parte</i>.  There may be extreme cases where it would be necessary to apply for an interim excluding order, but should this be done on an <i>ex parte</i> basis?  Under section 4(3) a local authority can apply for an interim order and remove a person from a local authority house without notifying the person concerned. While it could be argued that the courts will prevent abuse of the powers conferred on local authorities, this is a far reaching requirement. Even the Almighty gave Adam and Eve a hearing before excluding them from the Garden of Eden. Is it wise to provide in legislation for the exclusion of a person <i>ex parte</i>?  The sections dealing with the effect of orders, the effect of appeal from order and the discharge of orders are necessary in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Under section 11 proceedings may be heard <Col N="389" /> otherwise than in public, a topical subject at present.  The general constitutional presumption is that citizens should know what is being transacted in their name in the courts of justice.  I did not hear the Minister of State justifying why a court should be allowed to hear these proceedings in private.  While it may be necessary to hear sensitive cases involving family or matrimonial matters in private, when relaxing evidential standards it is important that matters are dealt with in public so that it can have confidence in the system.  Private justice can often lead to a loss of confidence in the administration of justice. I am sure the Minister of State, like all other Members, receives a large number of representations from persons who have been aggrieved as a result of matrimonial proceedings.  It is often difficult to reassure people in this regard because, for obvious reasons, matrimonial proceedings are transacted in private.  However, if proceedings are administered in private under this legislation, will the public gradually develop a lack of confidence in the system?  Will the Minister reconsider her decision to allow judges to hear proceedings otherwise than in public?</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the letting and sale of local authority houses when drug suppliers are excluded from them.  In exercising its powers under this legislation, a local authority can refuse to let a house to a person who is engaged in anti-social behaviour.  Does an actual court order or finding have to be made before that subsection comes into play or are local authorities given complete discretion in this matter?  Can they claim they consider a person has been or is engaged in anti-social behaviour?  We should question if a local authority should be given power to do that without even a right of appeal. While I understand the administrative sense in allowing local authorities to make an initial determination in such a matter, as we are depriving a person of the right to participate in social housing, the person affected must have some form of inexpensive redress, other than High Court proceedings, by way of judicial review.</P>
    <P>The same provision extends to tenant purchase dwellings.  Subsection (3) states that the housing authority may refuse to consent to the sale of a dwelling on the basis of anti-social behaviour.  I fail to understand the thinking behind this.  A tenant purchaser should be entitled to an equity of redemption.  I do not understand the legal basis under which a local authority can refuse to let a tenant purchaser pay off a mortgage and sell the house.  I fail to understand why we are still referring to the possibility of providing for this in legislation when it is technically not possible.  Once one becomes a tenant purchaser, one has a mortgage and an equity of redemption.  Will the Minister address that matter in her reply?</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision dealing with the exchange of information between various authorities. Section 15 deals with the supplementary welfare allowance procedures that will be inserted in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) <Col N="390" /> Act, 1993.  It also deals with the abuse of supplementary welfare allowance by way of rent or mortgage interest.  I assume the normal procedures under the Social Welfare Act will apply in the case of a dispute.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion about evidence to prove that a person has been or is engaged in anti-social behaviour.  The Offences Against the State Act, 1972 included a provision dealing with unlawful membership of an illegal organisation and in the case of a prosecution a Garda officer above a certain rank was entitled to give an opinion as to whether a person was a member of an illegal organisation.  Under this legislation designated officers have also been given the power to say if they believe a person is engaging or has engaged in anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>This section addresses a serious problem.  I have received countless representations down the years from people living in local authority estates who were in great fear of giving testimony in proceedings. Perhaps the Minister will consider whether the section should be restricted to members of the Garda Síochána who are more familiar with the procedure of giving evidence in the courts than are, for example, health board officers.  The gardaí are used to giving evidence and are perhaps better aware of the nuances of imparting information to a court.  A court applying the section will be very scrupulous in inquiring into the basis for the belief asserted by the officer giving evidence.  I do not share the concern expressed by some Members about the section because those who express an opinion may be cross-examined about their beliefs.  Under the section certain opinions will be admissible as evidence, but the courts will not be compelled to consider such evidence.</P>
    <P>The measure also deals with more general misbehaviour, which is defined in subsection (1) as any behaviour which causes or is likely to cause any significant or persistent danger, injury, damage, loss or fear to any person living or residing in the vincinity.  I wonder if that definition is too complicated.  What we are talking about is nuisance. For those living in private houses, under civil law if one's neighbour is guilty of behaviour which amounts to a nuisance, that person may be sued.  The same principle applies in local authority estates, but persons residing in local authority estates generally do not have the wherewithal to bring private law actions against neighbours who are guilty of persistent misbehaviour, a problem that has become very extensive in some local authority estates.</P>
    <P>Surely the solution is to provide for nuisance as the grounds upon which the courts may exercise power under this measure.  Is it necessary to use all the words included in section 1 (1) (b)?  In that subsection we are setting different standards for residents of local authority estates from those for residents of private estates.  The standard of goods neighbourliness should be the same regardless of whether one lives in a private or a local authority estate.  For those living in local authority estates <Col N="391" /> there is an expeditious, inexpensive procedure whereby the local authority, as landlord, may enforce the law.</P>
    <P>This is a very interesting measure and I would like to have more time to discuss estate management. Estate management is a positive idea which has been referred to on many occasions since the plan for social housing was introduced by Mr. Flynn when Minister for the Environment.  Good estate management is about community building in local authority estates, and that philosophy must be applied.</P>
    <P>A number of decisions of recent years, for example, the surrender grant and, to a lesser extent, the shared mortgage arrangements, desirable as they are, have tended to strip local authority estates of natural community leadership. That is a problem that must be addressed.  We must encourage local co-operative arrangements in regard to environmental improvements.  We must consider international experiments where in some cases local authorities assign their rents to private contractors who provide the services in communities and we must provide funding for those purposes, but our philosophy should be guided by the principle of building up communities with locally based community leadership. Many problems have developed in the greater Dublin area as a result of lack of such leadership. We have all made mistakes in this area in the last few decades.  We should review our policies to see whether they tend towards that end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on behalf of the Green Party to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  The Bill addresses a serious oversight in legislation on local authority housing which allowed people to engage in anti-social behaviour.  It was brought about mainly as a result of the drugs epidemic, particularly drug dealings, and I take this opportunity to compliment the gardaí who last night made a significant drugs seizure in Dublin North. We all wish for success in that regard.  All of us have experience in our constituencies of drug-related problems and it is difficult to generalise the legislation because every case is different.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It allows local authorities to exclude a certain member or members of a household from inquiries in the event that one member is pushing drugs or is acting in an anti-social way. The withdrawal of supplementary welfare assistance in these cases is welcome, as is the provision that a court must decide, on a reasonable grounds, what is a valid case.  Local authorities have power under the Bill to turn down applicants who they believe have engaged in anti-social behaviour and who do not act in the interests of good estate management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of good estate management must be significantly tightened because at present it is open to interpretation.  While estate management courses are generally welcomed, will people be at a disadvantage by not taking part in such <Col N="392" /> courses and will addicts be penalised more than pushers?  Generally drug pushers appear compliant and socially amiable while addicts, who tend to appear dysfunctional, may present problems in terms of estate management.  The difficulties experienced by addicts in getting treatment must be addressed.  I am aware that is not within the remit of this Bill but it is vital the disadvantaged are not made more disadvantaged by ignoring the need for treatment for addicts.</P>
    <P>Greater emphasis should be placed on an appeals structure.  A person whose application is turned down should have recourse to appeal.  It is unacceptable that a local authority should issue a letter to a person without giving the reason for a decision.  The matter should be dealt with properly.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill which was moved last week by our justice spokesperson, Deputy O'Donnell.  I pay tribute to her for the work she has done to bring this matter to political attention.  She and Deputy O'Donoghue have sought, not just with the publication of this Bill but through parliamentary questions and contributions in this House, to make the Minister more accountable for the prison service.</P>
      <P>Some say we have a liberal prisons policy while others say it is illiberal.  However we have no prisons policy or strategy.  Many of us may have watched the television series on Mountjoy which concluded last Monday night.  We did not need to see that programme to realise our largest prison was in chaos and was unable to cope with the pressures put on it.  We did not need to see that film to know that people who go in drug free come out of Mountjoy suffering from drug addiction.  Perhaps allowing prisoners to use drugs is part of the political thinking or strategy of controlling the prisoners. The Minister opened up our prisons, almost throwing her hands in the air, to show the chaos there.  Many people did not need to have the prisons opened up to the realise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to distance the criminals and the prisoners from the crimes they have committed. If there was any fault in the production of that programme it was that it dissociated from awful crimes the prisoners and criminals who committed them.  Only people who have committed awful crimes go to jail unless there has been a serious miscarriage of justice.  There is no point telling an old woman who has been mugged, or a family whose house is constantly being broken into or a person who has been threatened with a syringe that the assailant came from a poor background or that, as the Minister of State at the Department <Col N="393" /> of Justice, Deputy Burton, suggested last night, we should understand that they commit crimes because of the economic circumstances in which they grew up.  The vast majority of poor people do not commit crimes.  I find it objectionable when I hear Labour Party Deputies and a Minister in particular speak about some of these criminals in a way that would almost justify what they have done because of the circumstances in which they grew up.</P>
    <P>If, instead of abolishing water charges at a cost of £60 million to save the Minister of State's seat &mdash; that was the main reason they were abolished &mdash; the Government had spent the money on some of the deprived areas in her constituency, it would have achieved a great deal more than it will achieve to the maintain her Dáil seat in Dublin West. That only became Government policy subsequent to the fright she got in the by-election.</P>

      <P>Some 4,000 people are released early from jail every year.  Why?  Some 4,500 prisoners are let out on temporary release.  Why?  It costs £45,000 to keep a prisoner in jail and £90,000 to keep one in Portlaoise.  Why?  It costs £22,000 in Britain and £13,500 in France.  It costs £700 a week to keep somebody in an open prison. Why?  We have more prison officers than prisoners in Ireland.  Why?  The reason is we do not have a prison strategy or policy.  Until such time as we take the prison service away from the Department of Justice and set it up as an autonomous executive body, with a separate directive, and until we give it targets and monitor its performance, we will not get value for the money the taxpayers currently spend on our outdated prison system which cannot cope.</P>
      <P>After the unspeakable murder of journalist Veronica Guerin, we saw action on crime from the Government when it finally agreed to hold the referendum on bail.  After the Judge Dominic Lynch debacle, we got a commitment from the Taoiseach that an independent prison and court service would be established within a week.  We are still waiting to see the legislation to establish that.  If an Opposition party with limited resources can produce such a Bill, then I cannot understand why the Government, with all its backup, has not been able to bring forward this legislation.  It is obviously not a priority.  The law-abiding people want to see those who commit serious crimes serve their full sentences.  They want to see a prison system which can cope with our serious crime problem.  Until we have an independent prisons executive we will not achieve what people want us to achieve on their behalf.</P>

      <P>I grudgingly welcome the introduction of this legislation.  However, I suspect Deputy O'Donnell's motives for introducing it because the Bill's provisions have already been taken on board by the Government.  The Minister indicated that the expert group has been established to make recommendations on the establishment of an independent prisons board on a statutory basis and that its report will be published by the end of the month.  The Progressive Democrats are trying to score political points.</P>

      <P>That is a shame.  In the other House the Progressive Democrats have enunciated further proposals, the cost of which would be significant, while in this House Deputy Molloy proposed that the enormous sum of £23 million should be spent on a group water scheme.  They have, at the same time, accused the Government of being spendthrift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Justice on introducing in the summer of last year, at a cost of £60 million, the most significant package of security measures in the past two decades.  She has provided for a drug free zone in Mountjoy Prison and a drug treatment centre in the training unit. She has drawn up plans for a new 60 unit women's prison, the money for which has been provided.  A new 400 unit remand prison is to be opened at Wheatfield.  It is a scandal that we have no means of separating those who have not been tried from those convicted of serious offences. <Col N="395" /> Extra places have been provided at the Curragh and at Castlerea Prison which is to be expanded, while extra accommodation is to be provided at Limerick Prison.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister on allowing cameras into Mountjoy Prison for the first time to produce programmes of quality.  These were followed by newspaper articles and live radio interviews.  Last summer a Labour Party delegation visited the prison.  It was the first party to send a delegation.  Every other party should do likewise and on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>In the mid-1960s the prison population stood at 400 on average.  It now stands at 2,200, which represents a fivefold increases.  Its profile has also changed.  Instead of petty larceny, prostitution, robbery and assault, the vast majority are now serving sentences for drug related and sexual offences.</P>
      <P>The key problem is that it is virtually impossible for a Department as large as the Department of Justice, which is responsible for formulating policy and all other areas of the criminal justice system, including the Garda Síochána and the courts, to run the prison system, given its complexity. It has attempted to do so, however, in a secretive and jealous fashion.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a proper management structure which is both effective and accountable.  The chief executive officer or director of the proposed independent prison service should have the necessary authority to implement policy.  Prison governors should also have a role.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not deliver the goods.  I, therefore, await the introduction of the legislation announced by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prison reform has never been a particularly popular issue.  As far back as 1985, the Whitaker report cognitively analysed the problems of the penal system.  Yet, nothing was done.  For seven long years, from 1987 to 1994, Fianna Fáil ran the country.  For three of those years it was joined by the Progressive Democrats.  Yet, it implemented no significant changes in the penal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that the Opposition parties have produced simplistic proposals.  When in Government it did nothing.  In contrast, the Fine Gael Front Bench and Young Fine Gael produced a detailed penal reform policy.  In Government the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, has attempted to address the issue seriously.  We have the largest prison building programme since the foundation of the State, involving the provision of around 800 extra places; a review of the operating costs of prisons by a group chaired by the former secretary of the Department of Education, Mr. Declan Brennan; a Government commitment to <Col N="396" /> establish an independent prisons board and extensive measures to tackle the drugs problem in prison.  This represents real progress but none of us should be in any doubt that more needs to be done, both inside and outside our prisons.</P>
    <P>For a start, nobody should be sent to prison if there is a suitable alternative but, for somebody who must be contained for the good of society, there must be a place.  On the number of prison places, while the current investment programme of over £135 million between 1996-9 is most welcome, further expenditure will be necessary.  We must face the, reality that most of our prisons are too old and overcrowded to form the basis of a 21st century prison system.  Further new prisons on the model of Wheatfield, while expensive to build, are essential.</P>
    <P>When the current programme of prison building is complete, a new phase should commence. We need to analyse the facilities we should build and how we will finance them.  Ultimately, it is only when we, the legislators, are prepared to give an ongoing financial commitment to prison reform that we will make real progress.  Inside our prisons the serious problem of drug taking is being addressed by the ministerial task force but the scale of the problem is frightening.  A recent survey showed that over 70 per cent of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison have a history of drug abuse. The figure of nearly 500 drugs seizures in 1996 over a nine week period bears testimony to the scale of the problem.  People are going into prison without a drugs problem and coming out with one.  There are no easy or cheap solutions to this or other prison problems.  The new drug free unit in Mountjoy Prison, with preventative and detention measures in the visiting areas, help, but until we have proper treatment facilities and prevention through education and rehabilitation programmes both inside and outside prisons we will not succeed.  Reform will not come cheaply but without it society will eventually explode.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we debate this issue in the national Parliament in the centre of Dublin because 75 per cent of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison come from just five deprived areas in the capital.  For too long penal reform has been viewed as a question of prison and sentencing policy but if we really want to tackle crime and reform the prisons then we must go to the root of the problem.  The 1985 Whitaker report clearly stated that much of the crime prevailing in modern Ireland appeared to be related to moral, demographic, social and economic change, especially the transformation of Irish society from being mainly rural to mainly urban and the concentration in the cities of growing numbers of young unemployed.</P>
    <P>In the inner cities many young people leave school with no qualification and are condemned to long-term unemployment.  Among them are the future inmates of Mountjoy Prison where just 11 per cent of prisoners have had experience of school beyond the age of 16.  I hear glib proposals to solve the crime and prison problems and of the <Col N="397" /> need for tax cuts and lower public spending, but I do not hear much talk of social justice and the need to fund programmes to make it a reality. The people in these deprived areas are no worse than people in better off areas.  They do not care any less for their children's education and future but, worn down by lack of facilities, employment or hope, some lose their will to live or can only do so with the crutch of drugs which then drag them into crime as the only way to feed their habit.  We must break this cycle.</P>
    <P>We started that process, in particular, through the £110 million local development programme between now and the end of 1999, for which I have ministerial responsibility.  Local development is about empowering local communities in deprived areas.  It is about local communities analysing their own problems and proposing community-based solutions in partnership with the State, State agencies and the social partners. These local action plans give the long-term unemployed, the disadvantaged and the early school-leavers a new opportunity.  Educational and training opportunities, employment in one to five person enterprises, environmental improvement and estate management training for tenants are the elements of this second chance.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives are also under way, such as the £21 million urban programme in north Cork, west Tallaght-Clondalkin, Ballymun-Darndale-Finglas; the £10 million package for demand reduction measures in relation to drugs agreed arising from the ministerial task Force; the initiatives by the Department of Education to target resources at schools in deprived areas; and the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, which will allow for better local authority estate management.  In two short years great strides have been made but, in truth, much remains to be done and it will not come cheaply.</P>
    <P>Money, however, is a relative thing.  I hear talk incessantly about the cost of things but rarely about their value.  Can we put a price on an old person's peace of mind in an area where crime has been reduced?  Can we put a price on the joy of a parent that a child is fulfilling his or her educational dreams?  Can we put a price on the satisfaction of a person who gets an honest day's pay for an honest day's work?  We can put a price on the cost of keeping a person in prison; it may be as much as £80,000 a year.  We can put a price on putting a youth into care in a special school for delinquent young people; it is in the order of £74,000 a year.  We can put figures on the lack of educational achievement.  Sixty per cent of those attending drug treatment centres in Dublin in 1994 had left school either before the official school-leaving age of 15 or at that age.  Would it not make more sense to allocate resources to education now rather than having to pay detention costs later?</P>
    <P>We do not live in a society where there is equality of educational opportunity.  University, in the recent words of the Provost of TCD, is a no go area for young people in large areas of <Col N="398" /> Dublin's Inner city.  Students from low income homes are 18 times less likely to attend university than those from wealthier families.  If we really want to stem the flow to our prisons, then we must be relentless in our pursuit of social justice and in tackling the problems of poverty in the ghettos which scar our community.  When will the Opposition put the Government under pressure to advance social justice?  There has been no sign from the Opposition benches that there is due concern in this regard.</P>
    <P>The plans are there.  What is needed is to drive them and commit resources to make them a reality.  We need to deal with the teacher-pupil ratio, particularly in inner city schools.  We need to run home-school liaison and school counselling services on a scale which helps to tackle the problem. We need to build youth and sport facilities along the lines of the sports strategy published by my colleague, the Minister with responsibility for sport, yester-day.  We need training programmes and, crucially, we need localised drug treatment facilities.  These are the ways to tackle this serious problem.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made under this Minister but it is time this House had greater concern for social justice and the value of reform rather than simply its cost.  It is time we stopped scoring points off each other on prison facilities.  We know the prison system needs to be reformed. The appointment of an independent prisons board is a great start and the Minister for Justice has done a great public service in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I applaud and support every view expressed by Deputy Mitchell, a member of a different political party.  It is interesting how ideas can sometimes merge on the same track.</P>
      <P>Like many of the Private Members' Bills debated in this House in recent months, this is pretty flimsy stuff.  They will probably get much flimsier as the Deputies opposite gear up for a general election.</P>
      <P>There has long been a need for comprehensive prisons legislation which would repeal antiquated legislation dating back as far as 1826 and establish a modern system of prison administration which serves the needs of individual prisoners and society.  Unfortunately, this Bill does not come even close to meeting that need.  Drafting legislation is never easy for Opposition Deputies and I have long argued for improved research and advisory facilities, but this Bill amounts to little more than a random attempt to push various electoral buttons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two main planks to Deputy O'Donnell's Bill, the first of which is the need for an independent body to run the prisons.  That recommendation first surfaced all of 11 years ago in the Whitaker report, which was consigned by successive administrations to the darkest basement in the Department of Justice.  The Progressive Democrats had the opportunity to resurrect the Whitaker recommendations during their term in <Col N="399" /> office between 1989 and 1992 but, unfortunately, they funked it.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left has long argued for the decentralisation of the Department of Justice, the establishment of separate bodies to run both the courts and the prisons and to administer early release and parole.  I am, therefore, delighted that work is proceeding on the establishment of an independent courts service and that an expert working group is currently examining the best way of setting up an independent prisons agency. Deputy O'Donnell's proposals with regard to an independent prison service are welcome but out of date.</P>
    <P>This Bill is no more than a rehashing of old ideas, some of which are nevertheless worthwhile. Old ideas, however valid, do not grab headlines and that, essentially, is what the Progressive Democrats are all about.  Deputy O'Donnell can never resist playing to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> constituency, that well known school of jurisprudence which regards trial by media or, very often, trial by public opinion, as infinitely preferable to trial by judge and jury.  The icing on the cake of this Bill is the proposal for a register of prisoners on temporary release open to inspection by the general public.  Every self-appointed vigilante in the country will, if Deputy O'Donnell gets her way, be entitled to know who is on temporary release and, I imagine, where they are living.</P>
    <P>Section 15 in its present form is a charter for mob rule.  Not only does it give effective sanction to vigilantes but it will also facilitate every gangster in knowing when his turf rivals are free in order to seek retribution and revenge for long held grudges.  I feel very strongly about this.  Last year in my constituency a young man was beaten to death.  He was not on temporary release, but he could have been.  The temporary release register envisaged by Deputy O'Donnell would provide aspiring vigilantes with a useful directory for their activities.  Simple populism is no substitute for a coherent policy.</P>

      <P>This proposal by the Justice spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats is one of the most irresponsible put forward by any Deputy during my time in this House.  Rather than legislating for vigilantism, Democratic Left has consistently called for the establishment of an independent parole board which would ensure that early and temporary releases are fully monitored and that the conditions of release are tailored to the history and needs of individuals prisoners. In particular, it is vital to ensure that prisoners are not dumped on to the streets when prison spaces are needed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This afternoon we learned of the impending retirement from public life of my colleague the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  I take this opportunity to wish him well in his retirement and to pay tribute to him for his outstanding commitment the people of Dublin South-West whom he has represented so ably.  He and I served as members of Dublin County Council for a number of years and for the past ten years we have served as colleagues here representing the people of Dublin South West.  He never displayed bitterness to any of his colleagues and was always very fair, open minded and even-handed in debates with us.  He will leave behind him a substantial legacy of good legislation which has been supported inside and outside this House.  He has made an outstanding contribution not only in his time as a public representative, but particularly in his time at the Cabinet table.  I wish him a happy and result retirement.  I know his wife Marilyn, who has supported him so strongly all through his public life, will welcome more of his time in the family home to which he is rightly entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Bill, I wish to take up a point made by Deputy Byrne relating to the register of temporary release orders.  I can see both sides of the argument on that issue.  The public are greatly concerned about the many instances where individuals on temporary release reoffend. There seems to be a view abroad that very little information is available on that aspect of our prison service.  There is a great deal of disquiet on the issue generally.  Consequently, the matter must be addressed.  In so far as Deputy O'Donnell is attempting to address it in this legislation, I support her.  Some aspects of it might be amended.  People have been very concerned about the issue of parole.  I am not sure if we have a right to keep information of that kind from the public, given that the people concerned were brought before our courts, convicted and confined to prison.  As that is a very public act, why should be maintain a veil of secrecy over those who are on temporary release?  The issue must be addressed and we must be mature enough to live with that information.  We should not allow our legislation to be dominated by the thugs and ruffians who would seek to compel us to frame legislation <Col N="401" /> in such a way that they might be able to benefit from it in their illegal practices.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the prison service in general because it has been an issue for a long time.  Any Member of the House who engages in a tit for tat confrontation on this issue is letting his or her party down.  All of us in this House have questions to answer about the manner in which the prison service has been dealt with.  I compliment Deputy O'Donnell and her party on bringing forward this legislation.  Second Stage legislation is subject usually to amendment and there is no reason a member of any of the Government parties could not table amendments to this Bill.  That is part of the cut and thrust of Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <P>This debate provides an opportunity to examine ways by which we can develop and improve the service to meet future needs.  The prison service is in poor shape and that has evolved over a number of years possibly as a result of the changeing society in which we live.  The substantial overcrowding in our prisons, which has reached a crisis point, is causing great difficulty.</P>
    <P>Many speakers in this and other debates have raised the problem of drug abuse in our prisons. It is posing a great difficulty to staff in the management of prisons.  There is also the issue of poor facilities for the rehabilitation of prisoners to enable them to return to society as law abiding citizens.  That problem must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Another issue is the increasing number of prison suicides which cannot be unrelated to the conditions in which prisoners live and possibly to a mixture of drug abuse and other problems and the no hope situation that faces prisoners on their release.  We are disheartened with the prison service. Criticisms are raised at meetings, particularly public ones, about its operation, but the problems in our prison service have developed over a number of years.  They need to be urgently tackled and will require the expenditure of considerable resources.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of Part II addresses the need to assess the requirements for prison and custodial accommodation in the future.  This is very important.  I am not sure a coherent plan based on accurate information and forecasting of requirements in respect of adult prisons and juvenile detention centres was ever made.  This was discussed in the context of the Children Bill, 1996.  We do not seem to be able to plan for future needs in this area.  This may be because the subject is not popular and does not generate public support unless problems arise in the system.</P>
    <P>Another issue which must be addressed is the management of prisons.  It seems individual prisons develop their own ethos and code of management and practices can differ greatly from prison to prison.  For example, a parallel recently emerged between Mountjoy Prison and its counterpart in Cork.  It appears there is easy access to drugs in Mountjoy while the contrary position obtains in Cork.  I understand there are differences in the way the populations of the <Col N="402" /> respective prisons are managed.  I accept there may be different pressures in Cork, but the authorities in that prison appear to have managed to restrict the availability of drugs.</P>
    <P>Prisons seems to exist in isolation from each other and the Bill seeks to co-ordinate the operation of these institutions under a centralised system. Further development and the provision of additional resources would make a considerable contribution to the orderly management of the prison system and facilitate the imposition of similar regimes in our prisons.  Management is extremely important because there have been significant criticisms of individual regimes.  It is not easy to manage a prison if it is overcrowded and there is a serious problem with the availability of drugs.  I understand the difficulties of front line staff who face danger during the course of their work.  However, they do an outstanding job which is a credit to them.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a director to the prison service is a good inclusion in the legislation.  Many annual reports are issued too late to enable corrective action to be taken, but the report of the director will have to be laid before the House in the first three months of the following year, and this will draw early attention to any deficiencies in the service.</P>
    <P>The question of rehabilitation and the action that can be taken in respect of the prison service must be addressed.  This can only be done if there is an orderly prison system which is properly managed, resourced and maintained.  We must also address the purpose of imprisonment.  What do we expect to gain from incarcerating individuals in our prisons?  Some sections of society might suggest that we lock people up and throw away the key but I do not subscribe to that philosophy. Society has a duty and a responsibility, through its prison system, to attempt to rehabilitate as many prisoners as possible.  I accept there are circumstances where little progress can be made.  However, the vast majority of prisoners can be rehabilitated.  This requires an orderly regime, resources and plans on how to effect such an improvement.</P>
    <P>Recent efforts to improve the prison system are insufficient and haphazard.  Those who work with prisoners both in prison and when they are released have criticised the fact that no account is taken of prisoners who on release are left to their own devices, must try to fend for themselves, obtain accommodation and return to the straight and narrow.  Part of the prison system's remit should be to help prisoners when they are released.  The last thing we need is individuals continuing to offend and re-entering the prison system.  The objective of the prison service should be to rehabilitate prisoners, where possible, and to link with health, education and employment agencies to co-ordinate assistance and help for those released from incarceration.  Otherwise people released from prison will re-offend and be incarcerated again because of the pressures <Col N="403" /> involved or their inability to cope with outside life.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to address a number of these issues.  I am sure Deputy O'Donnell would be the first to admit that it does not address all of the issues.  Some of the criticisms of the Bill, particularly those by Deputy Eric Byrne, are unfounded and introduced language that has no place in a debate on prison issues.  Such criticism does not help the prisoners, the prison system or those who work in prisons.  When a political party introduces well researched legislation of this kind which can be improved &mdash; as is the case with the bulk of legislation that comes before the House &mdash; it should be taken in the spirit in which it was intended.</P>
    <P>The Bill aims to centralise the prison service, co-ordinate the provision of prison facilities and ensure that a different approach may be taken with prisoners to give them some chance to avoid re-offending and returning to the prison system. That is extremely important.  These and other issues are referred to in the legislation, which has a part to play in the development of the prison service.  It will not be the last legislation introduced to deal with this issue but at least it is an attempt to grapple with the problem, once and for all.  If it so wishes, the Government is free to introduce amendments on Committee Stage.  It would not be the first time that happened.</P>

      <P>In dealing with prisons one must refer to the cancellation of the prison building programme and the consequences of that action in the overall context.  This set the scene for an upsurge in criminal activity in 1995 when we witnessed an increased number of larcenies, robberies, burglaries and savage attacks on the elderly.  At that time, Fianna Fáil's spokesperson, Deputy O'Donoghue, stated that crime was spiralling out of control and he was accused of scaremongering by the Rainbow Coalition.  The problem was that the ideal of punishment for crime had been eroded.  This meant that prison doors were more open than even before.  The rights of victims became less important than those of criminals, particularly to some members of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that criminals became more daring.  They were aptly christened &ldquo;the untouchables&rdquo; because they were untouchable.  When Fianna Fáil called for a bail referendum the Tánaiste initially refused, even though crime was rampant and even though 1,300 prisoners breached their conditions of temporary release from Mountjoy Prison.  The Rainbow Coalition did not want to deal with criminals who concluded they could continue their criminal ways. The murder of a member of the Garda Síochána was abhorrent.  At that stage everybody thought crime had reached its zenith and we could not take any more.  The Government adopted Fianna Fáil's Proceeds of Crime Bill; senior members of the Government said its introduction was the <Col N="404" /> high point in the Government's career and took it unto themselves as if it were their very own.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt there has been an immense amount of bungling within the Department of Justice since this Government took office.  It has been disconcerting, alarming and unsustainable. &ldquo;Don't read your letters, Mrs. Owen&rdquo; could have been the title of a song about the Judge Lynch episode written on the basis that the Minister could not take any more bad news.  That episode spurred the Government into doing something tangible about crime.</P>
    <P>Any fair assessment of the number of prison places to be provided will still leave us with not enough places in the final analysis.  Even with the provision of the promised 180 places at Castlerea, the addition to Limerick of 55 and 68 in the Curragh for sex offenders, there will still not be enough and offenders will continue to be allowed out early.  The governors of the prisons and the prison officers feel they are subject to crisis management. They cannot run their prisons in a planned and co-ordinated way.  For that reason the Progressive Democrats Bill, which looks for proper planning and co-ordination in the prison service, is welcome.  However, every Garda station has bundles of warrants, all of which are unexecuted because there are not enough prison places if the people were arrested.  Gardaí are deciding to exercise just one warrant because they know the prisons do not have the space and that the prisoners will be released back on the streets almost as soon as they are brought in.</P>
    <P>Crime, unfortunately, is on an upward spiral and this is a problem for people who are trying to govern and manage prisons.  I understand that 30 to 40 people are released from Mountjoy in any one day.  Offenders see no reason to pay fines or give up on petty crime because their chances of getting an early release are very high.  It makes sense to them, therefore, to continue with crime.</P>
    <P>Prison officers have been criticised about the level of overtime, which is exceptionally high, but people must realise that prison officers have no option but to work overtime if they are asked to do so.  Now that the Minister of State is here let me remind him that about two years ago the Civil Service advertised and held exams with a view to recruiting prison officers, but nobody was called for interview.  It is my understanding that 3,000 or 4,000 people sat that exam, all of whom are waiting patiently for recruitment.  It has not yet happened. Can the Minister of State give us an idea what will happen in regard to these people who want to be recruited to the prison service?  A number of promotions have been made over the past two years.  In many cases the people who have been promoted have been transferred to other prisons, but they have not been replaced in the prisons from which they were transferred.  It is vital that the Minister of State explain categorically his position on recruitment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> Much has been said about the privatisation of prisons.  I have yet to be convinced that privatising prisons will result in a better prison service.</P>

      <P>Prison governors in the UK wonder at their responsibility, their role and the co-ordination of their activities.  We have heard about escapes while prisoners are taken to and from the courts, but when it comes to the question of responsibility, there is a major question mark about where that responsibility lies.  The Exchequer cannot continue to plough money into prison building programmes.  Over the past five years there have been calls from building consortiums to take over the building of prisons on a build and lease back basis.  This is something that should be seriously examined by the Exchequer in any planning programme for the prison service.</P>
      <P>There is a perception that there are often cost overruns in planning prisons.  It is speculated that in drawing up prison plans discussions often take place with lay people who may not know the intricacies of what is required within prisons; we find that during a building programme additional requirements are added to contract, and this adds enormously to the overall cost.  In looking at the privatisation of building prisons it is important to set parameters for proper planning and control and that we know exactly what is required within the prison service to ensure that the woeful waste of the past will not be a feature of the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue indicated that in drawing up structures for prison administration certain key issues need to be addressed.  If a new regime is being instituted one has to ask if it will improve upon the existing regime, if it will eliminate overcrowding, if it will improve morale and working conditions and the overall relationship between prison staff and prisoners.  More fundamentally, the question arises of the powers and responsibilities relating to prisoners that would remain with the Minister for Justice.  These issues concern the efficiency and rationale of a new authority.</P>
      <P>One of the major issues which a new prison authority would have to address is the high incidence of prison suicide.  Does it stem from a lack of support facilities in prisons?  Is the relationship between prison officers and prisoners as it should be?  In November 1996 the Minister indicated that the probation and welfare services would be placed under the control of the new prisons authority. The Irish Commission for Justice and Peace rightly asked if that was appropriate.  Those services would be more appropriately placed under the responsibility of the new courts authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of work to be done in examining the structure of society.  Prevention is better than cure.  School class sizes and the level of resources being put into areas with high crime levels are <Col N="406" /> just two of the issues that arise in this regard.  All the issues must be addressed together.  We cannot continue to build prisons without tackling the major social issues that need to be addressed.</P>

      <P>It must be obvious to anyone who listens to this debate that this Bill is not a serious effort at law or prison reform.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>What would this Bill achieve?  It has been claimed that it would force the Government to provide sufficient prison accommodation. Where is that provided for in the Bill?  The Bill states that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; provide such prisons as are reasonably necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice already has all the legal powers she needs in this regard and, as she pointed out on in her contribution to this debate, the provision in section 5 of the Bill would not secure one extra prison place.</P>
      <P>It has been claimed that the Bill would create a new management structure for the prisons. However, as the Minister for Justice pointed out and Deputy O'Donoghue in effect agreed with her, it leaves unanswered a host of important questions about how this new structure would operate in practice.  There is so little detail in the Bill about a new management structure that it is virtually meaningless.  It has been claimed that the Bill is being put forward in the context of the need to reduce costs in the Prison Service.  Where does it do that?  During the debate we did not hear one specific proposal on how one penny was to be saved.  Instead we heard a combination of sweeping statements, pious aspirations and platitudes.</P>
      <P>We recognise that there are problems with the prison system.  They have not developed overnight. They did not begin two years ago when this Government took office.  Rather, they have been present under successive Fianna Fáil and Progressive ments and under the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government.  It would be fraudulent to claim that the problems could be tackled in any way by the Bill before this House this evening. Thankfully, the Government has taken substantial and effective action to address these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prison accommodation will not be created by a spurious legislative power.  Building prisons costs a great deal of money and one cannot escape that fact.  However, it was because the Government <Col N="407" /> recognises the importance which attaches to this matter that it has undertaken the most comprehensive prison building programme since the foundation of the State.  It will provide over 800 extra places.  That is how the problem of the revolving door &mdash; which was revolving for a very long time before this Government came into office &mdash; will be tackled.</P>
    <P>I noted that Deputy Batt O'Keeffe spoke about privatisation and he had the effrontery to look at me when doing so.  He should have been looking at the Progressive Democrats Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>We decided comparatively recently to do so and immediately put in train the necessary steps to implement the decision.  This is not a straightforward matter and it gives rise to complex issues which have to be addressed effectively if the new agency or board is to be in a position to fulfil its role effectively.  That is why the Minister for Justice established an expert group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Dan McAuley, to advise her on the detailed aspects of setting up a new prisons administration.  That group has made substantial progress on its work and its report will be available shortly.  That is the sensible way of going about it.</P>
      <P>Another group with expertise from within and outside the public service has been studying the question of prison costs.  Once again, very complex issues arise which are being tackled in a sensible way.  This process is in no way helped by those who make sweeping claims about inefficiency but offer no specific suggestions as to how savings might be achieved.</P>
      <P>While it is, of course, important to ensure that our prisons are run efficiently, is anyone seriously expected to believe the claim by Deputy O'Donnell's party that they will be able to provide all the extra prison places necessary without incurring additional expenditure?  I listened with great interest to an interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; last week or the week before when the question was put to her continuously as to how she would cut down on the cost and at the same time provide extra prison spaces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the Minister's demeanour &mdash; not to mention the colour of his face &mdash; that he is deeply uncomfortable discussing our Private Members' Bill.  The Government is also deeply uncomfortable in having to account to Dáil Eireann and the citizens for presiding over a prison system which is in chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice decided not to hide behind the expert group, which is examining this matter, and to allow the television cameras into Mountjoy as she has nothing to lose.  She is on <Col N="409" /> the last lap.  She has nothing to hide because it has all been exposed.  During the past two years Deputy O'Donoghue and I have tabled questions and held the Minister to account but it has been a shameful experience.  It has been revealed that we have a costly shambles of a prison service which is the most expensive in the western world. It costs £12 million per year to run our prisons, £2 million per week, and it does not work.</P>
    <P>Our prison service is not fit for the purpose for which it was intended.  It does not deter, rehabilitate or keep prisoners inside jail.  They have been sentenced in public by our courts.  They have been prosecuted in public by the Garda and our authorities and every day 50 are released to make space for more convicted prisoners.  On that alone, which is admitted by the Government, the Government is unfit to rule.</P>
    <P>I regret I have caused such discomfort to the Government.  Clearly it is happy to have the media discuss the appalling situation in our prisons because it has abdicated responsibility at this stage.  The Minister is in a perpetual flight from her responsibilities not only on prisons but on the total mismanagement of her brief as Minister for Justice.  During the past two years in the area of criminal justice the Government has only responded to political calamities as they occurred. Following the Dominic Lynch fiasco we had prison reform.  In February 1996, prison reform was included in our Private Members' Bill which was voted down by the Government.  After the Dominic Lynch fiasco, hey presto, the Government would provide for prison reform and a new prison authority.  We welcomed that because we had been calling for it for two years.</P>
    <P>We have led the debate on prison reform, the need for which has been denied by the Left in particular.  I want to respond to the Labour Deputies who contributed to this debate. Throughout those contributions there was a denial of the need for prison reform because of its dangerous moral confusion which it peddles in the course of the socialist premise which is that criminals are ultimately victims to be treated with the same political, legal and social response as the victims of crime.  I do not buy that.  Perhaps criminals come from a disadvantaged background but it is dangerous for the Government and the socialist parties to send the message to the poor and disadvantaged that they have a licence to be criminals.  It is morally dangerous and confuses the difference between right and wrong.  After five years of the Left in Government there is moral confusion about what is right and wrong and how to deal with it.  It sends out a wrong message that criminal classes come mainly from the poor.  Statistically that is correct but it is an insult to the thousands of poor people who for many years have not turned to crime because they are not criminals.  The two concepts are not mutually exclusive.  It is imperative that we deal with both but it is wrong to postpone law and order for the sake of examining the root causes of crime.  A good Government can do both.  The <Col N="410" /> Government has been paralysed by the conflict between the parties of the Left and Fine Gael. Recently the Taoiseach admitted Fine Gael has no policies which are different from those of the parties of the Left with which it shares Government. Nowhere has that been more pathetic and dangerous than in the incoherent approach given to criminal justice and penal reform.</P>
    <P>The Minister boasts about a new openness and referred to a cynical response from this side of the House.  It is clear this new <i>glasnost</i> is a totally cynical spin-doctored exercise to allow the Minister to abdicate her responsibilities.  The most remarkable part of this new openness or <i>glasnost</i> is the complete absence in the whole process of the Minister for Justice.  She is leaving it to the governor of Mountjoy, a most remarkable man, to manage the chaos because the Department of Justice and the Minister for Justice who has political responsibility for the running of our prisons, has left him to explain the chaos in the prison system and put the best foot forward.  He knows there has been woeful waste in the massive expenditure in the prison service in the past five years with nobody accountable for it.  That is why we have proposed an executive prison services agency to inject accountability.  Nobody knows who is responsible for the massive waste.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to how the costs could be reduced.  I will tell him how to do this. Over the past three years £53 million has been paid to prison officers in overtime, and this at a time when there are more prison officers than prisoners.  There can be no justification for this expenditure in any management terms.  The overtime budget is overshot every year, yet the person with political responsibility cannot give any justification for this mismanagement.  Nobody blames the prison officers as most of their overtime is compulsory.  It is simply a case of bad management. The management system needs to be totally reformed.</P>
    <P>This statement by the Minister proves he does not understand the issue or how to ensure good value for the massive amounts of money spent on the prison service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It costs approximately £45,000 per year to keep a prisoner in an Irish prison, whereas the cost in England is approximately half and is £13,000 in France.  This difference in cost cannot be justified on any management grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government was happy to preside over such a system until the Judge Dominic Lynch affair when it had to pull something out of the hat fast while on the run from the public.  There is nothing as reforming as a Government on the run from the public.  Following this affair the Government capitulated on a range of measures dealing with the bail laws, the right to silence etc. which it had voted down a few weeks previously. The Government Whip agreed to all the proposals put to him by the Opposition Whips following <Col N="411" /> the murder of Jerry McCabe and the obvious escalation in organised crime as evidenced by the murder of Veronica Guerin.</P>
    <P>The Government is mortified by this debate. The Labour Party described the Bill as &ldquo;shabby&rdquo; while Democratic Left described it as &ldquo;flimsy&rdquo;. One would not expect anything different from the socialist parties in Government who are bankrupt in terms of how to deal with crime and lawlessness and are paralysed by moral confusion on how to deal with criminals &mdash; because they come from disadvantaged areas they believe they must be treated like victims.</P>
    <P>The electorate has lost confidence in the Government's ability to deal effectively with law and order.  If the prison service, which is supposed to be the end of the cycle in the criminal justice system, does not function properly then the rest of the system will be undermined.  This includes the work of the courts and the Garda.  The judgments dispensed by the courts are being set at naught by decisions made in private by civil servants.  It is a scandal that the people who manage the prison service make telephone calls every day to ensure that 50 prisoners are released because there is no space for them.  Another irony is that approximately 1,400 people are unlawfully at large.  These people have absconded from open jails, broken the terms of their so-called temporary release bonds and otherwise escaped from prison.  As far as I know, none of the 200 people who absconded from open prisons last year has been captured.  However, even if they were captured there would be no space for them in prison.  On that basis alone, the Government is unfit to govern.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the prison building programme. Over the past year the Government has managed to cobble together approximately 150 prison places.  However, this is only a drop in the ocean given that we need to increase the number of places by 50 per cent in order to meet the present demand, not to mention the additional places which will be required when the people unlawfully at large are captured and kept on remand under the bail legislation.  We are in breach of our international obligations in that we do not have a remand facility.</P>
    <P>The Deputies who visited Mountjoy Prison were appalled by the inhuman conditions.  These include overcrowding and a sheep dip medical service.  In one case a young man in a padded cell had only a blanket to cover him.  It costs a fortune to run this prison, yet we are getting nothing for it.  A basic requirement of prisons is that they have the capacity to keep prisoners for the duration of their sentence.  However, this is not happening. <Col N="412" /> I will not refer to rehabilitation as it is a forgotten dream.  The prison service is not fit for the purpose for which it was established, yet the Government presides over it without even blushing.</P>
    <P>Government Deputies said there was no problem with the prisons and that my party was merely looking for headlines by hyping up the crime problem.  The Minister for Justice claimed that crime was not a problem and that we were jumping on the bandwagon.  My colleague in Democratic Left, who was very worried about the temporary release system, was horrified that the Bill proposed the establishment of a register of temporary releases.  I am amazed that he should have been so horrified by this proposal.  The temporary release system, which is known as &ldquo;shedding&rdquo;, is an invisible decision-making process under which prisoners are released without any means of ascertaining whether they break the law while on release.  The term &ldquo;temporary release&rdquo; is a lie as it really means unconditional and unsupervised perpetual release.  This is a scandal. By failing to acknowledge that it is undermining the entire criminal justice system the Government is not fit to govern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment because many constituents have become increasingly alarmed about the ongoing strike affecting the collection of domestic refuse. Over 62,000 households on the south side of Dublin have a potential health hazard on their doorsteps. Life has become unbearable for many of them who have contacted my office in recent days.  Since before Christmas disruption of normal refuse collection services because of a dispute between bin men and South Dublin County Council has been a fact of life for many householders. They do not know from week to week whether their rubbish will be collected and that <Col N="415" /> has caused serious problems for them, particularly over the Christmas period when more rubbish than normal is generated.  A mountain of rubbish is building up in these areas with all the attendant problems of odours and lack of hygiene.</P>
      <P>Newspaper articles today report that the people of west Tallaght have resorted to burning their rubbish but piles of refuse remain.  Young children cannot be expected to steer clear of the bin bags which are strewn around housing estates in the west Tallaght area.  The daily lives of many people in this area are difficult enough without having this health hazard imposed on them.  In places like Knocklyon, Firhouse and Rathfarnham, bin bags are piling up in back gardens and stray dogs and cats are having a field day. This is making life a misery for thousands of householders and is inviting rat infestation.</P>
      <P>The unofficial action which was in place before Christmas has now become official action.  The dispute concerns new routing arrangements although I understand of the 62 routes in question, only two are the cause of disagreement.  We all accept bin men have a dirty job to do but whatever the rights and wrongs of this dispute, an industrial relations difficulty should not take precedence over what may become a serious health and environmental issue.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to take the necessary action to sort out this problem.  I do not know if she has any proposals in this regard, but perhaps private contractors could be brought in on a one-off basis to clear the growing mountain of refuse. Nobody advocates strike-breaking but the public health issue must be addressed in parallel with the industrial relations issue.  The grievances should not take precedence over people's health.</P>
      <P>The South Dublin County Council has called on the two unions involved to suspend the industrial action and consider the issues in dispute in a committee comprising two trade union nominees and two management nominees with an agreed chair.  I hope this can be done quickly but, in the absence of progress, we owe it to the householders of south Dublin to take whatever steps are necessary.  We should not have to wait until a child contracts a serious infection before action is taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am responding to this matter in the context of the general co-ordinating role of the Minister for the Environment in relation to waste management.  Deputies will appreciate that the provision of a collection service for household waste is primarily for local authorities to arrange in accordance with section 33 of the Waste Management Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current industrial dispute which has led to the suspension of domestic waste collection services by South Dublin County Council is regrettable, and I hope that there will be an early resolution of the issues involved.  The situation is not <Col N="416" /> considered at this stage to present a significant risk to public health.</P>
    <P>There have been intermittent problems with the refuse collection service in south Dublin since 20 January, but the official strike which is now under way commenced 12 days ago, on 7 February. The cessation of waste collection services by the council is clearly a significant inconvenience to householders, but there are a number of steps open to people to deal with their refuse in a responsible manner.</P>
    <P>Many householders are bringing their waste directly to the nearest landfill facility for disposal. I urge neighbours to co-operate in this respect and in particular to look after the needs of persons who may not have their own transport facilities. Residents' associations may also have a useful role to play.  In some cases, groups of residents have chosen to hire commercial skips for the purpose of refuse disposal.</P>
    <P>Where householders cannot or choose not to exercise these options, they can place their domestic refuse in suitable sealed containers.  These can be stored pending what I hope will be an early resumption of collection services.  Temporary storage in these circumstances should not give rise to significant nuisance.  It is the duty of every person who holds waste to do so in a manner which does not give rise to environmental pollution. Irresponsible disposal of waste is not to be countenanced, even in the trying circumstances now obtaining in south Dublin.</P>
    <P>Efforts should be intensified on both sides of this dispute to reach an agreement that is reasonable and honourable.  The overriding objective must be to restore to the householders and other customers of South Dublin County Council the waste services to which they are entitled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to speak on the outbreak of Newcastle disease in Northern Ireland.  If great care is not taken here and in Northern Ireland, this could have disastrous consequences for my constituency.  The code of practice recommended in a recent report on the poultry industry should be strictly adhered to.  This is the worst outbreak of disease in poultry in Northern Ireland for the past 20 years.  There have been many outbreaks of disease in the past ten years but, at great cost to the Department and producers, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry contained them by imposing strict exclusion zones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Poultry production is confined mainly to the Cavan-Monaghan region, particularly north Monaghan. Eleven of the 15 farmers who live near me are involved in intensive production of mushrooms, turkeys, broilers, pigs and eggs.  Approximately 60 per cent of broiler chicken production, 60 per cent of egg production, 80 per cent of turkey production and practically all duck and quail production takes places in my constituency.  This <Col N="417" /> indicates the serious consequences this outbreak of Newcastle disease could have for that area.</P>
    <P>Even though grant aid has not been provided for primary producers in the poultry industry, producers have continued to expand and compete. As an island we should be in a strong position to fight disease infection but, unfortunately, the majority of hens whose egg laying days are over are exported to Britain for slaughter.  The trucks in which they are transported should be strictly monitored.</P>
    <P>In March 1996 there was a report on the poultry industry and the Minister launched a £35 million programme for the industry.  The report recommended that there should be an all-Ireland approach to the poultry industry, that all hens at the end of their laying life should be processed on this island to maintain the existing avian health status, that a discussion group should be established involving various interests to examine issues relevant to the development of the poultry industry and, if necessary, the Government should act as a convenor.  It also recommended that regular independent audit checks should be carried out on every hatchery, breeding farm, processing plant and feed mill.  Have those recommendations been implemented?</P>
    <P>The increasing health conscious consumer regards poultry as a good purchase choice in terms of safety and nutritional value.  Consumer confidence is based on vigilant protection of our avian health status.  An operation, similar to Operation Matador launched in the case of BSE, should be put in place to ensure that poultry from Northern Ireland does not cross the Border.</P>
    <P>There are 561 supply farms, hatcheries and commercial growing sites in the State, with approximately two-thirds of them located in my constituency.  The consumption of poultry has doubled in recent times.  We have the highest consumption of poultry meat <i>per capita</i> in the European Union.  It is important that slaughtering plants are set up here so that it is not necessary to transport poultry in trucks to Britain for slaughtering purposes.  As a result of the recent closure of pig slaughtering plants in Cavan and Monaghan, we transport live pigs to Belfast and Newry with a similar danger of disease being carried by lorries.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Leonard for raising this important matter on the Adjournment.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to outline the issues involved in the current outbreak of Newcastle disease in the poultry industry in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently eight confirmed cases of Newcastle disease in poultry in Northern Ireland. <Col N="418" /> This is a highly infectious viral disease, which affects poultry, defined here as domestic fowls, turkeys, geese and ducks, pigeons and other birds.  The clinical signs of the disease include diarrhoea, drop in egg production, severe respiratory signs, nervous signs, depression and death.  It can spread quickly to cause widespread mortalities in birds and economic losses among poultry producers, but it poses absolutely no human health risks from the consumption of poultry and or poultry produce.  I emphasise that point to the House.</P>
    <P>In accordance with standard procedures provided for in European legislation, areas up to 10 kilometres around these eight infected holdings have been declared infected areas and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland has imposed movement restrictions &mdash; including prohibitions on export &mdash; on poultry, hatching eggs and poultry products originating within these areas.  The confirmed infectious flocks are slaughtered immediately, due entirely to animal health measures and not as a public health measure.  So far more than half a million birds have been killed.  I also understand the virus circulating is a particularly virulent one, with a mortality rate of up to 40 per cent instead of the usual 5 per cent.  Possible sources of infection include contact with pigeons and other wild fowl, migrating flocks and contaminated water and feed.</P>
    <P>Humans can also enter the equation and unwittingly spread the infection by car or lorry wheels, crates, or visiting sites without wearing protective clothing suitable for disinfection.  Advice to all in charge of poultry is to ensure that all movement of people, vehicles, equipment, etc. is kept to the absolute minimum.  It is also strongly advised that where poultry are on free range they should be kept housed if at all possible.  I emphasise that no case of this disease has been reported to date this side of the Border.  A particular worry is that the majority of the valuable poultry and egg industry is located in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  With this in mind I have introduced additional measures with regard to trade with Northern Ireland.  All imports of poultry from Northern Ireland are now subject to an import licence issued by my Department.  A supplementary scheme of health certification for poultry other than hatching eggs and day-old chicks has been introduced.  This requires that birds must be inspected within 24 hours of travel by an official veterinarian in the North, who certifies that they are free from any signs or clinical symptoms of Newcastle disease.</P>
    <P>Additional controls have been put in place at the Border to ensure that no illegal movement of poultry, hatching eggs and poultry products takes place.  The Minister has been in touch with the Customs and the Garda to heighten their awareness of the position.  An advice notice outlining the precautions to be taken and an information sheet on the clinical signs of the disease have been issued by my Department to all flock owners and producers to aid them to protect their flocks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="419" /> As the House is probably aware, Ireland has had an official policy of not vaccinating against Newcastle disease, as has Northern Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand.  EC recognition of our non-vaccinating status has entitled us to additional health guarantees in relation to imported poultry and poultrymeat.  Problems associated with vaccination include the cost, loss in performance, the fact that the presence of the actual disease can be masked and that there are various types of virus.</P>
    <P>Up to now non-vaccination was favoured by the industry.  Recently, however, the poultry industry in both parts of the island indicated that they favoured adoption of a vaccination policy and initiated a widespread debate with all interested parties, including the Departments in both jurisdictions.  It was perceived that vaccinated birds were much less at risk from the disease and vaccination reduced the spread of the disease should the birds be challenged by an outbreak. Due to the close North-South trade links any decision taken had to be the same and taken simultaneously.  Officials of my Department had various meetings with the relevant officials of the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland. Following these discussions, a system of voluntary vaccination has been introduced for the island as a whole.</P>
    <P>I stress that it is illegal to use a vaccine which has not been authorised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and to date five vaccines have been authorised.  These include both live vaccines and inactivated combination vaccines.  Vaccination is voluntary and flock owners should seek advice on their situation from their veterinary adviser.  One of the conditions of authorisation is that the vaccine is supplied on prescription only on a request basis by a registered veterinary practitioner to animals under his or her care.  The decision to vaccinate will depend on various factors including geographical location, species of poultry, age of birds, genetic level of birds and stage of production.  While strategic vaccination of breeding and laying flocks in certain locations may be worthwhile, it must be remembered that vaccination is not a cure-all solution, and it should be emphasised that there are no circumstances in which vaccination can be regarded as an alternative to good management practice, good bio-security and good hygiene practice in poultry farming.</P>
    <P>I re-emphasise that to date there have been no outbreaks of Newcastle disease south of the Border. I extend my thanks to our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland for their close co-operation and consistent liaison on this and many more subjects.  I am pleased we have arrived at an all-Ireland health policy on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that meetings have taken place throughout the country where communities are at war with the companies.  Two promises were made by the Government in this regard.  The Programme for Government refers to allowing competition between community television deflection systems and existing MMDS franchise holders.  As if that promise were not enough, the Taoiseach told a packed hall in Carrigaline in November 1995 during a by-election campaign that he would soon grant a temporary licence to South Coast Community Television.  That commitment was agreed by all three parties in Government.  The Minister cannot blame this side of the House for reminding him of those two pledges which were made openly and, no doubt, honestly.  Does the Government intend to meet those commitments and, if not, will the Minister publish the reason for not doing so and why it was necessary to make them?</P>
      <P>The appointment of a regulator will not solve the problem.  It is important that the regulator is not used as a means of passing the buck.

      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  This matter is particularly sensitive in my constituency.  My constituency colleague in the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Ring, had the opportunity once again this morning to articulate his views on the national airwaves on a matter that lies at the root of equality and equal treatment.  One is mindful of the singular role played by that Deputy in ensuring the Government provides a subvention for group water schemes in Mayo.  He said on the national airwaves this morning that the existing service, namely, the deflector service, provided to 110,000 people in the county should be licensed.  I ask the Minister to give the information sought by my colleague.  The present service, which amounts to bottom-up development, has been maintained by voluntary community organisations at a cost of 1,000 per cent less than that which would be charged by an MMDS operator.  While there may be legal difficulties, there are also technical difficulties in that an MMDS operation may not be able to give a service to more than 30 per cent of the population in my constituency.  Will the Minister publish the report and tell me why ten or 15 years later people do not have the terms, conditions and performance stipulations outlined in those licences to which they are entitled?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a statement on this matter.  From what I have been hearing, it seems people may be rushing to conclusions on what can only be based on rumour.</P>
      <P>There is no consultants' report into the MMDS deflector issue.  What I received last Saturday was a report from the consultants appointed by my predecessor to carry out an analysis of an application by South Coast Community TV for a licence to operate its re-transmission system.  It is important to be precise here.  Only one such application is under consideration, that is, the one from South Coast Community TV.  The EBU consultants' report is concerned with that application and with no other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that following the High Court judgment in 1995 on the action brought by South Coast Community TV, I am obliged to reconsider an application from that organisation for a licence to operate.  The court did not dictate what form that consideration should take or the outcome of any such reconsideration. However, to provide a degree of objectivity, far beyond what was necessary for the process, my predecessor decided to ask outside technical experts to analyse the application.  This was partly because the main difficulty about the use of deflector systems from the beginning has always been the technical one, that is, the inevitable <Col N="422" /> congestion that would be caused in the broadcasting frequency band.  The consultants' report is about a technical analysis for my consideration in the course of the decision-making process as regards the South Coast Community TV application.</P>
    <P>I am now obliged to give due consideration to this application in the light of all the relevant issues, including those that are the subject of the report.  The report does not contain any imperatives because the consultants were not asked to make any decisions or recommendations on the main issues.  All the decisions to be taken in these matters fall within my statutory remit.  There is no analysis of the MMDS system or of any other application as such.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, hope people will not be led by speculation into a belief that this report provides clear-cut solutions to all our problems.  This evening one commentator &mdash; an interested party &mdash; spoke of the decision of the EBU inspectors in the Carrigaline case and said they would recommend that Carrigaline be allowed a licence. That is not the content of the report or what the consultants were asked to do.  The report is a complex document dealing with complex issues and it will take time to digest.  I have not leaked its contents selectively or otherwise.  Ministers do not generally publish the advice they receive.  I will give a copy of the report to South Coast Community TV because it is its application that is the subject of the report.  I will give some thought, when I have had a chance to study the report, to wider publication of its contents to interested parties for consultation purposes before I make a final decision.  The last thing we need in rationally settling the deflector issue is superficial and partisan analysis of a highly technical report dealing with just one application.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress again that this report is an examination of technical matters which bear on the South Coast Community TV application. We are talking primarily about those matters that concern radio frequency interference and radio resource allocation.  These technical aspects are not the only ones to be considered.  Just as there are competing interests at stake in this area, there are also competing economic, administrative and legal aspects to be taken into account, including our obligations under international treaties governing the assignment of broadcasting frequencies and, most of all, the existing legislation which was introduced by Deputy Raphael Burke.  It is my job to take all of these into account and to make a balanced judgment in the interests of society.  It may be that I will have to take advice on some non-technical issues also.</P>
    <P>In the time available to me to read the report since receiving it, I have come to the view that a tremendous amount of work has had to be invested in the technical analysis of this one application. I am not surprised at this because radio frequency interference analysis is complex and time consuming work.  There are many variables involved in the radio planning process.  It is clear <Col N="423" /> that such analysis is necessary and it will become increasingly difficult if we fit unplanned services into the broadcasting bands beside the four national services which are being progressively rolled out.</P>
    <P>My only comment on the other deflector systems around the country is that in coming to a decision about the South Coast Community TV application, I will have regard to the implications of and for deflector systems generally.  Beyond that, however, I have no intention of becoming embroiled in controversy or legal proceedings that arise from the operation of deflector systems and, indeed, it would not be conducive to a speedy decision in the South Coast Community TV case to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the totally inadequate rail service which my constituents from Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk, Donabate, Malahide and Portmarnock are forced to use when going to and from work, college and school.  The trains are overcrowded, the service is inadequate, the timetable is unsuitable and the passengers are concerned for their safety. I want action from the Government and from CIE management to provide a satisfactory rail service.</P>
      <P>Lest the Dáil think these complaints are my view, I did a survey of rail users on Tuesday, 11 February and received a huge response which indicated the public's frustration.  When asked if they felt the rail service was adequate, 79 per cent said no; if there was overcrowding on their regular train, 96 per cent replied yes; if the timetable was to their satisfaction, 71 per cent said no; if they were concerned for their safety on the trains, 60 per cent said yes.  The level of concern for safety increased among passengers boarding at stations nearer the city by which stage there is only standing room left on the trains.  I travel on the trains and fully understand the views of my constituents.  To be fair to CIE, 82 per cent felt that the trains were generally on time; 54 per cent regarded the service as value for money and 53 per cent felt that station facilities were adequate.</P>
      <P>The main suggestions made by my constituents to improve the rail service in north County Dublin were as follows: more carriages and trains at peak times; later trains from the city in the evenings; a Sunday train service; later trains on Saturday evenings; a proper public address system on trains and platforms; better access for the disabled; smoking bans to be enforced; improved station facilities such as public telephones, security in car parks, proper toilet facilities, automatic ticket machines and better lighting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One issue of major concern has been expressed to me &mdash; the inability of CIE to respond to the unexpected.  For example, on 18 November last an empty passenger train was derailed which meant it was not possible to run trains between <Col N="424" /> Killester and Connolly station.  On 21 November the 7.35 a.m. train from Dundalk failed outside Harmonstown and needed a locomotive from Pearse station.  On each of these occasions the response from CIE was pathetic.  On the first occasion, the bus transfer system was an abject failure and, on the second, passengers were left sitting on the train for hours due to a delay in the arrival of the promised locomotive.  The least passengers are entitled to is an efficient emergency response when the unexpected occurs.  CIE management should and must be properly organised and have systems in place to provide an efficient response which includes regular and accurate information.</P>
    <P>I have been pressing CIE for a considerable period to carry out improvements to meet the expressed needs of north County Dublin rail users.  It stated in response to my queries: &ldquo;CIE is starved of resources...and simply cannot provide the quality transport service our customers deserve&rdquo;.  I do not accept these excuses.  CIE management has a responsibility to organise its affairs in such a manner as to meet the reasonable expectations that when a customer buys a ticket he or she will at least have a seat on a safe, clean train with proper toilet facilities.</P>
    <P>The Government also has a responsibility in the matter.  I call on the Minister to provide sufficient funding as a matter of urgency to allow CIE to purchase additional carriages and extend platforms to enable my constituents to have the service for which they are paying.  I assure him and the rail users of my constituency that if he does not do so immediately, my party will in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the transport Acts, the provision of transport services is a matter for Córas Iompar Éireann and its operating subsidiary companies. The issues which the Deputy raised clearly relate to operational aspects which are legally the responsibility of Iarnród Éireann.  The fact that an annual Exchequer subvention forms part of the resources available to Iarnród Éireann does not and cannot in any way alter the fact that the legal and practical responsibility for all aspects of the running of the railway falls on Iarnród Éireann.  I have no function in such matters.</P>
      <P>The State makes substantial resources available to Córas Iompar Éireann in support of the range of socially necessary services which cannot be operated by the companies within the group on a commercial basis.  This year these resources amount to £105 million.  The Deputy cannot, therefore, talk about the inadequacy of the annual subsidy made available by the State.  The disbursement of these funds to the individual companies is a matter for the CIE board and subsequent allocation in support of particular areas of operation is a matter for those companies. These are internal matters for the group and, again, I have no function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> I now turn to the specific rail services to which the Deputy referred.  In line with population growth and increasing congestion on the roads, the demand for commuter services has risen substantially. Iarnród Éireann has responded by assigning additional capacity to the corridor in terms of extra services and longer trains.</P>
    <P>Since we are talking about rush hour services, it is hardly surprising that heavy loadings are involved.  This is the norm on commuter trains worldwide.  It is disingenuous to suggest that services of this kind can be provided on a sustainable and cost effective basis by any transport operator if maximum use is not made of available resources.  All public transport operators must strike a balance between the capacity required to meet demand at peak times and that needed in off-peak times.  It would be unrealistic to expect Iarnród Éireann to purchase trains which would be used at peak times only and lie idle most of the time.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggests that the current arrangements present a safety hazard.  I assure him and the general public that Iarnród Éireann regards safety as a matter of paramount importance.  I am advised that high loading factors such as those experienced on Dublin's suburban train services at peak hours do not jeopardise safety as regards breaking power or the body strength of the trains in question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> Rolling stock on the Balbriggan-Dublin line has been upgraded substantially in recent years and much of it is now of mainline inter-city standard. A natural desire by the Deputy to present the best case he can should not lead him to make irresponsible allegations which would have the effect of raising unfounded safety concerns on the part of the travelling public.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann is very much alive to the need to develop and improve the quality of the service it offers to customers and this applies to Dublin's northern suburban line as much as to any other sector of the national rail network.  The line has already benefited from the investment in recent years in track work and signalling as part of the Dublin-Belfast project.  Looking to the future, the company has plans to increase capacity and comfort for northern suburban passengers through the introduction of additional services and new rolling stock, including the proposed extension of the DART service to Malahide which is scheduled for completion in 1999.</P>
    <P>I heartily welcome the company's positive commitment to making optimum use of existing and planned additional resources in delivering quality, safe and cost effective services to its customers on Dublin's northern line.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 February 1997.</P>

      <Quest>the current position of the ongoing process of urbanisation and corresponding rural depopulation; and the range of measures, if any, he has in place to counter this trend.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The nature of the growth of urban areas and associated rural population issues such as distribution, dependant age structures and settlement patterns are interrelated and complex matters.</P>
      <P>Rural depopulation is of particular importance to the west.  Equally, patterns of congestion and associated social problems in urban areas are a source of concern.  The socio-economic issues that arise as a consequence of these phenomena are being tackled across a wide range of Government policies which aim to address all areas of disadvantage, both urban and rural.</P>
      <P>The local development programme, which is the responsibility of the Minister for European Affairs and local development, is designed to tackle disadvantage in designated areas.</P>
      <P>The programme adopts an integrated approach towards addressing problems identified locally. Funding is provided on the basis of area action plans drawn up following local consultations. Areas are identified on the basis of objective indicators, including age dependency.  This means that areas where emigration was a factor were designated.  All area partnerships are now in place and funding of £76.5 million has been allocated to partnerships to the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>My contribution to the issue of depopulation relates particularly to the western region.  I am overseeing the implementation of a number of initiatives which have an important contribution to make to the regeneration of the region.  A western investment fund is being established which will make available long-term venture capital and equity for developing businesses in the region.  The Western Development Commission has been appointed to promote the economic and social development of the region and add value to the work already being done by State agencies and local development organisations in the region.  In addition, a pilot programme on public service provision has been set up to test models of best practice in the delivery of public services to less populated rural areas involving local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a recommendation in the National Economic and Social Council in its report, New Approaches to Rural Development, the Government requested the council to undertake a study of socio-demographic trends and settlement patterns. The study aims to inform policy in relation to rural development and regional policy and national level social and economic policy; identify <Col N="428" /> the consequences for settlement patterns of present public policies at regional, national and EU levels; and identify the priorities for public policy if a balanced national population pattern is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The NESC study will result in a clearer understanding of the mechanisms and forces which underpin the changes affecting urban and rural populations and will have a significant influence on the formulation of future economic and social policies.</P>

These grants are allocated on the basis of prioritised projects selected by the relevant local authorities islands committees and following an assessment of the merits and quality of each individual project proposed. This year the Government has made available an additional £1 million for priority infrastructural projects.  This funding is available to all offshore islands and there is no distinction made for islands in a Gaeltacht area.</P>
      <P>In line with previous administrations, the Government recognises the unique position of the Irish language and culture in Irish society and the role it plays in defining our identity.  The Government will continue to lead and support initiatives which promote the use of the Irish language and the Development of Irish culture.</P>
      <P>The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and Údarás na Gaeltachta have special responsibilities in relation to the Gaeltacht islands in the context of their overall responsibilities for the Gaeltacht region.

      <P>The Law Reform Commission recommendation concerning the need for a new cause of action in respect of defamatory statements made about a person who is dead at the time of publication of those statements consisted of three main elements: the right to institute defamation proceedings in such a case should be vested solely in the personal representative of the deceased who would be under a statutory obligation to consult the immediate family of the deceased before instituting proceedings; the period of limitation within which proceedings must be instituted should be three years from the death of the allegedly defamed person, and the only remedy available should be a declaratory order and, where appropriate, an injunction.</P>
      <P>This is one among many proposals for change which were made by the Law Reform Commission. There are divided views on the wisdom of having such a cause of action and I have an open mind on the matter.  It is one of many matters I will consider in the context of my overall review of this area.  However, I have other legislative priorities and work on defamation has to be accommodated within those priorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 68 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department operates a scheme of grants for the purpose of assisting voluntary organisations which provide marriage counselling services and child counselling services where the parents have separated.  The sum of £900,000 has been made available in 1997 to my Department for this purpose.  Application forms for the 1997 grants were issued recently by my Department and I hope to be in a position to arrange for the early payment of the first instalment of the 1997 grant to those organisations that meet the eligibility criteria attaching to the scheme of grants. No completed applications forms have been returned to my Department to date and consideration of the amount of grant that will be paid to individual organisations must await the scrutiny <Col N="432" /> of the grant application forms when they are received in the Department.</P>
    <P>As these services are provided by voluntary organisations it would not be appropriate for me to instruct them to provide additional services. They may, however, be encouraged by the financial assistance which they receive from my Department to respond to developing needs.  I am not considering any alterations to the existing scheme of marriage and child counselling grants for 1997.</P>
    <P>Family mediation is a professional confidential service which enables couples who have decided to separate or who have already separated to negotiate their own separation agreement with the help of a trained mediator, without resorting to adjudication through the courts.  All issues are included in the negotiations, such as ongoing parenting of the children, the family home, family finances, pensions, property and any other issues relevant to the separation.</P>
    <P>Any money available for mediation is used in the running of the family mediation service, which is operated by my Department.  Expenditure on the family mediation service in 1996 was approximately £232,000 and £300,000 is available for this purpose in 1997, having regard to the development plan for the service.</P>
    <P>The first stage of the programme for the development and expansion of the family mediation service is almost complete.  A new service co-ordinator was appointed on 4 November 1996.  The new post of area mediation co-ordinator for the new centre at Mill House, Henry Street, Limerick, was filled on 2 December 1996 and the appointment of an area mediation co-ordinator to the existing family mediation centre at the Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin, will be made during the coming week. The persons appointed will be responsible for delivery of a quality mediation service, with the assistance of a team of mediators, each for his or her own geographical areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>With the management structure in place it is now possible to proceed with the recruitment of further staff for the service and this is proceeding apace.  In this regard, Deputies may have noticed advertisements recently in the national newspapers, and in some provincial newspapers, seeking applications for positions as part-time mediators with the family mediation service.</P>
    <P>The appointment of area mediation co-ordinators would also facilitate the establishment of a scheme for the use of mediators in private practice, who have the necessary training and experience and otherwise meet the standards set by the family mediation service, to provide family mediation at locations distant from a family mediation centre or to relieve pressure on the centres at Dublin or Limerick as required.  The allocation of cases to private mediators would be done through the family mediation service.  By these means I expect that in time a truly national quality mediation service will be available to <Col N="433" /> couples wishing to negotiate their own separation agreements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no authoritative source of data on the current level of child care facilities.  Such information as does exist does not differentiate between child care facilities or parents with family responsibilities to enable participation in the workplace, in education or training or for any other reason.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that provisions of child care facilities should have a child centre rather than a working parent centre of focus.  For this reason the Department of Health is the primary authority in overseeing child care arrangements. Statutory arrangements for the compulsory registration of certain child care facilities with local health boards are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health.  The Deputy may wish to put a question to the Minister for Health on the level of registered child care facilities.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need for child care facilities for parents with family responsibilities to enable them to participate in the workplace or undertake education or training.  The pilot child care initiative which I set up in 1994 has sought to address this issue by providing grant assistance to delelop new and innovative child care projects in disadvantaged areas.  To date grants totalling £1,850,000 have been issued to 109 approved projects.</P>
      <P>The first tranche of funding under the initiative, which comprised £1,250,000 to 73 projects, was the subject of an evaluation which was published recently.  This evaluation indicates that nearly 2,000 additional children are being cared for by the projects funded under the initiative.  It is clear therefore, that the pilot child care initiative has made a very significant impact in stimulating expansion of capacity in child care facilities. Following publication of the evaluator's report on 7 February last I am considering how best to progress the child care initiative.  In doing so I will obviously bear in mind developments generally in the provision of child care facilities including those arising from recent statutory registration developments with the health authorities.</P>

      <P>I have set out in a tabular statement, which I propose to circulate in the Official Report, the waiting times as at 31 January last at 28 of the board's 30 full-time law centres. Because the two remaining law centres, at Tullamore and Newbridge, only opened at the end of January, figures are not yet available for them.</P>
      <P>A number of factors should assist in improving the waiting lists in the future.  The impact of the two centres opened last month as well as the two opened at the end of last year has yet to be fully felt, particularly in adjacent law centres.  In addition, new heads of staff have recently come on stream in accordance with the development plan for the service.  The board is also seeking to extend the private practitioners scheme outside the Dublin area, to which it is currently confined. Extension of the scheme would have a significant impact on waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Waiting times are continually reviewed by the board.  Where waiting times, for whatever reasons, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action where possible.  The board operates a system for giving priority attention to domestic violence cases and to certain classes of cases involving children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work is progressing in the Legal Aid Board on the collating and analysis of statistical returns from the law centres in respect of 1996, in preparation for the publication later this year of the board's annual report for 1996.  Until this work is complete it will not be possible for the board to identify what proportion of cases it processed in <Col N="435" /> 1996 were family law cases.  I can say, however, that if the pattern of previous years is maintained, as I expect it will be, then the figures will be in the region of 97 per cent for court cases and 90 per cent for legal advice cases.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a previous Dáil question from Deputy Harney on 7 November 1996, a special study published in 1994 by the ESRI provided a greatly enhanced insight into the average gap between men's and women's hourly earnings generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other main official source of data on male/female wage differentials is the Central Statistics Office which publishes figures regularly on the hourly earnings rates of production workers in manufacturing industry.  The latest figures available, for March 196, show the average hourly rate for women in this area is nearly 74 per cent of that for men.  The equivalent 1991 figures showed women's hourly rates at 69 per cent of men's.  While such a trend is most welcome I am <Col N="436" /> only too well aware that this data only relates to less than one fifth of all female employees.</P>
    <P>In order to secure a more accurate picture of the male/female differential generally across the sectors I have undertaken to seek to update the ESRI 1994 report which was commissioned jointly by my Department and the Employment Equality Agency.  That study found that taking all sectors into account women's hourly earnings were 80 per cent of men's and that half the 20 per cent difference is explained by differences in productivity related factors such as length of labour market experience.  The unexplained gap of 10 per cent reflects a lack of knowledge on the impact of wage determination processes and probably some element of discrimination.  This follow up study responds to a specific commitment in Partnership 2000 which was recently negotiated with social and community partners. My Department is currently consulting the Employment Equality Agency so that the forthcoming study can shed further light on the wage differential phenomenon.</P>

      <P>Expenditure on consultancies by my Department in 1995 and 1996 to the Pensions Board, QMP, MRBI, and Mr. Michael Keegan has been provided in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 135 of 28 January 1997 as reported in Volume 473, No. 6 at columns 1745 to 1747 of the Official Report; and expenditure on a consultancy to TCD has been provided in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 130 and 132 of 21 May 1996, as reported in volume 465, No. 6, at columns 1592 to 1594 of the Official Report.  In addition Destination Ireland received a sum of £19,495 to organise two conferences in connection with the EU Presidency and Ms A. Colgan received £35,300 to advise the Department on disability.</P>
      <P>These figures are exclusive of expenditure incurred by bodies which operate under the aegis of my Department and by other bodies which have connections with but are independent of my Department, viz. the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, the Travellers Task Force, and ADM Limited in relation to the report on the pilot child care initiative.  Many of the consultants were engaged for the purpose of providing services, conducting polls, etc. and no formal report was required.  Only one such report was furnished and its cost was integrated in the cost of the consultancy.  Accordingly, the cost of the report cannot be isolated from the other consultancy costs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 69 together.  The requirement under section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995 to give three months notice of intention to marry has been in effect since 1 August 1996.  The requirement is in line with commitments made in response to the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marital Breakdown in 1985, in the Government statement of intent on divorce in 1986, in the White Paper on Marriage Breakdown in 1992 and in the Government paper on <i>&ldquo;The Right to Remarry&rdquo;</i> in 1995.</P>
      <P>While the vast majority of cases under this requirement have given rise to no difficulties, in a small number of cases difficulties have arisen specifically relating to giving the notice to the wrong registrar.  In such circumstances a doubt has arisen as the validity of the marriage concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has approved my proposals for the drafting of a Family Law Bill the purpose of which is to provide for the restrospective validation of marriages where such difficulties have <Col N="439" /> arisen, and to amend the law on notification of intention to marry so as to provide a procedure in the future for rectification of administrative errors.  Arrangements are now in place for formal drafting of the legislation.  I propose to bring forward the legislation as soon as possible in the near future.</P>

      <Col N="440" /> The CSO's most recent population and labour force projections, published in 1995, forecast that the total labour force would grow to between 1,537,000 and 1,619,000, depending mainly on the assumptions made about the level of net migration.  The number of women in the labour force in 2006 was projected at between 583,000 and 616,000, representing 38 per cent of the labour force.</P>
    <P>However, the projections for the overall labour force and for the percentage of women in the labour force in 1996 have both already been exceeded.  There were 540,200 women in the labour force, representing 36.6 per cent of the labour force, in April 1996.  This compares with the projection for 1996 of 508,700 or 35.5 per cent.</P>

      <P>Ireland has participated in the US Visa Waiver Pilot Programme since 1 April 1995.  In practice, this means that over 90 per cent of Irish people travelling to the US for visits of up to 90 days are no longer required to have visas.  There is no minimum age limit involved and as far as we know the US authorities do not intend setting one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain people, including those whose visa applications were previously turned down or people who were deported from the US do not qualify for visa waivers and must apply to the US Embassy for non-immigrant visas in the normal way.  I would advise anyone who has any doubts <Col N="441" /> about their eligibility for a visa waiver to contact the US Embassy and seek its advice well in advance of their proposed departure date.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the visa waiver pilot programme, visa waiver applicants automatically waive any right to appeal an immigration officer's subsequent decision to refuse them entry to the US.  We have been assured by the US Embassy, however, that in the relatively few cases where entry is refused to Irish people, this is done only after very careful consideration of the applications in question.</P>

      <Quest>if the policy of discouraging the listing of property for revision of valuation, as disclosed in his reply to parliamentary questions on 5 February 1997, is likely to lead to an uneven and unreliable base on commercial property leaving that base open to challenge in the courts, with consequences similar to the challenge some years ago against the rateable valuations on land.</Quest>

      <P>As they are closely related, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 49, 50, 51, 52, 53 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;blanket listing&rdquo; in this context refers to listings originating from intense canvassing of ratepayers by certain rating consultancy firms or blocks of listing of closely related property types by certain rating consultancy firms.  In general, &ldquo;blanket listings&rdquo; do not emanate from rating authorities.</P>
      <P>The Valuation Office records are not organised in a way in which they will be readily able to provide the requested statistics and their compilation would involve an unreasonable input of Valuation Office time, staff and resources.  I am satisfied that the effort involved would not be justified by reference to the usefulness of the statistics compiled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of preventing either occupiers of property or rating authorities from making requests for the revision of rateable valuation. Both parties can still make such requests and all revision applications will be processed by the Valuation Office.  The issue here is the concentration of finite resources on areas of greatest need.  The resources of the Valuation Office are not infinite and it is proper that these resources should be deployed to the optimum benefit of both rate-payers and the local authorities.  The Valuation Act, 1988, gives the Minister for Finance the power to determine fees for revision applications. As I indicated in my answer to the Deputy's parliamentary questions on 5 Februry last, the rationale for the recent revision of the revision application fee is essentially twofold: (i) by encouraging both occupiers and rating authorities to confine revision applications to cases where substantial valuation issues arise and-or where the properties involved were actually liable to rates, to allow Valuation Office resources to be concentrated on those applications where most work was needed or justified; and (ii) to effect a <Col N="443" /> greater recovery of the costs to the Valuation Office of operating the revision process.</P>
    <P>The question of an uneven and unreliable base emerging on commercial properties does not arise.  Section 5 of the Valuation Act, 1986, requires, among other things, that all valuation be made by reference to recently revised premises.</P>

      <P>The Department of Finance is currently finalising a circular for issue to Departments and offices on Information Technology systems and the Year 2000. This will ask Departments-offices to verify the Year 2000 compliance status of their IT infrastructures and systems.</P>
      <P>For non-compliant items Departments-offices will be asked to draw up plans to migrate to Year 2000 compliance and to submit them to this Department to enable it to advise Government of developments.  The objective is to ensure that all Departmental IT infrastructures and systems are Year 2000 compliant by January 1999, or earlier for those systems that process multi-century dates in this century.</P>
      <P>An advice note on how to determine the Year 2000 compliance of IT infrastructures and systems, and on how to draw up a Year 2000 Compliance Plan will be issued with the circular.  Some Departments, for example, Department of Social Welfare, Revenue Commissioners, have already completed this planning exercise.</P>
      <P>Departments are also asked to take steps to ensure that the problem is not introduced in already compliant IT infrastructures and systems by adopting multi-century date standards and by procuring only Year 2000 compliant products-services. In this regard, the Centre for Management and Organisation Development (CMOD) of this Department made available to Departments-offices, in 1996, a Year 2000 compliance clause for use in procurements.</P>
      <P>A special interest group on the Year 2000, chaired by this Department, was also set up last year, and meets each month.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recent upward trend in house prices.  This trend is related to a number of factors, including low interest rates, rising real incomes and substantial increases in the number at work.  House prices are set on the open market, and are not subject to any official controls.  I will be keeping the situation in the housing market under active review with my colleague the Minister for the Environment.  There are, of course, a number of official policy instruments which can affect the housing market, and their deployment from time to time can influence prices.  In this context I expect that the increase in stamp duty on purchases of certain higher valued residential property which was introduced in the budget should have a moderating effect on price increases for such residential property.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of Partnership 2000, wage earners can look forward to significant real increases in disposable income over the next three years, delivered through a combination of moderate nominal pay increases and substantial tax reductions.</P>
      <P>I would draw to the Deputy's attention the fact that mortgage interest relief is available to any taxpayer in respect of interest paid on moneys borrowed for the purchase, maintenance, repair or improvement of that taxpayer's main residence. Relief is available in respect of allowable interest up to a ceiling of £2,500 for single persons and £5,000 for married couples.  For first-time mortgage holders, 100 per cent relief is allowable up to the relevant ceiling for the first five years. Otherwise relief is allowable in respect of 80 per cent of the allowable interest reduced further by a <i>de minimus</i> exclusion of £100 for single persons and £200 for married couples.</P>
      <P>The standard rating of mortgage interest relief on a phased basis is currently being implemented. In the tax year 1997-98 mortgage interest relief will be fully standard rated, that is, relieved at 26 per cent for all taxpayers.  The current mortgage interest relief, which is estimated to cost the Exchequer around £110 million in the 1997 tax year, is of significant benefit to home buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Partnership 2000 contains no provision for additional compensation or reliefs for wage earners by reference to house price increases, and I <Col N="445" /> have no plans to give any such additional compensation or reliefs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The establishment of a new statutory based food safety board with executive powers was one of the principal recommendations of the interdepartmental group on food safety controls established by the Government last March.  The Deputy will be aware this recommendation was accepted by the Government in October and the processing of the legislation is now at an advanced stage in my Department.</P>
      <P>Because the introduction of the necessary legislation would take some time, it was decided that the new body &mdash; to be known as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland &mdash; should be immediately established on an interim non-statutory basis.  On 6 November, I announced the membership of the interim board of the authority which is being chaired by Dr. Daniel O'Hare.  The interim board is charged with establishing the structures and formulating the work programme for the new statutory body in order that some of the ground work will have been completed when the statutory body commences to operate.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the new authority is to ensure that the highest standards of food safety and hygiene are observed and that the regulations and controls are properly enforced by the various State agencies.  To this end, I propose that the authority will have four main functions.</P>
      <P>To identify and, where necessary, supplement, the legally binding standards and criteria relevant to food safety and hygiene and have these published and recognised as enforceable by the authority; to carry out audits to determine the effectiveness of the food control systems operated by the official agencies with primary responsibility in the relevant area and assess the level of enforcement and compliance with these controls.  The authority will publish reports of such audits and inspections; to carry out a range of other functions relating to data collection, research and coordination of services, and to subsume the role and functions of the current Food Safety Advisory Board and, as such, act as a major source of advice to myself and other Ministers on food safety and other matters relating to food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> To carry out these functions and, in particular, its audits and inspections, the authority and its staff will be given extensive powers, including power of entry, power to take samples and seize documentation as well as power to close premises and to order the withdrawal of products.  The authority will also have extensive powers of prosecution both in relation to deficiencies which it identifies during its audits and for obstruction in the carrying out of its duties.</P>
    <P>These comprehensive proposals will meet the demands for a body sufficiently independent and powerful to verify the standards of good practice throughout the food industry in the areas of food safety and hygiene.  As framed, the proposals allow for maximum flexibility and ensures, within the precepts of public accountability, that the authority will be independent in the discharge of its functions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as is the case in the semi-State sector generally, day-to-day matters relating to the recruitment and employment of staff by the Food Safety Authority will be an executive function of that body and not a matter in which I, as Minister, have a direct function.  However, the legislation being drafted by my Department provides that the authority will have a complement of staff &mdash; technical, professional and administrative &mdash; reflecting the range of disciplines relevant to the areas in which the authority has competence.  The authority will also have the capacity to engage consultants and-or contract out work, if appropriate.</P>
    <P>A permanent premises has not yet been acquired for the Food Safety Authority.  As regards the taking on of staff, I understand that the interim board has recruited two staff on a temporary, contract basis: a part-time acting chief executive and a secretary.  The post of full-time chief executive of the authority has been advertised by the interim board in the news media and interviews for the position have taken place.  The authority will undertake recruitment to other positions at a later date.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): My Department and the health boards provide assistance in a number of ways to the Rehab Group, which is a private, voluntary, not-for-pro-fit organisation, to improve the employment prospects for people with disabilities.  The National Training and Development Institute which is a division of the Rehab Group provides vocational training programmes for people with disabilities and develops and manages sheltered work enterprises for people with disabilities who are unable to access open employment.  Funding for the sheltered work enterprises is provided by means of section 65 grants and capitation grants.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am aware of the article referred to by the Deputy which was merely a commentary on some studies in the United States.  Other studies have <Col N="448" /> shown that any savings resulting from the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors &mdash; SSRIs &mdash; are offset by the higher costs of these drugs and have indicated that further studies are required before any firm conclusions can be drawn.  No pharmacoeconomic analysis of SSRIs versus tricyclic antidepressants &mdash; TCAs &mdash; has been carried out in this country.</P>
      <P>The prescribing of drugs for the treatment of depression is a matter for the individual doctor who has the duty and obligation to provide the most appropriate management for each patient. While the indicative drug target scheme offers doctors incentives to engage in cost effective prescribing, the right of the doctor to prescribe, as he-she considers necessary remains absolutely in place.  In this context the targets are increased annually to take account specifically of the newer more expensive drugs, including SSRIs, coming on the market.</P>
      <P>A recent fact sheet on prescribing for depression issued to medical practitioners by the National Medicines Information Centre indicated that while SSRIs and TCAs are equally effective in treating depression, as the side effects differ, the choice of therapy will depend on the patient's symptoms and other conditions.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> It is the Government's intention that retired nurses and other public servants will benefit from the local bargaining clause of the PCW pay agreement.  The pay proposals developed to date involve an element of restructing, as provided for under the local bargaining clause of the PCW pay agreement.  This applies to nurses and many other groups such as civil servants, clerical and administrative grades in the health boards and local authorities, teachers, gardaí etc. who have concluded or are concluding agreements under the restructuring option of the PCW.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the agreements emerging do not provide for uniform increases across groups and in many cases even within grades. This complicates the position regarding adjustments to pensions and this question will now have to be considered in respect of all affected groups across the public service.

When this general policy issue has been resolved, my Department will be in a position to clarify the adjustments to be made to retired health service staff, including nurses.</P>

      <P>I welcome the recognition contained in Partnership 2000 of the importance of child care in promoting equality for women, and especially in promoting equal opportunities in employment. I am particularly heartened by the proposal for the establishment of an expert working group under Partnership 2000, to be chaired by my Department.  This expert working group will involve the relevant interests in developing a strategy which integrates the different strands of the current arrangements for the development and delivery of child care and early educational services, and in devising a national framework for the development of the child care sector.</P>
      <P>This expert group will consider the conclusions of the working group on the job potential of child care, and the ESRI survey of child care arrangements currently being undertaken on behalf of the Commission on the Family as well as the specific issues set out in Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a positive development which will <Col N="451" /> greatly improve the prospects for more interagency co-operation on child care.  I can assure the Deputy that the expert group will have my full support in its endeavours.</P>

      <P>The red deer herd at Killarney is the only indigenous deer herd in Ireland and is accorded full protection under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  The general policy objective is to ensure the continued health of the herd and to maintain the population at a level which is compatible with the effective conservation of the natural ecosystem of which it forms part.  The herd has increased from dangerously low levels in the 1960s to its present level of 647 animals.  The number of animals and their habitats are monitored on a continuous basis both in the uplands and in the lowlands.  As a result of this monitoring and in the absence of natural predators the herd appears to have outgrown its range and accordingly it has become necessary to control population levels.</P>
      <P>In the season 1995-96 34 red deer were culled. In the current season 1996-97 60 red deer have been culled.  Some 21 of the 60 culled in 1996-97 were removed from land belonging to Killarney Golf and Fishing Club.  These deer were removed under licence under the Wildlife Act by expert staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department.  The deer were removed at the initiative of NPWS staff in line with the policy objectives outlined above and contained in the Killarney National Park management plan.</P>

      <P>A proposal has been made to the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department by the Castlerosse Hotel Limited, to swap 22.7 acres of State-owned land in Killarney National Park adjoining Knockreer in exchange for 23.4 acres of privately owned woodland in the area for inclusion in Killarney National Park.

    <P>A display has been mounted in Killarney in order to facilitate public consideration of the matter. The NPWS wrote to various interest groups asking them to contribute to this display so that <Col N="453" /> a variety of views should be available to stimulate public discussion.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that this is simply the first step in obtaining views on the matter.  It was felt that the particular details of the proposal would be best understood by local groups and individuals who would be familiar with the area in question and in a position to provide a cross section of views.  For this reason the advertisement seeking submissions was concentrated in local newspapers in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>All local Deputies have been sent copies of the documents on display and asked for their views. The views of broader national groups have not been neglected however.  An Taisce was invited to submit its comments for the public display in Killarney and the NPWS has written to the Heritage Council seeking its views on the proposal.</P>

      <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department is both the Management and Scientific Authority for this country for the purposes of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  The convention <Col N="454" /> is implemented in this country under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3626/82 of 3 December 1982 on the implementation in the Community of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2727/95 of 27 November 1995.  CITEs regulates trade in species of wild fauna and flora on the basis of a system of permits and certificates, which are issued when certain conditions are met and which have to be presented when consignments of specimens leave or enter a country.  The Siberian Tiger (Pathera tigris) is protected under the terms of the convention and the Council regulation.</P>
      <P>An application for the issue of an export permit for the tiger cub in question was submitted to the NPWS on 30 December 1996.  Further information was requested by the NPWS from the applicant by letter dated 6 January 1997.  The applicant was subsequently advised by letter dated 10 January 1997 that the application for an export permit could not be processed until such time as the CITES Management Authority for the country of import (United States) was in a position to issue a reciprocal import permit for the tiger cub.  The United States CITES Management Authority yesterday confirmed to the NPWS that it has now received an application for an import permit which it is currently considering. I am satisfied that the NPWS has enforced the terms of the Council regulation.  The delay in relocating the tiger cub in question would appear to be due to the delay by the importer in the United States in complying with the relevant requirements of the United States CITES Management Authority.</P>
      <P>I propose to include in the forthcoming Wildlife (Amendment) Bill the necessary provisions to enable me to formally ratify the CITES Convention and I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill within the next few months.</P>

    <P>Is comhartha é bunú Theilifís na Gaeilge de na hiarrachtaí atá ar bun chun úsáid na Gaeilge a leathnú.  Is fianaise í bunú na seirbhíse nua sin go n-aithníonn an Rialtas go bhfuil sé de cheart ag daoine, a roghnaíonn an Ghaeilge mar ghnáththeanga laethúil, teacht a bheith acu, sa teanga sin, ar earnáil chraoltóireachta theilifíse.</P>
    <P>Maidir le léamh na Gaeilge a spreagadh tá cúnamh substaintiúil leanúnach le fáil ó mo Roinnse trí Bhord na Leabhar Gaeilge don fhoilsitheoireacht i nGaeilge. Tá athbhreithniú bunúsach le déanamh ag an mBord ar Scéim Bhord na Leabhar Gaeilge maidir lena chumas chun leabhair thaitneamhacha shuimiúla i nGaeilge (nach leabhair scoile iad) a chur ar fáil do phobal léitheoireacht na Gaeilge agus tá tuairimí lucht léite, na ndáileoirí, na bhfoilsitheoirí agus na n-údar le cur san áireamh san athbhreithniú sin.  Tá nuachtán nua Gaeilge <i>Foinse</i> á fhoilsiú ó mhí Dheireadh Fómhair seo caite le cúnamh ó Bhord na Gaeilge agus anuas ar sin tá cúnamh leanúnach á chur fáil ag an mBord mar chabhair chun tréimhseachán Ghaeilge a fhoilsiú.</P>
    <P>Bhunaigh mé Coimisiún chun Ról na nEagras Deonach Gaeilge a scrúdú agus tá tuarascáil an Choimisiúin sin i.e., TREO 2000, díreach foilsithe. Beidh moltaí na tuarascála sin le breithniú go cúramach.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, is gá go nglacfadh an pobal féin páirt níos mó ná mar atá á glacadh aige i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Tá bá iontach ag pobal na tíre don Ghaeilge ach ní leor a bá amháin.  Caithfimid uile iarracht phearsanta leanúnach a dhéanamh lá i ndiaidh lae chun feidhm a bhaint as an méid Gaeilge atá againn cibé chomh meirgeach is atá an Ghaeilge sin.  Ní thig leis an Stát ná le pobal na Gaeilge féin an t-ualach ar fad a iompar. Tá cúnamh ón mórphobal de dhíth freisin.</P>
    <P>Is deacair an dul chun cinn atá déanta a thomhas ó ceapadh mé mar Aire a bhfuil cúram air i leith na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta ach, ar a <Col N="458" /> laghad, tá na bunchlocha leagtha síos agam chun tógáil orthu.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil dul chun cinn nach beag déanta le linn mo thréimhse mar Aire maidir leis an nGaeilge a chur chun tosaigh mar ábhar machnaimh agus díospóireachta.  Tá dóchas agam &mdash; ach cur chuige le fuinneamh agus le díograis &mdash; go bhféadfar dul chun cinn suntasach a dhéanamh de réir a chéile maidir leis an dátheangachas a chur i réim, seirbhísí Stáit a bheith ar fáil ar bhonn níos leithne trí Ghaeilge agus an teanga féin a bhuanú sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>The existing physical education syllabus which has been in operation since 1985 is currently under review by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  Also it is intended to conduct a pilot project in conjunction with the work of the NCCA to investigate issues relating to implementation of a new syllabus.</P>
      <P>Investigation of the feasibility of introducing physical education as an examination subject at junior or leaving certificate level will form part of the proposed pilot project.</P>
      <P>This year, for the first time students will be examined in leisure studies (physical education) as part of their Leaving Certificate examination within the Leaving Certificate Applied programme. The examination which will be both practical and written, will deal with such topics as aquatics, games, outdoor education and leisure studies.</P>

      <P>It is my intention that there should eventually be a psychological service available for all children in schools.  For this reason, there is a policy statement concerning the development of the schools psychological service in the Government White Paper on Education, which envisages the expansion of the psychological service on a phased basis.  The provision of the service is seen as a function of the new education boards.</P>
      <P>There is currently a psychologist from my Department assigned to second level schools in County Clare.  Parents may access this service through the second level school attended by an individual pupil.  Psychologists from this Department serving second level schools carry out assessments and casework as the resources of time and personnel allow.  Pupils and their families who require ongoing therapeutic work may be helped by services of the regional health board or by voluntary agencies funded by the board.</P>
      <P>In general, the responsibility for the psychological assessment of children in national schools, where such is deemed necessary, is a matter for the regional health boards through the appropriate director of community care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A schools psychological service at primary level is being introduced gradually by my Department as resources permit.  At present, this is provided for certain named schools which serve disadvantaged areas in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, in addition to the original pilot service in west Tallaght-Clondalkin and in south Tipperary.  There have been requests for the extension of this service to a number of other areas, including County Clare.  However, due to <Col N="465" /> the need to limit public expenditure, it has not been possible to expand my Department's psychological service further in the recent past.  It will necessarily, be some time before the Department of Education is in a position to take over responsibility for psychological assessments for educational purposes from the health authorities.</P>
    <P>As and when it becomes possible to extend the schools phychological service, the needs of children and of schools in various areas, including County Clare, will be borne in mind.  The number of phychologists appointed in any particular area or county will be related to its identified needs.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the allocation of Garda personnel and resources.  I have been informed by them that the current strength of the National Drugs Unit based at the Dublin Metropolitan Area Headquarters is 38 members and that there are 67 members currently attached to the recently formed National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  Both of these units have a national responsibility &mdash; the National Drugs Unit for drug related matters and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation for major crime.  The strength of both units is subject to ongoing review by the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>In addition to the National Drugs Unit there are district-divisional drugs units operating in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  These local units liaise with the National Drugs Unit which in turn liaises with Interpol and Europol.  There is a Garda inspector assigned permanently to the Europol drugs unit which is based in the Hague and he acts as this country's liaison officer with other member states of the European Union in relation to drugs trafficking and other related matters.  While these units provide an essential specialist response the enforcement of the law, in all respects, including the area of drugs and major crime, is a matter for all members of the force in the course of their normal duties.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Operation Dóchas came into effect in the DMA on 7 October 1996.  I understand from the Garda authorities that it continues to operate with success. The policing arrangements in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, including those relating to drugenforcement, are kept under continuous review by the Garda authorities and any adjustments made as necessary.</P>

      <P>The arrangements by which an extradition request may be made for a person to be extradited to Ireland for prosecution or punishment are governed by international agreements concluded with other countries in accordance with the Extradition Acts 1965-1994.  Apart from the arrangements with the United Kingdom in relation to endorsement and execution of warrants provided in Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, the principal international extradition agreement in this respect is the 1957 European Convention on Extradition.</P>
      <P>Two new EU conventions have been concluded recently in order to facilitate and improve, as between member states of the European Union, on the extradition arrangements provided for in the European Convention.  The first of these, the EU Convention on simplified procedures was formally adopted on 10 March 1995.  This convention deals with the procedures which will apply where a person consents to extradition.  The second convention, the EU Convention relating to Extradition was formally adopted on 27 September, 1996.  This convention improves and simplifies extradition arrangements between member states.  Legislation will be necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the two new conventions.  The appropriate legislation will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>

My Department is not responsible for residence permits but I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, that the provisions regarding the rights of residence of EEA nationals are set out in a number of EC directives which have been transposed into Irish law.  The Irish regulations set down the conditions for the issue or refusal of residence permits to EEA nationals.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 125 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to make a single commencement order to bring the entire Control of Horses Act, 1996 into operation, following which I will make regulations which will enable the local authorities to give effect to the licensing provisions of this legislation.  I anticipate having both these steps completed within a matter of weeks.  As Deputies will be aware, the Act enables the local authorities to make by-laws laying down control measures and declaring all or part of their functional <Col N="471" /> areas to be control areas where horses cannot be kept without a licence.  I would hope that local authorities in whose areas the problem exists will lose no time in implementing these provisions once I have made the commencement order and regulations.</P>
    <P>To fund the implementation of the Act at local authority level, I have made provision for the sum of £2 million in my Department's Estimates for 1997 which will be made available to the local authorities.  The basis of allocation of this funding is being considered and decisions will be made in due course but it would be reasonable to expect that the alloction of funds would have regard to the relative scale of the problem in the various local authority areas.</P>

      <P>Council Directive 79/373/EEC, as amended, provides that compound feedstuffs may not be marketed unless the packaging, the container or the label shows all the ingredients uses in the feed in decending order by weight.  Alternatively compounders have the option of declaring categories of ingredients which are prescribed in the directive.</P>
      <P>Following a meeting in December, 1996, the Irish Grain and Feed Association agreed that its members would declare ingredients in alphabetic order on a voluntary basis.  One of the country's largest animal feed compounders recently announced that it is to label in descending order of inclusion the individual ingredients used in its rations.  While there is no legal requirement to indicate the source of ingredients, I have informed compounders that I am committed to having the fullest possible level of information made available on compound feed.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the hardship grant scheme, a herdowner whose holding is restricted under either the TB or brucellosis eradication schemes and who, <i>inter alia</i>, is not supplying any milk for sale at the time of application, is eligible to be considered for hardship payments.  However, any subsequent supply of milk for sale at any time after the herdowner is deemed eligible for hardship grant will render the herdowner ineligible from the first date of supply of milk.</P>
      <P>The second person referred to by the Deputy is the registered herdowner.  A hardship grant application from this person dated 31 October 1996 was received in the local district veterinary office on 4 November 1996.  Information obtained by the local district veterinary office during the processing stage of the application, confirms that the herdowner continued to supply milk for sale from 4 November 1996 onwards.  The herdowner was therefore deemed ineligible for a hardship grant and has been notified accordingly by the local district veterinary office.</P>

Representation is from the farming sector, universities and colleges, environmental and energy consultants, agricultural agencies and Government Departments.  Membership is drawn from both sides of the Border.  The group is working to identify the barriers to agricultural based biomass energy development.
