      <P>It is proposed to take No. 2a, Children Bill, 1997, Second Stage (Resumed) and No. 8a, statements on the 1996 annual report of the Ombudsman.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 8a: (1) the opening statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokes-persons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (2) the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (3) Members may share time, and (4) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes.</P>

      <P>When does the Taoiseach propose to introduce the legislation promised on 22 July to establish an ethics commission?  Why is legislation to update the most recent legislation on corruption, which dates from 1916, not included in the Government's legislative programme in view of the need to have on the Statute Book modern legislation dealing with corrupt practices?</P>

      <P>It is vital that the Taoiseach and leaders of Opposition parties have private discussions from time to time.  As I said here over <Col N="1438" /> the past two days, I had no direct information on anybody and that was the source of the discussion. I am not in the habit of making private discussions public.  I do not think it is good practice.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise two items of promised legislation.  One is item 25 in the Government's legislative programme, as published on 25 September, which repeats the intention to interfere with the 1997 Electoral Act which provides for public disclosure of funding to parties and for public funding of parties.  Would the Taoiseach agree that it would be extremely foolish to continue to implement the proposed changes that he and the Progressive Democrats have in mind in relation to that Act?</P>
      <P>On page 22 of the programme for Government the Taoiseach promises that the Ethics in Public Office Act will be amended to apply to local authorities.  When does he intend to introduce that legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, the memorandum has not yet come to Government from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  I understand that it is to come some time in October. The ethics issues will probably be dealt with at the same time as we are looking at the other proposals.</P>

      <P>In reference to my earlier question concerning our conversations, is the Taoiseach aware that a Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, issued a public invitation to me to state why I had gone to the Taoiseach about this matter and drew a number of malicious and false interpretations from the fact that I had done so? It was only because of the malicious and false constructions that Deputy O'Dea put on my conversation with the Taoiseach that it was necessary for me to go public on what the Taoiseach had <Col N="1439" /> actually said to me &mdash; he said he could finger five to nine people.</P>

      <P>In relation to my request for information on the ethics in public office legislation for local authorities, the Taoiseach indicated he would take it in tandem with the other matters referred to.  At the same time, however, he says there may not be proposals in relation to the Electoral Act.  Can he clarify when he proposes to bring forward a Bill to provide for ethics in local authorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is possible to include it in the ethics legislation we will do so.  It would make a lot of sense to try to include both matters in one piece of legislation that would deal with the Ethics Commission and the proposal referred to by the Deputy.  There has been no decision.</P>

    <Title>Children Bill, 1997: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I criticised the Bill for not establishing joint custody as the norm in the case of unmarried fathers.  Joint custody and guardianship should be established as the norm in all areas relating to children, regardless of marital status or the personal relationship of the parents.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome for the approach it takes on the rights and needs of children.  Recognition of the need to take account of the wishes of the child in custody and access matters is a very progressive idea.  In certain quarters it might be considered a revolutionary idea.  It is essential if we are to fully protect the interests of children that this be established.  Too often children have become objects in a tug of love rather than being seen as individuals who are in need of care and attention in a marital or parental dispute.</P>
      <P>Other aspects of the Bill recognise the needs of children.  The taking of evidence by children under 14 years of age without an oath is very significant. This has been problematic in the past. Until now, children who did not understand the concept of an oath might be prevented from giving evidence, or if they did so, the evidence might be treated with suspicion.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the provision to allow the use of video links in civil proceedings.  This is currently the practice only in certain criminal trials. However, I have reservations about the capability of courts outside Dublin to implement it.  Court facilities in many provincial venues are inadequate and antediluvian.  They are not appropriately equipped or laid out to deal with sensitive issues, quite apart from dealing with technology such as videos.  Clearly the Minister will have to tackle this problem if we are to improve physical conditions and facilitate technological requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another measure will allow relatives to apply for access rights to a child.  This is a progressive approach because it formally acknowledges the role which many relatives play in caring for children. The care that they give deserves to be <Col N="1444" /> acknowledged by a right of access to or custody of children.  In many cases where children are at risk or where the family has broken down members of the extended family, grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, etc., can play an important role.  The Minister has indicated that he may consider extending it beyond the blood relatives as defined in the Bill.  I strongly recommend that he look again at that aspect of the Bill because at the end of the day protection is provided by the fact that the decision will be that of a judge.  It may be that somebody who is a relative by marriage, not a blood relative, can end up being the most significant person in a child's life if those who normally have responsibility for that child are unable or unwilling to care for him or her.</P>
    <P>Under section 22 arrangements for certification by a solicitor are similar to the arrangements which are made in separation and divorce proceedings. The code of practice introduced by the Incorporated Law Society will be helpful but we need to reconsider the effectiveness or otherwise of this means of encouraging mediation.  I suspect there is a certain conflict of interest where a solicitor is the medium through which mediation may be approached.  I have not found in my experience that solicitors believe that mediation is a real alternative.  Some may believe it is a service which is in competition with the service which they provide.  Mediation has beneficial effects.  It is an alternative which has not been used sufficiently, one which must be resourced and upgraded if it is to be a serious alternative to the adversarial approach with is clearly dominant at present.</P>
    <P>I suspect we must live with the adversarial approach for quite some time.  If that is the case, the Government must ensure the expansion of the support provided by the free legal aid centres. Recently published figures show that since divorce legislation was introduced the number of people on waiting lists for legal aid has doubled. The last Government had a good record in relation to free legal aid.  Waiting lists were shortened dramatically and new centres were opened. We are now going back to the bad old days.  Some clients of the free legal aid centre in County Wicklow are waiting 11 months for an appointment. That is totally unacceptable, particularly when one considers that this Bill will increase the workload of these centres.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that this Government has absorbed into the Department of Justice the Department of Equality and Law Reform which had responsibility for law centres.  It is a worrying and reactionary move.  This absorption is a backward step.  I am afraid that the supports developed by that new Department in a whole range of areas will be marginalised in the great crusade of the Minister to build more prison places while downgrading the range of services, such as the free legal aid centres, which are provided to ensure equality before the law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> I must express the same concern in relation to the probation and welfare service.  This Minister's mission is to put the maximum number of people into jail.  A better and more effective way to reduce crime would be to aim to keep people out of jail.  Alternatives to jail, particularly for young people, are often more effective and beneficial in the long term both for the individual and society and they are clearly more cost effective.  However, to date, the probation service has been incapable of keeping up with the overwhelming demand for it.  The provision of staff and resources is essential, but the Minister's concentration on increasing spending on prisons augurs badly for improving the capacity and capability of the probation service. The provision under section 26 which allows the District Court to seek probation and welfare reports will create an additional workload.  Will the Minister explain the kind of resources he is providing to ensure this workload will be met?</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 allow for hearsay evidence where a child is too young or is intimidated by the court proceedings.  This is an important provision and reflects the strong recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>Section 25 allows a court to transfer a case to any area where technical facilities are available. In this day and age every court should be computerised with video links available in at least one venue in each District or Circuit Court area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I intend to propose amendments with regard to joint custody.  Nevertheless, it is a progressive Bill which shows a definite shift towards making the needs of the child central in the family unit.</P>
    <P>However, we must be always vigilant.  The traditional family can no longer be presumed to be a safe haven.  Since 1992 there has been a 78 per cent increase in the number of reported child abuse cases in the Eastern Health Board area alone.  The appointment of the first programme manager for children and families by the Eastern Health Board is a good development, but it also indicates how serious and extensive are the problems which arise for children.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, two people carry responsibility for any child in the first instance.  That responsibility needs to be acknowledged equally in this Bill and by society.  Safeguards must always be in place where parents fail to live up to that responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Bill is about children, but it is also about how we envisage families of the future.  There has already been massive change and families will continue to change.  The original patriarchy has largely given way to a different set of conditions. In lone parenthood, fatherhood has become conditional in a way it was never before.  Fatherhood depends almost entirely on the mother and her relationship with the father.  In that context the mother has primacy in legal terms.</P>
    <P>In this Bill joint custody and guardianship for the unmarried father is being made easier, but we have yet to finalise the process that began with the abolition of the concept of illegitimacy.  It will <Col N="1446" /> not be easy.  Safeguards will always be needed regardless of the marital context.  They will be needed to protect women and children against male violence, abuse or neglect.  However, ultimately, equality in parenthood must be the goal, while allowing for the difference in the approach by men and women.</P>
    <P>The European Research Workshop has investigated the changing pattern of families.  In its paper entitled <i>Family orientation among men. Fatherhood and partnership in a process of change in Sweden</i> it states:</P>
    <P>Both men and women demand the right to have children nowadays.  The society acknowledges the children's rights to both parents.  The right to have children can also be seen as an expression for the increased cultural importance that children and young people have in society.  Children and young people represent the coming, the new orientations.  They represent creativity and new knowledge.  For adults, contact with children is an important way to keep in touch with changes in society. One can say that children have gotten an increased importance for the integration of adults in society.</P>
    <P>This is a different way of looking at how children are placed in our society.  We are inclined to think children need parents to have roots in the past. However parents equally need to know and connect with their children to face the rapid changes of today.</P>
    <P>The time has come to treat fathers and mothers equally, regardless of their marital status.  In turn that will be of benefit to the child and society in general since there are at present many young men, themselves fathers, who are alienated, disconnected from the family unit because of the changes that have occurred.</P>
    <P>Overall I welcome the Bill and look forward to the Minister's comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Bill has been introduced against the background of the Minister's indication that he and other Members will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage, one must be cautious in welcoming it.  Nonetheless I clearly welcome its objectives, or any legislation whose provisions seek to improve the support services or highlight the problems appertaining to children's welfare.</P>
      <P>Its main objective, as enunciated by the Minister, is to update the law on guardianship, custody of and access to children.  Some of his remarks in its introduction were as follows:</P>
      <P>Briefly, the main objects of the Bill are first to update the law on guardianship, custody and access by allowing a father who has not married the mother of his child to be appointed guardian by agreement with the mother, without the need to go to court as at present;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> I have difficulty with the phrase &ldquo;by agreement with the mother&rdquo; about which I will go into greater detail later.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>&mdash; obliging the court, where appropriate in proceedings concerning custody of or upbringing of a child, to give consideration to the wishes of the child;</P>
    <P>This is also to be welcomed, as is the other main point the Minister made:</P>
    <P>&mdash; making it clear that, in appropriate cases, custody of a child may be granted by the court to a father and mother jointly and allowing certain relatives of a child to apply for access to the child.</P>
    <P>I must reiterate that in practice &ldquo;by agreement with the mother&rdquo; could prove difficult and delicate. We know from experience that, even when mature, responsible couples separate, problems can arise especially with regard to their children. Guardianship, custody and access should be seen to be equal and fair unless there are obvious reasons for their being otherwise.  There is genuine concern on the matter of custody orders and equality imbalance.</P>
    <P>In the course of the last Dáil I tabled a number of questions, of similar vein, to the then Minister for Equality and Law Reform on whether his attention had been drawn to concern about gender imbalance in favour of one parent whenever the courts award custody of a child.  I also drew the Minister's attention to representations and submissions by Parental Equality with regard to custody orders and tabled a number of questions on that matter also.  Parents, in particular fathers, are genuinely concerned in that to date the majority of court orders have been in favour of the mother.  Most public representatives will have encountered very sad cases which, while perhaps extreme, led in the case of the father to the denial of his right to custody by the courts.</P>
    <P>We have also encountered cases where the bitterness between parents is unfortunately and unfairly taken out on children or on fathers because of the custody orders in place.  In this age of equality it should be made explicit that both mother and father have an equal responsibility in the birth and upbringing of a child.  The opportunity should be taken now to have that written in law so that fathers are treated fairly by having equal rights of guardianship, custody and access. Fathers have for some time been denied equal and fair treatment by the courts.  Agreements were forced on them in that they knew that, if they did not accept the agreement achieved by their legal representatives, they would fare no better in court.</P>
    <P>I understand from my research in the area of guardianship and custody that the unfair favouritism shown towards the mother dates from a time when she was seen to be the parent most involved <Col N="1448" /> in raising the child by being at home providing the necessary support.  Over the past decade, there have been such social changes that the majority of fathers play an equal role in the raising of their children.  Also, mothers play an equal role in providing for the home.  For one reason or another, whether it be house prices, mortgages, school fees or the preferred lifestyle, both parents work.  The old myth that the mother stayed in the family home to provide the necessary support for raising the child, which gave rise to favourable custody orders, warrants special consideration. That is why the issue of guardianship, custody and access should be equal and fair.</P>
    <P>Parental Equality spoke to the previous Minister for Equality and Law Reform, and I suggest the Minister take time, before proceeding to the next Stage, to speak to organisations such as this and others he deems appropriate.  This would mean he would have a broad understanding of the various action groups formed to have their voice heard.  This would be a great opportunity for the Minister to hear such views from people with first hand experience who have had to form organisations to get their points across.  The Minister should give favourable consideration to making time available for this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill's recognition of the important role of the wider family.  Section 9 allows a relation of a child to apply for a court order granting access.  As with the area of custody and guardianship, this issue has caused great distress to families and children and a clear structure should be put in place.  A relation such as an aunt, an uncle or a grandparent may have a special relationship with a child and great distress has been caused when access is cut off because of legal agreement or court order.  When this section comes into force, one hopes the knock-on effect of the mechanism put in place will be to recognise these relationships.  Long-term studies have shown that the involvement of parents, grandparents and the wider family will improve a child's future.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes provision for counselling and mediation, court proceedings, social reports, television links for court evidence, etc.  Extensive new legislation relating to children and families has come into effect since 1991 and these have been coupled with social changes, particularly in the region with which I am familiar, the Eastern Health Board.  The context within which social workers operate and the support services for children has altered significantly.  There is genuine concern on many fronts about the level of support and the availability of the professionals required to offer it.</P>
    <P>I record my appreciation for the many groups which have gone to great trouble to prepare many discussion documents such as <i>Putting Children First</i> and the north inner city group's report, <i>The Common Goals of Unmet Needs.</i>  A huge voluntary army is working tirelessly in the community with the aim of improving the required services for children and families.  I am honoured to be <Col N="1449" /> the chairman of the child care committee of the Eastern Health Board, which has done much work in recent years on the review of adequacy of services and unmet needs.  I congratulate one of the people who spearheaded that committee, Ms Brid Clarke, on her appointment as programme manager within the Eastern Health Board.  The title of her post is &ldquo;children, family and child care&rdquo; and she will focus on children's health, child care and family support, teenage pregnancy, counselling services and other support services for children.  That is a welcome development and I hope it occurs in the other seven health boards because it merits special consideration.</P>
    <P>Adequate funding is necessary in the context of such developments and it is disappointing that a number of developments, highlighted as necessary in studies carried out by local community groups which recognise the need to focus attention on particular issues, do not always receive funding.  I was shocked and surprised to learn recently of the apparent lack of co-ordination between the relevant bodies dealing with children from disturbed backgrounds and in need of institutional care.  There seems to be no liaison between the institutions and the outside agencies. A child released from institutional care often makes subsequent contact with the authorities only when he or she is picked up from the street by the Garda.  It is only then that an emergency response is put in place to help the child but, once they leave institutional care, they are back on the streets.  Will the Minister establish a mechanism which will allow follow-up support, especially given the importance attached to such support by those working in the relevant services?  It would be of enormous benefit to those providing the services and to other emergency response agencies. It would allow them to respond immediately to the needs of the child and to access information on them.  This issue warrants support and investigation.</P>
    <P>Ten days ago I visited a residential unit of the Eastern Health Board in the constituency of my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, which has been denied funding for such follow through.  This is one isolated problem.  There are other worrying aspects of the service to be examined.  There is great social change in the Eastern Health Board region and there is a serious problem which may not fall within the ambit of the Minister.  For example, there is an alarming increase in the number of so-called drug babies being born, causing serious problems for the professional support services.  If we are to develop the objectives of this Bill, which are to be welcomed, we will have to ensure that the moneys are made available to the professional services.</P>
    <P>Over the coming five to ten years we need to be pro-active in the provision of counselling, mediation, social support and social workers for children.  People working in such services are now sending out alarm signals and calling for a pro-active approach.  In addition to the necessary <Col N="1450" /> finances, the appropriate structures must be established to ensure that the required professional staff will be available in the areas acknowledged as needing special consideration.</P>
    <P>I extend a cautious welcome to this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I know his commitment and dedication to his portfolio and I have no doubt that this is the first of many Bills he will introduce in the interests of all the people.  I know the Minister is prepared to listen. I hope he takes up my recommendation to speak with Parental Equality and other such organisations, which have firsthand experience of needs in this area, before amendments are tabled on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  He showed great industry in Opposition in vindicating the right of the citizen to basic safety and security.  Since his appointment I have detected a note among Opposition speakers that because our party's policy was characterised by the maxim of zero tolerance, a policy capable of wide definition and one which was our basic party policy in the security and safety of the citizen, somehow this was a ministry devoid of social purpose or concern.</P>
      <P>For that reason, I am glad one of the first legislative measures the Minister has brought before the House is the Children Bill, 1997, which is a progressive reforming measure dealing with an area of civil legislation essentially encompassing three different areas.  The first restates our basic legislation on custody, guardianship and maintenance and makes certain reforms therein.  A second aspect of the Bill relates to how we can secure, from a procedural viewpoint, the best interests of the child in custody proceedings and, finally, there are evidential changes which I will discuss at length later.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Law Reform Commission on the volume and quality of its work.  It is of immense assistance to Members of the Oireachtas to have these reports that weigh up in great detail the arguments for and against changes in the law, and bring forward balanced and sensible proposals for reform.  Much of this measure draws on proposals drawn up by the Law Reform Commission. This House must be careful not to simply rubber-stamp the conclusions at which the commissioners may have arrived but to give serious consideration to the questions raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An idea mooted at the time of the establishment of the Law Reform Commission was that in addition to bringing forward proposals for reform of different branches of the law, the commission would endeavour to ensure that legislation generally would be simple, consolidated, codified and accessible to the citizen.  That is an important consideration when one looks at the reports of the Law Reform Commission.  One would need to be a legal scholar of substantial repute to master the detail and intricacy of the reports.  Plainly, we must make a political judgment on these matters but I would like if it was possible, from the point <Col N="1451" /> of view of legislation, to embody any proposals the commission brings forward in a simple accessible form.  It is not a serious criticism of this Bill but it seems we often miss the opportunity to consolidate legislation when we introduce new measures.  We proceed by way of amendment and insertion into previous Acts, making the accessibility of the resulting legislation somewhat remote from the citizen who may wish to find out his or her rights in relation to a branch of the law.</P>
    <P>On the three main principles of the measure, the first relates to the question of the guardianship and custody of children.  One of the main changes proposed is to permit a father who is not married to the mother of his child to be appointed guardian by agreement with the mother without the need to go to court, as at present.  Deputy McManus suggested that perhaps that section does not go far enough. However, the section goes far enough because it would not be feasible to confer automatic rights on fathers who are not married to the mothers of their children.  There is a concern here about the basic emotional bond which necessarily exists between a mother and child, which we must protect when considering civil legislation.  We must proceed with great caution if there is not a clarity of status between the mother and father.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that where the mother and father agree, the father can be appointed as a guardian without the need to go to court.  That is plainly commonsense.  A person should not be obliged to engage in the expense and trouble of having to have recourse to the courts to establish something which is agreed.</P>
    <P>The Bill also obliges the court to give consideration to the wishes of the child in proceedings concerning the custody or upbringing of the child. I am certain that that is already the practice.  In my experience, where a question of custody arises the courts consult children and give such effect to their wishes as is possible in the circumstances. That has always been the practice of the courts in this jurisdiction.  However, it is no harm to give that matter statutory authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes clear that, in appropriate cases, custody of a child may be granted by a court to a father and mother jointly and permits relatives of a child to apply for access.  There was not any real doubt that a court could direct joint custody but there is no harm in embodying it in the legislation. The innovation here is in permitting relatives of a child to apply for access.</P>
    <P>I sound a note of caution here &mdash; such disputes should not come before the courts unless it is essential.  I am glad a safeguard has been written into the legislation that before such an application can be made there must be a preliminary application to the court, and the court must be satisfied it is an application which should be entertained.  Therefore, an application by a person outside the immediate nuclear family for access to a child cannot be entertained by a court without a necessary preliminary application <Col N="1452" /> satisfying the courts that it is proper in the circumstances to permit such proceedings to ensue. That is an appropriate measure for which I commend the Minister.</P>
    <P>The rules in all these matters concerning the custody and guardianship of children have generally been elaborated by the courts over decades and centuries.  The predominant criterion is the best interests of the child.  It is plainly in the best interests of the child not to have vexatious or unnecessary litigation.</P>
    <P>I am also glad the legislation attempts to foster a culture of settlement and mediation of these disputes where the ultimate resort to judicial decision can be avoided if at all possible.  That ultimate recourse must exist as a matter of civil right under our legislation and Constitution. However, one does not like to see children brought into such proceedings if it can be avoided.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on that side of the Bill. Everyone on both sides of the House agrees the provisions relating to custody and guardianship are appropriate, well drafted and sensibly balanced.</P>
    <P>The second matter, which builds on the work of the Law Reform Commission, concerns the new Part IV to be inserted in the 1964 Act relating to safeguarding the interests of children.  I commend the Minister on this reforming measure which has been needed for a long time in our legislation.  He built on the work of the Law Reform Commission to insert safeguards in the legislation which ensure that an applicant for custody is aware of the alternatives to custody, access and guardianship and attempts to involve the legal profession in promoting agreement and conciliation in this area.  One would not disagree with this aspect of the legislation.  It provides that in any proceedings in which the welfare of a child is in question the court shall take into account the child's wishes.  In my view that was always the position taken by the courts but it is appropriate that it should be stated in legislation.</P>
    <P>An interesting aspect of this part of the Bill is the decision to implement the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission to provide for a system of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> and, if necessary, separate legal representation for a child.  One of the changes introduced by the Bill is to abolish the legal definition of an under age person as an infant and replace it with the term &ldquo;child&rdquo;.  The concept of separate legal representation stems from a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.  It is often the case that there is a conflict of interest between the wishes of the child and the parent and court proceedings are structured in many different respects to ensure that the courts have regard to that possible conflict of interest.  In this aspect of the Bill, the Minister is building on that by providing for separate legal representation in an appropriate case through the device of a guardian <i>ad litem.</i>  The phrase may confuse the laity but it means a guardian appointed for the purposes of litigation.  When <Col N="1453" /> Latin phrases are used in connection with legal matters they often serve to confuse rather than clarify.  However, the guardian <i>ad litem</i> concept is sound and I commend the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <P>The third principle of the Bill relates to the laws of evidence and certain reforms and changes are introduced in Part III of the Bill.  The laws of evidence are the laws on which courts determine what evidence can be admitted before them, what liability is to be attached to the evidence and how matters should be proved.  However, one of the problems with Part III of the Bill is that we are moving to an arrangement whereby there are different systems of evidence applicable in different tribunals.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas passed the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, which measure contained a substantial number of reforms with regard to the admission and proof of matters in criminal proceedings.  Provision is made for a live television link up for giving evidence in criminal proceedings, substantial relaxation of the hearsay principle in criminal proceedings and changes to the manner in which a witness under the age of 18 or a witness suffering from a mental disability could give testimony. These were applicable to criminal proceedings. This Bill proposes that similar changes would be extended to what are described in section 19 as</P>
    <P>(a) civil proceedings before a court, commenced after the commencement of this Part, concerning the welfare of a child; or</P>
    <P>(b) with necessary modifications . civil proceedings before any court, commenced after the commencement of this Part, concerning the welfare of a person who is of full age but has a mental disability to such an extent that it is not reasonably possible for the person to live independently.</P>
    <P>I have a problem with the definition of the welfare of a child.  To characterise or categorise legal proceedings on the basis that they concern the &ldquo;welfare of a child&rdquo; is a somewhat vague description of the exact proceedings to which the Part applies.  The phrase &ldquo;welfare of a child&rdquo; is defined in the legislation in terms of the &ldquo;. religious, moral, intellectual, physical and social welfare of a child&rdquo;&mdash; a definition borrowed from the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We require a more precise definition of what proceedings these new evidential procedures set out in the final part of the Bill will apply to.  The court faces the issue of what is meant by the welfare of a child in the context of legal proceedings and may not be absolutely certain as to exactly what proceedings are referred to.  Plainly, proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, are envisaged by this Part, but does the reference to the welfare of a child in that Part go beyond that to involve any proceedings in which a child is a party to civil litigation?  The Minister might revisit this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 27 applies irrespective of the Part to which I have referred.  It provides that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" /> a child who has not attained the age of 14 years may be received otherwise than on oath or affirmation if the court is satisfied that the child is capable of giving an intelligible account of events which are relevant to the proceedings.</P>
    <P>That change is proposed for all civil proceedings. The Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, introduced that change for criminal proceedings, but in civil proceedings a child had to take an oath and, in strict law, the judge had to be satisfied, by inquiring if necessary, that the child understood the nature and purpose of the oath and the sanction attaching to the failure to keep faith with an oath. Section 27 proposes changing that procedure in civil proceedings and to bring the procedure into line with what already exists in criminal proceedings. The sole criterion a judge will have to consider in deciding whether a child is a competent witness is whether the court is satisfied that a child is capable of giving an intelligible account of events which is relevant to the proceedings.</P>
    <P>I welcome that change.  It is desirable as it has already occurred in criminal law and there will thus be uniformity in all legal proceedings.  A child will be able to give evidence when a court is satisfied that that child can give an intelligible account of events.  A judge will not be constrained by authority to consider whether the child knows the difference between eternal damnation and eternal reward in considering whether the child should give evidence.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 to 26 of Part III are confined to proceedings affecting the welfare of a child and I have queried that criterion as being somewhat vague.  Will courts be in a clear position to determine whether the new evidential principles established in those sections apply in the particular proceedings before them?  Section 25 provides:</P>
    <P>Where information contained in a document is admissible in evidence in proceedings to which this Part applies, the information may be given in evidence, whether or not the document is still in existence, by producing a copy of the document, or of the material part of it, authenticated in such a manner as the court may approve.</P>
    <P>There was a similar section in the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, in relation to criminal proceedings. The law holds that the original should be produced, which is the best evidence a case admits, and the law has always been that an original should generally be produced by a party in legal proceedings, though there have been many exceptions to this rule over the centuries.  We established with the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, that there should be a general exception of this character inserted in our criminal jurisprudence. Accordingly, in all criminal proceedings, a facsimile is admissible provided the judge is satisfied as to its authenticity and there is no strict requirement to produce the original document.</P>
    <P>This legislation proposes that that principle should be extended to proceedings affecting the <Col N="1455" /> welfare of a child.  In criminal proceedings there is the strictest standard of proof and it seems strange that the provision in section 25 is not extended to proceedings generally.  It is difficult to see why it should be limited to criminal proceedings or proceedings affecting the welfare of a child.  I urge the Minister to look at whether section 25 could be made a provision of our legal system generally so that, in all court proceedings, copies of documents could be admitted in evidence. Notwithstanding the fact that these documents are not originals, the court could accept them if satisfied they could be authenticated. That seems to be a very reasonable principle which would cut out a lot of nonsense in the courts.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 to 24 deal with changes in relation to the admission of hearsay evidence.  These changes will be limited to proceedings to which the Part applies.  That means that three different legal regimes will apply in relation to the reception of hearsay evidence &mdash; one established by the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, one established by this legislation in relation to proceedings involving children and the unreformed hearsay law which will remain in all other civil proceedings. We should look at whether we can introduce a degree of uniformity in relation to the operation of the hearsay rule in our courts. Would it not be desirable that citizens should know when an out of court statement is admissible in legal proceedings and when it is not? There should not be separate rules for the criminal code, the children's code and other civil proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  This proposed legislation is another cog in the wheel of important legislation concerning children which has been introduced in recent years.  There was a time when one spoke <i>ad nauseam</i> of children's legislation in terms of the Children Act, 1908.  It was hoped that Act would be reformed but the will to do so did not seem to exist to any great extent.  It is to the eternal credit of the present Minister, and to previous Governments, that we are now about to add this important legislation to an area which focuses on children and supports their welfare.</P>
      <P>I have a background in education and for years we talked about the &lsquo;child-centred&rsquo; curriculum.  It is good to see that there is now child-centred legislation.  At long last we are to the forefront in Europe and the world in the area of child welfare legislation.  The fact that we have ratified the European Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights and are signatories to the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the points I want to address have been covered already by people with much better legal experience than myself.  I welcome the emphasis in the Bill on the wishes of children.  I will speak later about the recognition of natural fathers as <Col N="1456" /> guardians and the safeguarding of the interests of the children.  We should be under no illusions that the adoption of this legislation will carry significant resource implications in the areas of health care, social welfare, education and housing.</P>
    <P>One of the main features of the Bill is that a father can be appointed as a child's guardian by agreement with the mother without having to resort to court.  I am glad the Minister has underpinned his approach to mediation, agreement and avoidance of courts as a main principle of the Bill. Many of the children we are talking about are the children of young parents.  Those parents do not need to be put through the trauma of going to court, and it is obvious that their children would be significantly more traumatised if their parents were forced to do that.  It is important, therefore, that we properly resource the mediation services that are necessary and that will require training case workers, social workers and other professionals in a wide range of areas who will be able to mediate between parents.  That is vital because the tragedy is when parents separate, regardless of whether they are married, the only people who suffer are the children.  Obviously, the younger the children the greater the level of suffering.</P>
    <P>Another important feature of the Bill, and it is of growing importance with the increasing number of young parents, is the right of access for grandparents which will allow them become part of the lives of their grandchildren.  We do not often realise the importance of grandparents, and other blood relatives such as aunts and uncles, to these children.  Hardly a week goes by that I do not come across cases where grandparents are left to rear these children.  Relationships between young people often break up and they go their separate ways.  The grandparents are then left to cater for the educational, health and other needs of the children involved.  There has been a vacuum in this area up to now and I compliment the Minister on inserting this provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the need for mediation.  It is important that we begin to provide training for professionals in this area.  There has been an improvement in the provision of training for child care workers but there is still a major shortage of such people.  I ask the Minister to examine this area with a view to providing a cohort of trained professionals in the child care area who could take part in these mediation services.</P>
    <P>A great deal of progress has been made over the years in the family mediation service but the delay in dealing with some cases is often too long. To an adult a couple of months might not seem very long but in the life of a young child it can be extremely important.  We must, as far as possible, avoid delays in holding case conferences.</P>
    <P>Coming from an educational background, I cannot sufficiently stress the need for proper counselling services for children and their parents. The best counselling service is one which brings together the parents, many of whom are often in bitter disagreement.  It is important that <Col N="1457" /> the counselling service available to those parents is comprehensive and professional.  For that reason I fully support initiatives introduced by the health boards in recent years.  The role family resource centres play in the lives of communities cannot be understated, and we must continue to support those to a far greater extent.</P>
    <P>The early start programme in primary schools has been an important initiative in recent years. A network of these programmes has been developed in various areas.  The Minister has an involvement in these programmes through child care workers and I ask him to examine the possibility of extending them.  Some years ago the Government introduced neighbourhood youth projects which were mainly aimed at adolescents. These projects were excellent vehicles for the provision of mediation, counselling and support services for young parents and teenagers and it is a pity they have not been developed to a greater extent.  The Bill deals with young people up to the age of 23 in full-time education and we need to put in place mechanisms to support a range of demands.</P>
    <P>Although it is not the responsibility of the Minister, an issue which is not often addressed is that of fathers who wish to have visitation rights to their children at weekends.  Many of these fathers apply to the local authority for housing but under the present scheme of lettings and priority they are regarded as single and of low priority.  In many cases they are given a low quality one bedroom flat which is unsuitable to accommodate their children at weekends.  Consideration should be given to amending the scheme of lettings and priority for housing so that these fathers are given suitable accommodation. It is not acceptable that children should have to sleep on couches and floors in a one bedroom flat when they visit their father.</P>
    <P>Section 8 which deals with age of dependency of a child provides that a child shall include a reference to the person who has not attained the age of 18 years or who has not attained the age of 23 years and is receiving full-time education or instruction at a university, college, school or other educational establishment.  We are talking about young adults and I can see anomalies arising in that some of them will be excluded from the higher education grants scheme.  Young people who left school at an early age and wish to return to full-time education at a later stage may find it difficult to come within a certain category and thereby be excluded from the scheme.  It would be a pity if we were to introduce good legislation and at the same time exclude from the scheme young people who obviously need support.</P>
    <P>Section 11(25) is very enlightening.  It provides that as far as practicable having regard to the age and understanding of the child the court shall consider the wishes of the child in proceedings in which the welfare of the child is in question.  That is acutely important.  We have come a long way in moving towards the position where the child is the <Col N="1458" /> important person in this debate.  I compliment the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>I also compliment him on section 27 which allows the court subject to certain conditions to hear the evidence of all children under the age of 14 in civil courts without requiring them to take an oath or make an affirmation.  That too is important.  I am not a legal expert, but irrespective of whatever downside there may be from a legal point of view, that provision is welcome from the point of view of avoiding trauma for the child.</P>
    <P>I spoke about resourcing and section 11(28)(5) provides that legal representation should be paid for by such parties to the proceedings and in such proportions as a court may determine.  That relates to the area of case conferences where submissions are made etc.  It will have implications for schools where teachers will need to be very <i>au fait</i> with the cases they will discuss.  It will also have resource implications in the area of social work.  Not only will resources need to be made available in terms of finance, we will need to look at training for social workers, teachers and child care workers to ensure they will be able to make a worthwhile input into such case conferences.  It should be stressed that we are trying to avoid acrimony and bitterness as far as possible and at all stages the necessity of having to go to court.</P>
    <P>Section 20 deals with children giving evidence through a television link.  I know that system operates moderately successfully elsewhere, but I am not entirely convinced we have the technology which allows children of whatever age to be at ease at a remove from a court.  That needs to be looked at.  Not every judge or barrister can handle a case as well as others where evidence is given through a television link and an intermediary. I am slightly uneasy about that and I would welcome the Minister's comment on it.</P>
    <P>When children are with their newly declared guardian, whether their natural father or a grandparent, it is important that it be understood that the responsibilities of parenthood should attach to those guardians.  I am not convinced parents can always be asked to be entirely responsible for the actions and deeds of their children.  It is incumbent on us to stress they should be accountable for them which is an entirely different issue deserving of a wider debate.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this legislation but as one who has had a long involvement in working with young people I am uneasy about the suggestion that the probation and welfare service should have an involvement in some of these cases.  I may be old-fashioned but I believe children and their parents find the involvement of the probation and welfare service like a <i>quasi</i> court, in other words, if one is under the care of the probation and welfare service one is heading towards the court.  Perhaps we need to look at the question of modernising its image so that it is seen more as a caring agency than as a law enforcement agency.</P>
    <P>That there are of the order of 700 applications <Col N="1459" /> to the court each year by unmarried fathers who wish to become guardians of their children and that 12,500 children are born annually to unmarried parents says a number of things.  We are living in a changed society from the safe secure society we lived in, the composition of the family has changed and we must legislate for that.  While this legislation is far-seeing and radical the Minister proposes to introduce amendments at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The area I want to concentrate on is that of the non-adversarial approach and the implication that resources for a wide range of agencies need to be provided.  We are not talking about the adequacy of parents and are not casting aspersions on their ability to rear their children, but the desire by the State to provide the best resources possible so that children will grow up to be confident vibrant members of society.</P>
    <P>I am a great believer in the preventative mode.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest every child born to an unmarried parent is more likely to get into trouble than somebody who is born to a married couple.  With the best will in the world children get into difficulties and various supports must be available.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward an exceptionally enlightened Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very impressed by the contribution of the Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Dan Neville, when he spoke yesterday.  It reassured me that Members on all sides have similar views regarding this Bill and are concerned for our children.  Deputy Neville struck a chord with me and the majority of people when he said the family is the basic unit of society and tragically it has taken a terrible knocking in recent years.  We have now to introduce legislation to try to help some of the unfortunate victims who live outside the family unit and become victims in a tug of war, between the parents who may not live together.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, but I would like to see the Children Bill, 1996 brought back into the House. That Bill deals with juvenile justice, particularly the section of it which makes parents responsible for their children.  Parents, whether single or married, should know where their children are.  There is a need to introduce curfews, particularly for children who are recidivist criminals, who are committing robberies and who are out of control. Certainly no child of 11 or 12 years of age should be out at 11 o'clock at night.  For years I have advocated that parents must be made responsible for the actions of their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Single parents, particularly men, should be made to contribute financially towards the upkeep of their children as, in the case of 80 per cent of children born to single mothers, the fathers are known to the mothers.  Ten per cent of their earnings, whether from welfare or employment, should be attached for the upkeep of their child.  Some proud fathers have fathered four or five children.  Such men remind me of a <Col N="1460" /> song in &ldquo;The King and I&rdquo;&mdash; they think they are honeybees and women are flowers and that they are fulfilling their functions by going from flower to flower.  If they had 10 per cent deducted from their income, men would think twice before doing this.</P>
    <P>There are so many single parents now that young people meeting each other do not know if they might be meeting their half brother or half sister.  With today's standards of blood and DNA testing, it should be easy to establish whether people are related to each other.  We will have problems down the road if we do not tackle this now.  The Minister should consider legislating to make blood testing compulsory for people who wish to marry, as has been the case in America for years.  If a person is HIV positive the person they intend to marry should be entitled to know.</P>
    <P>In my constituency I have had a number of visits from time to time from brokenhearted grandparents who have no access to their grandchildren. Their son has fathered a child and the mother and her parents have no wish to have anything to do with the father of the child or his parents. I am glad that in this Bill there is provision for access by blood relatives of children.  On Second Stage the Minister said that the law should facilitate as far as possible the sharing of responsibilities of parents in relation to children. Some 12,500 children annually are born to unmarried parents.  At present some 700 applications are made to the court each year by unmarried fathers who wish to become guardians of their children jointly with the mother.  Of these some 400 are by agreement.  Under the new provisions they can become joint guardians of their child through a simple procedure without having to go to court.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what the situation would be if an unmarried parent died.  If the father dies, it is important that his parents have access to their grandchild.  We should make sure that where a son or a daughter dies either set of grandparents will have access to the child.  The Minister said that the new section 11(b) of the Bill gives blood relatives of the parent of the child an independent right to apply for access to that child, the intention being to reflect the fact that continued contact with relatives and grandparents can often be in the child's best interests.  That section is important because we all know the horror of a tug-of-war between unmarried parents of a child. While the media love it as a human interest story, when all the publicity has died down the situation remains.  In cases where the relatives are of good behaviour, are not involved in criminal activities and are not likely to be a bad influence, they should have access.  Access should be granted subject also to the parent paying something towards the upbringing of their child.</P>
    <P>Something else that has dogged our society, particularly in the case of children born out of wedlock, is the absence of the extended family, of aunts and uncles which, particularly at times like Christmas when the single parent is alone <Col N="1461" /> with their child, means that children miss out greatly in their childhood.</P>
    <P>Family counselling is integral to the success of this Bill.  The counsellors must be from stable backgrounds and &mdash; I make no apology for saying this &mdash; they should be married rather than single. Some people would disagree with that, but I feel married people, particularly those with families, have an understanding.  There are many people whose families have grown up, people who received a good education and spent their lives bringing up their families and who now have time on their hands, and these people have something to offer.  Rather than unionising the system we should broaden the net so that everybody who can will be able to help.  We do not want people with chips on their shoulders.  My fear is that some social workers think they have a monopoly on truth.  No one has a monopoly of truth or wisdom. The people involved in this work should have the required level of experience, they should not be men haters or women haters.  The same goes for judges.  We must ensure that those who provide counselling come from stable backgrounds and have no hang ups.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and urge the Minister to introduce the Children Bill, l996 as quickly as possible to complete the package.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  One of the benefits on Second Stage is that one can introduce extraneous matter.  Previous speakers raised many interesting issues.  Deputy Brian Lenihan, a lawyer by profession, mentioned the use of Latin phrases in legislation which tend to cause confusion in the minds of the public.  Perhaps all legislation should be drafted in Irish and English.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan also adopted a common sense approach in dealing with the section of the Bill under which one will be permitted to submit copies or faxed material.  He argued that a similar provision should be included in all legislation. This suggestion should be looked at given that much time is wasted in the courts and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Bill updates existing legislation on child care and related matters.  The Constitution and the potential cost were among the excuses given by successive Governments for avoiding the issue. It was only after the appointment in l987 of Deputy Noel Treacy as Minister of State that progress was made.  He was charged with the responsibility of examining all existing legislation. One of the difficulties was there was a variety of definitions of &ldquo;child&rdquo; in various Acts.  This caused confusion and resulted in conflict between the Departments of Justice, Health and Education which made life difficult for those working in the field.  I compliment the Minister on moving speedily to have the Bill restored to the Order Paper as it is badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rapid progress has been made since l987.  For the past two years I have served as chairman of the Southern Health Board and had the opportunity to work with the former Minister of State, <Col N="1462" /> Deputy Currie, who had responsibility for implementation of the Child Care Act which was a major step forward.  The Minister is fully committed to effecting improvements in the area of child care.  In the past he highlighted various issues which needed to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Legislation should reflect what is happening in society.  The Bill is a practical response in that regard.  Reference is made to 11 previous Acts, sections of which are being amended.  This may cause confusion in the minds of professionals working in the field.  I urge the Minister to consider introducing consolidating legislation which should be plainly understood.  As someone who had responsibility for the implementation of health and safety legislation in the industrial sector, it can be very frustrating to discover legislation has been amended when one thinks one has got everything right.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a move in the right direction.  Last year there were 700 cases in which fathers sought custody or access to their children.  The rights of grandparents and other blood relations have been mentioned.  Perhaps we should go further and consider the position of non-blood relations.  We are all aware of cases where individuals took on the responsibility of looking after a child and reared him or her as one of their own in a loving atmosphere.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is willing to consider amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage as there is no legislation which cannot be improved. The Bill needs to be strengthened in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>Society is changing rapidly.  We need to work to keep abreast of those changes.  Family support centres and other areas have been mentioned in the debate.  As a member of a regional health board, I am aware of how much can be done by providing assistance at an early stage before a partnership or marriage breaks up.  A great deal can be done by taking preventive measures.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise the rapid changes that have taken place in the traditional family unit. Whether we agree with the changes we have to accept that they are occurring.  The Minister must deal with the fall out from these changes and it is clear from the Bill that he has recognised what is happening.  The Bill is important because it addresses many of the issues and problems that have arisen from the changes which now require attention.</P>
    <P>The changing situation means that people tend to be categorised.  For instance, everyone can quote the number of unmarried mothers without any difficulty, but no one can quote the number of unmarried fathers.  It is an area that we must address.  The Bill is welcome because it facilitates fathers who have a sense of responsibility.  Those who are willing to become involved and accept their responsibilities should be encouraged and helped.  However, too many fathers do not wish to recognise their responsibilities and run away from them so other legislation may be required to deal with that aspect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> The Minister has tried to simplify many matters that arise such as the need to go to court.  I support the comments made earlier by Deputy Brian Lenihan that court should be a last resort.  We need to provide an alternative as that is the only measure available at present and I am glad the Minister is doing so.</P>
    <P>The legislation must reflect what is happening in the real world.  The old phrase that &ldquo;children should be seen and not heard&rdquo; was totally wrong and, under the Bill, consideration will be given to the wishes of children.  The question of granting joint custody is welcome but the focus must be on the child.  The Child Care Acts have updated legislation by taking children's wishes and views into consideration.  This Bill now extends that.</P>
    <P>There is a need to avoid confusion in the plethora of amending legislation because people in health boards and elsewhere will have to implement the laws we pass and it can be difficult for them to do so.  We need to train such people as well as enact legislation that is as simple as possible &mdash; something we do not normally do.  It seems at times as if there is almost a deliberate attempt to draft confusing legislation.  Health boards and other agencies must establish Protocols to deal with this legislation.</P>
    <P>In the coming months the Minister will be introducing much legislation.  I appeal to him to make it user friendly so that it is understood by people other than those who, like himself, are trained lawyers.  Although lawyers make much money from arguing and disagreeing over the wording of legislation, I appeal to the Minister to simplify the legislation as far as possible.</P>
    <P>In the past I argued for the immediate implementation of legislation that is enacted and I am glad the Minister has decided to apply a commencement order under a number of sections. Over the past two to three years in particular, health boards have been put under huge financial strain as a result of changes in legislation that transferred a range of responsibilities from the Department of Justice to the Department of Health.  In many cases funding has not been available.</P>
    <P>While people welcome many of the changes in society, the bottom line is that it costs a lot of money to police young people who do not abide by the law.  In this case the Minister, drawing on his own experience, is aware of the changes that need to be made in the probation service and the health boards, and this is recognised in section 27. There will be massive financial implications for both services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to the standards that need to be applied to those who provide counselling. His wish to have married people involved is laudable but there is no question of applying a rule to that effect.  I take his point, and hopefully the Minister will also, that we should try to avoid having people with a chip on their shoulder becoming involved in the sensitive area of child care.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> The phenomenon of counsellors has escalated so rapidly that it is difficult to keep up with the training and supply of professionals.  There has been a tendency to use anybody with any experience in psychology and other areas as counsellors. I take Deputy Briscoe's point that we need to keep a careful eye on that.  While it is something the Minister can legislate for, health boards will have to be aware of it.</P>
    <P>The powers of the courts are being changed, although not radically, and the right to remove a guardian is essential.  I must confess that I am going purely from media reports, but one of the worrying factors emerging from our changing society is the incidence of child abuse in relationships where a second partner is involved.  It has become too common for us to ignore it and allow it to pass.  The Minister should examine the possibility of building in safeguards in such instances. I am aware that health boards can intervene. However, from the evidence, it would appear that children are suffering abuse, yet there has not been any intervention.  That is probably because of the public's lack of knowledge.  It is becoming so frequent that people must be able to intervene at an earlier stage.  It is worrying that the Status of Children Act, 1987, and the Age of Majority Act, 1985, must be amended because there is conflict between the legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus said the Bill did not go far enough in giving the father equal rights in a relationship.  Society is changing radically.  The assumption that the mother is the natural person to bond with the child and the only one who cares and is responsible for it is no longer true.  Society is beginning to realise that the father is more willing and anxious to get involved.  One of the difficulties up to now was that fathers did not have access to their children.  They must be given full access so they can discharge their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned fathers who are unwilling to accept their responsibilities.  We must encourage fathers to become involved.  There should be total equality so that the male partner has the same rights as the mother.  In the past the mother was often left carrying the baby.  I hope joint custody is given to parents.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister said the courts will be the last resort.  It is important that non-blood relatives have access.  Those of us involved in health care are aware of the great work done and the sacrifices made by individuals over the years.  Perhaps a provision could be included in the Bill to allow non-blood relatives access in certain circumstances. Child abuse was mentioned by a number of speakers and I am sure it will be discussed further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for putting this Bill back on the Order Paper.  We should also pay tribute to the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, for his work on and commitment to equality issues.  The Minister is committed to this legislation.  I do not want to discuss specific sections today because there will be an opportunity to do so on Committee Stage. <Col N="1465" /> Perhaps we will be able to use our experience on health boards and involvement in community activities to initiate change.</P>
    <P>People must accept we are not challenging the traditional family unit.  We want to recognise the needs of society, particularly those of innocent children who did not ask to be involved in a relationship.  The break-up of relationships is often bitter and hurtful.  Other matters were mentioned, such as accommodation for unmarried fathers.  These are the real problems in society which must be faced.  Unmarried fathers will be the last to be considered for accommodation and, if they get access to their children, they will not be able to accept it because they will lack proper facilities.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will introduce more legislation over the next four or five years.  I reiterate the requests made by Deputy Brian Lenihan to simplify the Bill.  Those of us not involved in the legal profession and the people who must rear these children find it difficult to understand.  We should also avoid amending previous Acts, wherever possible.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who addressed the House during the debate and I appreciate the general welcome for the legislation. The opening remarks of those who contributed are encouraging and augur well for a good and positive debate on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In my introductory speech I indicated that this Bill is about children's welfare, particularly in circumstances where the family unit is split.  This Government is committed to a caring society and a system of laws and administrative measures which deal comprehensively with the consequences of marriage breakdown and the sundering of relationships, particularly where children are involved.</P>
      <P>A range of issues was raised by Deputies during this debate.  Deputy Neville gave a warm welcome to the provisions in the Bill and commented at length on the report recently published by the Eastern Health Board on child prostitution in Dublin.  I share the view that child pornography, prostitution and paedophilia are the most heinous of crimes.  It is the obligation of the State and society to protect our children.  The full sanctions of the criminal law should be brought to bear on people who exploit vulnerable young children in this way.  Such criminal behaviour should not and will not be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our laws already contain many sanctions against people who engage in such activities and I am determined to strengthen them further. When in Opposition I strongly advocated a new child pornography Bill to deal with this problem. In that context, I am pleased to announce that this week the Government approved my proposals to draft such a Bill.  The purpose of the new proposals is to enhance the measures already in place to protect children under 17 years of age <Col N="1466" /> from sexual exploitation and abuse.  More specifically, there is provision in the proposals for a precise definition of child pornography in addition to a number of new offences dealing with the production, distribution and possession of child pornography. There will also be new offences dealing with the abduction and trafficking of children. The penalties for such offences will range from five years to life imprisonment.  It is proposed that all forms of child pornography, including photographs, videos and films, will be dealt with as will the use of computers and the Internet to produce and communicate such pornography.  I expect that the Bill will be ready for publication later in the current Dáil session.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to put this legislation in place as quickly as possible in order that the criminal purveyors of the appalling and sickening trade of child pornography are dealt with swiftly and severely by the law enforcement agencies.  I also intend to publish a discussion paper on the law relating to sexual offences before the end of the year, which, among other matters, will deal with the question of a register of sex offenders.  These matters must be debated and this paper will provide those with an interest in this area an opportunity to do so.  The paper will also deal with the issue of child pornography.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Eastern Health Board working party on child prostitution are a matter for the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen.  He informs me that the health board is currently preparing proposals for submission to him to deal with the issues raised by the working party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Penrose suggested that the amalgamation of the former Departments of Justice and Equality and Law Reform will result in the work previously carried out by the latter Department being given a lower priority.  I reject that assertion.  I assure the Deputy that the pace of law reform will not diminish.  I can only conclude from his remarks that he did not read the legislative programme for the current session.  Three Bills sponsored by my Department are before the House and today I will publish the Arbitration (International Commercial) Bill, 1997 which I expect to bring before the House next week.  That will represent the introduction of the third Bill by me during one week.  If Deputy Penrose takes time to examine the Government's legislative programme as published, he will clearly see that my Department has planned for the future a substantial programme of law reform, covering many branches of the law.  The Deputy also warmly welcomed the Bill and made a number of suggestions for amendments.  Being aware of his experience in the legal field, I will carefully examine those suggestions before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with specific issues raised by Members in connection with certain provisions. Deputies Callely, McManus and Penrose referred to the position of guardianship and the rights of unmarried fathers.  Deputy McManus suggested that, given changes in the structure of the family, <Col N="1467" /> it is time to give greater recognition to the role of unmarried fathers.  She further suggested that they be given an automatic right of guardianship with the mother.  I share the belief that children are best reared by both parents and that fathers should fully face up to their responsibilities to their children.  However, granting automatic guardianship rights to unmarried fathers is not as clear-cut as might first appear.  Due to the complexities involved in this area I will briefly outline the current situation relating to unmarried fathers.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that where a child is born outside marriage the father can become joint guardian with the agreement of the mother without the necessity of going to court.  While this relaxation of procedures has been welcomed in many quarters, it has been criticised for not going far enough.  The position relating to guardianship under the law, as it currently stands, is as follows.</P>
    <P>The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, provides that the married parents of a child are the joint guardians of that child.  In the case of unmarried parents, the mother is the guardian of the child.  If the child's father subsequently marries the mother he automatically becomes a joint guardian.  Where the father is not married to the mother he can apply to the court under section 6(A) of the Act to become a joint guardian. Section 6(A), as inserted by the Status of Children Act, 1987, provides that where the father and mother of an infant have not married each other, the court may, on application of the father, by order, appoint him to be a guardian of the infant.  Where the unmarried parents of a child are in agreement, the father may apply to the court under a simple procedure to be made guardian of his child.  As already stated, the Bill permits the unmarried father to be appointed guardian of his child by agreement with the mother without the necessity of going to court as at present.  The background which informed our existing law is as follows.</P>
    <P>In 1982, the Law Reform Commission report on illegitimacy recommended a number of changes in the law on illegitimacy on foot of which the Government passed the Status of Children Act, 1987.  The commission was of the view that the principle of equality required that no distinction should be made in the legal rights of guardianship on the basis of marital status.  It recommended that both parents of a child should be joint guardians whether the child was born within or outside marriage.</P>
    <P>In considering the commission's recommendations in the context of preparing the legislation on the status of children, the then Government had regard to the fact that the extent and character of the relationship of the father of a child born outside marriage, with both the mother and child, varies greatly.  The situations vary from where a child is conceived as a result of a casual relationship to one where a child is planned and conceived in a <Col N="1468" /> stable relationship which has all the characteristics of a family.  The Government at that time was of the view that to accord the father of a child born outside marriage a defeasible right would enable a natural father with no interest in the child to interfere with, for selfish or vindictive reasons, arrangements which the mother might wish to make in the best interests of the child. This would result in greater recourse to the courts because the number of cases in which mothers would have no option but to seek the withdrawal of the father's guardian status would far exceed the relatively low incidence of cases of fathers seeking appointment as a guardian.</P>
    <P>The Government considered it invidious to place the onus on the mother to have the father's guardianship rights terminated.  Having considered all of the issues, the Government decided that rather than give fathers of children born outside marriage an automatic right of guardianship, they should be given a right to apply to the court to become a joint guardian with the mother.</P>
    <P>The report of the 1996 Constitution Review Group, in considering the question of unmarried fathers, pointed to the fact that a natural father has no personal right to his child, which the State is bound to protect pursuant to Article 40.3 of the 1937 Constitution.  In the case of K. <i>v</i> W., at 1990 I.L.R.M., page 21, section 6 (A) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, was construed by the Supreme Court as giving an unmarried father a right to apply to the court to be appointed a guardian as distinct from giving him a right to be a guardian, which is capable of being annulled &mdash; that is, a defeasible right.</P>
    <P>It was also pointed out that any criticism of the fact that a natural father does not have a constitutionally protected personal right to his child, can readily be understood in relation to natural fathers who live in a stable relationship with the natural mother or have established a relationship with the child.  It was also stated in this case that there does not appear to be justification for giving constitutional rights to every natural father simply by reason of biological links.  Were consideration to be given to any modification of Article 42.1 to expressly include unmarried parents, care would have to be taken with the drafting to avoid giving rights to natural fathers who have no relationship with the natural mother or no relationship other than a biological one with the child.</P>
    <P>Much of the criticism stems from the common belief that unmarried fathers who apply to the courts to be made joint guardians of their children are discriminated against and that if the mother opposes the application the father has little chance of success.  However, when court statistics are examined, one discovers this is not the case.  In 1996 there were approximately 12,500 children born to unmarried parents.  In that year 700 applications for guardianship were made to the courts by unmarried fathers.  In approximately 90 per cent of these cases the court made the unmarried fathers joint guardians with the <Col N="1469" /> mothers.  Of these 700 cases, 400 were settled with the agreement of the mother.</P>
    <P>The courts will refuse guardianship to a father only in cases where he is clearly unsuitable to be a guardian.  The court, in coming to all decisions regarding children, must, under section 3 of the 1964 Act, regard the welfare of the child as paramount. In effect, the court operates on the basis that unless the father is clearly unsuitable, the best interests of the child lay in making the father a joint guardian.</P>
    <P>The change proposed in the Bill is a reasonable step forward in the law as it applies to unmarried fathers.  It would take approximately 400 uncontested cases a year out of the courts system and better facilitate the position of unmarried fathers where guardianship is not in dispute.  Our law on that basis would be broadly similar to that in the United Kingdom and many other countries.  To give automatic rights of guardianship to unmarried fathers would seem to fly in the face of the reality that the mother is normally the homemaker for, and the carer of, her child.  The law on that basis should continue, as at present, to be generally protective of her position <i>vis-a-vis</i> her child.</P>
    <P>Where the parents cannot agree on guardianship, each case is decided on its own merits by reference to what is best in the interests of the child.  It is open to question as to whether, as has been suggested, a presumption should be exercised by the court in favour of the father's application for guardianship.  This could operate in making unmarried mothers concede guardianship rather than face court action by the father, the outcome of which might in future be regarded as inevitably in favour of the father and not necessarily in the best interests of the child.  Any court action could result in undue strain and hardship for the mother.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dennehy, Callely and McManus raised the question of the powers of the court to make orders for joint custody.  Section 11 (A), which is being inserted in the 1964 Act by section 9 of the Bill, makes clear that the court may make an order granting joint custody of a child to both parents if it thinks it appropriate.  This has been criticised on the basis that it implies that joint custody should only apply where it is proven to the court that the circumstances merit it and that otherwise sole custody should apply.  There is no such implication in the wording of section 11 (A).</P>
    <P>There is no statutory definition of joint custody and the question of what it means varies.  In practice, the term &ldquo;joint custody&rdquo; is used in the courts to describe a variety of arrangements.  These range from where a child spends a certain number of nights during the week separately with each parent, not necessarily half and half, to a situation where parents, although formally separated, continue to live in the same household and may be in a position to operate a joint custody arrangement.</P>
    <P>Because of the variety of interpretations of what is involved in a joint custody arrangement, there seems to have been some doubt in people's <Col N="1470" /> minds as to whether a court had the power to make a joint custody order under the 1964 Act. Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, the court may give directions as it thinks proper regarding the custody of, and access to, a child.  This section has been interpreted by the court as including a power to grant joint custody of a child to the father and the mother.  However, for practical and other reasons joint custody orders are the exception rather than the rule.  In order to clarify matters, section 9 amends the 1964 Act by the insertion of a new section, section 11A, which provides that:</P>
    <P>For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the court, in making an order under section 11, may, if it thinks it appropriate, grant custody of a child to the child's father and mother jointly.</P>
    <P>The provision is being inserted in order to make it clear that the court may make such orders.  To construe the words &ldquo;if it thinks appropriate&rdquo; as meaning that sole custody will be the norm is to misunderstand the context of the 1964 Act. Under section 3 of the 1964 Act the court is obliged to regard the welfare of the child as paramount in deciding questions of guardianship, custody, access, etc.  A court, in deciding on whether to make a custody order, must regard the child's welfare as the paramount consideration.  It is that consideration and no other which must inform the court's decision on the nature of the custody and/or access order which is most appropriate in the circumstances.  However, as I indicated in my opening speech, I intend looking closely at this matter again between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callely suggested that I meet Parental Equality and discuss the question of rights of unmarried fathers and joint custody.  I agree that such groups should be met and listened to and their concerns should be taken into account in situations such as this.  I will meet with that organisation next week.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus commented on the increasing number of family law cases on the Legal Aid Board's waiting list.  This Government is fully committed to the development of legal aid services and I emphatically reject the Deputy's assertion that the service is being downgraded. The most significant developments in the legal aid service since its foundation were initiated by the last Fianna Fáil/Labour Government.  When last in Government, we initiated a major development programme for the Legal Aid Board which resulted in a major increase in the resources available to the board over the past five years.  Funding has been increased from £2.7 million in 1992 to £8.3 million this year.  Over the same period the number of staff increased from 92 to 226. However, over that period the number of persons provided with legal services by the board increased by over 137 per cent from 5,274 to 12,462 persons.  In 1992 some 1,854 persons were given legal aid and 3,420 were given legal advice. These figures had increased to 4,660 and 7,802, <Col N="1471" /> respectively, in 1996.  The 1997 figures continue to show an upward trend.</P>
    <P>The overall effect of the increased investment in the Legal Aid Board was to provide legal aid centres in each county, thus bringing the service closer to the people and reducing significantly the waiting lists in law centres.  However, because of the introduction of new family law legislation, in particular in the area of judicial separation and divorce, waiting lists have increased over recent months.  For example, with the advent of divorce on 27 February 1997 the number of applicants on the waiting lists of the board's law centres has increased by 70 per cent.  Between May 1996 and February 1997 over 1,000 people had contacted the board seeking legal services in relation to divorce proceedings.  Up to the end of August 1997 there were 978 applications for legal aid certificates in respect of judicial separation proceedings and 695 in respect of divorce proceedings.  The current position in relation to the Legal Aid Board's waiting lists in the 30 full-time law centres is as follows: in five law centres, it is less than one month; in four law centres, it is between one and three months; in nine law centres, it is between three and six months; in nine other law centres it is between six and eight months; and in three law centres it is between eight and 11 months.  I am continuing to keep developments in the Legal Aid Board under review particularly in the light of the increase in the number of family law cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus criticised the absence of a probation service to provide social reports in family law cases.  Up to December 1995 the probation and welfare service assisted the courts by providing reports in family law cases even though there was no statutory requirement to do so.  Due to increasing work demands, especially in regard to criminal law work, it became necessary for the probation and welfare service to cease this service from 1 December 1995.</P>
    <P>The Family Law Act, 1995, the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, and this Bill put a statutory obligation on the probation and welfare service to provide social reports to the courts in family law cases.  However, the necessary staffing resources are not in place to enable the probation and welfare service to fulfil its obligation.  I am having the staffing requirements examined urgently to see what action can be taken to enable the probation and welfare service to meet its obligations as quickly as possible.  In this context, I note that Deputy Dennehy also referred to the probation and welfare service.  I will be in Cork city next Monday and I hope to meet with the probation and welfare service and hear its views.</P>
    <P>He mentioned the question of counselling and mediation.  The proposed new sections 20 and 21 to the 1964 Act contain safeguards designed to ensure that intending parties to guardianship, custody and access proceedings are fully aware of the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.  These involve leaving the confrontational courtroom <Col N="1472" /> atmosphere behind, either temporarily or permanently, and availing of counselling or mediation in an effort to resolve the issues which are of concern to the parties.  As Deputies will no doubt be aware, provisions of this nature are already a feature of judicial separation and divorce legislation but, curiously, to date have played no part in the 3,000 or so District Court cases per year where matters which are central to a child's welfare are determined.  Counselling can be of immense benefit, helping couples with psychological or emotional problems to deal with them in an amicable way.  Such problems often relate to children and the welfare of the children is inextricably linked to their resolution.  Mediation as a discipline is fast gaining recognition as a most important element in the process of problem resolution. In many cases, immediate resort to the law can ruin completely the prospect of a voluntary settlement.  It is widely recognised that even the most embittered couples have within them the ability to work out their own difficulties and there is a greater ownership of an agreement which is worked out by the parties themselves. They take responsibility for it, have a greater respect for it and are less likely to deviate from its terms than if it is imposed on them.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that despite the large volume of court disputes between parents over children, most parents, whether married or unmarried, manage to resolve child related disputes without going to court.  A high proportion of custody and access disputes which come before the courts could, with the right professional assistance, be resolved amicably to the benefit of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Mediation and counselling is all important as an alternative to court proceedings in these kinds of cases and the focus of the Bill on these alternative methods of dispute resolution is important. To encourage this focus on mediation and on counselling and to emphasise their merits I have established a group under the chairmanship of the Second Secretary of my Department to look at this issue in greater detail.  The working group comprises the chief co-ordinator of the Family Mediation Service and the chief executive of the Legal Aid Board.  I intend to expand the group in the future to include representatives of other organisations.  I want to promote consensus rather than court-based solutions to guardianship disputes.</P>
    <P>Deputies Callely and McManus referred to the family courts.  The hearing of family law cases is a matter of concern to me.  I am committed to ensuring that these cases are dealt with in the most effective and efficient way possible.  Social changes in recent years and legislative and other developments in the family law area have led to a major increase in the number of persons coming before the courts on family law business. Deputies will be aware that the developments have placed a strain on the resources of the courts.  I am aware that there have been problems in many Circuit Court venues with regard to the delays in the hearing of family law business and <Col N="1473" /> with the accommodation available for persons having recourse to the courts on such business.  In the context of these delays, the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for an increase of seven in the maximum number of judges who may be appointed to the Circuit Court.  These seven additional judges have been appointed.  The Courts Act, 1996, provided for a further increase of four in the maximum number of Circuit Court judges who may be appointed. Two of these positions were filled earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The problem regarding delays has greatly diminished following the appointment of additional Circuit Court judges in July 1996 and January 1997.  In April 1996 there were delays in hearing family law cases in 14 Circuit Court venues ranging from nine months to two years. In six other venues the delays ranged from three months to eight months and there were no delays in the remaining six venues.  In June 1997 there were delays of between nine months and two years at three venues and at seven other venues the delays ranged from three months to eight months.  There were no delays at the remaining 14 venues.  The situation is being monitored and the President of the Circuit Court is continuing to assign extra judges to those venues which have the greatest delays.</P>
    <P>I am aware that any delay in the hearing of family law cases is a serious matter, having particular regard to both the personal and complex nature of such cases and the fact that decisions in these cases have life long repercussions on all members of the families concerned.  I am confident that the appointment of these additional judges will provide the courts with the resources necessary to deal effectively with existing delays and arrears, including family law cases, and assist in the prompt disposal of cases in the future.</P>
    <P>As everybody is aware, a working group under the chairmanship of Judge Susan Denham was established in November 1995 to examine the court system in general and to consider the establishment of a courts commission.  Preparation of the necessary legislation to establish such a commission is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the problem of accommodation, it is the policy to provide family law suites in all new or refurbished courthouses as part of the ongoing courts building programme to ensure a network of family law courts is available throughout the country.  These family law suites are located to provide privacy to the parties involved, which is of considerable importance.  The suites include a specially designed courtroom, which is smaller and less formal than the usual courtroom, a judge's chamber and consultation rooms for the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>Separate family facilities have already been provided in more than a dozen locations, including Athlone, Arklow, Bray, Cork District Court complex, Ballina, Ballinasloe, Carrick-on-Shannon, Naas, Portarlington, Midleton, Galway, Kilkenny, Waterford and Clonmel and in the District, <Col N="1474" /> Circuit and High Court in Dublin.  Work has just been completed on the refurbishment of Portarlington courthouse and refurbishment projects are under way at Cork Circuit Court, Ennis and, Deputy Neville will be pleased to note, Abbeyfeale.  A new courthouse is being built in Tallaght and will be completed by the end of this year.  I have also recently authorised works to commence on refurbishment projects at Portlaoise, Listowel, Rathdowney, Roscrea and Castlerea.  The total cost of these projects will be just over £13.5 million.  I am committed under this refurbishment programme to providing the best possible facilities for the transaction of family law business as quickly as possible within the resources available to me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville referred to the issue of child abduction.  I take this opportunity to refer to two of the most effective international instruments ever devised in so far as child protection is concerned. These are the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the Council of Europe Convention on Child Custody which were given the force of law in this State by the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991.  Prior to that legislation there were no formal arrangements whereby rights of custody of parents in this State could be recognised or enforced in another State.</P>
    <P>The Hague Convention contains judicial and administrative measure to secure the return of a child on the basis that the custody of a child should be decided in the courts of the place where the child habitually resides.  The Luxembourg convention contains measures which are designed to ensure that custody orders made by the courts in a contracting State are, subject to conditions, recognised and enforced in other contracting States.  Over 40 countries world-wide, including all our EU partners, the US and Canada, are party to one or both conventions.</P>
    <P>The conventions provide for the establishment of a central authority in each contracting State to carry out functions which are specified in the conventions.  All central authorities are obliged to initiate steps to trace a child, to seek the child's return or secure access to the child and, if necessary, to arrange for court proceedings to secure the return of or access to the child.  They must collate and forward to the court other central authorities' information on the child.  As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I am the central authority here and officials of my Department carry out the relevant duties.  In saying that I am the central authority, I mean within the context of this Bill and the relevant conventions.</P>
    <P>The total number of cases dealt with in 1996 by our central authority was 114, of which 51 were abductions into the State and 63 abductions from the State.  In 12 of those 51 cases of abductions into the State the court ordered the return of the children concerned, in eight cases the court refused to return the children and, in nine cases, the relevant parties reached agreement.  One case brought was for the recognition of a carer.  One <Col N="1475" /> case was outside the scope of the relevant convention, 12 applications were withdrawn and 18 cases awaited resolution at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In 17 of the 63 cases of abductions from the State foreign courts ordered the return of the children.  In five cases the foreign courts refused to return the children, in 15 cases the relevant parties reached agreement, one case being outside the scope of the relevant convention, ten applications were withdrawn and 15 cases awaited resolution at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I thank all Members for their contributions to a very valuable and informative debate.  I am confident of receiving their co-operation on Committee Stage and look forward to our discussion then.  I hope I have comprehensively answered Members' queries and shall be only too pleased to discuss any additional views or amendments as comprehensively as possible on Committee Stage. Amendments tabled by Members which would help to improve the provisions of this Bill will receive a most sympathetic hearing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that Dáil Eireann has availed of this opportunity to consider the thirteenth Annual Report of the Ombudsman for the year 1996 published in June last.  It is timely and appropriate that the House should turn its attention to this important report.</P>
      <P>I will first, take a look at the report in terms of presentation and what it says about complaints made to the Ombudsman, their number and character; second, within the context of the report, I will consider the overall process of change and development in the public services, particularly those changes encompassed in recently enacted legislation and, third, I will address a question raised by the Ombudsman about the Government's plan for extending his remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very impressed by the presentation of this report.  In his introduction, Mr. Kevin Murphy recalls that in his 1995 report &mdash; which covered his first full year of tenure in office &mdash; he introduced a new format, style and general theme.  The 1995 report was the first to be published in both Irish and English and the first to be made available to the general public on the Internet and on diskette.  It also set out the Ombudsman's thinking on the general principles of good administration <Col N="1476" /> on which the delivery of public services should be based.  That report was a model of how complex information should be presented clearly, comprehensively and accessibly.</P>
    <P>How does his 1996 report measure up to that? It actually surpasses the calibre and quality of the previous year's.  It would have been perfectly understandable had the latest report of the Ombudsman slipped back into a more sedate, conventional annual report format but such expectation would have been a profound underestimation of the Ombudsman and his staff.  Mr. Kevin Murphy has had a long and distinguished career as a civil servant in the Departments of the Public Service and Finance.  Those who know him are well aware he has never been known to rest on his laurels, that to him a sense of achievement and a job well done is not a cause for relaxation, rather a spur to renewed effort.  The presentation of his 1996 report is imbued with his fundamental commitment to excellence.</P>
    <P>His 1996 report has the superb qualities of presentation introduced last year, is bi-lingual, available on the Internet and diskette and its general format is clear, concise and comprehensive. It presents a checklist of standards of best practice which public bodies should adopt to ensure high quality public administration.  This little guide to standards is embodied in the text of the report and made available directly in the form of a leaflet distributed to all public servants and available to the general public from the Ombudsman's office.  It is just a list of commonsense practices public servants should adopt when dealing with the general public.</P>
    <P>The public service is the biggest &ldquo;business&rdquo; in the State encompassing a wide range of activities requiring a myriad of rules and regulations with inherent potential for complexity and confusion. Yet such confusion and complexity, where allowed to persist, represents a diminution of the fundamental rights of our citizens.  As the Ombudsman rightly points out:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;. the relationship between public bodies and the citizen is an essential element in the quality of our society and democracy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>By providing this checklist of standards the Ombudsman opens up the notion of excellence in public services in a manner understandable and relevant to all citizens.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman noted the checklist was devised entirely by reference to complaints received by his office.  In this regard the report is illuminating because it illustrates the Ombudsman's proposals for best practice by reference to specific examples.  As the report shows, there were quite a few examples to choose from last year.  During 1996 the Ombudsman received a total of 3,181 complaints which represented a 10.5 per cent increase compared with the previous year.  Just less than half this total concerned the Civil Service, with the Departments of Social Welfare, Agriculture and Food, and the Revenue Commissioners together accounting for most of <Col N="1477" /> these.  Other complaints mainly concerned local authorities, health boards, Telecom Éireann and An Post.  While this might be seen, <i>prima facie</i>, as evidence of declining standards in public administration in the areas concerned, I have no doubt the increase in the number of complaints received also reflects the efforts of the Ombudsman to spread information on and awareness of the activities of his office as widely as possible.  Putting such information on the Internet and arranging for the delivery of information leaflets on his office to a significant proportion of residential households are two examples of recent initiatives.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to refer specifically to individual cases reported by the Ombudsman.  These cases concern the individuals directly affected and the Departments or offices of the public service where fault was found.  My colleagues in Government who are now in charge of the relevant Departments and I have no doubt Ministers will ensure prompt action is taken in respect of specific recommendations contained in the Ombudsman's report.</P>
    <P>I want to focus on two priorities identified in the report which, in my experience as a public representative, are essential to proper public service and whose absence leads to much unnecessary confusion, distress and waste of resources. These are the need to ensure public servants deal with citizens' queries promptly, avoiding unnecessary delay, and that people who are dissatisfied with the outcome of their case have available to them appropriate information on appeal mechanisms.  These are crucial elements of good public service.  All in this House know the anxiety caused when our constituents suffer delays in respect of applications for pensions, benefits, grants, or other forms of income maintenance. For those on very low incomes an undue delay of even a few days can impose hardship. We see these troubles in our clinics on a weekly basis.  Business people and farmers working in an increasingly competitive environment know how true is the adage &ldquo;time is money&rdquo;.  Bureaucracy and red tape impose costs on business operating in competitive markets and absorb resources needed to contribute to investment, jobs and wages.  The Ombudsman notes frustration and uncertainty created by unduly slow service are sometimes compounded by further delays on the part of public bodies in responding to his office.</P>
    <P>Similar difficulties arise where clients and customers of public bodies, who are dissatisfied with the outcome of their case, are unable to find suitable means of appeal and redress.  The fundamental principles of fairness and transparency in providing public service demand not only that appeal mechanisms be available but also that members of the public be given adequate information, full co-operation, assistance, help and advice.  Getting this right is not just about putting in place the structures, systems and processes of appeal; it requires most of all a &ldquo;be of service&rdquo; culture.  The report of the Ombudsman shows that we still have work to do to develop such a culture in the <Col N="1478" /> public service.  Developing a &ldquo;be of service&rdquo; culture is central to changing and improving the public service.</P>
    <P>I want to consider aspects of this process, focusing especially on recently enacted legislation. The emphasis on a culture of quality in the public service is a legitimate expectation of the citizen.  It informs much of the thinking underlying the Ombudsman's checklist of standards.  The summary of standards of best practice presented in the Ombudsman's report is similar in concept to the statement of the rights of members of the public set out in the position paper, The Public and the Public Service: A Time of Change, which we published in May 1997.  In that we suggested four fundamental rights: the right to procedures in accordance with natural justice; the right to courtesy and confidentiality at all times, even in adversarial dealings; the right to clear and concise forms and all relevant information; and the right to a transparent administrative appeal, the importance of which I have already emphasised. Observance of these fundamental rights is crucial to maintaining the proper, fair and impartial public service advocated by the Ombudsman.  At the same time, our position paper recognised that excellence in public service is a two-way street: meeting the needs of the citizen also requires understanding and energising the officials who deliver the public service demanded.  We particularly emphasised the need for proper training for sensitive public service jobs and the need to enhance flexibility in order to facilitate officials giving advice and practical assistance to clients and customers.  This twin track approach to the provision of excellence in the public service underpins the programme of institutional reform designed to modernise Government administration, which we set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>It is a time of change in public administration. This process of change is not something which any sector of society or the economy can ignore. As I mentioned earlier, the provision of public services is big business.  General Government expenditure is equivalent to over 40 per cent of gross national product.  Given this scale of activity, it is inevitable the public service affects every other sector of the economy.  There are approximately 219,000 public servants out of a total number at work of 1.25 million.  With this level of direct involvement in the economy, there are bound to be difficulties.  I want to make clear that I value and do not underestimate the major contribution made by the public service to the growth and development of the economy and society over many years.  This is often overlooked and underestimated.  Great credit is due to many within the public service for much of Ireland's achievement today.</P>
    <P>There is a solid basis already in place on which to build excellence in the public service in the future.  Moreover, the public is aware of this.  For example, in a recent benchmark survey of the general public's experience of and attitude <Col N="1479" /> towards the Civil Service, carried out by Irish Marketing Surveys, over 70 per cent of respondents who had contact with the Civil Service in the past year rated the service fairly or very efficient.  However, we want to increase that to 100 per cent.  I will endeavour to assist the Ombudsman in whatever way I can using my role in the Department and my commitment to this office to ensure we take heed when he informs us and all throughout the public service of our requirements, obligations, duties and commitments to ensure the public has a service which is second to none and the envy of the world.  That said, there is a common perception that the Civil Service is still too bureaucratic and too detached from the competitive world of business.  Overcoming organisational problems and changing the public service for the better means aiming for the standards set by the Ombudsman.  Achieving progress towards realising these standards is central to the Government's strategies for institutional reform.</P>
    <P>A key element in the Government's programme for institutional reform involves the implementation of new legislation which has passed into law over the past few months.  The most important elements of this legislative change include the Public Service Management Act, the Freedom of Information Act, and the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act.  All these Acts were signed into law this year.  In Opposition, we supported and facilitated the grounding of the process of change and development in the public services in this key legislation.  Many of the essential elements were brought forward when we were last in Government. Now back in office, we are working towards the implementation of the changes required to ensure both the letter and the spirit of the law are fully reflected in improved structures, systems and practices in the public service.  Our intention is to send a clear signal both to civil servants and the general public that the momentum of public service reform is being maintained and strengthened under this Government.</P>
    <P>A key element in the programme of change in the Civil Service is embodied in the Public Service Management Act, 1997 which was commenced by order of the Minister for Finance on 1 September.  This major Act empowers the Civil Service to undertake the steps needed to transform the fundamental structures of the administration of central Government.  It provides a legal basis for a new management structure in the Civil Service and makes the accountability of civil servants more transparent.  The Act provides for a new relationship between Government Ministers and the Civil Service and provides a basis in statute for the modernisation of the machinery of Government.</P>
    <P>A key feature of the Public Service Management Act is the requirement that Departments prepare and submit to their Minister, no later <Col N="1480" /> than March next year, a strategy statement which will set out the key objectives, outputs and related high-level strategies, including use of resources, of the Department.  Once it is approved, Ministers will ensure that a copy of the strategy statement for their Department is laid before each House of the Oireachtas within 60 days.  Bringing these statements before the elected representatives of the people will provide a positive and inclusive mechanism for determining whether the levels of quality and performance in the delivery of the public services meets the standards set, for example, by the Ombudsman's checklist.  In my opinion, the preparation and the placing of these statements before Dáil and Seanad Éireann opens up the structure, character and performance of the Civil Service in an unprecedented way.  All Members of the House have made reference to this in many debates in the last few years and we will all welcome it.</P>
    <P>At present my colleague, the Minister for Finance, is preparing directions for Departments on the preparation of these statements and on the mechanisms of accountability for Secretaries General.  Further work is also being undertaken in relation to the Act by the implementation group, set up by the Government on 28 July, to drive the process of change in the Civil Service under the Strategic Management Initiative.  Putting the various elements of change required under the Act into place will involve a process of participation by all levels within the Civil Service and will necessitate meaningful discussions with staff interests.  I hope all levels of staff will see opportunities to enhance their own career path in their work sphere so that they can take the opportunities presented under the Acts in a more modern, efficient and meaningful way.</P>
    <P>A further major change in the Irish public service is being ushered in by the Freedom of Information Act.  Under this Act freedom of information is now a citizen's right.  In essence, citizens are empowered by being given a legal entitlement to have access to official information kept by the State, to have inaccurate or outdated information kept on them corrected, and to have access to reasons for decisions taken by public bodies which affect them.  The Act ensures that members of the public will exercise this &ldquo;right to know&rdquo; to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest and legitimate rights to privacy. Experience in other countries has demonstrated the power of Freedom of Information legislation to change these matters for the better.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Act brings about the following key changes.  There is now a statutory right to official information based on a presumption of openness.  Necessary exemptions are to be subject to an overall injury or public interest test, as appropriate.  Public manuals on the structure and organisation of public bodies, and on rules, procedures and guidelines to be used in decision making by Government bodies will be prepared. There is now a legal obligation on officials to help citizens requesting information to identify and <Col N="1481" /> clarify what they need to know.  There is an obligation on those who hold information to justify, with detailed reasons, any refusal to disclose such information.  There is a powerful independent appeals system to resolve disputes between citizens and public bodies promptly and free of charge.</P>
    <P>A central policy unit on freedom of information established within the Department of Finance has been charged with managing the implementation of the Act.  This process, among other tasks, involves an intensive programme of training, a thorough and comprehensive assessment of official records and the creation of appropriate systems within the public service to facilitate access to information.  When the Act comes into effect in April next year the public service will be ready.</P>
    <P>I am confident there will be fundamental changes under freedom of information which will move the public services towards the standards of excellence advocated by the Ombudsman. Greater transparency in policy making will generate more confidence in the system of governance as a whole.  The relationships between users of public services and the Government bodies providing them must improve as individuals gain the reassurance of having access to records.  In practical terms, citizens will now have a direct means of finding out for themselves whether their cases are being dealt with fairly and impartially.  Over time, an administrative culture which promotes openness rather than unnecessary secrecy will begin to develop across the public services.  I am confident that this very spirit of openness will itself encourage quality: no one will want substandard work exposed to public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Underpinning these positive expectations of the benefits of this legislation is the acceptance by the Ombudsman of an invitation to be nominated as Ireland's first Information Commissioner. He will hold both offices simultaneously. The commissioner will be entitled to examine documents, summon witnesses and issue binding decisions in relation to individual cases. It is a key role demanding professionalism, insight and sensitivity, all characteristics abundantly evident in the author of the report before this House.  This is a significant step forward and if anything tangibly demonstrates all the points I have made, the appointment of the Ombudsman does so.  This is a positive way to show the public, the Civil Service and the public service that the Government is determined these Acts are not on the Statute Book in a meaningless way but will be utilised to the maximum by the public.</P>
    <P>A further important initiative in the process of institutional change falls directly into the domain of members of this House and Seanad Éireann.  I refer to the legislation which empowers committees of both Dáil Éireann and the Seanad to compel witnesses to give evidence and to confer privilege when they do so, that is, the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges <Col N="1482" /> and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997. This Act enhances the capacity of committees of the Oireachtas to act on behalf of the citizen in investigating matters of public concern.  The new law gives power to relevant committees, acting within their terms of reference, to compel witnesses to give evidence or produce documents and to grant them privilege and immunity from legal action if they do so.  The Act comes into operation when the Committees on Procedure and Privileges of Dáil and Seanad Éireann establish the required mechanisms and the various Oireachtas committees begin to seek the relevant new powers.  It is up to the members of the committees of the Oireachtas to make these new arrangements work in the public interest and I have no doubt that, over time, the value of these powers will be put to good effect.  Having served on many committees of this House over the past ten years, I am aware that on many occasions they have been frustrated in terms of their power to get to the bottom of matters under examination and requiring decisions and action.  I now look forward to committees developing the opportunities the new powers extend to them for their own benefit and that of the public.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to address a question raised by the Ombudsman in his report regarding the Government's plans for his Office.  In particular, the Ombudsman has suggested that it might be possible to bring some public bodies within his remit quickly by means of orders amending the Schedules to the Ombudsman Act, 1980.  In response to this I wish to draw the attention of the House to An Action Programme for the Millennium which includes the commitment that a key part of the process of institutional reform in the public service will involve &ldquo;expanding the remit of the Ombudsman to include legal, medical and other areas&rdquo;.  Since assuming office, the Minister for Finance has directed that earlier work in this area should be re-examined in light of this commitment.  This work is now well advanced in relation to proposals designed to increase the powers and extend the remit of the Ombudsman to cover a number of new areas. Our thinking is along much the same lines as has been discussed in this House on other occasions. For example, consideration is being given to extending the Ombudsman's remit over administrative matters in non-commercial State funded bodies which receive most of their funding from the Exchequer including non-medical matters of voluntary hospitals.  The Minister for Finance is currently finalising specific proposals to put to Government on changes in these areas.  For my own part, I will ensure that appropriate legislative proposals are expeditiously brought before this House.  I have also been informed by my colleague, the Minister for Health, that he is currently considering how proposals in relation to the medical area might be implemented.  In this regard, it is envisaged that consultations with relevant interest groups will be initiated in the near future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> In conclusion, I thank the Ombudsman and his staff for their work and in particular for the 1996 annual report.  They are making a very constructive and positive contribution to Irish public administration and their achievements and objectives for the future set standards of excellence which merit the attention of this House and at all levels across the public service.  I commend this report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Ombudsman, Mr. Kevin Murphy, and thank him for his excellent report.  Its accessible and clear format makes it possible for busy Deputies to come to grips with the essentials of it very quickly.  I also thank the Ombudsman for the good work he has done during the year.  He is diligent and accessible and his excellent and available staff are quick and ready to process complaints brought to their attention.</P>
      <P>I wish to turn to the volume of complaints with which the Ombudsman had to deal during 1996. Of over 3,000 complaints received, 2,466 have been processed, a very credible portion.  Four hundred and forty four complaints have been resolved, assistance was provided in 547 cases, 973 complaints were not upheld, 482 were discontinued and 50 were withdrawn.  Many of us who deal with complaints and queries from constituents on a daily basis will compare our volumes to those of the Ombudsman.  It is interesting that while the work of the Ombudsman is universally praised the constituency activities of parliamentarians is frequently denigrated.</P>
      <P>The example cases highlighted by the Ombudsman in his report are similar to those which pass through the office of every Deputy, Senator and county councillor.  On leaving the Department of Health, my office had dealt with 6,500 constituency cases over two and a half years with significantly less staff than is at the disposal of the Ombudsman.  Since leaving the Department the volume of queries is decreasing, but it is worth placing on the record that my caseload is dealt with by myself and one secretary in circumstances where, while my children communicate from around the world through email, I do not have a fax in my office.  I understand the Ombudsman's comment that there is little point in having offices such as his without providing the necessary staff and support.  Unless serviced properly, Deputies will not be in a position to continue to process their present workload.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the roles of the Deputy and the Ombudsman are different.  The Ombudsman exercises a quasi-judicial function and has to be careful of the procedures he follows.  His investigators must examine all sides of a case.  Deputies and Senators can cut through the red tape quite quickly and all that is important to many of us is getting a result while the process is equally important in the work of the Ombudsman.  Therefore, I am not comparing like with like, but it is a peculiarity of our system that people who comment <Col N="1484" /> in the media regard the activity of Deputies in serving their constituents as an antiquated practice of parish pump politics and that we would be better parliamentarians if we abandoned that work.  However, Deputies reading the cases highlighted by the Ombudsman will recognise many similarities with their own case load.</P>
    <P>One curiosity which I may pursue separately concerns references to public access and awareness. The report says that during 1996 the Office of the Ombudsman paid monthly visits to Citizen Information Centres in Galway, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and the Tallaght Partnership.  Over the year there were 443 callers to these centres.  Did five fully staffed offices deal with only 443 cases during the year, an average of 80 cases per office? Any self-respecting Deputy would be worried about losing his seat if his case load was less than 80 inquiries per week.  I would like clarification on this number.  Does it refer only to inquiries to Citizen Advice Centres which were forwarded to the Ombudsman or does it refer to the total number of inquires received by the centres?  It is an extraordinarily low number.</P>
    <P>As the House and the Administration continues to extend the remit of the Ombudsman it is anomalous and bordering on the ridiculous that he is no longer entitled to inquire into areas previously within his remit.  Functions now vested in FÁS and the Health and Safety Authority were within the Ombudsman's remit under the then Department of Labour.  However, since these two new bodies were established, the Ombudsman lost certain rights of inquiry.  We have given him powers as an information officer and a role in the ethics in public office legislation while restricting the powers he had in other areas when the Office was established 13 years ago under the former Minister, John Boland.  The Ombudsman has asked that this be rectified by amending the Schedules to the Ombudsman legislation in accordance with section 4(10) of the Act.  He asks that this be done immediately without prejudice to the Government's plans for amending legislation. I see no reason the Government would not agree to the Ombudsman's request.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous if the Ombudsman may no longer inquire into functions carried out by the former Department of Labour which were clearly within his remit and which are now carried out by the Health and Safety Authority and FÁS.  If there is an easy way to correct the anomaly by amending the Schedule, to which everyone in the House would agree, the Minister should do so and not give us guff about reviewing the review which took place and consulting further with Departments and saying the Minister for Health is looking into his heart, that it will go to Government in due course and that there is a reference to it in the programme for Government.  There may be a reference to it in the programme for Government but I saw no reference to impending legislation in this area on the list of legislation circulated to Deputies this week, certainly not in this session.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> Another area where legislation should be introduced arises directly from something the Ombudsman said which was that the overriding essential requirement for an Ombudsman is that he or she is entirely independent and impartial. That impartiality requires independence which in turn requires statutory or legal underpinning, security against arbitrary removal, the power to issue and publish reports with the protection of legal privilege and adequate resources to do the job.  He goes on to say there is a danger that Ombudsmen who do not meet these requirements will devalue the role and standing of those who do, something with which we all agree.  We also have that legal underpinning here.</P>
    <P>The committee which reviewed the Constitution recommended that an Article be included in it recognising the role of the Ombudsman and guaranteeing his independence.  In many respects, the Ombudsman's position is similar to that of a High Court judge and the position of the Judiciary is guaranteed under the Constitution.  I would like the Government to give a commitment that at the first opportunity it would underpin the role of the Ombudsman in the Constitution by including an Article to guarantee his independence. There is no point having a referee for fair play in the public service unless he is totally independent of the Executive, can look people in the eye and act without fear or favour.  The legislation in place gives him statutory independence but his role should be enshrined in the Constitution as well.  This is in accordance with the recommendation of the all party committee of this House which we should take on board.  In the review of the position of the Ombudsman to which the Minister referred, the Government should consider that proposition because it is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I liked the new departure in this year's Ombudsman's report where as well as giving an account of his stewardship for 12 months and highlighting cases he thought we would find most interesting, he draws conclusions from the cases and, in effect, gives us a code of best practice for the public service.  It is not something he has arbitrarily constructed in that he examined a series of cases in 1996 and over the years and has come to the conclusion that this code of practice would be of great benefit.  We would agree with many of the practices, for example, the Ombudsman says dealing properly with people means dealing with them promptly and without undue delay, correctly in accordance with the law and other rules governing their entitlements, sensitively by having regard to their age, capacity to understand often complex rules, any disability they may have and their feelings, privacy and convenience.  He gives further guidelines for dealing fairly with people.  He speaks about treating people in similar circumstances in like manner and about accepting that rules and regulations, while important in ensuring fairness, should not be applied so rigidly or inflexibly as to create inequity.  He gives guidelines under the heading <Col N="1486" /> of dealing impartially with people which are very good but where do we go from here?</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has no Executive authority to implement this code of practice across the public service.  All he can do is advise and draw attention to it.  From the examination of the cases he put before us and others, it is clear he feels it necessary to bring out a code of best practice for public servants, yet the Minister did not indicate any Executive action to ensure these guidelines will be followed.  This should be incorporated into the training of all new civil servants and in service training programmes.  There should be a means from the public service section in the Department of Finance to personnel offices in each Department whereby this is systematically taken on board.  There is no point having codes of behaviour unless they are implemented.</P>
    <P>My experience of members of the public service is that they are intelligent, fair, impartial, decent, honest and helpful people.  They have improved a lot over the years &mdash; I suppose we have all improved a little &mdash; and we are getting a good service from them.  If the Ombudsman believes that a systematic code of practice would be of benefit, there is an onus on the Department of Finance and the Executive to ensure that this code of practice becomes the Bible of practice for all civil and public servants during interchanges with the public.</P>
    <P>I and I am sure others will be surprised by one of the codes of practice to which the Ombudsman referred.  He said dealing impartially with people means avoiding bias because of a person's colour, sex, marital status, ethnic origin, culture, language, religion, sexual orientation, attitude, reputation or who they are or who they know.  The Ombudsman said he had not received a complaint to suggest that a member of the public service treated anybody other than impartially arising from their colour, sex, martial status, ethic origin, culture, language, religion, sexual orientation, attitude, reputation, etc.  I am not contradicting the Ombudsman but there is increasingly a bias in this country in respect of persons of other nationalities as Dublin becomes a pluralist capital like other European capitals.  I am surprised the Ombudsman has not received complaints of bias in respect of sex, colour, ethnic origin or sexual orientation because I, and I am sure many Deputies, have done so.</P>
    <P>The common parlance in Dublin is that we are facing a problem of racial prejudice as the homogeneity of our society is changing.  I would like the Ombudsman to revisit this in his next report and have a word with his investigators and those in regular contact with the public and Departments to keep an eye and an ear open because this area will present difficulty in the future and I am surprised he could comment so firmly that he has had no complaints of persons being treated with bias.  I know he is including this in the guidelines for good behaviour.  I am not saying public and civil servants are impartial or biased but it is <Col N="1487" /> interesting that the Ombudsman is so categoric that he has not come across this problem.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in the increasing role of the Ombudsman.  There is a danger he will take on so many functions he will not be able to exercise his primary function fully and will not be resourced sufficiently.  It is a great compliment to him that he will be the first Information Commissioner, arising from the Freedom of Information Act.  However, that puts a huge extra burden on his shoulders.  He will need sufficient staff and resources to ensure he can carry out that function, which is as onerous and time consuming as the function of Ombudsman.  Mr. Kevin Murphy will now be both the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner.</P>
    <P>We are great at setting up offices but quite frequently the Department of Finance does not provide the resources needed to run such offices effectively.  I hope the resources are provided for this area of the rights of citizens and the right to information and this new dispensation of openness in the public service.  Otherwise, it will be a sham, which is not what I want.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's role will also increase significantly in the area of European law.  The report states on page 10:</P>
    <P>It has also been agreed that national ombudsmen would devote a separate section of their annual report to complaints involving European Union law.  While I outlined one such case in the 1995 Annual Report, no similar case arose during 1996.  The creation of the office of European Ombudsman, together with the co-operation arrangements now being put in place, have an important role to play in ensuring the full protection of the rights of citizens of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as well as having a national remit as the broker of fair play between Irish citizens and the public service and being appointed the Information Commissioner under the Freedom of Information Act &mdash; with all the promises which have been attached to that Act in terms of access to information, openness and fair play for citizens &mdash; he will have to be the broker of the rights of citizens who feel they have cause for complaint about how they are treated as citizens of the European Union.  That is also a very onerous task.</P>
    <P>Although he had to pursue only one such complaint in 1995 and none in 1996, I suggest that is not because of lack of grounds for complaint but because of the lack of awareness that he has a European function.  As soon as people become aware of that function they will have many grounds for complaint about how they are treated under the various schemes administered in Brussels. The farming population could keep him occupied every day of the year if they became aware they have recourse to the Ombudsman if they feel they are being dealt with unfairly under European directives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1488" /> It is a great compliment to the Ombudsman and to his office that when difficulties arise for the Houses of the Oireachtas people say it should be a job for the Ombudsman.  It is a judgment by elected representatives on his efficacy and impartiality, but there is a danger.</P>
    <P>He will also have wide functions under the Ethics in Public Office Bill, the provisions of which will apply to persons occupying certain offices. The commission on which the Ombudsman will serve proposes a role in the use of public funding provided for political purposes, disclosure of political donations and control of election expenditure at specified times.  That is another role to be fulfilled by the Ombudsman, in association with the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ceann Comhairle, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad.  We are all aware in the present context of how onerous the duties of a commissioner governing the Ethics in Public Office Bill may be.</P>
    <P>Whenever we come across problematic new issues which require an impartial referee, they are moved in the direction of the Ombudsman.  Over the past two years, the role of the Ombudsman under statute has increased very significantly.  If one compares the staffing levels and resources provided to him in each annual report, one will not see a similar increase.  That should be looked at.  One of the worst things which could happen to the public service would be to have an Ombudsman who was so under resourced that he could not function, and that the last court of appeal for frustrated citizens with complaints against decisions of the public service could not be processed because the Ombudsman was under resourced.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Ombudsman.  It is a pity the Minister of State does not have the right to reply.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Ombudsman on his 1996 report.  I am impressed by the way he is pushing out the frontiers of his office.  I was delighted to see the report was available on the Internet.  Before I received my copy of the report I conducted a search on the Internet for articles about ombudsmen in general.  I was glad to see the Ombudsman's 1996 report was on the first page of the list of articles found by the search engine I used on the world wide web.  I found a number of interesting items on the Internet which might have a relevance to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan mentioned the question of bias and referred to a person's colour, sex, marital status and ethnic origin.  It is interesting to note that under the Dayton Peace Accord in Bosnia an office of human rights ombudsman was set up. <Col N="1489" /> That agreement also set forth minimum moral standards.  The office of the ombudsman was used as an alternative to litigation and considered alleged or apparent violations of human rights in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.  This might be an extra responsibility for the Ombudsman in the future.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to see that, in the context of sustainable development, there is a worldwide move towards appointing ombudsmen to identify processes focusing on the interface between public health, the environment and human rights because of their direct bearing on people's lives. This came about as a result of the Rio Earth Council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan suggested &ldquo;the practice of administration&rdquo; booklet should be used as a training basis for civil servants.  He suggested there was no such training in place at the moment.  A good deal of the Minister's speech concerns the development of the public service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.  To date about 9,500 claims have been made against the Department of Defence by serving and former members of the Defence Forces alleging hearing impairment from unprotected exposure to gunfire. New claims continue to come in at a rate of around 100 per week.  At the end of August 1997 settlements had been reached in 699 cases and court awards following hearing had been made in 25 cases.  A further 23 cases were successfully defended or withdrawn.  Compensation of £19.355 million and plaintiff costs of £3.108 million have been paid in respect of the 724 cases finalised to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy by the last Government for dealing with these cases had been to identify suitable <Col N="1490" /> cases for determination by the courts.  By &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; is meant those cases where the alleged hearing impairment is either not significant or is not attributable to any wrongdoing on the part of the State.  Those cases in which the hearing impairment sustained is both significant and attributable to the negligence of the State are being dealt with either on the basis of an agreed settlement or, where such is not possible, by the courts in the ordinary manner.  The present system whereby these actions are being processed by the courts in the normal manner is both costly to the taxpayer and is a lengthy and often difficult process for injured parties and their families.  I am mindful of my responsibility as Minister for Defence to the taxpayer and to the members of the Defence Forces, past and present.</P>
    <P>If a compensation tribunal were to be established by the Government the assessment of such cases might result in a considerable saving to the taxpayer in terms of legal and associated costs which make up a substantial proportion of the costs of the claims processed to date.  A tribunal might also ensure a speedy means of resolving claims.  However, the absence of an agreed method of assessing hearing handicap is a major impediment to the establishment of such a tribunal. We are talking about considerable sums of money in overall terms and if there is a method whereby the bill can be reduced then it must be examined.  I have, therefore, directed that a memorandum be prepared for submission to the Government for consideration as a matter of urgency on the financial implications of these actions, with a view to deciding how best the public interest and the legitimate interest of those who are suffering from hearing impairment can be reconciled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be the biggest liability case in the State's history and it is important that the Exchequer and the taxpayers are protected. However, at the same time the process should be made easier for those pursuing claims.  We do not wish to subject those already damaged to further trauma but we must be scrupulous in ensuring the State is not exploited.  I welcome what the Minister has said with regard to the memorandum to the Government.  What are the estimated legal costs to date?</P>

      <P>As I understand it legal costs comprise about 60 per cent of the total claim, that is, the sum of the plaintiff's costs, the defendant's costs and the amount awarded.  The average settlement is about £25,000 and figures of between £37,000 and £41,000 are mentioned in the context of awards plus costs.  As I indicated, the plaintiff costs to date amount to £3.108 million in respect of the 724 cases finalised.  It is a tale of woe for both sides.  As the Deputy points out, there is an obligation to both parties involved. We must be conscious of our obligation to the taxpayers and we have an obligation to ensure that those making claims get a fair hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" /> I am seized of the problem.  I am aware of what is required and I may have a number of options to offer the Government in the memorandum being prepared.  I hope to put the memorandum before the Government within the next two months.  I will keep Deputies informed of developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister actively considering the legal strategy?  Is he satisfied that suitable tests can be devised to determine accurately the level of hearing loss?  If so, will he consider a forum or tribunal to assess the outstanding claims?  Has the Minister an estimate of the total costs outstanding if all the claims being pursued prove successful?  A figure of £800 million has been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Many figures have been bandied about.  I will put a number of options to the Government.  We will seek to establish a common average of hearing impairment with the ENT specialists, for example.  There is not an average hearing loss standard in this country as exists in America and Britain.  Efforts have been made in the past to solve this problem but they have not been successful.  I hope to be the Minister to take a decision which, although it will not cure the pain for the taxpayers, may bring to a conclusion a situation which is somewhat out of hand in terms of the number of claims made.  The Deputy will be aware that claims are arriving at a rate of about 100 a week.  In the context of that average and taking account of the 10,000 claims already in, a suggested figure of £350 million would be a minimum based on our knowledge to date. However, as the Deputy indicated that could be unrealistic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his urgent preparation of a memorandum to deal with the problems outlined here.  I understood an American test was being used to assess the hearing loss.  Is the Minister not satisfied with the efficacy of that test?  Is a more accurate test needed? Given that an extra 500 claimants have made applications since August 31, is there any estimate within the Department of how many claims will finally emerge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I would not have the competence to make a judgment in relation to the efficacy of the American standards.  I understand, subject to correction, that the American standards suggested to our courts have not found acceptability in contested cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the claims, over 947 claims alleging hearing impairment from exposure to gunfire have been initiated by former and currently serving members of the Defence Forces against me, in my corporate capacity, and against the State. New cases are arriving at the rate of 100 per week.  Since 1992, when 49 cases were received, the number has quadrupled each year, and 2,394 <Col N="1492" /> claims were received in 1996.  An additional 4,701 cases have been received so far this year.  The basis of most of these claims is that the individual involved was exposed, in the course of his or her duties, to gunfire, usually at ranges where smallarms, rifle fire or artillery were being used.</P>
    <P>At the end of August 1997, settlements had been reached in 699 cases.  Court awards were made following hearings in 25 cases.  A further 26 cases were defended successfully or withdrawn. The compensation amounted to £19,355,770 and plaintiff's costs amounting to £3,107,970 have been paid in respect of the 724 finalised cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The adversarial legal system is probably not the best way to handle these cases.  I have heard of particular solicitors' firms as being likely to make enormous sums of money if we follow this route.  Figures in the millions of pounds have been mentioned.</P>
      <P>Obviously there are many legitimate claimants who wish to pursue their cases, but there is concern over the possibility of false claims.  Is the Minister satisfied he will be able to put a procedure in place to protect against false claims?  I raise this issue while accepting that there are many legitimate claimants who have every right to pursue their claims.  There is concern in the Defence Forces that their position may be undermined by some of these events.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>I do not want to pre-empt or prejudice any of these matters, but that would be considered among other options.  I do not want to mislead the Deputy.  I would hope to bring him into my confidence as this is now a crisis.  It is of national importance for the wellbeing of the economy and those who have made claims that there be a structure to this issue that allows us to see where we are going.  The present problem is that the case is unfocused and I, as Minister, need to give it a proper focus.  It is going to be very painful for the taxpayer, but so be it.  People have a legitimate complaint and I am not the judge and jury in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The strength as of 31 August, 1997, of the Army, the Naval Service and Air Corps was 9,230, 1,096, and 985, respectively.</P>
      <P>I recently arranged for an additional intake of 250 recruits this year and their enlistment took place during September.  This brings the total intake of recruits since December to 800.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the selection process for the award of 46 cadetships in 1997 is nearing completion and the new cadets will commence their cadet training shortly.  A competition for the award of 17 apprenticeships will be advertised in the national newspapers commencing on Friday, 3 October.</P>
      <P>It is the intention that in future recruitment will be on a more constant or continuous basis than heretofore having regard to the operational requirements of the Force and the overall level of wastage.  I do not like the term &ldquo;wastage&rdquo;; &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; might be better in these politically correct times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked this question because this is a time of great change for the Defence Forces due to the Price Waterhouse report's target figure of 11,000 members.  It made wide-ranging recommendations which mean great change for the Defence Forces.  Is the Minister concerned that the uptake of the early retirement scheme and the wastage in the last year have led to numbers being at such a critically low point as to make it difficult for the Army in particular to do its job?  I am glad to hear the Minister plans to introduce continuous recruitment, but is he confident that numbers in place at the moment are sufficient to do the tasks in hand and that the numbers recommended in the report will be maintained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that the Defence Forces current strength is less than the target figure of 11,500, but they are well able to continue with their tasks.  I see no serious problem in that regard.</P>
      <P>The voluntary early retirement scheme has worked and I pay tribute to my predecessor, whose plan I am pursuing.  It is my intention to continue with this first phase of the implementation plan, which, as the Deputy will be aware, is a three-year plan extending from 1996 to the end of 1998.  The Defence Forces are well able to continue with the tasks that are given to them and I pay tribute to them for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation plans and consultants' reports are constant worries to organisations at which they are aimed.  As Minister for Defence I would like to think that I would not need to engage in further consultancy.  I sometimes think the Defence Forces have been overburdened with consultants.  I do not mean any disrespect to consultants <Col N="1494" /> when I say that &mdash; there is a place for them in the human race too.  However, the best consultant to the Defence Forces is the Minister of the day and I would like to think that I could make any necessary judgments in regard to matters of this nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much analysis of the Army and Defence Forces in general and it is now time to act on the recommendations made and provide the necessary supports for vital back-up and equipment to the Defence Forces and to ensure the numbers stay as they should be. I agree with the Minister when he says that backup rather than further analysis is necessary. However, at a time of change, various systems must be put in place to ensure that morale does not sink too low.  I have some concerns about that.</P>
      <P>As regards the numbers, the Minister says he is satisfied the Defence Forces can carry out the tasks in hand.  I understand there are not sufficient junior officers at present and that there are some difficulties in terms of recruiting sufficient people for service overseas.  There is something of a mismatch between the numbers of people currently in place and the places to which they are attached.  This seems to be causing some strain.  Will the Minister look at these issues and further examine the continuous recruitment issue in the light of some of these mismatches?  Unfortunately, it may happen that the very plan which was intended to rejuvenate the Defence Forces, while perhaps acceptable in its broad outline, may in its implementation lead to serious difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 800 new recruits have been taken on since December last and I intend to continue apace with that recruitment programme.</P>
      <P>As regards overseas service, the only area of concern which may have existed is in relation to UNIFIL in the Lebanon where, because of the age profile, people served quite a number of times and were becoming less than happy about the situation.  That issue has since been resolved. Our service in the Lebanon has been nonpareil and has probably provided one of the greatest morale boosts to the country in its many years of service to the United Nations.  The service provided by the Defence Forces has been commended and praised by many people and organisations throughout the years.</P>
      <P>I would be glad to address the issue of junior officers if the Deputy could provide me with some details.  I am not aware at this time of any complaints in that regard but I would be anxious to assist in stabilising the morale of that section of the Defence Forces if it is destabilised.</P>

Voluntary early retirement was granted to 735 personnel in 1997. I appreciate the Deputy bringing the issue to my attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to basic pay all personnel posted to Border units are paid a Border duty allowance of £50.07 per week in the case of officers and £45.13 per week in the case of noncommissioned officers and privates.  The allowance is paid, irrespective of the actual hours worked, on a continuous basis, including periods of annual leave and sick leave.  A military service allowance is also payable to all members of the Permanent Defence Force up to and including the rank of colonel to compensate personnel for the special conditions associated with military life, such as the unsocial hours of duty, being subject to transfers and a requirement to serve in all conditions.  The current rate in the case of officers is £2,101 per annum, and in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates is £40.28 per week or £2,101 per annum with the exception of privates with less than three years service who receive £14.50 per week.  The allowance is paid on a continuous basis, irrespective of the actual hours worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990 the issue of pay and allowances comes within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA and the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers, RACO and may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent <Col N="1496" /> Defence Force which was established in agreement with the associations.  The question of the payment of an allowance to personnel involved with the recent BSE-related operations in Border areas has been raised by PDFORRA under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme. Under the terms of the scheme, as agreed with the associations, discussions on claims which are being processed are confidential.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that as the matter is under active consideration at present it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been considerable disquiet on the issue of the BSE Border patrol payments and the naval patrol allowance.  The Minister says the matter is confidential and I respect that.  There is a feeling that Border duty allowances were offered and subsequently withdrawn. Will the Minister comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concern.  I will be attending the PDFORRA conference next week and I will address the issue there.  The matter is one of legitimate concern to PDFORRA.  I do not know whether it will be resolved to the satisfaction of the parties involved or, indeed, whether it will be resolved at all.  It would be dishonest of me to say otherwise.  I am involved in intensive ongoing discussions on the issue and, in so far as I am the Minister for Defence, I am on the side of PDFORRA and RACO.  On the other hand, I do not wish to go down the populist road. I am open to criticism from those organisations from time to time and I have no problem with that.  I am a Minister for Defence and I intend to do the best I can for those organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister success in his negotiations because they are important.  It would be disturbing if agreement were not reached on this deeply felt issue.  The concern of the Defence Forces' organisations and their members seems to be a legitimate one.</P>
      <P>On a related issue, some disquiet has been expressed about PDFORRA's negotiating rights in relation to national pay agreements. Its members made some comments recently to the effect that there should be some form of affiliation or relationship with the ICTU, which seems to be a different route for the Army to consider.  Will the Minister comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to comment very much on that.  The personnel at the head of PDFORRA are well qualified to negotiate with the Department of Defence on behalf of their members.  They are people of considerable experience and wisdom and they are well able to manage their own affairs.  The Deputy will appreciate that the organisation is effectively new, in the sense that it is not long in existence, and in many ways it is still finding its feet.  If there <Col N="1497" /> is a problem in relation to its members feeling put down in some way, I am open to hearing about that.  I hope to discuss with members of PDFORRA any matters of immediate concern they may have in that regard.  I am on the side of RACO and PDFORRA as representatives of the men and women in the Defence Forces and I would like to think I will be known as a Minister who at least did his best for them, and who tried to make the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps a more pleasant place in which to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously these organisations believe there are some barriers in their negotiations, so much so that they have said they want to consider some type of affiliation.  Perhaps we will see the final outcome of this matter when the Minister is in a position to report on the negotiations currently under way in relation to the two issues I mentioned.  They are probably the issues that have driven the representative organisations in the direction to which I referred.  The Minister said these people are competent in handling their own affairs but it is they who have raised this concern. They believe their hand is not strong enough because of the slow progress in relation to the patrol allowances in particular.  I hope the negotiations prove they do not have cause for concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, a respected former Army officer who has probably served in Lebanon, is correct.  Difficulty has been experienced in the recent past in attracting large numbers of volunteers for United Nations services in that part of the world.  That is a reflection of the high age profile of serving members and the fact that many members of the Defence Forces previously served with UNIFIL on a number of occasions. However, the measures taken arising out of the Defence Forces review implementation plan, that <Col N="1498" /> is the recruitment of young people and the VER scheme, has alleviated that particular problem to a great extent, if not completely.  A total of 800 new recruits have been enlisted in the Defence Forces since December and it is my intention to continue that recruitment programme until such time as we get the age profile to a reasonable level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said earlier that service in UNIFIL was a great morale boost and that the service had received great praise.  It is no secret that over recent years difficulties have been experienced in fulfilling the required number of personnel for this service.  A private soldier receives an allowance of £26 per day when he arrives in Lebanon.  Will the Minister consider extending that allowance to the pre-departure date because personnel are away from home for six months, but before they depart this country they are formed up for six to eight weeks at great inconvenience to their families?  That is one of the main reasons difficulties have been experienced recruiting the required number of personnel.  A practice has developed in recent years whereby personnel come home from Lebanon for two weeks, having served six months, and then return. That is not desirable from their point of view or that of the new unit.  Also, what contingency plans, if any, do we have in place if sufficient volunteers are not recruited?  What if only 500 people volunteer and our commitment is to provide 611?  Does the Minister have any contingency plans in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot force people to go anywhere and it would never be my intention to do so.  If it came to the point where people decided they did not want to go to Lebanon, and we could not fulfil our obligations to the United Nations, it would be a sad day for the country.  As for contingency plans, we have people on standby if any of the 611 personnel due to depart decide not to fulfil that commitment for one reason or another. That is a contingency plan of a sort but as for forcing people to go somewhere in the name of Ireland, that is not my style.  We can only request people to go on a voluntary basis.  The people who have gone to Lebanon &mdash; some have travelled on a number of occasions &mdash; have served with distinction and honour despite the conditions. In the recent past we had the tragic death of Sergeant John Lynch, and once more my sympathy goes out to John's widow Rosario and her two children.  That is indicative of the quality service we have come to expect.  I cannot answer the Deputy's question in any other way.</P>
      <P>The question of pay and allowances has always been a matter of concern for members of the Defence Forces serving abroad.  It is a matter I am trying to address having regard to the exigencies of the time, but I am not unaware of the problem nor am I unaware of the dissatisfaction that prevails in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If we have reached the point where there is some difficulty in recruiting personnel for Lebanon, will the Minister agree that highlights the need to pay serious attention to the whole recruitment issue?  Obviously, the Minister cannot force anybody to go abroad but it is something the Army would wish to do in order to fulfil duty requirements in Lebanon or other UN missions. It is not about forcing people to go abroad but rather about the need for ongoing recruitment and a fresh input by officers and men who are not repeating a six-month tour of duty in the Lebanon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Eight hundred new recruits have been enlisted in the Defence Forces since December and further personnel will be recruited as the need arises.  It is intended that in the future recruitment will be on a more continuous basis rather than on the stop-go basis pursued by the previous Government.  I was also guilty of pursuing this policy when I was in this manifestation in a previous Government.  The upper age for recruitment has been reduced from 27 to 21 years.  This measure, together with the ER scheme, will help to address the high age profile within the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The strength required for the next Irish UNIFIL contingent is 620 personnel, of which 68 are officer appointments.  All officer appointments have been filled for the next contingent which is due to depart later this month.  The selection of volunteers from other ranks personnel, of which there are approximately 700, will be completed by the military authorities on 30 October, the date of activation of the contingent.  The military authorities are satisfied that the full complement of contingent numbers will be met.  The current strength of the Irish contingent serving with UNIFIL is 611, while the strength last April was 619.  The reduction in strength is due to the tragic death of Sergeant Lynch, permanent reparations on compassionate grounds and for family, health and other reasons.  I am not greatly worried about our ability to fulfil our requirements in regard to UNIFIL.  Our record over the years has been distinguished and I believe our future record will be equally so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 9 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>The development of Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, as a joint military/commercial airport was carefully considered by the previous Government last year and it was decided that a second commercial airport for the Dublin area would not be in the interests of the aviation sector and the economy generally.  As opportunity permits, resources are made available for the development of the aerodrome as the main military air base in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the study carried out by the previous Government into this matter. Will the Minister agree that Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, which is a great asset of the Defence Forces and Air Corps, is under-utilised? There is considerable disquiet in the Air Corps about the Minister's failure to adopt a more progressive approach to this matter.  Will he consider the development of the aerodrome for commercial purposes at some stage in the future?  It has been suggested that the airport is perfectly placed to act as a hub for executive jets.  It is very difficult to travel to and from Dublin Airport because of traffic congestion and Baldonnel Airport is perfectly placed to act as a hub for executive jets. This suggestion has support among a number of people in the Defence Forces and Air Corps.  The Minister needs to be more imaginative and responsive to the views within the Air Corps on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This has come as a shock to me and I am not sure how to respond.  I am speechless at the suggestion that a cadre in the Air Corps has been throwing darts at an effigy of me because I have not been progressive or forward enough in the context of a problem which has been raised at Question Time three months after my elevation to office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want in any way to belittle the Deputy's points but I want to place this matter in context. The previous Government considered that a second airport for Dublin would lead to a duplication of infrastructure and facilities and that airlines could well be reluctant to transfer to a secondary location because of an inability to offer an integrated service and the absence of the hubbing opportunities available at Dublin Airport.  To the extent that Baldonnel Airport would attract airlines, this is likely to be at the expense of Dublin Airport rather than lead to net growth in air traffic to the Dublin region.  The costs of adapting Baldonnel Airport would be high and difficult to justify as Dublin Airport has the capacity to <Col N="1501" /> accommodate present and projected air traffic levels, while the opening of the northern cross route has provided improved access to Dublin Airport for people living in south County Dublin.</P>
    <P>On the question of executive jets, I am not sure if the Deputy is talking about commercial or private aircraft usage.  I understand that privately owned executive aircraft use Baldonnel on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis on the payment of a fee and the production of the necessary insurance indemnity. The question of extending usage of these facilities for hire or reward has been carefully considered as it may have implications regarding licences. Between eight and ten private aircraft use the facility each year.  It is not possible to determine the number of private aircraft which may use Baldonnel in the future.  Some business companies in the area have expressed an interest in using the airport and if they want to do so there will be no bar in that regard.</P>
    <P>I share the previous Government's view that it would not be technically possible to use the airport for commercial and military purposes.  To suggest that a group of officers at the aerodrome are chewing the cud and condemning me for not being progressive leaves me reeling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not dream of criticising the Minister for not being progressive and certainly would not attempt to lecture him as I know him too well.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this is a very suitable location for a commercial airport?  It is adjacent to the Naas dual carriageway and the new motorway and would be ideal to serve the south and midlands.  Its use for commercial purposes has been advocated by Dr. Tony Ryan, the founder of Ryanair, the primary independent airline. It should be possible to get commercial airlines to finance the necessary additional infrastructure, for example, a major terminal, and the extension of the runways.  Will the Minister examine the commercial viability of this proposal and consult with private airline directors, chairmen and boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for his intervention and take his suggestion very seriously.  I do not know Mr. Ryan but I have seen his operation and have great respect for the much needed competition it provided in the airline industry.  I wish him and his airline continued success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will examine the Deputy's suggestion. However, I do not have the competence to decide whether there should be a commercial airport there.  As the hurler on the ditch on this matter I ask if we should not continue to develop Dublin Airport in a passenger friendly fashion.  The problem with Dublin Airport, although it has been brought under control to some degree in the recent past, is that one tends to get lost in it.  It was becoming like Heathrow Airport where one must walk for miles from point of arrival to point of departure.  People using Heathrow Airport <Col N="1502" /> may be on holiday, but after the walk through it they need a holiday and some form of resuscitation. I would not like Dublin Airport to become like that.  I will examine the suggestion and report to the Deputy on its commercial viability.  The Deputy's proposal would not find favour in the context of the need to continue to improve and expand Dublin Airport and, more particularly, the road infrastructure which is fast developing in this city and county.  As Minister for Defence, I would not propose to have the military and the commercial sectors admixed because I am not certain it would improve the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be unprecedented. Brussels airport is a prime example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I know parts of Brussels Airport are set aside for military use.  I take the Deputy's point and I will have the matter examined rather than speculate on the successful outcome of the proposition.  I thank the Deputy for raising it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to surprise or ruffle the Minister, but has he discussed this matter with the Air Corps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not.  It shocks and stresses me that I have not been consulted.  I have the greatest respect and regard for the Air Corps and I know they would not take me by surprise.</P>

      <QRef>[15180/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I visited Irish troops serving with the Multinational Stabilisation Forces, SFOR, in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the period 22 to 24 September l997.  While in the region I met members of the Defence Forces serving with the EC Monitor Mission to the Former Yugoslavia, ECMM, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in European, OSCE, and members of the Garda Síochána serving with the UN International Police Task Force.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of my visit was to see at first hand the work of Irish military personnel serving in the region and to convey to them, on behalf of the Government and our people, the deep appreciation felt regarding the outstanding manner in which they continue to perform their duties on overseas service.  Not for the first time, I was extremely impressed and proud of the professionalism of the Irish personnel serving abroad as well as the effectiveness of the various missions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my visit I met a number of prominent military people, including General Eric Shinseki, the commanding officer of SFOR, who deeply appreciate Ireland's contribution to the force. Throughout my visit I heard consistent praise for the Irish military personnel and a desire that they <Col N="1503" /> should continue in service in Bosnia.  I was very heartened by these many positive comments.</P>
    <P>On l4 May l997 Dáil Éireann approved the despatch of a contingent of the Defence Forces for service with SFOR.  The first contingent of Irish personnel was deployed to the mission area on l July l997 and is due to rotate in January l998. The contingent strength is 50 personnel based in Sarajevo, comprising a National Support Element, Military Police Company Headquarters and a Military Police Platoon.  In addition a lieutenant-colonel acts as Irish liaison officer to the SFOR co-ordination centre at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe, SHAPE, Mons, Belgium.  I pay tribute to Lieutenant-Colonel Mark O'Brien, the commanding officer, on his wonderful organisational abilities, having regard to the fact that he was there for the first time.  He organised his own group of people very quickly and efficiently.  I express my appreciation for his courtesy and the manner of his organisation on my visit.</P>
    <P>I regard Irish participation in SFOR as an important and practical expression of our ongoing commitment to peacekeeping in general and to the cause of peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Furthermore, it responds to the foreign policy priority of staying in the mainstream of peacekeeping at a time when the UN is increasingly turning to regional solutions for peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>There are currently nine Irish military personnel serving with the EC Monitor Mission to the Former Yugoslavia and six serving with the OSCE Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina.  I do not envisage any increase in the number of Irish military personnel currently serving in Bosnia nor has any request to that effect been received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I too appreciate the work being done by Irish Defence personnel in Bosnia in what originally were very difficult and still are very demanding circumstances.  Does the Minister envisage that our forces will participate in similar missions in the future under the type of operation and control SFOR is under in Bosnia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This group of military personnel under the leadership of Lieutenant-Colonel O'Brien operates under a United Nations resolution. General Shinseki is the commanding officer of SFOR under NATO.  As long as we operate within the United Nations, OSCE and the EU I see no problems, but my vision for our Defence Forces, our military, in particular, is in respect of their functions at home.  They are there to aid the civil power and as long as the wretched BSE crisis continues they will continue to have to serve on the Border, but when that is over and now that peace has arrived we will have to address a different scenario.  I would like the future of our Defence Forces to be seen in the area of peacekeeping under the organisations I mentioned.  We have a major contribution to <Col N="1504" /> make in the area of peacekeeping.  When I previously held office I set up a United Nations school in the Curragh which has been an outstanding success and many countries have participated in it.  We should make our name in the areas of vision and leadership where peacekeeping is required because our practice, traditions and ethos is directed and focused in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Peacekeeping has an incredibly important role to play in development work and in developing democracy.  I agree our Defence Forces can play a crucial role.  As the role of armies evolves as we near the 21st century this will be a critical element of it and an important one for our Defence Forces.  The UN is changing in the way it handles peacekeeping and is increasingly contracting out peacekeeping tasks to a variety of organisations some of which the Minister mentioned.  If the UN contracts out such tasks and our officers and other Defence Forces personnel are asked to participate in Partnership for Peace initiatives what will be the Minister's response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as the resolution is United Nations based, OSCE based or EU based I will be happy to treat each application on its merits in the circumstances of the peacekeeping mission required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a slightly different view from that expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs recently in relation to our participation in projects or missions under the Partnership for Peace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the Minister's statement carefully and there is no difference.  I see Partnership for Peace as a surrogate NATO and I do not have much regard for it.  The Deputy can take it from me that so far as the Defence Forces are concerned their involvement in Partnership for Peace is not a tenable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were supporting a United Nations resolution and the Irish Army was asked to become involved would the Minister's view be the same?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that there are sufficient sea patrol boats and aircraft available to effectively police our 200-mile fishery exclusion zone; if not, the additional numbers which are required; if he is seeking additional EU and national funds for such craft; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In December 1994 the Air Corps took delivery of two CN235 (CASA) aircraft which were acquired with financial assistance from the EU.  These aircraft, which were purpose-built and equipped for fishery protection purposes throughout the 200 mile zone, have been deployed in support of Naval Service fishery patrols.  In addition, two Dauphin helicopters are equipped to operate in conjunction with the Naval Service vessel, LE <i>Eithne.</i></P>
      <P>The CASA aircraft have a cruising speed of 220 knots and a patrol speed of 180 knots with a maximum endurance time of ten hours.  They are equipped with a range of surveillance and data-processing equipment including radar, infra-red cameras and high speed computers.  The speed and range of these aircraft permit them to undertake surveillance flights over the entire 200 mile zone.  In 1996 the CASA aircraft flew a total of 295 patrols involving 1,715 flying hours and they had flown 210 patrols totalling 1,167 flying hours up to the end of August this year.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there are sufficient aerial resources available to meet current operational needs.  The matter is, however, kept under continual review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there enough naval boats to protect the exclusive fishing zone?  Given the number of arrests made by the existing boats one has the distinct impression that at any one time there may be several dozen Spanish trawlers fishing illegally inside our 200-mile exclusive limit. Will the Minister comment on the necessity for more boats or is he happy with the present number?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The naval requirements are satisfactory, the record of the Naval Service in relation to arrests and prosecutions has been excellent and the number of vessels at its disposal is adequate.  A competition for a new vessel will come to a close at the end of this month or early next month.  The building of this additional vessel will take from 18 months to two years.  The three vessels LE <i>Deirdre</i>, LE <i>Eimear</i> and LE <i>Aoife</i> have been refurbished and refurbishment of LE <i>Aisling</i> is under way.  The remaining vessels are due to undergo refitting in the period l998-2000. The Naval Service consists of seven patrol vessels which undergo regular and planned maintenance to meet operational requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the period 1 January l997 to 28 September l997, Naval Service records show 1,815 sightings, 867 boardings and 41 detentions of fishing vessels. The figures for l996 were 2,927 sightings, 1,204 boardings and 33 detentions of fishing vessels. Given such a record we should be proud of the work being done by the Naval Service.  Maybe the answer to the Deputy's question is that we do not have enough vessels.  The more vessels we have the better.  Perhaps the smaller, faster, more manoeuvrable vessel might be considered, particularly in view of the efforts made by the Spaniards, in particular, to hoover the oceans of fish on <Col N="1506" /> the one hand and the drug operators on the other. I take the Deputy's point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate there are seven vessels but my information is that due to refitting etc. only about three are at sea at any one time.  There may also be a difficulty in crewing those boats. Perhaps the Minister could comment on that issue since I have the impression that Naval Service personnel resources have been considerably depleted in recent years.  Despite the impressive figures &mdash; full marks to the Naval Service who do wonderful work in a difficult situation &mdash; I still think the Spaniards are getting away with blue murder and that we do not have sufficient resources to catch as many as we should.  They are devastating our fish stocks, doing a disservice to the nation and to Irish fishermen and are a disgrace to the European Union.  I would like the Minister to provide more resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not complain at the last remarks made by the Deputy.  They have never been brought to book in relation to the manner in which they literally ride roughshod over the fishing regulations of the European Union.  The strength of the Naval Service, including Army attachment, as on 31 August l994 was 1,096.  Arising from the recruitment campaign for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force in l996 and l997, 20 recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service on 30 December l996 and 80 have been enlisted this year.  A further ten cadets will commence training shortly.  It is proposed to enlist seven apprentices for training in the Naval Service in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the changing nature of international crime as well as the fishery issue which the Naval Service has to contend with, I agree with Deputy Deasy and the Minister that the number of vessels available needs to be looked at.  The Air Corps is providing an excellent service in terms of intelligence feedback on what is happening in our waters and on the many illegal movements but has the Naval Service the capacity to respond quickly enough?  In view of the difficulties outlined by Deputy Deasy, is the Minister concerned that it is difficult for the Naval Service to respond, due to the increasing scale of movement, particularly towards Scotland, and the difficulties associated with drug smuggling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to allay the Deputy's concerns. We have two CASA aircraft which are <Col N="1507" /> packed with technological equipment of the highest standard, so much so that they can carry only a limited number of passengers.  The bulk of the interior is taken up with this most sophisticated equipment.  I invite the Deputies in the House to go on a patrol with the CASA.  I would not suggest they stay in the air for ten hours but perhaps they would come for a few hours and see the operation at first hand.  That would allay their concerns about it.  The Air Corps and the Navy give an exceptional service.  We are a small island and are well able to manage our surrounding seas with our two CASA aircraft.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 41, 47, 49 and 57 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An incentive scheme targeted at certain categories of Air Corps pilots was announced by my Department on 1 August, 1997 in response to the <Col N="1509" /> increasing number of Air Corps pilots seeking to retire to take up employment in the civil sector. The details of this scheme are being finalised with a view to full implementation in the very near future.</P>
    <P>At 1 August 1997 a total of 16 pilots had applied to retire from the Air Corps in 1997.  Of these applications ten had been given retirement dates in 1997 and six had been given dates in 1998.  Six of the officers given dates in 1997 have now retired.</P>
    <P>Since the scheme was announced a further three applications to retire have been received by the military authorities from Air Corps pilots. These applications are being processed by the military authorities and will be submitted to me for decision shortly.  Each case is considered on its own merits having regard to length of service, appointment held by the officer in question and overall operational requirements of the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>I have indicated previously that the situation will be kept under constant review over the coming months to see if there is any scope to allow retirements at an earlier date.</P>
    <P>Any officers who have been given retirement dates for 1997 or 1998 and who wish to reconsider their applications in the light of the introduction of the incentive scheme will be facilitated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the rapid and frequent movement of people out of the Air Corps had a destabilising effect on overall operations, and is the taxpayer getting value for money in the context of State investment in training pilots?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxpayer is getting value for money.  As to the first part of the Deputy's question, the service has not been destabilised. However, the outflow of highly trained and sophisticated operational pilots from the Air Corps has created a problem which is brought about by the call of commercial airlines and the money they offer to highly trained pilots.  In that sense the Air Corps is the victim of the Celtic tiger.  The more commercial airlines there are the more pressure is put on highly trained pilots to leave the Air Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced an incentive scheme involving the payment of gratuities of £10,000 per annum to selected pilots in return for an agreed contract of service.  It is envisaged that around one third of the pilots in the Air Corps will qualify.  The scheme applies to experienced officers who are qualified to fly larger twin-engined aircraft.  This incentive scheme is available only to pilots, that is, flying officers in the strict and unequivocal sense of that word.  It will not be available to anybody else.  It is a scheme that might attract some of these men who have given terrific service to the Air Corps, who are of the very highest quality in flying and personal achievement terms.  I would like to think the scheme will be considered seriously by them because the taxpayer gets extremely good value for money, and the scheme <Col N="1510" /> might solve a problem.  However, I cannot, and will not, force people to go anywhere in the service of their country, nor will I force anybody to stay in the Air Corps against their wishes and will do my best to facilitate them to leave the Air Corps when it does not affect the overall good running of the Air Corps.  I am not in the business of compelling people to stay in the organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point.  Is the net complement in the Air Corps affected by the 16 people who applied to leave before August this year and the three who have applied since? Will replacement personnel be recruited as these people are given leave to retire from the service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Air Corps is hugely attractive to young men and women, so there will be no problem about recruitment.  The problem is the length of service.  The Deputy will appreciate that a new recruit learning how to fly is less valuable than a pilot with 15 years service.  There has been a problem in that regard.  There are currently 92 pilots in the Air Corps.  If all officers who have applied for retirement to date proceed with their applications the number of pilots will be reduced to 79.  I will give some figures which will put the Deputy's question in context.  In 1993 one pilot retired; in 1994 six pilots retired, in 1995 four pilots retired and in 1996 nine pilots retired and, to date, in 1997 six pilots have retired.  The current upturn in the civil aviation industry and resulting financially attractive packages available to a number of Air Corps pilots seeking to retire has contributed significantly.  Rather than imposing compulsory retention on such personnel, it is proposed that an incentive scheme will be offered instead.  Such incentive schemes are not uncommon in Defence Forces in other countries where similar difficulties exist in retaining qualified personnel.</P>
      <P>The Air Corps could not sustain full operational capacity if the current loss of experienced personnel were to continue at the 1997 level.  The incentive scheme will apply primarily to the experienced personnel who fly the Gulf Stream, Beach Craft, CASA and Dauphin aircraft which are the principal operational aircraft in the Air Corps.  The number of officers engaged in flying duties or in direct management of these aircraft represents one third of flying officers in the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>The incentive scheme is being introduced with a view to retaining senior pilots who occupy key appointments in such areas as sea and air rescue, search and rescue, maritime surveillance and ministerial air transport.  The gratuity of £10,000 per annum is designed to strike a balance between the demand of the commercial environment and the need to exercise responsibility in relation to public service pay.  The gratuity will be payable to those officers who undertake to remain in the service for a further, three, four or five year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> No officer has been refused permission to retire.  It has not been possible however to permit all officers to retire on the date sought.  I will place no obstruction in the way of any member of the Defence Forces who wishes to leave.  I will do my best for them.  Many of them have given honourable and decent service and they should be treated honourably and decently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Air Corps does a magnificent job and it is extremely important that there are enough pilots to maintain the range of services it provides.  Has the incentive scheme been introduced or is it still the subject of negotiations? Is the Minister concerned about the possible effect of such a scheme on other members of staff?  The Minister has to strike a balance in providing an incentive to retain staff &mdash; this is critical &mdash; but there is a danger that other members of staff may become discontent.  How does the Minister propose to deal with this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The incentive scheme is still the subject of negotiations.  If a scheme is introduced for a particular group another will be disappointed. I am sorry if people are discontent but the scheme will be available only to those who are flying aircraft.  If people decide to leave there will be angst and concern but I will not stand outside Baldonnel Aerodrome to prevent them leaving. I would like them to avail of the scheme as I wish to retain their expertise in the service for a three, four or five year period.  In the context of the overall need to contain public pay, the offer is a generous one.  It is directed specifically at pilots, the men in the flying machines, nobody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In his report, the Ombudsman states that the relationship between public bodies and the citizen is an essential element in the quality of our society and democracy.  On the basis of the number and type of complaints handled during 1996, there is an implication of inequality in our society.</P>
      <P>The highest numbers of complaints were as follows: Department of Social Welfare, 807; local authorities, 792; and health boards, 577.  Together they represent over 60 per cent of all complaints handled during the year.  The areas of social welfare, local authorities and health boards generally relate to persons who are not in the higher socio-economic groups.  This raises the question why there are so many more complaints from those who are socially and economically disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>The number of complaints would be reduced if it was the policy of the Department of Social Welfare, local authorities and health boards to positively discriminate in favour of those who are socially and economically excluded, in order to cherish equally in essence as well as within the narrow legal meaning of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The stewardship of the State's finances is watched over effectively by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  While complaints are investigated by the Ombudsman there is a need for someone to watch over the process of how effectively bureaucracy works in the interests of the public whom the public bodies serve.</P>
      <P>A number of matters within the remit of local authorities immediately come to mind which would function more effectively if an audit was to be carried out on the way local authorities function. The following are some examples.  Replies to correspondence from public representatives and from the general public need to be improved throughout all local authorities.  In the local authorities I am aware of, private housing matters are often discussed at large impersonal counters within earshot of other members of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there a morally fair allocation of resources to deprived areas?  There are areas of deprivation in the major cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick which need massive injections of cash and human resources to help communities help themselves <Col N="1513" /> and so improve dramatically the quality of life for those who live there.  I am thinking of areas in Dublin such as Fatima Mansions and Bridgefoot Street flats.  Is it fair to have beautiful parks like St. Anne's in Clontarf, Malahide Castle, New-bridge Demesne in Donabate and Ardgillan in Skerries, while parts of Dublin's inner city and western suburbs contain a proliferation of Long Kesh type corrals?</P>
    <P>There is an ethos whereby local authorities will help those who help themselves and this is a reasonable way of dispensing resources.  It allows for accountability, regularity and propriety.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and departmental secretaries can report in a manner that reflects well on them.  At the same time they have a value added product.  By adding to the resources of local community groups it can easily be shown that the accountable body has received value for money.  This is an easy way of achieving results but should the money not have gone to more difficult administrative areas where needs are greater?  There are many areas of need but is it right to concentrate on the convenient ones rather than those which are greater?</P>
    <P>This money could be spent more effectively by providing accommodation for travelling people. In the past funds have been allocated to those councils which are readily prepared to provide accommodation such as South Dublin County Council, rather than to councils such as Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown which is in greater need of resources to accommodate travellers but which has been able to block all efforts to accommodate them.  While these moneys have been spent in an efficient and accountable manner, I question if they have been spent in a way which is effective nationally in providing traveller accommodation in each county.</P>
    <P>Have the rights of all the people been vindicated by this expenditure?  Has the money been spent in a morally fair manner taking into account the population?  Has the expenditure been effective in improving the quality of life of all our citizens? The report states there was a 10.5 per cent increase in the number of complaints received by the Ombudsman, as if this was a great achievement. However, it would have been a great achievement if there had been a reduction of 10.5 per cent in the number of complaints.</P>
    <P>The aspiration of greater socio-economic equality should be built into the administrative practices of public bodies.  The booklet which accompanies the Ombudsman's report, &ldquo;Guide to Standards of Best Practice for Public Servants&rdquo;, should include an aspiration to greater social and economic equality.  This could be included in future Government policy.  The Ombudsman's office should also audit the effectiveness and work practices of public bodies in the same way the Comptroller and Auditor General audits the receipt and expenditure of State funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> I have examined whether an individual is entitled to a decent quality of life under the Constitution. Article 40.1 states:</P>
    <P>All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.  This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
    <P>This equality provision has a legal connotation rather than a socio-economic aspiration of equality.  The Constitution review group in its report addresses this question.  Arguments for and against whether the equality guarantee should be denominated as a core norm in the Constitution were examined.  The arguments for included the fact that true liberty depends on equality in a broader than legal sense and on having the resources for effective participation in the democratic system.</P>
    <P>Exclusion from full and equal participation for whatever reason, economic, social, cultural or any other, weakens the sense of community and common purpose and thus makes more difficult the achievement of desirable reforms, such as the removal of unfair discrimination.  Greater economic equality would lead to greater political stability on which the effective functioning of democracy depends.  The argument against states that the arguments in favour of the proposal are essentially political ones for an optimum degree of socio-economic equality rather than strictly for equality before the law.  The interrelationship between the two is acknowledged but the former is a policy issue appropriate to be addressed by the Government and the Oireachtas rather than by a constitutional assertion.</P>
    <P>In its recommendations, the Constitution review committee stated that &ldquo;A majority of the review group considers it unnecessary and inappropriate to designate a right to equality as taking precedence over others and prefers that reconciliation of rights, where they are in conflict, should remain a matter for the courts.  A minority fears that the absence of such a provision would mean that equality will be subordinated to other constitutional values.&rdquo;  Had I been a member of the review group and being a Member of this House representing many disadvantaged and socially excluded people, I would have veered on the side of the minority.  However, if the view of the majority prevails, I will look to my party to ensure that future Government policy will aspire to the optimum degree of socio-economic equality.  The Office of the Ombudsman is the ideal vehicle to examine and audit all Government bodies to ensure the equality policy of the Government is implemented, in practice and in spirit by public bodies.</P>
    <P>There is the question of controlling and regulating expenditure.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has a duty to audit in each year the appropriation accounts for the previous financial year prepared by various Departments.  The Secretary of each Department, who also serves as <Col N="1515" /> accounting officer, is responsible for the safeguard of public funds and property under his control, the efficiency and economy of administration of his Department and the regularity and propriety of all transactions in the appropriation accounts.  This spending process is well catered for, but everyone is aware of the difficulties in having money allocated to various projects, whether these involve the provision of an additional teacher for a school or the provision of a small vehicle for a community Garda.</P>
    <P>In general, the resources of the State are well guarded and efficiently and effectively administered and for this we must congratulate the Secretaries of the Departments and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, there are a number of questions which must be asked.  Should we aspire to socio-economic equality?  I believe we should.  Are the resources of the State being effectively applied in a caring and moral way? They should be.  Should the Ombudsman have a role in auditing the spending of funds to ensure that greater socio-economic equality is being sought?  The Ombudsman should have a greater role and his 1996 report shows that he is ready and willing to take it on.</P>
    <P>During my trawl of ombudsmen listed on the Internet I came across a number of items I felt might be of relevance here.  One facet of the work done by the ombudsman's office in the United States is gaining ground, namely, care of the elderly. It is interesting to note that under the social welfare heading in the Ombudsman's report the number of complaints was greatest in the area relevant to old age entitlements.  There are a growing number of elderly people in Ireland and there is a greater need among them for information services, security, and certainty.  To arrive at this position it is necessary that information services be provided.</P>
    <P>With regard to the type of facilities available to elderly people &mdash; whether these be old age pensions, nursing homes, services provided by community health nurses or local authority housing &mdash; it is necessary that the function of the Ombudsman in respect of these people should be examined.  In the United States, an ombudsman for the aged can be a voluntary position.  People who are willing to perform the function can be trained in all of the requirements and needs of the elderly, who can go to someone if they feel they are being unjustly treated.</P>
    <P>The office of ombudsman for small business assists businesses with air quality and other regulatory requirements and encourages environmental compliance and stewardship.  This office has come to the fore, particularly in regard to sustainable development and the Rio Accord.  It is important that small businesses be helped.  The office of small business ombudsman is at present operated in the state of Pennsylvania.</P>
    <P>My preparation for this speech has awakened in me a great interest in the potential of the office of Ombudsman.  I am sure that in the next few <Col N="1516" /> years the office of Ombudsman will be an integral part of the services provided by the Government. I look forward to its continued success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Ombudsman's report and its discussion in this House is timely. I compliment the Ombudsman, Mr. Kevin Murphy, on dealing with a variety of queries.  When the office was established 13 years ago, the groundwork was laid by Mr. Michael Mills, the first holder of that office.  It is to his credit that the office has been developed to its current state.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman dealt with 3,181 problems last year, a 10 per cent increase.  This increase is not so much due to a negative view of the Civil Service and other public bodies but to the greater publicity given to the office of Ombudsman in recent times.  That is a welcome development which Mr. Murphy should be complimented on.</P>
      <P>There is a greater response to the office of Ombudsman from rural than from urban areas. Therein lies another message, that is, the part played by local radio and provincial newspapers in highlighting and advertising the availability of staff from the Ombudsman's office throughout rural Ireland.  That is a welcome development, albeit they operate from the offices of the citizens' advice bureau.  I would ask the Minister to investigate the possibility of providing the services of the Ombudsman in sub-offices throughout the country on a permanent basis and not necessarily through the offices of the citizens' advice bureau.</P>
      <P>All citizens are entitled to be dealt with properly, fairly and impartially.  Those words come loudly and clearly from the report.  Another positive aspect of the report is that the Ombudsman is prepared to be proactive rather than reactive in many of the ways in which he is dealing, or proposes to deal, with matters.  That will lead to a far better society.  It will alleviate many of the hardships of people who go to the Ombudsman as a last resort.</P>
      <P>Many Members and public representatives realise that they have failed on occasion due the rigidity of officials in public authorities.  If such officials make a statement, it must stand.  Even when the Ombudsman took up a particular case with the Department of Health, according to the report, the official took the matter all the way to the Attorney General's office.  Is it necessary in 1997 that a query of the Ombudsman should go all the way up the line to the Attorney General before somebody in the Department of Health finally capitulated?  While I do not want to criticise the Civil Service and public servants in general, some individuals within the public service have built little empires which they do not want interfered with.  The instance to which I refer was a case of last resort where the highest legal officer in the land had to be called in to decide on the acceptance of the advice of the Ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too often principles of good administration are not observed by public bodies and, unfortunately, in many cases by Departments.  I welcome Mr. <Col N="1517" /> Murphy's positive approach in the 1996 report, highlighting the best standards of practice.  I ask the Minister, as the person responsible for the public service, to initiate some formal training on a regular in-service basis for public servants.  I know that the younger public servants are bright, intelligent and amenable but there are others who came up under the old regime and their attitude might not be as flexible or receptive.  These latter people caused shock waves when the former Minister, Mr. Boland, suggested in the 1980s that all public servants identify themselves by name on the telephone or by wearing a name tag.  That was resisted for a long time by what was termed faceless people within the public service and those public bodies.  Thank God we have moved away a little from that.  It is much appreciated by the public because there is nothing as bad as to be talking to or making representations to a person one is unable to identify by name or rank.  It is good to know that one can talk to officials in the public service on a friendly basis.  This is especially the case for members of the public who may not be articulate in presenting their case.  It could be lost otherwise.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new provision whereby public bodies will list and provide leaflet information to what the Ombudsman believes will be the standards of best practice.  I hope it will continue and will eventually lead to in-service training on a regular basis for all public servants.</P>
    <P>According to the Ombudsman to deal fairly means avoiding the imposition of penalties which are out of proportion to what is necessary to ensure compliance with rules and proceedings.  It also means being prepared to revise and change them if necessary.  This would be a welcome development.  Given the proliferation of grants, rules and regulations in the area of agriculture it is easy for recipients of grants to make mistakes when applying for them.  Even the slightest mistake can result in the refusal of a grant application. This is unfortunate because many of those making such decisions are not aware that grants and contributions are a part of an applicant's everyday income.  I am aware of instances where, despite the inclusion of accurate information on forms, applications were rejected because it was wrongly displayed, even when it must have been obvious to officials that there was no deceit or fraudulent intent.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry figures highly, among the top three or four, on the list of bodies complained of in the report. It must accede to the charter of rights, which was heralded last year in a blaze of publicity, and which appears to have floundered.  If it was established, there would be far fewer refusals of applications for grants and there would be less delay in their payment.  The Ombudsman has outlined an instance where a grant was refused to an applicant 18 months after he made his submission and which resulted in him losing the possibility of applying successfully for another grant in the interim.  Only when the Ombudsman interceded <Col N="1518" /> on his behalf did officials of the Department finally accede to his application on the basis of information in their files.</P>
    <P>There are also instances of the Department of Social Welfare having sought reimbursement of overpayments.  Yet, in one case of which I am aware, when the Ombudsman finally pursued the matter in detail he discovered an amount of approximately £26,000 owed to the relevant pensioner in addition to the amount the Department had been deducting from him at the rate of approximately £6 per week.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the huge volume of applications and the proliferation of all schemes it is understandable that there will be exceptions. Nonetheless I have rarely heard of any departmental official apologise for the severe hardship he or she may have caused resulting from their mistakes; it appears it is not in their character to apologise and/or regret any such inconvenience. Henceforth the Minister will have to ensure that such an approach becomes part and parcel of all Government Departments.  Departmental officials, like the rest of us, must be able to say: sorry, we did make a mistake, accept that fact and apologise for its consequences.</P>
    <P>Another example is of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry having changed the goalposts or criteria applicable to some grants schemes.  When the REP scheme was initiated relevant criteria and conditions were laid down for applicants when, because of its nature, an advanced payment was made in trust to its various applicants.  Subsequently, when the Department discovered that those conditions were not sufficiently tight, involved some anomaly, it changed them without notice and applied them retrospectively.</P>
    <P>To date there are mountains of such applications lying rejected in the Department, yet none of its officials has ever thought fit to put pen to paper and explain the reasons for their rejection, some so frivolous as to be based on the existence of a non-fenced turf bank in a huge bog in the west, which formed part of the original conditions. Until such time as somebody within that Department examines this aspect with a realistic eye and decides these criteria must be changed many well intentioned people will have their applications notionally rejected but not confirmed in writing.  The exasperating aspect of all of this is that the Department will not commit itself in writing lest somebody challenges their regulations, when earlier decisions would have to be changed.  That takes me back to the little internal monuments built within certain sections of many Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the radically changing manner in which applications must be lodged, in line with the latest technology advances, there must be greater acceptance that ordinary farming folk cannot keep pace.  Indeed, in order to submit an application under many of those schemes any ordinary farmer would practically have to be an accountant, a professional-type smallholder or <Col N="1519" /> lawyer to interpret the fine print on such application forms.  It is serious that schemes which form part of the income upon which those applicants depend are so complex.  It is important that adequate notice be given of changes so that people are informed, and this should be done on an individual basis where applicable.  There is no follow-up to inform applicants as to where the error is or how it can be corrected.  A note or a telephone call to a person to visit an office to verify a change would solve the problem on most occasions, but that is not part of these people's work practices.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to decentralise the Ombudsman's office.  Will the ombudsman for financial institutions report soon or does Mr. Kevin Murphy's report encompass that one also? Apart from the public service and the other areas Mr. Murphy envisages will come within his remit at a later stage &mdash; FÁS, the vocational education committees, and others &mdash; I hope lending institutions will be brought to task for their severe penalties and their habit of distancing themselves when problems arise with customers.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Deputy on his maiden speech which was extremely well delivered. I also compliment the Ombudsman on his report.  Deputy Noonan mentioned that the Ombudsman received 2,536 complaints in 1996 and not 3,414.  There was a carryover from the previous year.  Deputy Noonan said he received about 6,000 complaints and there was no one but himself and his secretary to deal with them.  I do not receive anything like 6,000 complaints, or problems as I prefer to call them, a year; it would be more in the region of 1,000 to 1,500.  Many of those with problems probably go to other public representatives as well and I wonder if any end up with the Ombudsman.  It would be interesting to know how many constituents did so and were successful where previously, having been to their public representative, they were not.  I would be very interested to know that number.</P>
      <P>As a public representative, I always say I cannot get anyone something to which he or she is not entitled.  All we can do is speed up the process by which we get them that to which they are entitled.  I have always defined a public representative as a person who acts as a buffer between the people and the bureaucrats.  That is the essence of democracy and is sometimes forgotten by those who call us messenger boys and denigrate the work of the public representative.  Such work is extremely important.  Under any dictatorial regime or totalitarian state, people have no access to any representation.  Our system is Government of the people, by the people and for the people.  The fact that not as many people as before attend our clinics is because most people have telephones.  Some 50 per cent of the problems I get are communicated to my office by telephone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> I was delighted to see the satisfaction rating for the public service was 70 per cent.  My satisfaction rating would be even higher &mdash; I am 99 per cent satisfied with the public servants I have met and with whom I have had to deal.  Much public representation concerns diplomacy, that is, getting the problem across to the official to whom one speaks.  However, I have met the other 1 per cent in recent times and it has disturbed me.  I have been a member of Dublin Corporation since 1967 and a Dáil Deputy since 1965.  Many of the senior civil servants of that time have now retired and their place has been taken by a batch of young people who do not even know the public representatives.  I have spoken to a number of people in local authorities who resent my intervention, particularly in planning department matters. If a person has a query regarding a planning application, I ask the planning officer to look at the site, but recently some planning officers ask why they should do so, because they have already made a decision &mdash; forgetting that we are there to represent the people, and the people must have access to their public representatives and, through them, to their officials.  Many years ago I was travelling in a lift to see an official and a young public servant asked if I had an appointment; I said &ldquo;no&rdquo; and he told me to wait downstairs. A senior official quietly told the younger official that a public representative could visit any department at any time, with or without an appointment, during business hours.  I told the young official that he would go far, and the further the better.  That attitude is seen occasionally but 99 per cent of our public servants at national and local level are marvellous.  We can be proud of their great tradition.  I recently spoke to the city manager about some of the attitudes I had encountered and suggested it might be necessary to tell these people about the role of public representatives.</P>
    <P>Here is an example of where the Ombudsman might intervene in a case.  I had to go to the Ombudsman &mdash; it was Mr. Michael Mills at that time &mdash; about a case where I was not getting any joy.  I wonder how many other Members of the House have had to contact him.  In another more recent case, a daughter of a constituent had back trouble and was in receipt of injury benefit.  The Department of Social Welfare thought she was fit to return to work but her doctor did not.  The Department seemed to be mistreating someone who was genuinely unwell.  She was entitled to appeal the Department's decision within 21 days and her payments were supposed to stop this week, on October 1.  The medical referee who examined her on 23 September expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  However, this woman has an appointment in Beaumont hospital for spinal injections &mdash; these take six weeks to arrange and are quite unpleasant.  A person who did not have back trouble would not go for these tests.</P>
    <P>Would the Ombudsman be able to contact the Department and say that no one should be <Col N="1521" /> refused social welfare until the appeal has been decided?  This is an important issue which should be examined by the Minister for Social Welfare. Only after appeal should social welfare benefits be stopped.  This is an example of how we, as public representatives, act as a buffer between the people and the bureaucrats.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Ombudsman has dealt with cases where medical cards are taken from people aged 80 years or over.  This might happen in local community centres but the policy of the Eastern Health Board is not to take medical cards from anybody over 80 years of age.  It is a distressful occurrence for elderly people of limited means and it is an important issue.</P>
    <P>I have heard criticism of Question Time in this House.  However, the opportunity to put a question to a Minister is important in that often a problem is solved within four days of placing a question to the Minister when satisfaction was not being achieved through dealing directly with the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>The Department of Social Welfare has now established direct lines of communication for Deputies and this works satisfactorily. As a result I have not had to table any Parliamentary Questions on such issues.  I am delighted with the response of the Department and compliment the nice people staffing that service.</P>
      <P>Anybody who thinks we are elected to this House simply as legislators and not as messengers boys is wrong.  We are messengers boys.  In many ways we are glorified social workers.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to read the concern expressed by the Ombudsman about people not able to articulate their cases effectively.  Occasionally, people find it difficult to put the facts before a Government Department when making representations on their own behalf.</P>
      <P>I note the Ombudsman has 41 staff.  Deputies with one secretary may have up to 5,000 clients per year, but he has 41 staff and dealt with 2,536 clients.  There is something wrong somewhere.</P>
      <P>I would like the Ombudsman to examine legal costs.  The fees payable to the legal profession, ranging from £500 to £3,000 per day, are insane. There are too many lawyers here and the legal profession has lost the run of itself.  I feel bad about the fact that poor people cannot get proper legal representation.</P>
      <P>I compliment many of the public servants I have met.  Tax inspectors are often criticised, but I have found them most helpful.  Many people will not contact them when asked and this is where the difficulty stems from.  It is like dealing with a bank manager &mdash; it is only when his letters are not answered that difficulties begin to arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Due to time constraints, I will state the points very starkly. Allowing the proliferation of masts in Dublin and throughout the country for the mobile phone system is an act of sheer irresponsibility in view of the serious questions which have been raised about the health effect of microwave radiation emitted from these masts.  There is huge concern about this question in nearly every county.  In recent days a delegation, mainly from County Cavan but also from other counties, protested vigorously outside the Dáil against the imposition of further masts in their areas.</P>
      <P>ESAT Digifone and Eircell, the two main companies involved, quote safety standards for microwave radiation levels which are hopelessly out of date and based on immediate post-World War II standards which were set on the criterion that they did not cause burns and heat human tissue &mdash; the so called thermal effect.  The athermal effect of microwave radiation, the unseen effect, was unknown at that time but evidence has been accumulated on the dangers microwave radiation represents in its athermal effects on the human body.</P>
      <P>The International Radiation Protection Association which was to set safe limits took its standards from that time.  It was from that group that the current International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection has emerged.  The International Radiation Protection Association was closely involved with the military and industrial complex and was saturated with that viewpoint and philosophy.</P>
      <P>On the mobile phone itself, an illuminating article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> on 21 September stated that the most recent research shows radiation emitted by mobile phones has caused loss of concentration and lapses in short-term memory. It went on to describe the research carried out and the dangers.  Research published at a conference on mobile phone safety held in Brussels showed that microwave radiation of the type emitted by mobile phones severely, although temporarily, impaired the ability of rats to learn simple tasks.  People might ask if it does that to rats, what would it do to politicians?  It is a severe warning which should be taken on board immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fingal County Council, of which I am a member, has received many applications for permission to erect telecommunications masts and has received documents from an agency of Forbairt essentially backing up the safety standards <Col N="1523" /> of ESAT and Eircell.  Forbairt is not an independent body.  There is a conflict of interest in that its aim is to support Irish and overseas firms to develop all sectors, including technology, and to make a profit.  It is wrong to charge a State company, which is supposedly independent on the mobile phone controversy, with those aims.</P>
    <P>Warnings have been given of which successive Governments have been aware.  Dr. Tom McManus, a former health adviser to the Minister with responsibility for communications, has been ignored.  In 1993 he said there was convincing evidence that electromagnetic fields can affect biological tissue and especially the behaviour of living cells under laboratory conditions.  He went on to say that the policy of prudent avoidance and least regret is being undertaken in different countries. Those policies are being blatantly flouted with the proliferation of these masts.  The weakness of the guidelines issued by the Minister for the Environment last year makes them absolutely useless.  We now have a proliferation of masts in the heart of residential communities.  For example, the deal done with the Garda behind the backs of the people to allow these antennae in the heart of residential communities is quite shameful.</P>
    <P>Asbestosis is a horrible, crippling disease which destroyed a generation of workers.  It was years before its deadly effects became known.  I am warning that microwave radiation is potentially similar and an even more insidious threat.  In case I am accused of scaremongering, as I have been by colleagues of the Minister on the county council, can the Minister say she is certain we will not find in the future that terrible damage, which is as yet unseen, is being done which could take a great toll on people's lives and health?</P>
    <P>The Government should urgently publish new guidelines, which include prudent avoidance and least regret as fundamentals, on where these masts can be located.  Those guidelines should also deal with the environmental concerns in regard to how these masts can destroy the landscape.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Joe Higgins for raising this matter to which I am glad to respond.  I was very interested in what he said.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the fact he is a member of Fingal County Council.  As he is aware, the construction of new masts is subject to planning legislation.  I presume Fingal County Council has debated this matter and reached democratic decisions.  Issues such as the number of masts in a particular area and the co-location and sharing of masts are planning issues which are the responsibility of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is, however, committed to promoting the sharing of masts where possible. In this regard, guidelines for planning authorities entitled, &ldquo;Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures&rdquo;, published by the Department <Col N="1524" /> of the Environment in July last year &mdash; which the Deputy mentioned, although he obviously does not agree with them &mdash; provide that planning authorities should encourage the sharing of facilities.  The guidelines provide information on the technical aspects of mobile telephone infrastructures and also set out guidelines on the siting, location and sharing of mast sites.</P>
    <P>The recently adopted European Union directive on the interconnection of networks also requires member states to promote the sharing of facilities.  My Department is looking at the possibility of bringing forward proposals to provide a legislative basis for the mandatory sharing of masts and other telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
    <P>On the health concerns raised by the Deputy, it should be noted that mobile telephones in use in Ireland meet the exposure standards recommended by major health advisory bodies world-wide. The Deputy referred to those guidelines and I have noted his reservations about them.</P>
    <P>Compliance with international non-ionising radiation emission standards is a condition attached to all telecommunications licences for mobile telephony services issued in Ireland.  The Director of Telecommunications Regulation, Ms Étain Doyle, to whom I referred yesterday at Question Time, is now responsible for ensuring compliance with licence conditions.  I understand she is currently looking at this issue and intends to put in place suitable arrangements for the future.</P>
    <P>In 1996 a major review of the health issues was carried out.  The report concluded there is no substantive evidence of adverse health effects from exposure.  Tests were carried out throughout the country by Forbairt, to which the Deputy referred and about which he obviously has reservations. Further research in the area has been proposed recently in a report commissioned by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>Arising from the increasing number of inquiries being received in my Department from local authorities, health boards and elected representatives from all parties with regard to concerns about the health aspects of mobile 'phone towers, MMDS masts and other transmission infrastructure, it has been decided to hold an international conference on this issue early next year.  The conference is at the early planning stage but I will keep Members informed as progress is made.  I hope the conference will be open, discursive and will bring forward views from all perspectives on the issues involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this matter and thank the Minister for Finance for attending in the House.  I raise this issue in the context of difficulties having arisen with regard to farm incomes in the current year.  There have been problems with the cereal crop and cattle prices have fallen primarily because of the BSE crisis.  The number of full-time farmers is decreasing rapidly and on the basis of the Santer proposals it appears that agriculture in the EU will see dramatic change in the future.</P>
      <P>There is a problem with the approach adopted by the Revenue Commissioners.  There is a system of self-assessment for tax in place for the self-employed and those in the farming sector. However, given the nature of the farming industry and the unpredictability about eventual profit margins in any one year with large fluctuations from one year to another, there is a need to ensure the Revenue Commissioners will adopt a flexible approach to this issue.</P>
      <P>The recent implementation of the directive was not as severe in the past.  I have had contacts on this matter from people in the accountancy profession as well as from those in agriculture.  At a time when the sector is going through dramatic change and income has deteriorated the standard advice from Teagasc is to cut costs to ensure sustainability &mdash; advice with which I concur &mdash; this approach by the Revenue Commissioners will add additional costs.  Given the Minister's experience I am sure he is aware of the problems being faced.  There should be flexibility in the application of this directive from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this matter.  The issue raised by the Deputy relates to the payment of income tax by the self-employed, including farmers, under the self-assessment system.  Self-assessment for income tax was introduced in 1988 in a major simplification of the tax system.  While some further simplifications have been made, the underlying system is the same as introduced in 1988.</P>
      <P>The system involves the payment of preliminary tax by 1 November in each tax year; the filing of a return of income by 31 January after the end of the relevant tax year; and the payment of any balance of tax due over and above preliminary tax paid, by 30 April after the return filing date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The self-employed taxpayer has three options as regards how much preliminary tax he or she should pay without being exposed to an interest charge.  Under the first option he or she can pay 90 per cent of the estimated tax liability for the current tax year.  Under the second, he or she can <Col N="1526" /> pay 100 per cent of the previous year's tax liability. Most taxpayers take this option since it does not involve estimation of the current year's liability. Under the third option, the taxpayer can spread the payments over the tax year by using the direct debit system.</P>
    <P>In that case, an amount equal to 105 per cent of the pre-preceding year's tax liability can be used as a basis for the instalment arrangements so as to give sufficient certainty for the taxpayer to start the instalments early in the current year. The direct debit scheme allows a person to spread the preliminary tax payment over a period of 12 months and facilitates the management of cash-flow throughout the year.</P>
    <P>If the correct amount is not paid under any of the above options or if the tax is paid late, then interest is charged at the rate of 1.25 per cent per month or 15 per cent per annum.  This is a statutory rate of interest which is chargeable on late or insufficient payments in the case of all taxes administered by the Revenue Commissioners. The charging of interest underpins the whole tax collection system and the rate needs to be set at a level which will encourage the highest degree of compliance.  The amount paid is not allowed as a deduction in one's accounts.  It is a dead tax that cannot be claimed back.</P>
    <P>The charging of interest on late or insufficient preliminary tax payments also ensures equity with the PAYE sector and avoids a situation whereby the majority of self-employed taxpayers who pay the correct amount of tax on time are at a disadvantage in their trading activities as against those who do not pay on time.  However, exceptional and unforeseen circumstances can occasionally lead to a situation where the self-employed taxpayer gets his calculation of preliminary tax wrong, or pays late, despite his best efforts.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are prepared to consider such cases sympathetically.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind he should bring it to the attention of the Collector-General's Office in Sarsfield House, Limerick, setting out the full circumstances involved.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners have also indicated that where a taxpayer has not met the preliminary tax payment for 1996/97 and a topping up payment in respect of that year is made by 1 November 1997 in conjunction with the preliminary tax payment for 1997/98, Revenue will have regard to this in assessing compliance for 1996/97.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the preliminary tax requirements are extensively published and that each taxpayer under the self-assessment system is advised of those requirements and the interest provisions arising from late or inadequate payments, when the Notice of Preliminary Tax issues each year.  In addition, an advertising campaign is currently under way to make taxpayers aware of the consequences of failing to meet the preliminary tax criteria under self-assessment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> I am satisfied that the statutory provisions relating to the charging of interest in cases where the payment of preliminary tax is either insufficient or late are reasonable and effective.  The operation of the provisions will, of course, be kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for accepting this item for debate and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, for his presence.  He is very familiar with the hospital in question.  This application was initiated in 1992 and has had a long and turbulent gestation in the Department of Health, which consulted the administrators and governors of the hospital &mdash; the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood, Ballinasloe, County Galway.</P>
      <P>Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinalsoe, County Galway, is outside the jurisdiction of the health boards.  Nevertheless, it provides a very important service offering the highest standards of health care to the people of east Galway and the midlands. Indeed, its catchment area extends into the Minister Deputy Cowen's and Deputy Fahey's constituencies.  This area encompasses Athlone, Mullingar, Longford, south Roscommon, east Galway, Loughrea and Portumna.</P>
      <P>Last June, about two days before the election, after much petitioning to the then Minister, the project was sanctioned and approved and approximately £2.5 million was allocated for the capital extension at the hospital.  This extension would entail the replacement of three theatres currently located in prefabricated buildings.  I do not know of any other hospital in Ireland where surgical work of the highest standards &mdash; which is a compliment to the medical and nursing staff there &mdash; is carried out in third world conditions. From this time of the year onwards there is probably not much demand for an anaesthetist in these theatres, so extreme are the temperatures. As is common in all theatres air conditioning is required during summer and winter months as temperatures fluctuate to a wide degree. However, thanks to the magnificent work of the surgical, medical and other staff at Portiuncula things have worked satisfactorily to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officer and representatives of Portiuncula Hospital were in constant contact during the summer months with Department of Health officials finalising and hammering out the details of bills of quantities and tender procedures in order that a contractor would be appointed to do the work.  If the matter had been allowed to run its normal course we would now be starting up on the site.  However, we find ourselves in the awful situation where the project is under review, something which comes as a major shock to the people involved.  I do not know what that review entails but if it follows the pattern of other departmental reviews it effectively means stalling.  That is not acceptable.  The Minister of <Col N="1528" /> State Deputy Fahey, as a west of Ireland Minister, must understand far better than most what this setback means to the people who work so hard in Portiuncla Hospital to provide a health care service.</P>
    <P>The three theatres to be included in the capital works programme include a coronary care unit, an ordinary surgical theatre, an eight bed intensive care unit and the other ancillary facilities required in a modern hospital.  I implore the Minister to take action immediately so that Portiuncula Hospital will not come under this review. This project should be allowed go to tender so that work can commence as a matter of urgency. In the interests of medical safety I ask the Minister, through the Minister of State, to make an immediate decision in this regard before any serious damage is done.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Burke for raising this issue and I welcome him to the House as a new Deputy.  I am pleased to be back myself for the first time following a period of absence.  Deputy Burke and I have sparred on opposite sides of the fence in south and east Galway for many years and I am happy to see him in the House as he is a gentleman.</P>
      <P>I want to record formally the Government's gratitude to the many dedicated staff, religious and lay, who have made an important contribution over the years to the health and quality of life of the people in the catchment area served by Portiuncula Hospital.  I assure Deputy Burke of the Government's ongoing commitment to maintain the services provided there.</P>
      <P>In that context, the hospital received a revenue allocation from the Department of £11.4 million in 1997 to provide medical services.  In providing these services the hospital not only plays a major role in the life of east Galway but also serves significant proportions of the population in Counties Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly and Longford.</P>
      <P>In regard to the development to which the Deputy refers, I should explain that the project involves a new extension to the hospital at first floor level comprising three operating theatres, ICU/CCU, endoscopy, etc., and alterations to the existing building to accommodate links and a new passenger lift.</P>
      <P>The current position in relation to the development is that the hospital has recently submitted to the Department lists of main contractors and mechanical, electrical and lift subcontractors from which it is proposed to seek tenders.  In regard to the timescale, I cannot be definite as to when the development might proceed until the Health capital allocation for 1998 has been decided by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total estimated cost of this project is of the order of £6 million including design fees, construction work costs, equipment, etc., and provision has been made in the capital programme for 1997 to cover the planning fees and other preparatory costs associated with the project.  The <Col N="1529" /> timing of the tendering process and the commencement of construction will be considered in the context of the capital budget for 1998 and the other competing demands for inclusion in the Department's capital programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke will understand as well as I do that a commitment made two days before an election is one we are all prone to make but the fact remains that the previous Minister did not provide for the money to back up that commitment. That is a difficulty for the present Minister and for the Department generally.  In addition, the allocation for the capital programme for 1997 was considerably down which has placed a considerable burden of ongoing costs on the Department as we approach the 1998 Estimates.  Against that background, I must be frank and say I do not believe we will be in a position to do anything about proceeding with this project in the foreseeable future.  I regret, therefore, that I cannot give any definite news in relation to the scheduling of the tendering and construction work at this time but I am fully aware, as is the Minister, of the concerns of the hospital that the project proceed.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again that Portiuncula has a major role to play in complementing the services of the major acute hospitals in the western and adjacent health board areas.  The development will be considered as a matter of urgency with all other projects when the 1998 capital Estimates are known.</P>

      <P>While this matter relates to a specific case a number of similar cases have been raised in the House by me and other Deputies in recent years. Some years ago we rightly decided to enact legislation which provided that the spouse of a separated woman in receipt of a one parent family payment should contribute to the maintenance of his family.  However, it was never anticipated that a woman in these circumstances would have to take adequate steps to recover maintenance from her husband.  It may be easy for some women to do this but it may not be possible for others.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the woman referred to in my parliamentary question is in this position but in an acrimonious marriage breakdown it is often very difficult for the woman to pursue her spouse through the courts.  The legislation never anticipated that this course of action would be a necessity and it merely provided that steps should be taken by the applicant to ensure maintenance was paid.  The reply to my parliamentary question states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Her entitlement to a lone parent's allowance was subsequently examined.  One of the conditions for receipt of this allowance is that the claimant must make and continue to make reasonable efforts to prevail upon her husband to contribute to the support and maintenance <Col N="1530" /> of herself and her children.  This is based on the underlying principle set out clearly in social welfare legislation that the primary obligation lies with the spouses to maintain each other and their children.</P>
    <P>I accept this but object to the degree to which the vulnerable party, the applicant, is forced to pursue her partner through the courts notwithstanding her financial position.  The application of the law is wrong in this regard.</P>
    <P>This is not a new problem, it has been ongoing for some time.  I know applicants with no resources who have almost been forced into penury by virtue of having to pursue their spouses through the court.  These women are being treated unfairly.</P>
    <P>As regards this case, I ask the Minister to intervene to ensure that payment is made as soon as possible.  When this woman has some financial independence she can then pursue her spouse through the courts.  It is not a simple matter to pursue a case through the courts and win.</P>
    <P>The reply given to my parliamentary question was not entirely accurate in terms of the maintenance being paid.  I am not suggesting that I was given a deliberately inaccurate reply but I ask the Minister to examine the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which he also raised by way of parliamentary question on 30 September.  As the Minister explained, the person concerned applied for deserted wife's benefit in October l996 and her application was disallowed as the social insurance contribution condition was not satisfied.  Her yearly average of paid or credited contributions was 16, which is below the yearly average of 24 required for benefit qualification.</P>
      <P>The deciding officer is satisfied that the applicant is deserted and this is not an issue.  What is at issue is that there is a legal onus on the person concerned to make and continue to make reasonable efforts to prevail upon her husband to contribute to the support and maintenance of herself and her children.  This is based on the underlying principle, set out clearly in social welfare legislation, that the primary obligation lies with spouses to maintain each other and their children.</P>
      <P>In November 1996 the person concerned was requested by the Department to make appropriate efforts to get adequate maintenance from her husband through the district court under family law.  Again in March, May and August 1997 she was asked to provide evidence that she was seeking maintenance from her spouse through the courts.</P>
      <P>During this period the Department became aware that her husband had agreed to pay her informal maintenance of £20 per week.  However, the deciding officer considers this would not be adequate maintenance in their circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned indicated to the Department on 5 September 1997 that she intended to <Col N="1531" /> initiate court proceedings for maintenance from her husband.  A decision will be made on her entitlements as soon as the Department receives confirmation from her of this action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The other information I gave, of <Col N="1532" /> which the Department does not seem to be aware, is not incorporated in the reply and, therefore, it is not accurate.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 7 October 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 22, 43, 50, 52 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The strength of the FCA and An Slua Muirí as at 30 June 1997 the latest date for which figures have been compiled was 14,638 and 369, respectively. Recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force is ongoing and continuous at local level to replace wastage.  Recruitment of new members includes visits to schools on a regular basis and local advertising.  The Defence Forces are concerned at all times to recruit active, young people with a view to keeping strengths at appropriate levels and introducing young people to military discipline and, indeed, preparing those who may be interested for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to female members of An Slua Muirí, the position is that the necessary administrative and logistical infrastructure is being put in place to allow for the recruitment of female personnel. As these arrangements are now nearing completion it is anticipated that recruitment of <Col N="1534" /> female personnel to An Slua Muirí will commence in the near future.</P>
    <P>The activities of the FCA range from normal military training, ceremonial duties and the performance of security duties.  Military training involves weekly parades, weekend camps, attendance for full-time annual training and courses of instruction.  The designated role of An Slua Muirí is to assist the Naval Service in seaward defence, port control and examination of vessels and provision of a signal and communications service for seaward defence.  However, their training is in the areas of port control exercises, the boarding of ships and the operation of the naval base as well as attendance at annual training and courses of instruction.  There is now no emphasis on seaward defence.</P>
    <P>The role and reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force is comprehended by the restructuring and reorganisation of the Defence Forces that is taking place at present.  The current emphasis, however, is on the reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force.  The Defence Forces review implementation plan provides for a special review of the Reserve Defence Force to be undertaken during the course of the plan, 1996-97.  A considerable amount of preliminary work connected with this review has already taken place.  The review itself is expected to commence shortly.  The question of establishing new units of the reserve, including any proposals in that regard relating to the Air Corps, will be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>Primary responsibility for law enforcement within the State rests with the Garda Síochána. However, when assistance is requested by the Garda the Permanent Defence Force provides such assistance.</P>
    <P>In the case of Civil Defence local authorities are responsible for recruitment as and when vacancies arise.  Posters and literature are displayed in churches, schools and youth clubs to encourage new membership.</P>

      <P>The hours worked by pesonnel on security duties vary according to location and the security situation at any particular time.  In general, personnel detailed for barrack or post security are employed on that duty for 24 hours.  The hours worked on other type security duties, such as providing aid to the civil power, cannot be accurately predicted as it depends upon the security situation and resources available at any particular time.  A security duty allowance is payable when Permanent Defence Force personnel are required <Col N="1535" /> to carry out such duties outside of their normal working schedule.</P>
      <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, matters relating to pay and allowances come within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) and the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers (RACO) and may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the associations.  The question of a review of security duty allowance has been raised with PDFORRA under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme and in the context of the agreement reached with the association under the local bargaining clause of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  It is intended to proceed with this review in the near future.  Under the terms of the scheme, as agreed with the association, discussions on issues being processed under the scheme are confidential and you will appreciate, therefore, that it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 33, 39 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that, to date, about 9,500 claims have been made against the Department of Defence by serving and former members of the Defence Forces alleging hearing impairment from unprotected exposure to gunfire.  New claims continue to come in at a rate of around 100 per week. At the end of August 1997 settlements had been reached in 699 cases and court awards following hearing had been made in 25 cases.  A further 23 cases were successfully defended or withdrawn. Compensation of £19.355 million and plaintiff costs of £3.108 million have been paid in respect of 724 cases finalised to date.</P>
      <P>The strategy for dealing with these cases by the Government has been, firstly, to identify suitable cases for determination by the courts.  By &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; is meant those cases where the alleged hearing impairment is either not significant or is not attributable to any wrongdoing on the part of the State.  Those cases in which the hearing impairment sustained is both significant and attributable to the negligence of the State are being dealt with either on the basis of an agreed settlement or, where such is not possible, by the courts in the ordinary manner.</P>
      <P>The present system whereby these actions are being processed by the courts in the normal manner is both costly to the taxpayer and is a lengthy and often difficult process for injured parties and their families.  I am mindful that my responsibility as Minister for Defence is to the taxpayer as well as to the members of the Defence Forces, past and present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a compensation tribunal were to be established by the Government the assessment of such cases might result in a considerable saving to the taxpayer in terms of legal and associated costs which make up a substantial proportion of the costs of the claims processed to date.  A tribunal <Col N="1537" /> might also ensure a speedy means of resolving genuine claims.</P>
    <P>However, the absence of an agreed method of assessing hearing handicap is a major impediment to the establishment of such a tribunal.  We are talking about considerable sums of money in overall terms and if there is a method whereby the bill can be reduced then it must be examined. I have, therefore, directed that a Memorandum be prepared for submission to the Government as a matter of urgency on the financial implications of these actions, with a view to deciding how best the public interest and the legitimate interest of those who are suffering from genuine hearing impairment can be reconciled.</P>

      <P>In view of the role of the Army Equitation School which is to promote and advertise the Irish non-thoroughbred horse, it is important that Army riders be mounted on the best possible horses. Indeed, the Equitation School has fulfilled its mission with distinction down the years through its participation and many successes in equitation events at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Funding for the equitation school is provided from the national lottery.  There is an allocation of £155,000 available this year for the purchase of horses.  I am aware that the cost of top quality horses has increased significantly in recent years and I intend to explore with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, ways of developing the potential of the school in order to achieve common objectives in relation to the Irish horse industry.</P>
      <P>There are currently five riding officers in the equitation school, two of whom compete on the international circuit.  Of the remainder, one is of national standard and two have recently started their competitive careers at national level.  A further three equitation cadets are currently undergoing their cadet training at the Curragh and are expected to be commissioned next summer. The school currently has a total of 39 horses of which eight are international and 19 are national standard showjumpers.  The remainder is made up of brood mares and student standard horses.  I intend to ensure that sufficient numbers of good quality horses continue to be acquired by the Army Equitation School in order to maintain the proud tradition of that establishment.</P>

      <P>The female strength in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps on that date was 266, 10 and 18 respectively.

The deployment of new military personnel is a matter for the military authorities based on the operational requirements of the force.</P>
    <P>One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the efficiency audit group was the development of a personnel policy with emphasis on lowering the age profile.  It is essential in order to maintain the operational effectiveness of the Defence Forces that we continue to recruit new young blood into the organisation which is essentially a young person's profession.  The required reduction in the strength to 11,500 over the three years of the first phase of the plan and the lowering of the age profile, is being achieved by means of a programme of recruitment of young personnel on a continuous basis combined with a voluntary early retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>A total of 200 personnel have been recruited in 1996 and 600 to date in 1997.  Also, 46 cadetships have been awarded in 1997 and the successful candidates will commence cadet training shortly. Additionally, 17 apprenticeships will be offered this year and in this regard advertisements will be placed in the national press on 3 October 1997.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to purchase an additional fishery protection patrol vessel for the Naval Service as part of the 1996 to 2000 EU fishery protection programme. The cost of the vessel will attract EU support.  Tenders have been received and are currently being assessed with the assistance of marine engineering consultants.  It is anticipated that a contract will be placed for the new vessel by the end of this year and that construction time for the vessel will be of the order of 20 to 24 months. The vessel will be equipped with the most up to date equipment relevant to its fishery protection role.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service fleet currently consists of seven patrol vessels.  These undergo regular and planned maintenance and repair to ensure maximum availability to meet operational requirements.  In this context successive EU fishery protection programmes have facilitated certain planned maintenance and re-equipping to extend the service life of the vessels.  Three vessels &mdash;<i>LE Deirdre, LE Emer</i> and <i>LE Aoife</i> have been refurbished to date.  Refurbishment of the <i>LE Aisling</i> is currently under way.  The remaining vessels are due to undergo refitting in the period 1998-2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>I am entirely satisfied with the level of attention paid to health and safety matters within the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces have put a great deal of work into implementing the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 demonstrating a high degree of commitment to the safety of all of its members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> A Defence Forces Advisory Committee on Health and Safety, comprising both civilian and military personnel, has been engaged in directing and monitoring a comprehensive implementation of the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  The 1994 report of the Defence Forces Advisory Committee to the Health and Safety Authority acknowledged the excellent work undertaken by the Defence Forces and made recommendations in the light of the work which had already been done in an area which the report acknowledged as being a constantly evolving process.</P>
    <P>The report made recommendations in the following areas; management and promotion of occupational safety and health in the Defence Forces; reporting of accidents and dangerous occurrences; consultation at barrack level; education and training.</P>
    <P>The recommendations made in these areas are being addressed under the auspices of the Defence Forces Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>The report specifically acknowledged the excellent work done by the Defence Forces in the areas of education and training and suggested a policy of continued education and training throughout the Defence Forces.  In this regard, the following measures are ongoing: each command is running courses for manual handling, fire and first aid in addition to safety officers and safety representative courses.  All personal requiring manual handling training are fully trained; to date, over 33 personnel have attended the UCD diploma course in Safety; 29 NCOs have obtained certificates in safety through UCD; the Defence Forces safety officers course is now a recognised course by the National Irish Safety Organisation.</P>

      <P>One of the most serious problems facing the Defence Forces which was identified by the Efficiency Audit Review Group and their consultants, Price Waterhouse, was the high age profile of the members of the Defence Forces.  As part of the restructuring and reorganisation of the Defence Forces which is taking place at present is the putting in place of a comprehensive manpower policy.</P>
      <P>A voluntary early retirement scheme was introduced in 1996 and this together with a reduction in the upper age limit for recruits is a first step towards addressing the age profile problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners while the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  During the course of routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti-drug smuggling operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Services to respond effectively to such taskings. Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 has also increased the <Col N="1543" /> role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area.</P>
    <P>Pollution control at sea is a matter for the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  The Naval Service is available to respond to requests from the Department to assist in the control of pollution at sea but no such requests have been received in recent years.</P>
    <P>At present the Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying patrol vessels, four off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  The Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone.  These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed at all areas of Irish waters as necessary.  Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by two CASA maritime patrol aircraft. As I have indicated in my reply to Question No. 18, it is planned to provide the Naval Service with an additional patrol vessel.</P>
    <P>Pending delivery of the new vessel the Naval Service will continue to carry out its various roles using the existing seven patrol vessels.  Three of these vessels were refurbished in recent years and another is currently undergoing a major overhaul to replace and refurbish obsolete or deteriorated equipment and extend its operational life.</P>
    <P>The current strength of the Naval Service is 1,096.  Arising from the recruitment campaign for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force in 1996 and 1997, 20 recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service on 30 December 1996 and 80 have been enlisted in 1997.  A further ten Naval Cadets will commence training shortly and it is proposed to enlist seven apprentices for training in the service in the near future.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a study of the Naval Service and Air Corps is currently being undertaken by the Efficiency Audit Group as part of the review of the Defence Forces.  The resulting report will serve as a blueprint for the future development of both services.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for women in the Defence Forces and to the full participation of women in all aspects of Defence Forces activity including operational and ceremonial duties.  I am fully satisfied with the position regarding participation by women in the Defence Forces and with the facilities <Col N="1544" /> available to women for the furtherance of their military careers.</P>
      <P>Recruitment for service in all elements of the Defence Force is open to men and women on an equal basis.  Accordingly, men and women are eligible to compete on an equal basis at recruitment competitions and women are also eligible to take part in internal promotion competitions under the same conditions as those that apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same military training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.  In essence the basis of selection at entry level and for internal promotion is suitability rather than gender.</P>
      <P>While the number of women joining the Defence Forces might appear to be somewhat lower than the number of men joining, the actual position merely reflects the much greater number of male applicants for entry to the Forces.  I am satisfied that the recruitment and promotion competitions are carried out in a fair and competitive manner.</P>
      <P>Women are also liable for the full range of military operational and ceremonial duties.  I am satisfied that women are not discriminated against in any way either at recruitment or in participation in the full range of military duties, education courses and training courses.</P>
      <P>Recruitment to An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil is also open to men and women on an equal basis. Membership of the FCA is now 20 per cent female.  However, recruitment to An Slua Muirí has been delayed pending the making of the necessary administrative and logistical arrangements for the admission of females to both the Naval Service and An Slua Muirí.  Women have been serving in the Naval Service since 1995 and it is anticipated that it will be possible to admit women to An Slua Muirí shortly.</P>

In their review of the Defence Forces, Price Waterhouse management consultants suggested that an appropriate ratio of pay to non-pay expenditure for the Defence Forces should be 70:30.

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended to amend progressively the ratio of pay to non-pay spending and it has been agreed with the Minister for Finance that future <Col N="1545" /> pay savings projected at some £7.5 million a year will be available for investment in the Defence Forces from 1999 onwards.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 36 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's participation in UN missions generally originates with a formal request to the Irish Government by the United Nations Secretary General, following adoption of a Resolution by the UN Security Council, to deploy a multinational force to a particular region.</P>
      <P>The factors which inform the Government's consideration of each such request include the following:</P>
      <P>1.  An assessment of whether a peacekeeping operation is the most appropriate response to the situation;</P>
      <P>2.  consideration of how the proposed mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy;</P>
      <P>3.  the degree of risk involved for UN personnel and in this regard the safety of Irish Defence Forces personnel is always of paramount concern to the Minister for Defence and to the Government;</P>
      <P>4.  the extent to which the particular skills or characteristics required relate to Irish capabilities;</P>
      <P>5.  the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate which has the potential to contribute to a political solution;</P>
      <P>6.  whether the operation is adequately resourced;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1546" /> 7.  the level of existing commitments to peacekeeping operations, including consideration of security needs at home.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces are currently participating in a number of overseas missions involving a total of 750 personnel.  Troops serving on such missions are provided with adequate resources to carry out their tasks.</P>
    <P>New equipment for the Defence Forces is acquired in accordance with national and European Union procedures relating to public procurement. Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders which are assessed on the basis of obtaining best value for money by the Department.  When tendering in this area suppliers may submit third-party funding proposals which would have the effect of spreading the impact of the cost of aquiring new equipment through a period of time &mdash; thus lessening the requirement for large once-off provisions in the Vote.  However there is normally an additional interest cost involved.  The advantages or disadvantages of third-party financing proposals must be assessed on a case by case basis having regard to factors such as the type of equipment; the scale of cost; the type of financing offered and any additional costs connected with it; the comparative cost of Exchequer borrowing; the availability of funds in the Vote; etc.</P>
    <P>The question of procuring armoured personnel carriers is under consideration in my Department at present.  A project team has been established comprising civilian and military personnel and has been tasked with identifying the most suitable type of APC for the Defence Forces, the numbers and variants required and the estimated costs involved.  Procurement of APC's will be undertaken by way of a competition which will be conducted in accordance with Government contracts procedures.</P>

Irish military personnel have built up a considerable reputation as peacekeepers having contributed to a total of over 30 UN missions.  As a small country we can be proud of our record in terms of peacekeeping.  The Defence Forces also contribute to peacekeeping operations under the auspices of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE and the EU.

A total of 727 military personnel is currently serving with ten UN missions.  It can be said with pride that Ireland continues to build a long tradition of service to the founding principles of the UN by making practical commitments of personnel on a continuing basis &mdash; proportionately, far beyond its size.</P>
    <P>As well as the extensive involvement of Irish military personnel in UN peacekeeping operations, a number of senior military officers have, down the years served with distinction in senior appointments in UN missions.  Currently Major General David Stapleton is serving as Force Commander of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in Syria, UNDOF.  These appointments bring prestige and honour not only to the Defence Forces but to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>It must be said that the Defence Forces derive considerable benefits from participation in international peacekeeping missions.  In so far as experience and training are concerned the professional advantages gained in such missions are very substantial.</P>
    <P>Down the years the making available of contingents for overseas service has been possible by drawing small numbers of personnel from units throughout the commands.  The level of overseas participation is, however, kept under continual review in order to ensure that security needs at home can be met at all times and that the cost to the Defence Vote does not become excessive.  In this latter regard it must be borne in mind that certain peacekeeping missions are now conducted on the basis of contributing countries bearing their own mission costs.</P>
    <P>The concept of stand-by forces for UN peacekeeping missions has been in the course of development since 1990.  This system is intended to enhance the United Nations' capacity for rapid response to emergency situations.  I am happy to say that it has been decided that the Defence Forces will participate in this system, known as the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System, UNSAS.  Participation in UNSAS would not entail the commitment of additional personnel for UN service over and above the numbers which obtained during Ireland's participation in UN service in Somalia, i.e. 850 military personnel. There would be no obligation to participate in any particular mission and, as at present, Dáil approval would be required for the dispatch of a contingent to a specific operation.  Our decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, Ireland is currently contributing to SFOR, the NATO-led stabilisation force in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This mission operates under a United Nations Security Council mandate.  Last month I had the <Col N="1548" /> privilege of visiting Irish personnel serving in that region.  I felt immensely proud that Ireland is contributing to the very worthy efforts of the various missions which are endeavouring to ensure peace and stability in that area.  A significant factor is that our involvement in this mission reflects the importance of staying in the mainstream of peacekeeping at a time when the UN is increasingly turning to regional solutions in troubled areas.</P>
    <P>Defence Forces participation in peacekeeping missions involves major operational taskings and a heavy financial commitment.  It is my policy to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to continue in this very important role of peacekeeping under the auspices of the UN, the OSCE and the EU.</P>
    <P>Overall, international participation by the Defence Forces in peacekeeping missions has had considerable benefits and has been a positive element in our relations with other countries.</P>

I might add that revised complaints procedures for the Defence Forces were agreed with PDFORRA and RACO and implemented with effect from May 1996. These procedures included the appointment of an independent complaints inquiry officer to investigate grievances on behalf of the Minister.  The agreement provides for a two year trial period after which a review will take place, in May 1998.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces Review &mdash; Implementation Plan, 1996-1998 provided for special studies to be carried out on the Air Corps and the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>In July 1996, the efficiency audit group engaged Price Waterhouse Management Consultants to conduct the special studies into the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  The consultants subsequently furnished a preliminary draft report to the EAG. Amongst other things the draft report highlighted those issues which required to be studied in greater detail and identified a number of new issues which required examination.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, and rather than publishing a report which identified problems requiring further attention it was decided that the consultants should be asked to address these problems in their report.  In this way, the study will be as comprehensive and well grounded as possible, and the resulting report will produce a definitive blueprint for the development of these services in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The consultants are due to report to the Efficiency Audit Group by mid-December 1997. It is my intention to publish this report at the earliest possible juncture.</P>

      <P>The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 provides for the implementation of a European directive on cerain aspects of the organisation of working time.  Section 3 of the Act provides for its non-application to, among others, the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Defence Act, military personnel are liable at all times to render military service.  Therefore, the application to the Defence Forces of legislation relating to the organisation <Col N="1552" /> of working time would be contrary to the principle of military service and would have fundamental organisational and operational implications for the efficiency and effectiveness of the Defence Forces.  As there is no area of the permanent Defence Force that is regarded as non-essential its application to &ldquo;non-essential areas&rdquo; does not arise.</P>
    <P>This position is unequivocally supported by the military authorities.  Members of the Defence Forces are given adequate rest periods following or during occasions when long hours of duty may be necessary.  In this regard, rest periods and sleep periods are often availed of during periods of extended hours of duty.  In addition, the Defence Forces have a very flexible and generous system of leave granting, time-off and &ldquo;days resting off&rdquo; which reflects and caters for the uniqueness of military life.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that existing arrangements and conditions relating to time off and monetary compensation take full cognisance of the nature and requirements of military service and that application of the Organisation of Working Time Act to the Defence Forces would not be appropriate.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces have never used landmines either for offensive or defensive purposes.  They procure small quantities of such mines for training purposes only.</P>
      <P>The recent agreement reached at the negotiations in Oslo on a Global Convention banning anti-personnel landmines represents a major step forward in the struggle to eliminate these inhumane and indiscriminate weapons.  The agreement will be particularly welcomed by those countries which have suffered so much as a result of the use of these barbaric devices.</P>
      <P>It is settled policy that the Defence Forces will not use anti-personnel landmines in any circumstances but they will continue to procure and use small quantities of such mines for purposes of mine clearance training, including the destruction of such items, as well as for equipment research. This is an important factor in order to ensure the protection of Defence Forces personnel serving on overseas missions.  Article 3 of the Oslo Convention provides for such an exemption.</P>
      <P>On initial consideration, it would appear that there will not be any practical implications for the Defence Forces arising from the Oslo Convention. However, before Ireland ratifies the convention it will be necessary for the Department of Foreign Affairs to examine all aspects in relation to the issue, including legislative considerations.</P>

      <P>The Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland has recently decided to set up a committee of inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Blayney to investigate the conduct of members of the institute named in the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Dunnes Payments).  In correspondence with the institute, my Department has sought to clarify a number of matters in relation to the committee of inquiry.  In reply, the institute has indicated that its committee of inquiry will be empowered to publish its report in whatever <Col N="1556" /> manner it sees fit.  The institute is aware of my position that justice should be seen to be done.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the institute has not yet acceded to my request to have my Department observe the proceedings of the committee of inquiry; I am pursuing this matter vigorously with the institute.</P>
      <P>The accountancy profession plays a vital role in the economy, and it makes a major contribution to the industrial and commercial life.  To carry out their role, accountants are placed in a position of trust by society as a whole.  They are trusted to audit corporate accounts, from small firms to the largest of our quoted companies; they are trusted to submit tax returns to the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of their clients; they are trusted to manage corporate insolvencies in the best interests of creditors.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of accountants are upright and conscientious people who abide by the law and who would never encourage or facilitate wrong-doing by their clients.  It is all the more important, therefore, that the actions of a few individuals are not allowed to tarnish the image of the profession as a whole.  It is equally important that low standards should not be tolerated within the profession lest they set the norm for the future behaviour of members.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I would expect the institute's committee of inquiry to conduct its investigations in a professional manner, and on this basis, I have no reason to review the self-regulatory status of the accountancy profession at present.</P>
      <P>I should indicate that it will solely be a matter for the committee of inquiry, once operational, to determine how best to undertake its investigations and to decide how and to what extent information on the course of its proceedings will be made public.  I will have no function in relation to either of these matters.</P>
      <P>If the committee of inquiry or any other inquiries arising from the tribunal report establish that members of the accountancy profession have contravened the Companies Acts, I intend that the relevant evidence will be brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities for a decision on whether or not the prosecution of any such offences is warranted in the courts.</P>

      <Quest>her views on the recent criticism by the Construction Industry Federation in respect of the lack of provision of apprenticeship places in the construction industry; and if she considers that the lack of sponsoring places by firms in that industry is the real problem being encountered by FÁS.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15214/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney) Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The standards-based apprenticeship system, which is operated <Col N="1557" /> by FÁS, was introduced in September 1993, and includes 25 trades at present, of which 12 are construction industry related.</P>
      <P>The duration of an apprenticeship is now four years, approximately, and there are seven phases in all &mdash; four on-the-job with the employer and three off-the-job in a FÁS training centre or an educational college.  At the end of August 1997 there were 4,734 apprentices in the system.  This represents a 32 per cent increase on the previous 12 months, when registrations totalled 3,597, a figure which itself exceeded the target set for the new apprenticeship, by the social partners in the PESP agreement, where the aim was to increase the annual apprentice intake by 1,000 to 3,500.</P>
      <P>This buoyant and welcome increase in apprenticeships has of course placed considerable pressure on the State institutions which provide the necessary off-the-job training for the apprentices. As a result, FÁS has increased and is continuing to increase the number of apprenticeship places in order to meet the growing demand with the minimum of delay.</P>
      <P>In regard to the provision of apprenticeship places by employers in the construction industry, it is generally recognised that the current shortage of certain skilled workers in the industry, such as bricklayers, plasterers and painter-decorators, is the result of insufficient recruitment and training of apprentices by employers in the early years of this decade.  In view of the lead-time of apprentice training, I would urge employers to take a longer term view of their future human resource requirements and, since they are responsible for apprentice recruitment, to provide for the employment and training of adequate numbers of apprentices in order to avoid future skill shortages.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to estimate the final exposure of the State to hearing loss compensation in respect of the Defence Forces.  Already some 9,500 claims have been received and the average payment has been around £25,000 excluding legal costs.  New claims are arriving at the rate of about 100 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current strategy is to identify suitable cases for hearing in court and to adduce evidence that the type of high-frequency hearing loss claimed <Col N="1561" /> does not translate into a significant handicap in daily life.</P>

      <P>Under the Army Pensions Acts a former member of the Permanent Defence Force may apply for compensation in respect of a wound or an injury received on duty or otherwise attributable to service either at home or abroad.  Formal application must be made within one year after the date of discharge-retirement.</P>
      <P>The minimum degree of disablement required to qualify for a pension is 20 per cent.  A disablement gratuity may be granted where the degree of disablement is less than 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>Applications are assessed by the Army Pensions Board which is the statutory body established pursuant to section 5 of the Army Pensions Act, 1927.  It consists of a chairman and two ordinary members.  It assesses the degree of disablement and determines whether the disablement is attributable to military service.</P>
      <P>Under the common law it is open to any serving or former member of the Defence Forces to take a civil action for damages for any personal injury sustained as a result of the alleged negligence or breach of duty of the Minister, his servants or agents.  The Chief State Solicitor acts for Government Departments in the conduct of civil legal claims alleging personal injury due to negligence.</P>

      <P>Following a meeting with the matron and officer in charge of the Curragh hospital, the director, <Col N="1562" /> medical corps decided that there was no justification for two ANS personnel performing night duty as the number of in-patients was averaging between six and ten.  Accordingly, the duty roster now provides for only one nurse on duty at night. The revised roster was implemented successfully last May.  While maintaining adequate staffing levels at night this arrangement also facilitates the provision of an improved service during the day as two extra sisters are available for duty, a nurse who would have been rostered for duty at night and a nurse who would otherwise have been resting off from night duty at a time when the out-patient work load is increasing.</P>
      <P>Four enlisted personnel are also on duty in the hospital at night, some of whom have para-medical qualifications.  Accordingly, adequate technical support is considered to be available to the nurse on duty and I am assured that the personal security of the nurses is also adequately catered for.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" /> The current Commissioners are: Mr. Cathal Mac Domhnaill, Chairman, appointed 3 October 1990; Mr. Dermot Quigley, Commissioner, appointed 3 October 1990; and Mr. Frank Daly, Commissioner, appointed 25 September 1996. While the commissioners are subject to the direction of the Minister for Finance, in practice the commissioners are totally independent in dealing with the specific tax liabilities of individuals and companies.  This was made clear during the debate setting up the Revenue Commissioners in 1923 and has been endorsed in the Dáil by successive Ministers on numerous occasions since.</P>

As data is not available to enable a reliable costing to be made, this figure is tentative. However, it should be pointed out that there is no guarantee that the benefit of this reduction in stamp duty would be passed on to the first-time purchaser.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the Inspector of Taxes office in Cork has refused an application for tax relief in respect of the diploma in safety, health and welfare at work in UCC for the academic year 1996-97 in view of the fact that the Department of Education has listed this course as being eligible for tax relief under section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996, as amended by section 7 of the Finance Act, 1997, for the academic year 1996-1997.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the Department of Education advises them from time to time of courses which have been approved for tax relief under section 15 of Finance Act, 1996 as amended by section 7 of Finance Act, 1997.  A list of the approved courses is sent to all tax offices and is updated as the Department of Education advises that new courses are approved.</P>
      <P>In the case of the course in question, diploma in safety, health and welfare at work, in UCC, the Department of Education advised the Revenue Commissioners on 4 September 1997 that the course had been approved.  I understand that an application for tax relief was refused by the Cork tax office in June of 1997 as the course was not approved at that stage.  The particular taxpayer called to the Cork tax office on 9 September 1997 but as the revised list had not been circulated at that stage the tax office could not confirm that the relief was due for 1996-97.  I understand that the Cork tax office has since been in touch with the taxpayer and that the relevant relief has now been given.</P>

      <P>Article 47.3 of the Constitution provides that voting at a referendum shall be confined to those citizens of Ireland who are eligible to vote in Dáil elections.  The position in relation to referenda is thus more restrictive than is the case in relation to Dáil elections, since Article 16.1.2º provides that Irish citizens and such other persons in the State as may be determined by law shall have the right to vote at Dáil elections.  Arising from this provision, section 8 of the Electoral Act, 1992 extended the right to vote at Dáil elections to resident British citizens.</P>

      <P>Under new arrangements introduced by Iarnród Éireann in August of this year free travel passholders using DART services are required to obtain a ticket including a return ticket if appropriate before commencing their journey, in the same way as other passengers. This is in line with the arrangements already in place for free travel passholders using mainline train services with Iarnród Éireann.  Formerly, such passholders were admitted to DART trains on inspection of their pass by station staff, without the need to obtain a ticket.  The new arrangements were necessary to facilitate access by all commuters to trains via the automatic turnstiles. While this may involve some level of queuing for free travel passholders in obtaining tickets, any <Col N="1571" /> delays involved should only arise during morning and evening peak travel times where the numbers using the DART increase considerably due to commuters travelling to and from work.</P>
      <P>Any alteration of the current free travel pass would have implications for the ticketing arrangements for all of the transport operators involved in the free travel scheme.  An arrangement of this kind is not feasible in the immediate term but the suggestion will be considered in the context of future development of the scheme and emerging technologies.</P>

However, in July last, I referred a request to me for such funding from the Dún Laoghaire Genealogical Society to the Heritage Council, which is a statutory autonomous body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, for consideration.  Under that Act, the functions of the Heritage Council include proposing policies and priorities for the identification, protection, preservation and enhancement of the national heritage, including, <i>inter alia</i>, heritage objects, which in turn, includes genealogical records.  In addition, the Heritage Council has powers to provide advice and assistance including financial assistance to any person or body in respect of any matter which is related to the performance of its functions.

      <P>The submission referred to by the Deputy, concerning the need of schools in County Sligo for a resource teacher post, has been received in my Department.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>For the current school year, a total of 31 additional resource teachers have been allocated to primary schools.  This brings the total number of resource teachers in the primary system to 77.</P>
      <P>I am at present reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the resource teaching service, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the national schools to which he refers, in south Sligo, will be fully considered in the context of any additional allocation of resource teachers which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>Schools are allocated posts of responsibility based on a points rating.  The management authorities of each individual school have discretion as to the allocation of duties to individual postholders, and in practice, schools assign posts for educational, administrative and pastoral duties including, of course, duties associated with anti-drugs education.</P>
      <P>Following the conclusion of the PCW agreement, the following additional posts of responsibility will be created in second level schools.</P>
      <P>A Posts (renamed assistant principal posts) 1,200 approx.</P>
      <P>B Posts (renamed special duties teacher posts) 270 approx.</P>
      <P>The current annual allowance in respect of A and B posts of responsibility is £2,934 and £1,298 respectively.  As there are 763 second level schools &mdash; 1996-97 school year &mdash; the estimated total cost of one additional A post for each school is £2,238,642.  An additional B post for each school would cost £990,374.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department does not have estimated costing for a network of area co-ordinators.  However, in any one area the cost of a co-ordinator together with necessary support services would be of the order of £35,000.  The costs involved in establishing a post of national co-ordinator <Col N="1579" /> together with support services would be of the order of £40,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations governing the redeployment panel result from an agreement negotiated in 1937 between the Catholic bishops and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO).</P>
      <P>The agreement is incorporated into the Rules for National Schools.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the redeployment panels operate very efficiently and I have no immediate plans to initiate a review of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Catholic panels are compiled on a diocesan basis.  Accordingly, each diocese has its own panel and the diocesan office in each area is custodian of the panel.  The Department's role is <Col N="1580" /> to administer the scheme as agreed between the two parties.</P>
    <P>The regulations provide for a system whereby permanent assistant teachers in national schools whose posts are being suppressed due to insufficient enrolments may be redeployed to posts in other schools.</P>
    <P>I am aware of certain problems in the operation of the panel in the Cork area.  I would like to reassure the Deputy that senior officials of my Department are monitoring the situation on a daily basis in consultation with the Cork diocesan office and the INTO with a view to finding a resolution to the problems.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he will give details of the deposits and the registration fees which students of third level colleges are required to pay; and the changes in the level of these charges for the year 1997-8 compared to 1996-7.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15269/97]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, a standardised charge of £150 was levied by the third level colleges in the 1995-6 academic year for examination, registration and student services. This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years and set for review this year.</P>
      <P>The universities have argued that the true cost of these charges would on average amount to £400 in the 1997-8 academic year and that, increasingly, the services have required subvention from other areas of their income.  The need for improved student services has also been highlighted by both the universities and the technological sector.  In the light of these arguments and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250.  I would point out that students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a <Col N="1583" /> framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.</P>
    <P>I expect that this framework will be available by the end of November and in anticipation of the publication of the framework, I have requested all institutions to consult with students' unions on the application of funding for improved student services.  I have increased the level of student representation on this working group.</P>
    <P>In addition to this basic charge towards the cost of registration, exams and student services, a number of third level institutions have additional levies, of between £10 and £50 in respect of the development of students centres and sports centres.  These levies have been introduced following referenda of students in the individual colleges. Some institutions may also charge deposits/fees from students for the use of equipment and/or materials on particular courses. These deposits-fees are a matter for the individual third level institutions and my Department does not have details of the individual deposits/fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 129 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the skills group established by Forfás and chaired by Dr. Frances Ruane identified skills needs in the areas of software engineering, engineering technicians and teleservices up to the end of the century.  In relation to softeware engineering, an annual additional output of some 1,000 computing graduates was identified.  In the area of engineering technicians, the skills group recommended the provision of an additional 750 technician places each year and in the area of languages for the teleservices sector, an additional 1,000 places.</P>
      <P>In response to these identified shortages, a steering committee, chaired by the chairman of the Higher Eduation Authority, identified the most cost effective way of providing 1,000 additional software graduates and 750 technicians per annum.  On receipt of the steering committee's report, the Government approved an additional £5 million for capital development in the 1997-8 academic year to fund an expansion in places available on high-technology courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the teleservices area, I have introduced a national initiative to provide training to meet the <Col N="1586" /> skill needs of the international teleservices industry. As part of the response to this need, 690 training places have been allocated in 20 PLC colleges throughout the country which will offer full-time two year post leaving certificate courses in international teleservices.  A key element of the PLC courses in international teleservices will be an extensive overseas placement, of up to six months, to give on-the-job training and continued immersion in the chosen foreign language and culture.  This is a new departure for the PLC sector, and a new student support scheme is being introduced towards the cost of the overseas placement.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present compiling the statistical information sought by the Deputy in relation to student numbers on the specific programmes. As soon as it is available, I will arrange to have it conveyed to the Deputy.</P>
