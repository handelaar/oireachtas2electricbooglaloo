    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I met the Prime Minister of Russia, Mr. Viktor Chernomyrdin, in Shannon on Wednesday, 5 February last.  The meeting was a most useful one. We discussed bilateral trade and economic matters including the issue of imports of Irish beef to Russia, relations between the European Union and Russia and the general security architecture in Europe.</P>
      <P>Arising from our discussions, the Prime Minister and I have agreed to pay official visits in 1997 to Russia and Ireland respectively.  It is intended that both these visits will involve a trade delegation with the objective of increasing the turnover of trade and investment between both countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a very constructive exchange of views on the issue of Russian imports of Irish beef.  I acknowledged that the Russian authorities had a genuine responsibility to ensure that the concerns of their consumers were adequately met.  I set out the Irish concerns in regard to the selective ban which had been imposed by the Russian authorities on imports of beef from certain counties in Ireland.  I underlined to the Prime Minister that the Irish control measures in relation to BSE were of the highest standard and stressed that the overall level of BSE here remains extremely low. Finally, I invited the Prime Minister to send his Minister for Agriculture and appropriate technical <Col N="1022" /> officials to visit Ireland to inspect our control arrangements and satisfy themselves as to the total adequacy of these and all other relevant arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to say that in response the Prime Minister adopted a very constructive attitude to solving the problems on this issue.  In particular he indicated support for continued importing by Russia of substantial quantities of Irish beef.  He agreed to accept my invitation to his Minister for Agriculture to visit Ireland to inspect the situation. Arrangements are being put in train to bring this about as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach see any immediate prospect of reversing what has effectively been a partition of the country from the point of view of beef exports?  Was he able to give any assurances to the Russians that the issue of BSE is not as serious as they thought and that the incidence of BSE is quite low in our herd?  What was the response of the Russian Prime Minister to that, and what guarantees was the Taoiseach able to get from him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was able to point out to the Russian Prime Minister that the most recent monthly figures show quite a significant decline in January as against December.  On the other hand, the second half of 1996 showed a larger incidence than the first half of 1996, so there is a very recent downward trend which follows upon a slightly less recent upward trend.  The control measures that the Government has instituted are exceptionally strong, and that has been acknowledged by the Russian veterinary authorities.  The Russian Prime Minister, in his meetings with me, was exceptionally positive about continued imports of Irish beef.  He made it clear that he wanted to see Irish beef exported to Russia on a continuing basis.  He saw this trade as mutually beneficial to Ireland and to Russia.  He explained, however, and I completely understand, that he must ensure that his consumer protection authorities are able to take the steps necessary in their scientific judgment to ensure that their consumers have the sense of assurance that they need to have.  I believe that is the case.  I am, therefore, reasonably confident that if we can see a continuance of the recent downward trend in BSE incidence there will be a gradual and ultimately complete lifting of the ban on individual counties. There is a provision in the agreement for a specific review in April of this year.  I am glad that at my invitation the Russian Minister for Agriculture will come to Ireland to see these controls for himself.  It is a good sign of the Russian Prime Minister's commitment to the beef trade with Ireland that, without notice, he quickly agreed to send his Minister for Agriculture here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the decision will be reviewed in April, does the Taoiseach intend to make his official visit before then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1023" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the official visit will not be before that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the significance of the Russian market which takes 25 per cent of our beef exports, would the Taoiseach agree it would be more sensible to make the visit before April than subsequent to the review date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been extremely effective, as has the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, in getting the necessary political commitment publicly expressed by the highest political official, apart from the President of Russia, to the continuation of the beef trade between Ireland and Russia.  Notwithstanding the county ban, the level of beef exports to Russia in terms of total volume is undiminished. That is an important consideration which needs to be taken into account in any discussion on this matter.</P>
      <P>After my meeting with the Russian Prime Minister, I made the point publicly that we must respect the right of Russian authorities to take whatever steps they believe necessary in their independent scientific judgment to protect their consumers.  It would be wrong to expect the Russian authorities to behave differently from the way we would expect Irish political authorities to behave in a similar situation, namely to take due account of the technical advice from their scientific personnel.  While it is important to maintain the good strong political contacts we have at all levels of the Russian administration, in the course of those contacts, we must show that we respect the integrity, scientific competence and responsibility for consumer protection of the Russia authorities which we would expect of them if they were exporting a food product to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it fair to conclude that following the Taoiseach's discussions with the Russian authorities, the visit of the Russian Minister for Agriculture, presumably prior to the April review, and the incidents of BSE in the past six or nine months there will be no danger of further counties being included in the ban?  Perhaps the ban will be lifted from some of the other counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends on the monthly statistics of BSE incidents.  It is important to recognise that the problem is the level of incidents of BSE.  Counties have been the subject of bans because of higher than average incidents of BSE.  The problem we intend to overcome is BSE which we will eradicate as speedily as possible by reducing incidents of it.  I have no doubt from the contacts and discussions I had with the Russian Prime Minister that the political goodwill exists to remove the ban on all counties, but it is up to us to reduce incidents of BSE with the measures we are taking and allow the Russian consumer protection authorities to make a valid independent scientific judgment in this matter.  Having not only met the Russian Prime Minister but on <Col N="1024" /> an earlier occasion the senior Russian veterinary official, Dr. Avilov, I have the greatest admiration for the integrity and scientific competence of the authorities in Russia in this matter.  They are approaching it responsibly and are making difficult decisions with integrity, which we must respect in everything we say and do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree it would help confidence in the Russian state service and among Irish consumers, if feedstuffs being fed to cattle in Ireland were found to be free of bone and meat derivatives.  Will the Taoiseach agree that it was alarming to discover over the weekend that despite meat and bonemeal derivatives being banned in Ireland for a number of years a high percentage of feedstuffs for cattle still contain meat and bonemeal in breach of the law?  Will he take immediate steps to ensure the law is complied with?  Many people were deeply shocked by what was revealed over the weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware because his party was in Government at the time, the use of meat and bonemeal in cattle feed was banned in 1990.  My information is that in the early years the ban was not rigorously enforced&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there were substantial illegal imports of meat and bonemeal during that period.  I am glad the ban is now being rigorously enforced.  We would not have this problem of incidents of BSE if the ban imposed in 1990 by the then Government was adequately enforced by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a couple of points about these discussions which, as the Taoiseach said, covered areas other than beef.  Was what the Taoiseach delicately described as &ldquo;the security architecture of Europe&rdquo; discussed?  The Taoiseach recognised the Russians responsibility to protect their people.  Will he say if the Russian Prime Minister's concerns about the expansion of NATO to the Russian boundaries was raised? Did he ask for or was he given the support of the Government for broader security architecture in the context of the OSCE which the Russians are promoting and which is in the interest of nonmilitary and neutral countries such as Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to both questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach raise the concerns about the expansion of NATO?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing that when one puts a simple question, one gets a major policy decision.  Did the Taoiseach take the opportunity to raise with the Russian Prime Minister the concerns <Col N="1025" /> felt in this country about Chernobyl type incidents which could arise because of the unsafe nature of many of Russia's power stations and the rundown state of nuclear submarines, etc. which are a danger not only to the rest of Europe, but to this country?  Given that this nation is so conscious of nuclear pollution, did the Taoiseach raise that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a comparatively brief meeting and that subject was not raised.  I understand the Deputy's concern about the issue but we concerned ourselves with beef, east west relations in terms of security, the enlargement of the European Union and with trade and investment in both directions.  Those four topics occupied the full hour and a half of our discussions.  I did not have discussions on the topic raised by the Deputy.  However, I would be happy to avail of any further opportunities which arise to raise concerns about that matter.  As the Deputy will understand, the Russians are concerned about the health of citizens who live close to nuclear installations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>To revert to the question of animal feedstuffs, the Taoiseach seemed to suggest the situation was worse in the past.  Is it the case that the Government was carrying out surveys of this kind for a number of years and not publishing them or was the Taoiseach making a rough guestimate?  Has the breach of this law, for a number of years now, been known to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and suppressed or was the survey which was published the first of its kind?</P>

      <P>Let us avoid repetition, it is a luxury we cannot afford at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The best scientific opinion and explanation for the recent increase in the incidence of BSE in Ireland is that meat and bonemeal from bovines, even though it ought not have been, continued to be fed to bovines during the period after the ban was imposed in 1990.  That is the best available opinion as to the otherwise difficult to explain increase in the incidence of BSE in the second six months of 1996.  The incubation period for BSE is lengthy and, therefore, events in terms of feeding that might have occurred some years ago do not manifest themselves, in terms of incidents of BSE, until some years later.  Generally speaking BSE is to be found in comparatively elderly animals who have <Col N="1026" /> lived and who have been on this earth since the Deputy's party was in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to be helpful.  As I was making some remarks at Deputy McDowell's expense, I should also deal with his question.  I cannot answer the question about the surveys but I will get the information for the Deputy and I will refer the matter to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the trade, investment and commercial discussions the Taoiseach has had with the Russian authorities did he mention the ongoing discussions about Shannon being a hub for passengers both from Russia and the former Soviet Union?  Have the agreements about pick up rights between Ireland and Russia, about which there were difficulties some years ago, been resolved?  Has any further new commercial development taken place since 1995?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we discussed that matter at some length.  The Russian Prime Minister was extremely familiar with the important role Shannon has played as a hub for Aeroflot and other Russian airlines.  He recognised the fact that some of the planes are now of such capacity that, on the shorter haul journeys across the Atlantic, they do not require the refuelling facilities they required in the past.  He said it is important that a new business be found to deal with this matter by Russian planes flying longer distances after they have touched down in Shannon, where such arrangements would be necessary.  He indicated not only a great familiarity with this issue but also a strong commitment to continue to develop in a proactive way Russian aeronautical investment and business in Shannon.  That the meeting took place in Shannon is an indication of the importance of Shannon as an international hub.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated to Deputy Burke that in these discussions he had not raised the issue of Chernobyl.  Did he raise with Mr. Chernomyrdin the concern of EU leaders at the way in which the democracy in Belarus is lessening as a result of recent elections? <Col N="1027" /> Following recent elections in Belarus there is now a dictator in power who wants greater integration with Russia.  In effect he wants to go back to the USSR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the opportunity of raising my concerns about the situation in Belarus directly with the President of Belarus when I met him in Lisbon before Christmas.  The Deputy is right in saying the situation in that country is serious in terms of democratic rights, particularly the rights of the opposition.  That does not help in dealing with other issues.  There are also serious economic problems in Belarus which are not unconnected with the political difficulties.</P>
      <P>Russia is a country that is pursuing the democratic path with great courage.  They are persisting on the democratic road despite very substantial reductions in average income per head, which in many other countries might lead to a reversion to desperate or autocratic approaches.  Despite that, the Russian authorities, including Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, President Yelstin and many others, opposition and Government in the Duma, continue to pursue the democratic road.  We should not in any way attempt to conflate the situation in Belarus with the situation in Russia which is quite different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the security policy of the EU and its important relationship with Russia, did the Taoiseach state the Government's position on this matter and, if so, what was that position?  Clearly the Russians have an interest in the developing security position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The main concern which the Russians have is with the enlargement of NATO, not with the European Union's approach.  The Russians have no problem with the expansion of membership of the European Union, including the expansion of the common foreign and security policy of the European Union to include new members, including its commitment to the eventual framing of a common defence policy which is contained in the Maastricht Treaty.  The Russians have no problem with that.  Their problem is with the expansion of NATO.  I said to the Prime Minister that the view of our Government is that no improvement in the security of one member state, or groups of member states in Europe, should be made by means of reducing the sense of security or self-esteem within the overall common European home of another member state.  The Russians see proposals to expand NATO membership, but not to include them, as potentially enhancing the security of some at their expense.  The way to overcome that problem is to develop a comprehensive European security architecture through the OSCE, or through other instruments such as the United Nations or consultative agreements of various kinds which ensure that all feel their security is being enhanced by any arrangements <Col N="1028" /> that are being made and that no country sees its security being disadvantaged by arrangements designed to advantage other countries.  That was the general approach I put to him but obviously it is for others to make the decisions, namely the people who are involved in decisions about NATO membership, which we are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I still have not got the affection for the common defence which the Taoiseach has. Neither does the Minister for Social Welfare.  Was the question of Aer Rianta, other than at Shannon, raised?  Did the Taoiseach mention the importance of duty free sales to Aer Rianta within Russia and the importance of our duty free markets there?  Will the Taoiseach express his view on the attack on duty free sales generally in the European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a wide issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not wish to be drawn to a separate question by the Deputy because that would get me into trouble with the Chair and I would not want that to happen.  The issue of duty free sales and the very successful operation which Aer Rianta has in various parts of Russia along its borders and at its airports in regard to duty free sales was touched upon in some of the contacts that took place in the context of my meeting. There are concerns about a particular border post between Russia and Finland where Aer Rianta has had some difficulties, but generally we are pleased with the work being done and the very successful business won by Aer Rianta in Russia in this area.</P>

While I have no immediate plans for further such meetings, the Government is engaged in intensive contacts on a daily basis under the auspices of the multi-party talks in Belfast.  These talks continue to be the primary axis for interaction between the Government and the Northern Ireland parties.  I should add, however, that the Government maintains extensive informal contacts outside the talks process with representatives of both communities.  I plan to visit Northern Ireland in the near future but, for security reasons, I am not in a position to give any details.</P>
    <P>In addition to formal and informal contacts with political representatives, the Government endeavours to keep in touch with the broadest possible spectrum of opinion in Northern Ireland. For example, I had a very useful and wide-ranging meeting yesterday with the four main Church leaders.  Contacts of that kind are most important because all leaders &mdash; whether political, church or community &mdash; and individuals have key roles and responsibilities in the process of reconciliation.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the IRA's statement at the weekend makes it perfectly clear that it intends to continue using violence to achieve its political ends?  Will he further agree that it is the pursuit of that terror campaign which continues to exclude Sinn Féin from the talks process and will continue to exclude it for as long as the IRA is determined to use violence to achieve its political ends?</P>

      <P>To answer the first part of the Deputy's question, the IRA's statement is profoundly depressing and shows a lack of political imagination on the part of the republican movement. It is very important for the republican movement to recognise that an opportunity for it to engage in the talks it had sought for years had been created and existed on 10 June and that a ceasefire before that date would have allowed it to take part for the first time in face to face discussions with all of the other parties, something it had sought for many years but from which, by persisting with its decision which had been taken earlier last year to resume violence, it excluded itself.  To answer the second part of the question, that continues to be the case.  The Mitchell principles are very clear in regard to that matter, as is the position of both Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that talking is a good thing and I want the talks to continue because it is better for people to engage in dialogue than not talk to each other.  However, has the Government any plans in advance of general elections here and in Britain to inject life into the talks process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The talks in Belfast represent the most comprehensive talks process in terms of their participation which has occurred on this island for the past 75 years.  Representatives of all <Col N="1030" /> the principal Unionist parties, the SDLP and the two Governments are sitting around the same table for the first time in a long time.  Regrettably Sinn Féin is not present because the IRA is continuing with its campaign of violence.  However, it is important to recognise the comprehensive and historic nature of these talks.  It is also important to recognise that we have put the talks in the hands of an independent chairman, Senator Mitchell, who is ably assisted by General De Chastelain and Mr. Harri Holkeri who are working to ensure that all parties are heard.  As the Deputy indicated in her supplementary question, it is very important that we continue to give positive support to the talks process.</P>
      <P>I understand fully the concern that the principal difficulty, that is the decommissioning of arms and when it should take place, has not yet been resolved.  However, both Governments, the independent chairman and the parties, to varying degrees, are continuing to work intensively even as we speak to overcome these difficulties.  On another occasion I said I believed we must use every opportunity which exists in a constructive way.  This is the reason I sought, for example, to use the Christmas recess as a constructive gap to help us overcome some of the difficulties which existed.  Unfortunately, that endeavour was not successful on that occasion.  I will look at any gap which may occur in the discussions in the future as an opportunity, not as a problem.  In preparing for any such gap I will seek, in conjunction with the British Government, the other participants and the chairman to use it in a constructive way to create conditions which will enable the talks to resume with an even better prospect of forward movement than may currently be visible.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the continuation of the IRA's deplorable operations which endanger life and peace makes a mockery of the alleged commitments to peace? Will he also agree that sometimes when matters are at their worst in Northern Ireland opportunities can be created to move matters forward? Is he confident that Senator Mitchell will maintain and sustain the necessary effort in the task in which he is involved or will he, as is unfortunately being increasingly stated, stay only until the break-up of the talks?  Is the Taoiseach saying that the effort he is putting in now is an endeavour to reach a conclusion prior to the British general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mitchell's role has been exceptionally positive despite the many discouragements he has faced.  It is fair to say that he regards his involvement in the talks as a labour of love, something he does out of a sense of commitment to all the participants and an anxiety to serve all of them in a fair minded way.  Regardless of their initial dispositions, I think the participants have come to respect him greatly in his role. <Col N="1031" /> He is making intensive efforts to create positive conditions for forward movement in the talks.</P>
      <P>As I have stated repeatedly in the House, it is not particularly realistic to assume that a problem which was not solved during 200 years of Irish history and which led to 25 years of the most appalling violence might be overcome and set aside in an eight-month period of discussions.  It is important that the parties continue to talk and that there is a determination to move forward. The differences which exist are very real and substantial and the fears which underlie them are even more real and substantial and become, as I think the Deputy acknowledged, even more accentuated by every incident of violence, which in itself makes the issue of arms a more difficult one to resolve.  Every incident of violence raises the profile of the arms issue and makes any agreement about arms more difficult to reach. Those who wish to see the talks move forward must do everything they can to ensure that violence is not used.  The more violence there is the more difficult it is to overcome the most difficult question in the talks, that is the issue of arms.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Taoiseach regarding the multi-party talks.  Has he discussed with the leaders of the Northern Ireland parties the futility of the current structure of the talks process?  Will the Taoiseach discuss with the British Prime Minister the possibility of giving Senator George Mitchell more power so that he will not have to listen for hours to aimless speeches aimed at filibustering?  While the talks may be a labour of love to Senator Mitchell, as they are currently structured they are a form of embarrassment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should reflect on the reverse of what he is saying if it were to happen. Talks which involve dealing with people with whom one has a profound disagreement are obviously more difficult and time consuming than those with somebody with whom one is already in large agreement.  The talks currently taking place in Belfast are between people who profoundly disagree with one another on the fundamental question of allegiance; they disagree on the State to which they belong.  It is an ambitious and difficult task for anybody to attempt to bridge that gap but I do not see any substitute for listening and talking, even listening to people who talk at length.  The idea that one can somehow concertina all this discussion and have some form of solution imposed from the Chair or elsewhere is naive in the context of Northern Ireland.  We are talking against a background of 200 to 300 years of division.  There comes a time, however, when initiatives are necessary to move matters forward but they must be taken against a background of the participants recognising that they are necessary.  Any suggestion that an initiative is being taken in defiance of the wishes of some or a large number of the participants would doom <Col N="1032" /> it to failure.  A considerable degree of patience, therefore, is necessary.  This is a democratic process and democratic processes in divided societies by their nature are slow, difficult and testing of patience.</P>

      <P>I specifically raised the matter, referred to on a number of occasions by Deputy McDowell, of people parading to churches and the influence those holding services in those churches have on the manner people process to and from divine service.  It is important that those who preach in churches exercise their responsibility to ensure that not only is the proceeding within the church informed by Christian charity but that the proceeding to and from the church is also informed by Christian charity.  I made that point quite strongly.  The same consideration applies where people choose to parade past churches of a different denomination.  The idea that people should use parades in a way that demonstrates domination, particularly if they do so claiming inspiration from Christian principles, is wrong.  I made that point in the House and when I had the occasion to do so in meeting the Church leaders yesterday.</P>

The facility will be further expanded this year with the delivery of approximately 270 additional radio units, with associated equipment, bringing total investment in this area to more than £9 million.

      <Quest>the reason for Ireland's fishery compromise proposal during his recent term as President of the Council of EU Ministers; if he will give details of the compromise proposals; the way in which it will affect the Irish fishing industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to advise the House on the background to the Irish Presidency's compromise proposals on fishing fleet capacity and the rationale behind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Presidency tangible success was achieved on Ireland's main priorities, notably progressing realistic conservation measures, agreement on the introduction of satellite monitoring and improved co-operation on fisheries control.  The dominant issue in fisheries during the Presidency was the Commission's proposal for up to 40 per cent cuts in the European fishing fleet.  These proposals were unveiled by the Commission in the weeks before we took over the Presidency.  The drastic &ldquo;blunt instrument&rdquo; approach of the proposals made them highly controversial from the start and they were objected to strongly by virtually all member states.  Moreover, <Col N="1038" /> in so far as the Commission's proposals would apply to Ireland's specific situation, they were totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The reductions in fishing effort needed to be focused on the stocks most at risk and on the fleets overfishing those stocks.  Getting the balance right between fleets and available stocks involves a wide range of factors including conservation and better enforcement.  The serious socio-economic and social consequences of drastic fleet cuts over a short period also had to be addressed. It was therefore clear from the outset that the Commission's proposals did not offer a way forward and that a total impasse existed.  My objective in taking a fresh look at the problem was to break this impasse which was not in the interests of the EU and certainly not in the interests of the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Based on the outcome of discussions at the October Council, my political bilaterals with fisheries Ministers in November and intensive analysis of the complex technical issues involved, we constructed a comprehensive and radical alternative proposal aimed at delivering a rational, targeted and fair solution to the overfishing and overcapacity problem in European waters.</P>
    <P>The key features of the Irish Presidency compromise are: reduction rates to be targeted on the critical stocks in specific fishing areas and calculated by reference to the extent to which these stocks are in trouble using the most up to date scientific assessments; an exemption for small-scale coastal fishing fleets; a choice for member states of reduction method, either fishing effort management which is known as &ldquo;days at sea&rdquo;, capacity reductions or a combination of both; a weighted approach to calculating reductions for national fleets which means that the extent to which a fleet actually fishes the stock in trouble would be factored in; reduction targets to be set for three years followed by a mid-term review of all measures in place to protect fish stocks as well as a further scientific assessment of the state of stocks; improvements to vessels for safety purposes to be exempted when calculating capacity; no discrimination between trawlers and boats using fixed fishing gears; the decision-making process on member states' programmes to be fully transparent and verifiable; the principle of relative stability and the national entitlement to take up quotas to be observed.</P>
    <P>The Irish proposals were welcomed by all member states as a basis for going forward and I also won a firm commitment at the December Council to an agreement by April next.  By ensuring that negotiations proceed on the basis of the Irish compromise and that there would be no indefinite postponing of a decision, we got the best possible outcome from all perspectives.  A firm deadline for a decision safeguards the future availability of EU funding for the fleet.  The Commission has made it clear that, without a decision, Structural Funds are under threat.  A decision in April will protect that funding.  Intensive negotiations <Col N="1039" /> are now under way to finalise the decision as there are complex technical matters to be sorted out.  We have created the basis for a solution and in doing so we have shaped and influenced the outcome in the best interests of the Irish fishing fleet and, overall, in the interests of the European fisheries resource.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the Minister's clarification because fishermen, especially in my part of the country, said they were being kept in the dark on the proposals discussed and negotiated by the Minister which have never been fully explained to them or to the fishing organisations.</P>
      <P>How does the Minister propose to control, or what proposals were put in place to control, the high capacity boats of the Netherlands and the UK which disregarded regulations and targets in past programmes?  The Dutch were some 70 per cent over target in the last programme.  What definite proposals are in place for levelling the playing pitch in this area?</P>
      <P>What plans or proposals were included in negotiations to secure funding to allow Irish fishermen to upgrade the quality of their boats to allow them to compete fairly with the fleets in other EU countries?  As the Minister will be aware, we have an old fleet and fishermen are not in a position financially to do anything about it.  Has the Minister any definite proposals or funding in the package he has announced today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The fishermen's organisations were kept fully informed.  I accept the Deputy's claim that there was a breakdown in communication but we endeavoured to explain the situation to the various organisations.</P>
      <P>As regards the level playing pitch, it is envisaged in our proposal that the starting point would be where one is supposed to be at the end of MAGP 3, which means the cuts which existed under that must be included.  There can be no wiping out and starting anew because that would be grossly unfair to those countries, including us, which have had to make great sacrifices in reducing tonnage.  I assure the Deputy that there is much anxiety not alone on the part of Ireland but on the part of other members states that those who have not met their targets should do so and start from the point where they ought to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards renewal of the fleet, if the Commission's proposal for a 40 per cent reduction had gone ahead, there would be no possibility of Ireland doing anything to improve its fleet.  That was another reason we were extremely concerned.  I accept that investment in a fishing fleet is necessary on an ongoing basis.  As the Deputy will be well aware, the level of funding allocated to the Operational Programme for Fisheries was insufficient to meet all demands.  For that reason, I have, in the course of the mid-term review, argued my point in seeking additional funding under that programme.  If that becomes available, I would be only too pleased to <Col N="1040" /> see moneys being allocated towards upgrading our fleet.  However, we should not ignore the progress made under the modernisation grants by my constituency colleague, Deputy Andrews, my predecessor and myself.  There has been considerable improvement by the modernisation programmes carried out on fishing vessels as a result of existing funding.</P>
    <P>Having met the organisations, we are considering a pilot scheme to observe the effects of new boats in the white fish fleet and a firm of consultants is examining the socio-economic effect of replacing existing vessels with new ones.  If large sums of money are invested in new vessels, there must be catches and quotas to justify repayments on boats and to make the overall venture viable. There is a danger that many others dependent for a living on fishing, perhaps on a part-time basis, will be displaced.  All these factors must be taken into account.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the matters raised by the president of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers at their special delegate conference in Newbridge, County Kildare on 30 January 1997.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3597/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The president of RACO covered a large number of issues in his address to the special delegate conference and, accordingly, I have arranged for a copy of my address in reply to that conference to be furnished to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the conciliation and arbitration scheme and the representative process is working well.  I have given an undertaking to the association that, should I find this is not the case, I will have the matter investigated and put to rights.  I have also told the association there is a positive commitment on the part of the Department to reaching agreement on a long-term promotion system for officers of the PDF.  Constructive discussions on this issue continue.</P>
      <P>With regard to the special reviews of the Air Corps and Naval Service, while I am as disappointed as anyone else that the studies are not yet complete, I understand the reason for the delay is that the consultants have found it necessary to devote more time to some issues which have arisen than was originally intended.  I have assured the association there will be consultation with them on the content and implications of these reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply.  He dealt with areas in which there is broad agreement and support for the action he has taken.  The president of RACO, when addressing the special delegate conference in Newbridge, was extremely critical of the Minister and the Government because the restructuring process has become nothing short of a cost cutting exercise.  The sacrifices in the restructuring <Col N="1041" /> process have all been borne by members of the Defence Forces.  As a result, a smaller number of people are carrying out more tasks, while no long-term strategy has been outlined by the Government.  Members of the Defence Forces do not have the hope they had before, and there is less desire to forge a career in the Defence Forces in families whose members previously had such a desire.  The Minister should examine that problem and try to address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's allegation that the president of RACO criticised me.  He did not.  He expressed concern about the level of consultation between him or his organisation and the military authorities but he accepted that I have met RACO on nine occasions in the past twelve months.  I have had ongoing consultations with both RACO and PDFORRA.</P>
      <P>I also reject the suggestion that this process is a cost cutting exercise.  It is the first time since the foundation of the State that anything has been done to restructure the Defence Forces.  It is not about reducing numbers.  Its objective is to make existing numbers more effective, efficient, younger and more capable of performing the tasks expected of them.</P>
      <P>Both the EAG's and the consultants' reports clearly established the Defence Forces had an age profile problem, with a huge number of personnel in medical category C who were unable to perform normal duties.  Our job is to run the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps and they have specific tasks to perform.  We have, in a humane way, offered those forces voluntary early retirement at considerable expense to the taxpayer. After this year, the Government will have spent up to £45 million on the voluntary early retirement scheme.  In addition, we have taken in 400 recruits in two months and we hope to take in another 200 within the next three months as part of the programme of older personnel leaving and young people joining.</P>
      <P>The Army has a job to do and I do not want trained soldiers carrying out functions that can be carried out by civilians.  I want trained soldiers to do the job for which they joined the Force and for which they are trained.  Frustration arises when trained soldiers are asked to do menial tasks which can be done by others without the soldier's skills being wasted.  When one endeavours to carry out major reform in any organisation the initial stages will be upsetting.  That is only natural. People have been doing things in the same way for the past 50 or 60 years.  It will take up to ten years for major changes to be established and to achieve the required result.  We knew that from the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject the suggestion that there is a morale problem in the Defence Forces.  In the past two weeks I visited six barracks on the Border.  I did not find low morale in the course of those visits, I found concerns.  In many cases I could allay those <Col N="1042" /> concerns and, in some cases, I undertook to examine them.  I will continue to do that.</P>
    <P>Please do not suggest this scheme is a cost cutting exercise.  We have given a commitment that at least 50 per cent of the savings that will arise at the end of the voluntary early retirement scheme will be invested in new equipment.  I hope we can secure an agreement from the Department of Finance that, when it has recovered the moneys spent on the scheme on behalf of the taxpayer, we will receive 100 per cent of the savings. However, there will be no savings in the Defence Forces following implementation of the plan until 1999.  This year we will spend £30 million on the VER.  Last year, £13 million was spent on it while next year at least £30 million will be spent.  We are not talking about savings yet.  However, savings will begin to come on stream in 1999.  The Defence Forces want us to give a guarantee that those savings will be invested in equipment, refurbishment and so forth.  That commitment has been given and will be given in the future.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy wants me to deal with every item raised by the president of RACO, I will be here until 5 p.m.  However, I will forward my reply to the Deputy so he can see my response to the various points made by the president.  If the Deputy is not satisfied, I will be pleased to return to the House next month and answer any questions he might have about that reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>To listen to the Minister, one would think everything in the Defence Forces was rosy.  With regard to the Minister's meetings with the representative organisations, I agree the system is working well but that is not thanks to the Minister.  He was most reluctant to get involved and it was only when one of the organisations criticised him that he took notice and realised the organisations had a function in this process.</P>
      <P>The voluntary early retirement scheme will begin to yield savings in 1999.  However, the Minister only recently gave a commitment to have 50 per cent of the savings reinvested in infrastructure, new equipment and buildings.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the security forces, including the Army which plays an enormously important role in this regard, are the guarantee for democracy, will the Minister agree it is essential that morale in the Defence Forces be maintained at the highest possible level?  I raise this point because I am alarmed at the Minister's response to an earlier question from my colleague in which he said that from his visits around the country he has no reason to conclude that morale in the Army is low.  If he is of that opinion he is out of touch and is listening to the wrong people, or maybe he is being told what he wants to hear.</P>

The Minister has the full support of all Members in whatever steps he takes to ensure that morale is restored to the highest level in the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána, the two arms of security.  He should ensure that his colleagues in Government give him full backing in that regard.  There is an erosion of morale, which is critical to the well-being of our democratic system.  I accept the Defence Forces are undergoing a major review and the doubts and fears that arise may be exaggerated in some cases, but morale is low.</P>

Sometimes when I get up in the morning I feel very low while other times I feel good.  The recruitment of young, active people to the Defence Forces is a boost to morale.  If successive Governments, including my own, had paid more attention rather than allowing a position to arise where all one had to do was read the Price Waterhouse report to learn of the level of morale, they would understand the need for the changes now proposed.  In the course of those changes the levels of morale will vary, but I do not accept that overall on a daily basis in every barracks morale is at a very low level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 49, 53, 56, 60 and 300 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I established the salmon management task <Col N="1047" /> force in October 1995 because of concern about the serious decline in salmon stocks.  The mandate of the task force was to develop practical proposals for the management of wild salmon stocks, with full regard for those with legitimate rights in salmon exploitation.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force confirmed the need to rebalance the salmon catch between the various sectors and the need for a new approach to salmon management.  I received Government approval in September 1996 to take forward the implementation of the report's main recommendations, in consultation with all the various interests involved.  I also referred the report of the task force to the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy and I look forward to having an opportunity in the coming weeks to discuss the report at that committee.</P>
    <P>The new salmon management strategy recommended by the task force involves a package of conservation measures designed to secure and augment salmon stocks, a move to management on a local catchment basis and the introduction of a quota system to ensure a fair share of the resource among the various legitimate interests. The conservation regulations I have recently introduced with effect from this year's salmon fishing season completes the first phase of implementation of the new salmon management regime.  At home and abroad there has been general acceptance of the new measures introduced for 1997.  The measures contain gains as well as losses for the different sectors in the interest of optimising the resource.</P>
    <P>With regard to the expressed concerns about the impact of the new conservation measures on the draft-net fishery, I have already decided, following consultation with draft-net and snap-net fishermen, not to restrict these tidally dependent fisheries to daylight hours only.  The weekend close period has also been staggered between the drift and draft-net fisheries which will allow the draft-netsmen one clear day each week when there will be no drift-net activity.</P>
    <P>Overall the package of measures I have introduced so far is essential if salmon stock declines are to be halted through improved spawning and escarpment and if this valuable resource is to be protected in the future.  I have taken careful note of the specific concerns raised by Deputies on behalf of draft-netsmen and estuarial drift-nets-men in certain areas or particular estuaries.  These specific situations can best be dealt with by taking a local catchment management approach.</P>
    <P>Catchment management plans, drawn up with the positive participation of all legitimate salmon interests in the area will, by definition, cater for the specific needs of each catchment area.  I have asked the regional fisheries boards to take the lead in facilitating discussions between local commercial fishermen and angling groups with a view to developing local catchment plans.  I will give <Col N="1048" /> positive and favourable consideration to all such proposals.</P>
    <P>The key elements of the second phase of the new salmon management strategy are progressing the proposals for a quota and tagging system and the introduction on a formal basis, of local catchment management strategies.  At my request, the marine institute is carrying out a thorough technical and scientific assessment of the TAC quota and tagging recommendations.  This study together with the preparation of the legislative changes which will be required will be completed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  In fairness to him he is doing everything possible to try to bring some order to this area where there have been problems for a while.  He is right in saying the difficulties vary in different regions.  I welcome the local management plan the Minister is trying to put into place.</P>
      <P>In the Blackwater area June and July are not good for fishing.  The fishermen there also want to fish earlier in the season as their livelihood is threatened.  Draft-netsmen have a problem in that normally they cannot go on the river when the drift-netsmen are there.  I appreciate the Minister is introducing one day when only draft-netsmen will fish.  In the Waterford estuary, April and May are not of great benefit for fishing.  There is normally a run of salmon in August.  These fishermen are being affected as well.  Can these provisions be implemented?  I know the Minister is putting the local management plan into place to try to do that.  However, the fear locally is that because there are so many angling interests on the Southern Regional Fisheries Board the interests of the fishermen and their livelihoods will not be protected by the board.  What can the Minister do to ensure fair play for everyone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenneally's question and his description of the problem in this area underlines the complexity of the issue and the advisability of introducing catchment management plans at local level which take account of the peculiarities which apply in particular areas and estuaries.</P>
      <P>I have asked the fisheries boards to facilitate the drawing up of catchment management plans. I appreciate that in drawing those up it is not always possible to get immediate agreement between the different interests.  I hope the professional skills available in the fisheries boards will be sufficient to enable those plans to be drawn up and to assist the parties to the plans to agree on them.  I understand from reports I have received that considerable progress is being made in the various boards in relation to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not general acceptance of the report which the Minister has recommended to the House.  However, it is appreciated he has <Col N="1049" /> taken measures which go some way towards meeting fishermen's grievances.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister include the month of August in his provisions for drift net fishermen, particularly on the South coast?  They depend on that month to make a living.  It is useless to them if the weather is bad in June.  The catching season has been reduced to alarmingly small proportions. It is not reasonable to expect people to make a living in the open sea in the type of weather conditions we have in June.  Will the Minister include the month of August and arrange to draw up the management plan as quickly as possible so that people in different areas using different types of nets such as snapnets, drift-nets and draft-nets can all be catered for?  One generalised system will not suffice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably more accurate to say that while there is general acceptance of the recommendations, there is not total acceptance. I understand that, given the variety of interests involved.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to extend the drift-net season into August.  The task force recommended that in the context of the introduction of a quota system, the season could be extended into August.  The arrangements for the introduction of a quota system are already being prepared by the marine institute and the Department.  However, in advance of the introduction of a quota system, it would not be possible to extend the season into August.  This is for good conservation reasons. The primary purpose of these regulations is to ensure that salmon stocks are conserved, they are allowed to escape to the rivers and that there is sufficiency of salmon available for the fishery, whether at sea, in estuaries or rivers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The drift-net fishermen in the Youghal area have complained that confining them to the June and July period will ensure they will be out of business lock, stock and barrel. They feel it is necessary that the season is moved back a month or so to allow them to make a decent living from fishing in the Youghal Bay area.  The Minister should re-examine this matter seriously because the June and July period is, in their opinion, not sufficient for them to make a decent living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be said that for anybody to make a living, or have any kind of income, from salmon fishing there must be salmon to fish for.  The problem which has been developing over a number of years, and it is particularly acute in the southern area, is that salmon stocks have been in decline.</P>

The measures which the Minister has taken will, hopefully, go some way towards redressing the continued decline which is affecting the income of drift and draftnet fishermen, as well as others.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> Will the Minister endorse the commitment given to me during the Estimates debate that the Slaney management plan will remain in place for a three year term as agreed by all the partners in salmon fishing? There now seems to be a question mark in that the Minister's officials are trying to change the ground rules.  Much time and effort was put into that plan.  The Minister should endorse the commitment he gave some weeks ago during the Estimates debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that catchment management plans will be in place.  In that context, it is my hope that the Slaney plan can be proceeded with but I might add that any catchment management plan requires the agreement of the parties to that plan.  I have asked the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board to consult with the parties to that plan and to clarify certain aspects in relation to it prior to making the regulations for 1997.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points made earlier by the Minister of State.  He is quite correct in saying that if salmon stocks are not conserved there will not be any salmon left to fish.  However, does the Minister agree that the small nets fishermen are using in the Blackwater estuary are not a danger to conserving stocks?  The problem lies elsewhere but they are being penalised for it.</P>
      <P>An agreement was worked out, independently of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board, in December 1995 between the various interests in the Waterford estuary.  It was sent to the Department of the Marine which has not accepted the report.  That is probably the basis for an agreement so perhaps the Minister could look at it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the quota system the Minister is talking about introducing, does he have any plans to introduce a buy-out where people are prepared <Col N="1052" /> to sell their licences and their rights to fish for salmon?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Deputy Browne's question, the whole purpose of the strategy currently being pursued is to allow more salmon back up river which will be of benefit to anglers. It will assist in the propagation of stocks.</P>
      <P>In relation to the quota system and the buy-out, the task force report supported the concept of buyouts, and I accepted that recommendation. It is something that can be progressed at a later stage.</P>
      <P>Finally, given Deputy Molloy's long history in Government, I find it strange that it is only now when the question of salmon management is actually being addressed that he has discovered the State's involvement in salmon fishery.</P>

    <P>In the period since the introduction of the 1980 Act we have witnessed the growth of the aquaculture industry to the point where it accounts for some 25 per cent of total fish production in Ireland and internationally.  Total production of farms in 1995 amounted to almost 27,000 tonnes with a value of some £50 million.  The total number of people engaged in all sectors of the aquaculture industry stood at 2,946 at the end of 1995.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture or fish farming implies human intervention in the rearing of fish.  This can involve, for example, the farming and feeding of fin fish in cages or the propagation of shellfish which filter feed naturally in the waters where the seed is placed.  The world-wide decline in stocks of wild fish, together with the buoyant consumer demand for fish, has meant that aquaculture products now account for an ever-increasing proportion of fish production.  Ireland is in an ideal position to benefit from this trend.  Experience has shown that careful, environmentally sound husbandry is the key to the production of quality aquaculture food.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the continued sustainable development of this valuable industry and to delivering on the potential for jobs and growth which it offers, particularly in coastal communities.  The planned development and expansion of the industry is a major element of the investment programme in place under the Fisheries Operational Programme 1994-1999.  The operational programme envisages doubling aquaculture output to £103 million by the end of 1999 and the creation of an additional 1,300 jobs over the period of the programme.  A total investment of £36 million is planned in new projects and in the modernisation of existing facilities.  To date, 58 investment projects in aquaculture have been approved under the programme involving a total investment of some £14.2 million.</P>
    <P>To facilitate the realisation of the targets for expansion and maximise the benefit of the Structural Funds investment, a sound legislative framework to solidly underpin aquaculture development is essential.  It has been agreed for some time by the industry and other interests that a thorough overhaul of the existing legislation is essential.  It is necessary to address not only deficiencies experienced with the licensing procedures and constraints imposed by court decisions, but also to take account of new thinking on planning and environmental issues, as well as the significant technical advances in aquaculture itself.  The existing legislative provisions do not command confidence.  The claimed failings and defects are both perceived and real.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture industry sees the present procedures as a disincentive to enterprise and as being cumbersome and slow in terms of finalising licensing decisions.  The industry needs and deserves a greater degree of certainty in the process <Col N="1061" /> of assessment and decision making and in terms of the timeframe for decisions.  Others perceive the present licensing process and procedures as failing to have sufficient regard to public rights and environmental concerns. Furthermore, all sides agree that appeals mechanisms against licensing decisions are inadequate, and applicants and objectors are poorly served by the present system.</P>
    <P>There is a large degree of consensus on the broad requirements of any new licensing system. The degree of common ground on what is needed is particularly significant given the differing, often opposing, perspectives on aquaculture development. Views on the specific issues to be addressed in new legislation converge in many respects.  Key industry concerns centre on: the need for a streamlined, impartial and speedy licensing framework; enhancement of notification-consultation procedures for licence applications; strengthened rights of appeal against negative licensing decisions; security of tenure; safeguarding of other interests; the need for more effective policing and regulation; a sound statutory basis for licences; new fee basis; and the need for explicit policy guidelines to inform decision making.</P>
    <P>Key third party concerns centred on the need for an impartial and transparent decision making process, improved public notification-consultation procedures, better access to information, improved appeal mechanisms, enhanced regulation, monitoring and control of industry, a clear-cut penalties regime to ensure full compliance with licence and other requirements, and explicit policy guidelines to inform decision making.</P>
    <P>Consequently, one of my primary concerns in the drafting of the Bill was to endeavour to strike the necessary balance between the essential development needs of the aquaculture industry and the acknowledged and real concerns of other parties.  Getting this balance right is essential to ensure that the development of aquaculture is planned and regulated in a sustainable way.  Thus, the objective of the Bill before the House is to establish a new licensing process which (i) facilitates the continued sustainable development of the aquaculture industry while meeting local and environmental concerns; (ii) gives those directly involved with aquaculture, and all other interested individuals and organisations, a reasonable opportunity to express their views on particular development proposals within a framework of clearly defined procedures and times-cales; and (iii) makes provision for the establishment of an Independent Appeals Board and process.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to lay to rest a number of emerging myths about this Bill which have been the subject of an advertising campaign last week in the provincial press.  It is unacceptable that misinformation and distortions of the Bill's provisions and objectives may regrettably have gained a degree of credence among <Col N="1062" /> some fishery and angling interests.  Specifically, I would like to offer the following assurances and clarification to the House that people's rights are enhanced and not diminished by this Bill.  The allegation that the Bill could put fish farms on every lake, river, estuary and bay in Ireland is a gross exaggeration and distortion of the facts.  As things stand, any person can lodge an application for a licence to engage in aquaculture at any place or on any waters.  That remains the case.  The consent of the owner, whether private or State, is required and in the case of salmonoid breeding installations, marine or freshwater, EU requirements for environmental impact assessments must be complied with.  For inland or land based developments, local authority planning requirements must be met.  Licence applications will also continue to be subject to full and rigorous assessment by the Department's technical services from all relevant perspectives.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not abolish all rights to fishing, navigation and recreation.  Public waters and the foreshore are a common resource with competing demands from a wide range of economic, ecological and recreational interests.  No one interest can dominate.  There must be a balanced usage in the public interest.  Rights of appeal are enhanced and not abolished as has been claimed.</P>
    <P>The Independent Appeals Board will not replace the courts.  As in planning law, any person wishing to contest a licensing decision will still have recourse to the courts by way of judicial review provided the court concludes that there are substantial grounds for doing so.  In any planning sphere, it is important to dissuade vexatious or frivolous appeals to the courts and it is reasonable to insist that appellants at least have grounds for their objections.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as is standard practice when introducing a new format of licensing permission which will be subject to strengthened regulatory requirements, provides that all existing and future licensed aquaculture operations will be brought within a comprehensive licensing and regulatory system.</P>
    <P>There are different types and methods of fish culture and, indeed, a range of fin fish and shellfish species are farmed.  Currently, licences are granted for ten year periods, and the aquaculture industry has represented its case that licences of longer duration are needed to underpin investment, secure finance and provide the necessary security of tenure.  The Bill provides for licence duration of 20 years and more, although I envisage that 20 years will be the norm.</P>
    <P>Public notice procedures will remain in place. Our objective is to have the fullest possible consultation prior to any licensing decision being taken.  Application regulations, as provided for by section 10 of the Bill, will facilitate the broadest possible consultation process, including consultation with other Departments, State bodies and agencies.  The Independent Appeals Board is not biased towards fish farmers.  The composition of the board is carefully balanced to ensure that <Col N="1063" /> aquaculture, environmental protection, wild fisheries, planning and development and industrial and community development interests are represented with no interest having a majority position.</P>
    <P>The appeals board will be totally independent but, as in planning law, ministerial power is reserved to issue general policy directives in relation to aquaculture to which the board must have regard.</P>
    <P>Objections to licensing proposals are not severely restricted.  It will be open to any person to lodge an objection to or make representations on any proposed aquaculture developments within a reasonable timeframe.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to exempt trial licences from appeals.  Such licences will be of strictly limited duration, temporary and non-renewable, to facilitate experimental aquaculture and research and development.  Long-term commercial aquaculture developments following completion of trials will be subject to the full licensing process.</P>
    <P>The State foreshore is not being privatised. Placement of seafarm cages or structures on the foreshore for aquaculture purposes will continue to be licensed under the Foreshore Act, 1933.  It has been long-standing practice for the State to grant licences or leases for areas of the foreshore for a range of economic or recreational activity.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill and the new framework for licensing and regulation proposed.  A fundamental requirement of the Bill is that one cannot undertake aquaculture without a licence.  Furthermore, section 11 will disqualify persons from applying for a licence for any area where they commenced aquaculture operations without a licence.</P>
    <P>Applications for licences to engage in aquaculture are to be made to the licensing authority, that is, the Minister for the Marine or a designated officer of the Minister in the event of the power being delegated.  A statutory time objective for determining licence applications within four months is provided for with the licensing authority empowered to extend this period in specified exceptional circumstances.  In such circumstances, reasons will have to be given to the applicant concerned and the date by which, or period within which, the application will be determined must be stated.  This provision setting a four month time objective for licensing decision takes account of concerns expressed by the industry that there should be a fixed time frame for dealing with applications.  It will be open to the Minister to delegate the function of deciding on licence applications and reviews of licences, or on particular categories of applications and reviews, to an officer of the Department.</P>
    <P>An independent Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board will be established to determine appeals against decisions of the licensing authority. A statutory time objective for determining appeals within four months will apply with similar provisions for extending this period in exceptional <Col N="1064" /> circumstances.  The board will consist of a chairperson and five ordinary members with knowledge or experience of aquaculture, environmental protection or wild fisheries, planning and development or industrial or community development who will be appointed by the Minister.  The chairperson's term of office will be five years and other members will hold office for a term not exceeding five years to be specified at the time of their appointment.</P>
    <P>There is a standard provision for disclosure of interests by the board or persons engaged by the board in circumstances where a particular beneficial or material interest exists.  The board may engage consultants and advisers for evaluating appeals.  The concerns expressed by the industry and the various interest groups on the need for accountability through an appropriate right of appeal have been recognised and taken on board. To a large extent, we have used the Bord Pleanála model for the structure and procedures of the aquaculture appeals board.</P>
    <P>The procedures relating to appeals and their consideration by the appeals board are derived from the streamlined planning appeals procedures established by the Planning Acts.  The main features include: a time limit of one month for lodging appeals by any aggrieved person; a requirement to state the full grounds of appeal when appealing; an entitlement for the other parties to an appeal, and anybody else who wishes to do so, to make written submissions on the appeal within a time limit of one month; a discretionary power for the appeals board to invite a further submission from any person concerned with an appeal, where it considers it appropriate to do so; a power for the appeals board to decide, in its absolute discretion, to hold an oral hearing of any appeal and power for the appeals board to dismiss frivolous, vexatious or abandoned appeals.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be empowered to issue general policy directives, and any designated officer exercising licensing functions and the appeals board will be required to have regard to such directives.  This is a standard provision in planning law on which this part of the Bill is modelled.</P>
    <P>The licensing authority may grant trial licences authorising experimental investigations for particular aquaculture developments.  Such licences would be subject to a maximum term and would not be renewable.  Because of the limited nature and duration of these licences, appeal provisions will not apply.  It is clear there is a need for more flexibility in licensing experimental operations. For example, trials to establish site suitability including suitability for fallowing purposes or the viability of farming novel species have to be facilitated if the industry is to grow and adapt to new developments and technology.  Diversification into new species and products is needed to avoid over-dependence on particular species or markets. The potential to develop into new areas needs to be encouraged and not hindered.  Trial licence provisions will assist the ongoing research and development effort into experimental techniques <Col N="1065" /> of cultivation for new and currently farmed fish species.</P>
    <P>This is not a new concept.  Granting temporary permissions for trials or pilot projects is a well established procedure under the existing Fisheries Acts.  The trial licence provision in this Bill will, however, impose a statutory time limit on future trial licences granted.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be empowered to prescribe by regulations, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, fees for licence applications, licences and appeals.  This provision will make it possible to lay down fees for applications, reviews or appeals as is the case under the planning Acts, in addition to fees for licences.</P>
    <P>Matters which must be taken into account, as relevant, in determining licence applications and appeals are delineated in the Bill.  These include the suitability of the area in question for the aquaculture development proposed, the likely economic effects, other beneficial uses of the water, the ecological implications for wild fisheries, natural habitats, flora and fauna.  The aim here is to introduce clear licensing criteria as sought by both the industry and other interest groups.</P>
    <P>Provisions to deal with unauthorised development and breaches of licence conditions are considerably strengthened.  This will protect existing or future licensees against developments which undermine confidence in the industry and the Department's ability to regulate properly.  It will also allay the concerns of other interests who can be confident that the aquaculture industry is properly regulated and placed on the same footing as other natural resource sectors.</P>
    <P>As a measure of the importance I attach to ensuring that fish farmers comply with the responsibilities placed on them by this Bill, stiff penalties, including fines of up to £100,000 and or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, are provided for offences committed.  In addition, provision is made in section 68 for the ultimate sanction of revocation of an aquaculture licence, without compensation for the licensee.  I have included strengthened provisions with regard to the recapture of fish in the event of escapements occurring at finfish farms.  This is a matter which I know concerns people involved in the wild fisheries sector.  Licences will be open to review once three years have passed.  Any decision following a review will be appealable in the same way as a decision on a licence application.</P>
    <P>As regards other miscellaneous provisions I have taken on board concerns expressed by the aquaculture industry about security of tenure and prevention of interference with licensed operations and incorporated specific provisions to address these concerns.  I have also made provision to underpin licences currently in place authorising aquaculture developments, the bulk of which were granted or renewed by my predecessors since the mid 1980s.</P>
    <P>In the course of preparation of this Bill, my Department has had extensive consultations with <Col N="1066" /> a range of interest groups and State bodies. Extensive consultations have taken place with other Departments, particularly the Department of the Environment and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The views of BIM and aquaculture industry representative bodies have been considered fully, together with views of fishery and environmental interests.</P>
    <P>Since this Bill was published I have made it clear that I welcome submissions from interested parties and am willing to consider any reasonable amendments that will improve the Bill.  I am anxious that we enact the best possible legislation and am examining a number of submissions received, together with comments that were made when the Bill was before the Seanad last December.  It is in this spirit that I bring the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture industry has been poorly serviced by out of date legislation and a licensing process which has failed to deliver in terms of decisions within a reasonable time frame.  Those who wish to lodge appeals, representations or objections against any licensing decision were also poorly served by the statutes in place.  I am satisfied the Bill provides the necessary legislative framework to command both industry and public confidence in the licensing and regulatory processes for the aquaculture industry.  It underlines the Government's commitment to the sustainable development of this valuable industry and to ensuring that aquaculture develops within strict environmental standards with the rights of other users protected fully.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil caoi agam anois labhairt i bhfábhar an Bhille seo.  I am delighted to have this opportunity at long last to say a few words in favour of the introduction of this legislation.  The Minister of State will agree it is not complicated legislation, it borrows from previous legislation in relation to planning.  I see no reason for the long delay in its introduction. We were promised it in the latter stages of 1995 and right through 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the controversy which has developed about the Bill it is necessary to say a few words about the philosophy and the history of acquaculture.  The coast of Ireland, like our lakes and rivers, represents a major national resource.  It has the potential for economic, environmental and sociological development which, if managed properly, will constitute a national asset of immense value.  All development must aim to work with rather than against the natural system.  However, there is a clear requirement to re-educate at least some members of the public who at the moment seem to assume that all change is bad and must be resisted at any cost and with all possible means.  As in all other areas of human activity, it is recognised that development must be sustainable; it must fulfil the needs of the present generation without compromising adversely the needs of future generations.  That is <Col N="1067" /> the philosophy which will underpin Fianna Fáil policy on development of these resources.</P>
    <P>Historically and because fishing is mainly a coastal activity, it is rural coastal communities which depend on a fishery for survival.  In controlling this natural resource questions should be asked about the social dimension &mdash; who is to own the property rights?  Is it the person with the most capital, most able to effectively exploit the resources or is the fishery to be used to assist the geographical spread of communities, maintain isolated settlements and/or to support the historical rights of families who have fished for generations as in Carlingford Lough and so on?  As politicians we have to address these questions and find a balance.  The Bill sets out to do that.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1852 the first ever commercial fresh water salmon farm was established in County Galway but we had to wait more than a century, until the 1970s, when Irish entrepreneurs, fishermen and students of the marine environment used the knowledge and experience of aquaculture, taken from Norway and America, to set up the first successful Irish salmon farms. Since those small beginnings, technology, the husbandry, and the new ways of doing things have developed to a stage where fish farming produces a quarter of Ireland's marine output, from a modest 20 tonnes in 1980 to 13,000 tonnes today.  Fish was farmed in ponds and lakes for thousands of years.</P>
    <P>The depletion of the world's wild stock by over fishing has given aquaculture an important and necessary food production role in Europe.  In North and South America and across to Asia demand for fish steadily increases each year as consumers become more conscious of the health benefits, the convenience and the almost unlimited variety of seafood available.</P>
    <P>Salmon, a highly versatile quality product, has a huge 300,000 tonne market in Europe alone. Irish salmon demands a premium place on continental shop shelves and restaurant menus due to its renown as a naturally produced full flavoured and consistent product.</P>
    <P>Farming accounts for a quarter of Ireland's seafood output today.  The World Bank has predicted that by the year 2025 the planet will get 40 per cent of its seafood from aquaculture.  Salmon is by far the most popular and successful farmed fish species.  More recently established fish farming enterprises in Ireland include oyster, mussels, scallops, clams, lobsters, eels and turbot.  They join the salmon and trout farms and combine the seafarming and animal husbandry skills that exist in Irish coastal communities.  The farms species list expands each year with farm cod now identified as a good potential expansion area.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects in the development of fish farming has been its labour intensive year round employment opportunities in coastal areas.  Many communities are heavily dependent on the jobs provided by fish farming. More than 2,000 people in Ireland rely either <Col N="1068" /> directly or indirectly on this kind of farming, processing and other services.  Winter time sees a demand in fish farming for part-time workers, most of whom use their employment in salmon farming to boost their incomes from fishing, farming or summer time tourism employment.  By combining traditional land farming and seafaring skills with up-to-the-minute technology, salmon farming has created a new way of life, linked to the sea along our western coastline.</P>
    <P>The service industry linked to this kind of farming employs many other skilled and semi-skilled workers, including hauliers, electricians, mechanics, boat-builders, net-makers, cage-builders, feed manufacturers, equipment makers, sales people, veterinarians, marine biologists, environmental consultants etc.  There are approximately 300 fish farms in Ireland &mdash; in the past they concentrated on salmon production &mdash; producing 13,000 tonnes per annum or 3.5 per cent of world production.  To diversify out of salmon, which is in abundant supply in Europe, a significant number have developed shellfish and other fish production, and employment has grown.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the acquaculture industry has been further encouraged under the operational programme for fisheries but as yet the majority of the producers do not have the necessary licences.  It is estimated there are more than 800 licences pending.  When replying, perhaps the Minister will tell us how many applications are pending and how he intends to process these applications or give an assessment of those who in different circumstances would have applied but have been hindered from doing so?  We all know the situation must be rectified.  Fianna Fáil is committed to implementing exacting legislation and ensuring a fair and equitable system is developed to maintain standards which will ensure licences will only be granted or renewed for those producers who operate within the conditions laid down in their licences.  In this way Fianna Fáil believes any environmental concerns in regard to fish farming and aquaculture in general can be overcome.</P>
    <P>Often Governments are seen to be working against the fishermen or in disagreement with them.  There is a need for radical change and to move away from the continuous confrontation and contentious issues which seem to pull us apart.  It is time we looked on these resources in the same way as we look on national programmes for development in other spheres and sought to have a national consensus, bringing the different components together, hammering out the problem inside closed doors.  Too much time is being lost, there is too much friction and too many people have all the answers for themselves without taking into account the wider and broader issues.</P>
    <P>We want this Bill to succeed and be seen as an opportunity, not as a threat.  It may pose a threat to some.  Explanations will have to be given, amendments may have to be made, there will <Col N="1069" /> have to be a consultative process to ensure these resources give maximum employment and an opportunity to fill the market at a time when other species are not readily available in regions which have little or no alternative opportunities. These isolated regions are far removed from Brussels, Paris and other main centres of population and have little prospect of securing mobile industry.  They must, therefore, rely on natural resources and a combination of different measures.  In this context, I urge the Minister to examine the possibility of bringing the various streams in this area together.  Like me, he is tired of the differences and divisions which have led to a waste of time and reduced the prospects of exploiting these natural resources to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine is responsible for enforcing the regulations and administering the industry on behalf of the State.  It delegates these functions to the Central Fisheries Board, BIM and the Marine Institute.  It is time the Department was placed on a higher footing as it is clearly not able to secure the necessary resources and is sometimes not listened to by the Department of Finance.  It is time we upgraded the Department so that it has the necessary facilities and resources to deal with problems more speedily.</P>
    <P>Most of the people in the industry have been crying out for pragmatic and sensible regulatory measures.  No one is under any illusion that the difficulties in the industry derive from the inadequacies of the Fisheries Acts and the failure of some local authorities to properly enforce the regulations.  The functions of the Department of the Marine, BIM, the Marine Institute and local authorities must be more closely integrated so that there is a consistent regime which will stand the test of time and enable local authorities which do not have sufficient skills to avail of the skills of other local authorities on a contract or other basis.  This will enable us to achieve the targets set out in the operational programme.</P>
    <P>When I visited Mayo last year I was asked to ensure that this legislation would be less bureaucratic, take into account different types of aqua-cultural methods, provide a simple, practical, efficient, cost effective and finite system of regulating the industry, inspire confidence among fish farmers, other water users and the public in its legality and efficacy, protect investment in fish stocks, recognise the necessity for finance and the availability of EU funding and be flexible so that licences can be extended to cater for changes in fish farming and farmers can diversify into other species and protect against speculation.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-1999 aims to increase the harvested tonnage from 13,000 to 24,000 tonnes.  Given the time span between the making of an application, its processing and the appeals process, we are not talking about very much development in 1997, which means it will not take place until 1998.  This poses a threat for the targets set in the operational programme <Col N="1070" /> which would have meant an income of between £80-£100 million and the creation of additional employment which will now obviously be lost.  As we are dealing with peripheral and poorer disadvantaged regions, the State must provide the necessary funding for marketing, promotion, training and research.</P>
    <P>The opponents of fish farming must realise that, like all other sectors, there is a learning curve and mistakes have been, and will be, made &mdash; there are very few areas in conventional farming and industry where mistakes have not been made.  New environmental regulations have been introduced to deal with problems which were not envisaged at the time many developments were started.  It is very important for salmon farmers that we have excellent water and environmental conditions and that these are monitored and maintained.  The future development of the industry depends on the right legislative environment. Irish farmed salmon, with its high quality in terms of appearance, freshness and colour, enjoys a favourable image in the marketplace.  However, the capability of Irish growers to supply the market with the type of produce it requires in terms of size, size mix and grade of salmon is less than satisfactory.  The experts in the industry tell me that this relates to size and tonnage, factors outside the control of the industry.  If we want to supply these larger markets we must achieve the targets set in the operational programme.</P>
    <P>We must also discuss the prospect of added value.  In most cases we do the primary work, at which we are very good, but other countries are better at downstream added value processing. The industry, the State and State agencies seem to be reluctant to carry out downstream added value processing.  Admittedly, it is expensive and one must continuously grapple with advances in technology, etc., but, given the creation of desperately needed additional employment, we can ill-afford to ignore the opportunities offered by added value processing.</P>
    <P>The fin fish sector represents 82 per cent of output.  What is the position of this sector in terms of grant aid?  Is it Government policy not to provide grant aid for hatcheries which are essential for supply?  I have been told that, as a result of the downturn and lack of expansion in the industry, qualified marine biologists and others with aquacultural qualifications have not had available to them the opportunities originally envisaged. We must provide the necessary funding for training so that entrants to this sector can keep abreast of the changes in technology.</P>
    <P>Salmon farming is a combination of age old intensive farming techniques, modern production techniques and technology.  It has rapidly adapted new technologies to meet its requirements.  Scientific progress continues to assist in the introduction of improvements and in pushing out the boundaries in terms of what can be achieved.  The industry is approaching a pure production phase, having evolved from the earlier research and development and scientific experimental phase. <Col N="1071" /> The need for change is ever present as the understanding of marine biology, diet, pathology and the environment advances.  With an emphasis on production, this change is less likely to come from within the industry, particularly in Ireland, and must come from elsewhere.  While the industry will be quick to adapt to new production technology and equipment developed in the world market, it may not discover or be aware of scientific developments and their suitability for application in areas of fish health treatments.  It is important, therefore, that scientific support structures are in place funded both by the State and industry, undertaking targets of research and continuously updating and educating the industry and the public as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Fresh water aquaculture in Ireland concentrates mainly on the production of salmon smolt for orgrowing at sea, fresh water rainbow trout for consumption and native smolt and brown trout for restocking and export.  Knowledge of the common diseases, vaccination and husbandry technologies have improved immeasurably but we must continue to push out the frontiers in that regard.</P>
    <P>To meet our targets in the operational programme, we need a smolt capacity of ten million and, taking into account the tourism programme, that capacity should be approximately 14 million. Will the Minister say whether we will be in a position to meet those targets?</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with certain management matters that have been brought to my notice because of the controversy that has arisen.  I understand the success of oil-based vaccines in salmon farming means there should be little or no need for the use of antibiotics.  Such guarantees are important and they should be discussed in the open.  We must believe in the industry and our ability to reassure the public.  The onus is on the industry to communicates more clearly in terms of the realities of these matters.</P>
    <P>The use of more than one site will allow single generation stock production with fallowing periods between stockings.  This kind of regime will lead to long-term sustainable stock health because of the breaking of the parasite pathogen life cycles, thus reducing greatly the requirement for chemical therapy.  The most common therapy to be used is Nuvan aquaguard bats for the control of lice.  Better net cleaning and general hygiene should greatly reduce the usage of Nuvan.  Fallowing will reduce it further or perhaps eliminate it.</P>
    <P>We should not shy away from the sea trout lice problem.  The implementation of the sea trout task force report, particularly in relation to single bay management and the monitoring of farms, is important.  It is interesting that for competition purposes some angling groups sought permission to site fish near the bays for shelter and other convenience.  Such co-operations is good and we must be committed to finding solutions to problems as distinct from stand-off publicity campaigns <Col N="1072" /> aimed at frightening people which can create enormous difficulty.</P>
    <P>The question of rates has been raised and in this context fish farming sectors are being dealt with differently from pig and mushroom producers and farmers.  An opportunity was lost in this legislation to put them on the same competitive footing as others, particularly Scotland and other competitors.</P>
    <P>In regard to emergency licences, will the Minister outline the way he intends to manage problems such as oil slicks or other pollution.  As far as fish farmers are concerned, flexibility would be required to deal with that kind of disaster.  The Minister might also indicate how matters are progressing in Europe in relation to the distortion of the market as a result of some non-EU countries, particularly Norway, oversupplying the market. Statistics show that Norway produces approximately 300,000 tonnes of fish, Scotland produces 60,000 tonnes and Ireland produces 13,000 tonnes.  We must be wary of the bigger players in the market.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis we have to manage conflict. Irrespective of legislation, however well thought out, or any system that is put in place, wide differences of opinion remain across the country.  It is important for the development of this country, particularly coastal regions, that we seek solutions to our problems.  The implementation of legislation such as this and the prospect of growth in aquaculture will be greatly enhanced.  I urge the Minister to bring the disparate groups together in the context of a national consensus on the way forward.</P>

    <P>The fin fish aquaculture industry has had a chequered history since the tentative investment in it more than 20 years ago by Gaeltarra Éireann in the Connemara Gaeltacht and subsequently by Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Substantial sume of taxpayers' money were invested in research and in a number of failed commercial developments until the earlier difficulties in feed conversion were overcome.</P>
    <P>The fin fish and shellfish industries have the potential to create substantial employment in remote regions of the west in particular.  The pristine quality of the Atlantic waters along stretches of the western coastline, which are far removed from domestic sewage disposal systems and other likely causes of pollution, has led an array of commercial investors into those regions searching for sheltered bays that combine optimum water quality with maximum protection for fish cages from the high seas that can be whipped up to a powerfully destructive force by the frequent storms that batter our western Atlantic coastline.</P>
    <P>The earlier expectation of bonanza from fish farming has not materialised.  There have been huge losses due to diseases which led to a period when every chemical with a potential cure was being tried, some of which were known to be carcinogenic. The alarming decline in the number of sea trout is seen as a direct result of the presence of salmon fish cages in estuary waters.  The emaciated condition of the lice-ridden sea trout that returned to local fresh waters pointed only in one direction when searching for the cause.</P>
    <P>This problem has occupied the attention of successive Ministers and Ministers of State at the Department of the Marine in recent years and has still not been satisfactorily resolved, although the fallowing policy that had to be introduced was a belated admission that there may be a major connection between the location and management of <Col N="1074" /> salmon farms in the sea and the near wipe-out of a very old native species, the sea trout.</P>
    <P>Local communities in Galway West have also expressed concern at the location of fish cages adjacent to popular beaches.  They fear this may have an adverse affect on tourism, a huge industry along the western coastline.  In this regard, one has only to recall the protests organised at Mannin Bay, Cleggan, and Lettergesh.  The attempt some years ago by Messrs Carrolls to locate fish cages on Lough Corrib to rear young salmon raised a storm of protest and led to alarm among angling clubs that they could no longer rely on the Department or the local authority to act as guardians of the marine and fresh water environment, particularly as the then Government also sought to impose a compulsory licence on all fishing rods.  This distrust continues to this day and has been openly expressed in regard to some of the proposals in the Bill.  I share some of those concerns.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in the proposals designed to prohibit persons engaging in aquaculture without a licence, to establish a licensing procedure and to allow for appeals.  Aquaculture is a big business.  It produces 25 per cent of our sea food, more than 80 per cent of which is exported. There are 270 people employed in the fin fish farming industry in Country Galway alone, which produced 5,000 tonnes valued at £15 million in 1996.  A further 150 people are employed in shellfish farming, producing 90 tonnes at a value of £90,000.  Salmon, gigas oysters, arctic char, extensive oysters, abalone, mussels, lobster and turbot are farmed in Country Galway.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture industry employs 3,400 people nationally, although the Minister gave a figure of 2,946 for 1995.  My figures, which I received from the industry, relate to 1996.  I am surprised he did not have more up to date figures.  The industry produced 24,000 tonnes of food valued at £60 million in 1996, most of which was exported.  As a food industry, this valuable business demands high standards.  It is essential, therefore, that extensive controls are put in place to ensure that only the highest standards are tolerated so that nothing is done to interfere with the aquatic environment through interference with the balance of nature and ecological order or through intrusiveness on the physical environment.  Hence the need for legislation.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on grasping the aquaculture nettle and on recognising the urgent need for comprehensive controls and an objective that has the support of the aquaculture industry and angling and environmental interests.  My party supports the principle and objective of this Bill.  I agree with the Minister's view that:</P>
    <P>The aquaculture industry sees the present procedures as a disincentive to enterprise and as being cumbersome and slow in terms of finalising licensing decisions... Others perceive the present licensing process and procedures as failing to have sufficient regard for public rights and environmental concerns.  Furthermore, all <Col N="1075" /> sides agree that appeals mechanisms against licensing decisions are inadequate and applicants and objectors are poorly served by the present system.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity for us to introduce proper legislation.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party is not satisfied the Bill contains sufficient specific proposals to allay the fears of concerned local communities, environmentalists and anglers.  Neither is it satisfied that adequate procedures are being put in place to allow for full consultation on suitability of proposed sites, the conditions and regulations to be applied and on the mechanism for appealing against these decisions.  We want to ensure that a fair, objective and impartial appeals system is put in place.  This is necessary because of the potential threat to the ever sensitive and finely balanced ecological order which affects the fish life in our marine and fresh waters.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with some sections about which I would like to hear further explanation from the Minister.  Section 4 repeals section 54 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, which brings to an end the existing practice of having a restricted number of areas for aquaculture.  The effect of this will be that anyone can apply to undertake aquaculture activities on any marine or freshwater location. This could open a Pandora's box because it gives the Minister the right to grant a licence to operate a fish farm on every lake, river, estuary and bay. There is enormous concern about this change. Why has no distinction been made between marine and freshwater sites?  This will lead to an increased use of our wild rivers and lakes for hatcheries, smolt rearing and other commercial operations.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture proposals for freshwater locations &mdash; land based, as the Minister calls it &mdash; require planning permission and must go through that process.  That requirement does not apply to the sea based structures.  Why has the Minister not dealt with that in the opportunity presented to him by this Bill?</P>
    <P>Section 7(2) states: &ldquo;A licence may be granted, notwithstanding the existance of any public right to fish in any waters to which the licence relates&rdquo;. If that subsection is applied in an insensitive manner without full adequate and meaningful consultation, it has the potential to create major confrontation at local level.  Local communities which make extensive use of lakes, rivers or the sea for fishing, recreation or commercial purposes could be excluded overnight from doing that by the granting of a licence.  If such a decision is now to be made &mdash; we have gone beyond confining it to designated areas &mdash; there is need for an extensive process of consultation to ensure that every possible aspect and the views, opinions and established traditional rights of local people are taken into account in granting a licence.</P>
    <P>Section 9 gives the Minister the power to grant a trial licence for a two years period without consultation and without allowing the public a right <Col N="1076" /> to appeal, which is extraordinary.  I do not agree with the distinction made between a full and a trial licence.  I have read and heard what the Minister has said.  I put it to him that the maximum period of any licence should be five and not more than ten years with an oral hearing in all cases.  If the Minister does not recognise the legitimacy of that proposal, he does not understand how sensitive this issue is and the necessity for absolute openness and the opportunity for full discussion and review of these decisions.  In view of the importance attached to the decision to grant an aquaculture licence, an oral hearing should be granted on request.  Sections 40, 44 and 49 deal with oral hearings and will require considerable amendment to make them more acceptable than the Minister's current proposals.</P>
    <P>Section 15 gives a right to grant a licence in perpetuity or for a period not exceeding 20 years. This is excessive and unnecessary.  Does the Minister not see that, by granting licences in perpetuity, he could transfer part of the State's natural assets into private ownership?  In many cases, if a fish farming company with considerable risk investments collapses and is heavily in debt to some bank or financial institution, that institution will take over the entire operation, including the licence.  The ownership of part of a shore of a river, lake, estuary or bay could thus be transferred to the ownership of some large and possibly foreign financial institution.  The Minister has not dealt with that issue adequately in his introductory speech and I would like to hear more in his reply.</P>
    <P>Under section 54 of the 1980 Act, the right of appeal to the High Court is available and this Bill removes that except in the case of the appeals board the Minister proposes to set up.  It has the right to have matters decided by the High Court, but only in matters of law.  The only opportunity for anyone else to appeal to the High Court is provided in the restricted circumstances set out in section 73 which relates to judicial reviews.  This restricts the matter considerably and is a retrograde step which must be dealt with in some way. It is difficult to see a justification for removing the right of appeal to the High Court and Supreme Court and I await with interest the Minister's explanation of the necessity for this fundamental change.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides that a licence may be renewed after consultation with such bodies as may be prescribed for that purpose.  Who are the bodies likely to be so prescribed, what criteria will apply in their selection and what role, if any, will they play other than being consulted?  I notice in the Minister's introductory speech he referred only to statutory bodies.  Is it to be confined to statutory bodies or will there be others?</P>
    <P>Part III, Chapter I deals with the establishment of an Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board whose role is to adjudicate on appeals against the Minister's decisions on the granting of aquaculture licences.  In the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> this past weekend, a spokesman for the Department, when <Col N="1077" /> asked to comment on the many objections to the Bill voiced by numerous organisations, sought to explain the matter by saying the changes in the law were based on the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts and were creating a means of appeal rather than abolishing them.  It is important to point out that, in the case of aquaculture licensing, the Minister retains the right to grant the licence.  In the case of planning, the Minister has no role either in granting the permission or in deciding the appeals.  The Minister's spokesman made a rather unfortunate and inaccurate comparison in seeking to allay the fears of the angling and environmental groups which had expressed opposition to and raised questions about this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the composition of the board as proposed under section 23.  To achieve a better balance, there should be at least two persons appointed with specific knowledge and experience of wild fisheries and another two persons with knowledge and experience of environmental protection.  I do not agree with the proposal that the board members be all appointed by the Minister.  The Minister stated that the appeals board is based on the An Bord Pleanála system. It is incumbent on the Minister to make the board appointments in the same way they are made to An Bord Pleanála which is from a list of names selected by certain representative nominated bodies which can be agreed by this House or by the Minister under regulations made under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has again defended his decision to have a board with five members and a chairperson who has a casting vote.  The chairperson must have knowledge of the aquaculture industry. Two representatives specifically with knowledge of the aquaculture industry will be appointed.  Of the six, three will come from an aquaculture industry background.  There will be one wild fisheries representative, one environmentalist and one person from a development or community development background.  That is why much concern has been expressed about the possible bias which may exist within the structure of the board to be appointed.  That is why I propose that the Minister consider favourably increasing the representation for environmentalists and wild fisheries representatives on the board in a way whereby the public can have confidence in the board to act independently.  If the six members of the board are to be chosen by the Minister and if they are to adjudicate on the Minister's decisions to grant licences, the public is entitled to be somewhat cynical, to put it mildly, about this operation.  The Minister has the right to issue directives to the appeal board with regard to the matters it must take into consideration.  The board's function is to adjudicate on ministerial decisions while its members are appointed by the Minister and do not represent any particular organisation.  They are there because the Minister chose them. Unfortunately, it has been the practice to appoint people of the Minister's or Government's political <Col N="1078" /> persuasion to such boards and that further taints the process.</P>
    <P>The method of selection is an important factor in establishing a board that is seen to be independent at all times.  Perhaps it is unfortunate that the Minister of State's civil servants said that the basis of this appeal system is An Bord Pleanála. If that is the case, let us have it all, including the method of selecting its membership.  The Tánaiste brought forward the amendment to the legislation establishing the planning appeals board which governs the way in which appointments to the board are made.</P>
    <P>Section 75 provides that licences issued under section 15 of the 1959 Act shall be deemed to be aquaculture licences.  In view of the High Court and Supreme Court decisions in the Ballyvaughan and Mulcahy cases, which stated it was unlawful to issue licences for fish farms located in the sea in accordance with section 15 of the 1959 Act which dealt exclusively with freshwater fisheries, the question arises as to whether the proposal in section 75 is constitutional.  Can the Minister of State offer a specific answer?  Although this matter has been raised with him in correspondence which I have seen, he has not answered the question.  The Supreme Court held that the granting of the licences in the Ballyvaughan and Mulcahy cases was illegal.  What has happened in the meantime?  How have those operations become legal?  Are they to be granted an aquaculture licence under this legislation without having to do anything more than wait for the passage of the Bill?</P>
    <P>I have searched this Bill to see if it is proposed to establish an inspectorate with powers to enter fish farms to establish whether the terms and conditions applying to the licences are being complied with.  I failed to find any such provision. This is a critical omission and must be rectified if the public is to have confidence in the licensing system.  It is obvious to everybody in the fish farming industry and to observers that mistakes have been made.  Salmon farmers are known to have exceeded the allowable tonnage under their licences and to have breached other conditions attached to them.  One of the complaints about the industry is that the Department has been unable to police it adequately and satisfy local concerns that licences and the conditions attached to them are being complied with at all times.  Who will carry out that task?  Perhaps the Minister of State will be able to point out that fishery officers will take on this task as an extra responsibility.  It would have been helpful, however, if a specific reference had been made to it by the Minister of State.  Perhaps he will clarify the position.</P>
    <P>A number of the provisions in the Bill refer to the public interest yet nowhere does the legislation define what matters are to be considered in determining whether the public interest demands certain action.  Under what criteria is one to judge whether the public interest has been breached? There appears to be a lack of clarity in that <Col N="1079" /> regard but the Minister of State might be able to supply a simple answer.</P>
    <P>Great importance is attached to this Bill.  The industry has developed enormously since the passing of the 1959 and 1980 Acts but there is a huge void in the legislation and in the opportunity to make adequate regulations and provisions. Everybody who is interested in the environment and in the development of the fish farming industry welcomes the opportunity presented by this Bill to legislate for a regime on which all sides can rely and in which they can have confidence. The industry can progress in the knowledge that policing mechanisms are provided to ensure that good fish farming practices are employed by all promoters and operators working in the industry.</P>
    <P>When fish farming developed some years ago it was seen as an exciting development, particularly for people in west coast areas where the waters are ideal.  It was envisaged that the industry would provide huge employment in areas where it was extremely difficult for the State to attract sufficient industry to provide employment for the local population.  It presented the opportunity for tremendous rural renewal.  The industry has been successfully managed in Norway and other countries but it has not taken off to the same extent in this country.  There have been difficulties including diseases, and the way they were dealt with converting food to the weight of fish, etc.</P>
    <P>These problems have made investment in fish farming a high risk business.  The ESB lost a huge amount of money when it invested in the industry &mdash; it is no longer involved in that &mdash; as did some of my friends who invested in fish farming.  I was sorry to see their investments fail.  They were brave entrepreneurs; they made an investment and took the risk.  The difficulties they encountered in dealing with the desease problem and its alleged effects required a quicker response from the State.  Hopefully, progress has been made in that area.</P>
    <P>One cannot point the finger at this Minister of State.  He has been active and attentive to his duties.  He has put many mechanisms in place to complement those established by the former Minister, Deputy Andrews, who is keenly interested in angling.  We want to see the natural environment preserved and the fish farming industry developed.  We want both to live harmoniously together with neither interfering with the ecological balance of the other.  I hope we can achieve that.</P>

      <P>Waterford does not have the same indented coastline as the west of Ireland so our aquaculture industry is confined to shellfish rather than salmon and trout farming.  Fish farming is a new and interesting phenomenon in our area.  The statistics quoted by the Minister of State are startling.  Twenty-five per cent of the total value of fish sold to exporters comprised shellfish and farmed fish.  That is enormous. Three thousand people are employed in the industry.  One wonders if that number could have been greatly increased if we had carried out a scientific examination of the habitats in which aquaculture could be fostered.  I would like the Minister to refer to that in his reply.  Up to now success has been hit and miss.  The success in my constituency is purely due to the efforts of individuals who invested money and took a chance.</P>
      <P>A number of major ventures on the west coast which involved huge investment by companies such as Guinness and the ESB suffered heavy losses.  What efforts has the Department of the Marine made to identify locations around the coast where fish farming and aquaculture in general could be a viable proposition?  If somebody told me 20 years ago that the Ring Gaeltacht area of County Waterford would have a lucrative oyster industry I would not have believed it.  I would have thought that a few oysters might be produced there, but to produce a vast quantity of oysters there did not seem possible 20 or even 15 years ago.  It was due to the efforts of a few locals who invested their money.  What research has gone into the likely locations for the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister say why the 1959 legislation and the 1980 legislation has been found to be deficient &mdash; that matter was not referred to in the debate.  This legislation is being introduced because those two Acts are deficient.  I suspected they were deficient several years ago when a shell fish project was started by a number of people off Woodstown Strand in the Waterford Estuary and a number of locals, for various reasons, were not happy with the project.  When the tide was fully in, trawler men trawled the area for flat fish.  The locals objected, but apparently their objections fell on deaf ears.  Some locals on the land were concerned about the effects on the environment and the ecology of the area, but their objections also fell on deaf ears.  When inquiries were made about the terms of the licence for the people who had put these ventures in motion, it was discovered that, despite the publication in national newspapers of reports that some of the individuals <Col N="1081" /> had received huge grants from the Department of the Marine for the ventures in which they were involved, they did not have a licence.  Under the 1959 and 1980 Acts they were not entitled to and could not be granted a licence.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister intend to do about unlicensed projects which have proceeded?  Does he intend to licence them retrospectively or go through a licensing procedure whereby locals, whether fishermen, environmentalists or the general public who are not happy with a development, can stop such development in the event that their objections are legitimate?</P>
    <P>I will come a little closer to the Minister's home to point out an analogy.  I heard on the radio or television during the past week that huge office blocks are to be built between beautiful old residences overlooking the sea in the Minister's constituency in Dún Laoghaire, some of which have been there for 100 years, and the proposed buildings would block the view of the sea from the residents living in the area.  It is incomprehensible that an amenity such as a gorgeous view of the sea can be eliminated, with no redress under our complex planning laws, which contain anomalies. That the view of the sea can be blocked and individuals affected can do nothing about it should be redressed.  Likewise, people who have had to endure fish farming projects in their area have no recourse in law to prevent them from operating.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong with the licensing laws and I have no doubt that is why this legislation is being introduced.  Even if there were deficiencies in the 1959 and 1988 Acts, one would have thought that the Foreshore Act, 1933, and the planning laws of the mid-1960s would give citizens the right to object, but apparently that is not the case.  I would like the Minister to spell out what exactly he is doing to address the inadequacies and inconsistencies in the legislation.  His speech, which is fairly comprehensive, does not refer to the reason the legislation is being introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to people's rights and myths.  That is a little poetic, similar to poems the Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, would write, but apparently there are a few budding poets in the Department of the Marine.</P>

      <P>The Minister was a student of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to bring in guidelines to distinguish between wild salmon and salmon raised in cages?  There should be a major differential in the price, particularly in regard to fresh salmon, but that differential may not exist because if a person does not have a sensitive palate he or she may not be able to distinguish between wild and tame salmon.  Those of us who live by the sea and regularly eat fish know the difference.  The public is entitled to know that some salmon is <Col N="1082" /> wild and some is tame and there should be a significant price differential.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the Minister for Tourism and Trade, perhaps the Minister will consider bringing in a law to make it compulsory to indicate whether salmon is wild or tame.  I find it very difficult to distinguish between the two in the case of smoked salmon, but it is not too difficult in the case of fresh salmon.  I am not sure the general public understands the difference and certainly continentals may not understand it.  We are at a great disadvantage because of the preponderance of Norwegian salmon reared through fish farming, which floods the market at various times of the year.  Since we produce much wild salmon it is important that a distinction is made between the two.  It would be helpful if we were given figures for the amount of salmon produced in cages by Norwegians and the amount we produce.  It has a huge effect on the overall market for salmon, trout and any other species of fish which can be reared in artificial surroundings.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister or the Department decide who is allocated foreshore for aquaculture, for example, in the production of oysters, mussels, clams and cockles, which are found around the Irish coast?  Is it like the Klondyke goldrush where people go out, rail off an area and lodge their claim with the Department of the Marine or another agency?  Is it done in consultation with the Department of the Marine?  I have seen disputes arise because of the size of foreshore which some people have obtained.  Some have obtained a large amount of foreshore and others a minute amount.  Is there a regular tendering system or is it first come, first served?  How are the various plots allocated?  If it is not done in a regular manner, there should be a tendering system.  The various areas which are identified scientifically through research as being suitable for aquaculture should be advertised and people should be invited to tender for a certain area and a certain type of shellfish.  It is a slap-happy system which should be more regular.</P>
    <P>I do not have a problem with the form of licensing system advocated by the Minister, particularly the appeals board.  An appeals board is badly needed and perhaps this is one of the reasons the Minister is introducing this legislation. I know the other two Acts are deficient and I am at a loss to know why.  Perhaps it is because there is no provision for an appeals board under existing legislation.  This would explain why those in the Woodstown area of my constituency cannot do anything about trestles which were put down without licence.  Those who do not want them there cannot do anything about it.  The appeals board may find licences should be granted and the trestles and shellfish should stay there.  I cannot give my constituents an answer, which is why I am asking the Minister to tell me.</P>
    <P>There was a similar situation in Dungarvan Bay.  On one side there is a massive oyster fishery off the Ring gaeltacht, which has been a tremendous boon to the area in providing employment. <Col N="1083" /> On the other side of the harbour people put out trestles with clams on them, without a licence.  It is a built-up area and the locals objected.  Who wants to look out their window and see a beach and a strand covered in trestles and seaweed and tractors and trailers going in at all hours of the day and night?  The local residents did not want it and could not find out if those involved had a licence.  They kicked up a fuss and the promoters of the project were told they were contravening the Foreshore Act, 1933, or planning legislation. It was one or the other and I do not know which. It appears that the means of preventing undesirable developments are not clear.  Perhaps this legislation will provide for this.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be able to suggest other species which would be suitable for aquaculture. We are used to traditional shellfish along the coast.  It was a source of interest when oysters and clams were capitalised on.  Does the Minister have a planning and research section in his Department which could encourage people to cultivate an additional series of shellfish or finfish?</P>
    <P>Overall, we welcome the Bill.  We welcome anything which clears up irregularities and blocks loopholes, of which, apparently, there are many in existing legislation.  We appreciate the good work the Minister has done since he entered office.  I will look for concessions from him on the salmon fishing season in the course of another debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I also welcome the Bill which is long overdue.  I compliment the Minister on initiating a process which will pull the aquaculture industry together.</P>
      <P>Over the last 15 years, this industry has been controversial and seemed to operate in a piecemeal manner.  From my limited involvement in this area, the Department of the Marine has shown a distinct lack of interest in its development. There have been major delays in the issuing of licences and legislation was practically nonexistent. As a result, confrontation between the developers and objectors seemed to be the order of the day.</P>
      <P>As in Deputy Deasy's constituency, there are many shellfish operations in the Wexford area. We have heard of Bannow Bay oysters and the mussel industry.  Letts were probably the pioneers of the shellfish industry in Wexford.  They still are and have developed further in Cork and other areas.  According to media reports, there seems to be an alarming incidence of confrontation on a regular basis on the west and south-west coast. Despite these problems, aquaculture has developed as an important component of the fishing industry.  The Minister mentioned the 2,946 people employed in the aquaculture industry at the end of 1995.  The total farm production in 1995 amounted to 27,000 tonnes with a value of £50 million and this is expanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credit should be given to those who, despite the confrontation, difficulties and delays by the <Col N="1084" /> Department of the Marine in issuing licences and giving them support, stayed with aquaculture and produced a modern industry.  I agree with the Minister that it is necessary to take it a stage further.  There is a need for proper legislation and the establishment of a process which will encourage people to become involved in the aquaculture industry in the coming years.  I noticed in the <i>Mayo News</i> that a group called &ldquo;The West's Awake&rdquo; made a number of allegations about the new legislation.  While the Minister dealt with some of them in his speech, perhaps he could elaborate on the new trial licence against which there is no appeal.  He mentioned the short duration of this licence but that may not appease people who are concerned.  A significant number of organisations question the Minister's new trial licence system.  Perhaps he could clearly define the duration of the licence.  There will be widespread concern because people want some appeal system whereby they can air their views.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke about privatising the foreshore.  From experience I know foreshore areas can become controversial in coastal counties. In Wexford Harbour, Lady's Island, Bannow Bay and many other areas of County Wexford major controversies have erupted over who should or should not operate within the foreshore. Some of the biggest objectors to developments in the areas I mentioned were the harbour boards or commissioners who seem to think it is a protected area where no new developments or operations should take place.  It is one of the most controversial political areas I have come across in my time dealing with marine issues.</P>
    <P>No one seems to want to let go of anything within the foreshore and it is difficult to define who owns it.  Usually it takes months to get a response to representations to the Department of the Marine, even for a gun licence to shoot in a foreshore area.  Sometimes I feel the Department of the Marine is afraid to make any decisions in this area because of the objections that may arise.</P>
    <P>Those objecting to the legislation have also questioned the idea of creating a licensing system which is heavily biased towards fish farmers.  Perhaps the Minister will spell out in his reply how he envisages this operating.  I am sure he will not hand it over to fish farmers in an area and then find himself in all sorts of difficulties later on.  The Minister has dealt with some of the 12 points listed but perhaps he might clarify some other areas in his reply.  Some of the questions raised have already been fairly well cleared up by the Minister, and others seem to be flimsy questions amounting to objections for the sake of it.</P>
    <P>It says at the end of the article: &ldquo;Tell your local TD what you think.  Remember this is an election year.  Don't allow them to take away your traditional rights&rdquo;.  Everybody seems to want to tell their local TDs what they think, particularly if it affects them in any way.  Everyone I meet nowadays, whether it is the school project or other projects, asks me to get a commitment from the Government this year because it is an election <Col N="1085" /> year.  If one were to give all the commitments the public is currently seeking, any party coming into Government would be in severe difficulty. However, it is an area the Minister should clear up quickly.</P>
    <P>There is always a difficulty in trying to strike a balance in coastal communities between what is acceptable and environmentally friendly, and what is required to develop jobs.  This area has the potential to create a significant number of jobs if it is developed in the right way.  Any legislation to be introduced must be balanced and fair so that all sides will have a say.  It is equally important that coastal communities should be given an opportunity to see industry or aquaculture developed in a way that creates jobs.  The Minister mentioned having provided 3,000 jobs to date and said another 1,300 or 1,400 will be created by 1999.</P>
    <P>Some coastal areas are being completely denuded of industry and jobs.  Many people are leaving coastal communities and moving inland to secure jobs.  With a bit of imagination, commonsense and flexibility on all sides many hundreds of jobs could be created around our coastline.</P>
    <P>I am annoyed by people from Dublin and Dún Laoghaire who buy holiday homes for £100,000 or £150,000 and lead the objections the moment any new project gets under way, be it a fishing development or &mdash; as in a recent case &mdash; a coastal sawmilling industry.  Just because they buy a house in an area they do not have a monopoly on the area for ever more.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone out of his way to be balanced and to produce legislation that will encourage development while protecting the environment. All sides must be given a fair hearing. If we allow industrial development to be stifled because of one or two objections, we will find that coastal communities will die out.  Such communities, comprising families that have lived there for generations, are the real protectors of our coastline.</P>
    <P>Side by side with aquaculture we must ensure the development of tourism activities including pleasure boating, swimming, water-skiing and cruising.  These and many other operations take place in harbours where proper regulation and licensing will allow them to prosper and grow alongside aquaculture development.  I hope this will become the norm and people will realise there is a way of ensuring all those areas progress rather than just being selfish and making things awkward in a confrontational way.  Confrontation will not resolve many of the problems that exist for people seeking jobs.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry, including fish farming, is a high quality food industry as the Minister indicated. We have an ideal opportunity to develop it as we produce this product in a clean green environment.  We should be in a position to develop our fishing industry and avail of export markets.  People are looking for fish and are turning away from some of the more useful food <Col N="1086" /> products.  In the years ahead we can capitalise on traditional food products including fish.</P>
    <P>I support what Deputy Deasy said about farm salmon and the wild species.  A distinct line needs to be drawn in this area because people can become confused about which is which.  Perhaps the Minister could examine this area to see how it can be dealt with in future.  There should be a price differential.  It may be the case that some retailers do not explain clearly to the consumer which variety is on sale.  This may result in overcharging.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I tabled a question to the Minister asking him the amounts of Norwegian salmon imported.  This causes grave concern for those involved in the industry as these imports distort the market.  I am led to believe that in some instances workers have to be laid off in certain months of the year when the market is flooded with Norwegian salmon.  What controls can be put in place to ensure the consumer continues to purchase Irish salmon?</P>
    <P>The lack of legislation was a deterrent to new investors in the industry.  There was a view that they would encounter difficulties immediately from objectors as well as delays in obtaining licences from the Department of the Environment. The perception was that this was not the right industry in which to invest.  The Minister has addressed each of these issues in the legislation. I hope that as a result those who wish to invest in the industry will receive a more friendly response from the Department of the Marine and within the industry.</P>
    <P>On the selection of nominees to the board, I have said consistently that the persons appointed to boards are usually cronies of the Minister concerned or of the parties in Government. It is important that the right people are appointed to ensure that the industry is placed on a sound footing.  They should have the required knowledge, be able to attract investors and find new markets, new species included, for a state of the art industry.  Too often in the past people who were not capable of running a corner shop were appointed to boards whose decisions had major implications in terms of jobs and investment.  The membership of the board should not mainly comprise representatives of fish farming as that would defeat its purpose.</P>
    <P>Delays in the processing of appeals will cause major problems.  The regulations introduced by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, a number of years ago stipulate that An Bord Pleanála should make decisions within four months, if possible.  I understand that in the majority of cases, however, it seeks additional time.  This causes major problems in the building industry in particular.  This issue was highlighted by the South-Eastern Construction Federation and the Wexford Construction Federation when I met them prior to the budget.  The Minister should not allow the new board to avail of a similar mechanism.  He should be strict with it for the betterment of the industry and ensure that it has the required number of <Col N="1087" /> staff to resolve any problems.  In fairness to An Bord Pleanála, it has insufficient staff to deal with the large increase in the number of appeals resulting from the building boom.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which will do much to put the industry on a sound footing and allow the Minister to achieve his objective between now and 1999, that is, to create an additional 1,300 jobs.  Once legislation and regulations are in place and there is a proper structure, people will want to invest in the industry.  That can only be good for the nation as a whole but, more importantly, for coastal communities which are heavily dependent on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Most speakers have welcomed the Bill with some reservations.  I wish to be constructive and help the Minister find a way through the minefields he will encounter in processing the Bill through the House.  It has already caused great concern in Galway and throughout the west, irrespective of its good intentions. Alarm bells have been set off in angling and fresh water circles in Galway city, Moycullen, Oughterard, Cornamona, Clonbur and Headford and the entire Corrib and Mask region.  The Bill passed through the Seanad without great fuss on 12 December, but it will be the subject of a more thorough debate in this House.  When it was drafted in November it was circulated to various bodies for their comments.  Will the Minister list the bodies to which it was circulated?</P>
      <P>In a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> on 30 January a Mr. Mark Helmore stated that the Bill could lead to fish cages being placed on every river, lake and estuary in Ireland.  This caused concern in the Corrib and Mask region.  In a letter to the same newspaper the following week a Mr. A W Lionel McKee stated that if what was stated in the first letter was true, it was a serious matter.  After that the debate took on a life of its own with angling and fresh water groups holding emergency meetings to examine and discuss the Bill.  That exercise led to the publication of half page advertisements in local papers in the west last weekend.  The Minister of State is aware of the questions posed in the advertisements.  He replied to some of them when introducing the Bill.  I am sure the people concerned did not place those advertisements without considering or being advised on the Bill.  I presume they would not incur that expense without having serious reservations about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following questions were posed in an advertisement.  1.  Could there be fish farms on every lake, river, estuary and bay in Ireland?  2. Will it abolish the rights to fishing, navigation and recreation?  3. Will it abolish the existing right of appeal against a licence to the courts?  4. Will the court be replaced by a ministerial board?  5. Will it legislate at a stroke and retrospectively approve all existing and illegal fish farm licences?  6. Will it license farms for 20 years or in perpetuity?  7. Will it effectively exclude fishery boards, county <Col N="1088" /> councils, An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency from the licensing decision?  8. Will it create a licensing board heavily biased towards the fish farmers?  9. Will it compel the appeals board to heed the Minister's policies? 10. Will it severely restrict objections in the limited circumstances where one has rights?  11. Will it introduce a new trial licence against which there is no appeal?  12. Will it effectively give salmon farmers full ownership of their sites &mdash; privatisation of the foreshore?</P>
    <P>As a Deputy representing a west Galway constituency, I have only to think back to a time less than ten years ago, 17 December 1987, when the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill quickly slipped through the Dáil and came before the Seanad on 18 December 1987 to understand why this Bill might cause such concern.  As a Senator I outlined my fears about that Bill.  I finished my contribution that night by warning the then Minister that anglers in the Corrib-Mask region would not accept that Bill.  It became known as the infamous rod licence Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne paid little heed to the fears sometimes generated by this type of Bill.  One would have to have been in the west for the four years following the introduction of the rod licence Bill to realise the concerns and trauma it caused in communities there.  I had first-hand experience of the tension and divisions caused by that Bill and I never want to experience them again.  Some of the hurt caused in communities, parishes and in families has not been assuaged.  People from outside the area found it hard to comprehend the passion and concern about the rod licence Bill. Opposition to that Bill was founded on a genuine fear that a licence to fish our lakes would lead to control of the waters and the installation of smolt rearing cages on our lakes.  That fear consolidated a campaign against the rod licence Bill and, if it is not dealt with &mdash; I am sure the Minister of State will deal with that real or imaginary fear &mdash; it will consolidate a campaign against this Bill.  I do not want that to happen.  I want that fear dealt with in a rational and appropriate manner.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will be able to respond positively to the concerns raised about this Bill.  If he is not able to do so now, we should not rush Committee Stage.  Any time spent on it will be better than time wasted addressing fears concerning its provisions after its introduction.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the impact, if any, the Bill will have on the procurement of permission for installation of smolt cages on lakes and rivers? Some people are of the view that it will automatically abolish all planning permissions in this area, but that is not the case.  Will the Minister of State clarify if a licence for fish cages can only be got in designated areas?  Will designated areas be abolished under the Bill and will it be possible to obtain a licence in any area?</P>
    <P>I am concerned about section 2 under which the Minister can delegate his or her function in granting a licence to a civil servant.  I do not like that departure.  I would prefer if the Minister <Col N="1089" /> made such a decision.  I ask the Minister of State to amend that section because it is always preferable that such decisions be taken by those with political responsibility.  I am not saying this Minister would, but a future Minister could wash his or her hands of an awkward case by handing it over to a civil servant.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides that a person who communicates with the appeals board to try to influence a decision shall be guilty of an offence.  That is a restrictive clause and it could even debar a public representative from making a legitimate representation because the purpose of any representation is to influence a decision.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider that provision.</P>
    <P>Under sections 45 and 46 a person appealing a decision has only one month to make an appeal.  The person can make only one submission which cannot be added to.  It appears that the objector's submission would be available to the applicant, but unlike the planning appeals board's position, the applicant's response to the objection would not be available to the objector.  That lessens the rights of the objector compared to the current position under the planning appeals board.  There cannot be an oral hearing except at the Minister's discretion and the only access an objector would have following an appeal would be a judicial review, which would be at the expense of the objector.  A judicial review could cost £50,000, which would be prohibitive to an ordinary objector.</P>
    <P>Under that section, will the Minister of State clarify the position regarding current fresh water cages or smolt cages which are in place without planning permission?  I have reservations about the section that introduces a two year trial licence with the sanction of only the licensing board. That would be a dangerous development.  Section 7 (3) outlines 11 conditions regarding monitoring. Who will monitor the position, given that there are no inspectors and one of the objectives of the introduction of this Bill is to regulate existing practices that are not in order or are illegal?  How can inspectors be available, particularly given that the major Corrib development plan has used the limited resources of the fisheries boards?  Who will ensure that the conditions set out in section 7 (3) are followed?</P>
    <P>Section 15 (2) provides that an aquaculture licence should be granted in perpetuity or for a period not exceeding 20 years.  Why should the licence be granted for 20 years?  Could it not be granted for a period of five to ten years at which time it could be reviewed?</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Bill has created genuine fears among anglers in the Corrib, Mask and Connemara region.  I do not wish to engage in scaremongering.  I raise these points on foot of the advertisement in local newspapers, the bottom line of which stated that people should contact their local TD.  Before the publication of that advertisement, many people contacted me to express their fears about this Bill.  I would be failing in my duty if I did not bring those fears to the <Col N="1090" /> Minister's attention.  He met some of those people at the TAFI annual general meeting in Athlone when they may have expressed their fears to him and he may have dealt with them. Will the Minister confirm that this Bill will not do away with the necessity to obtain planning permission before fish or smolt cages can be placed in fresh water?</P>
    <P>The production of farmed salmon in Ireland is about 15,000 tonnes annually.  If it is envisaged that the production of farmed salmon will be doubled, that will increase the demand for salmon smolts by the aquaculture industry in the region over the next few years.  According to statistics in a document produced by the Western Regional Fisheries Board on potential sites for salmon and smolt production for aquaculture, the lack of available freshwater sites is impeding the development of the industry in the western region.  That publication states also that it is important not only to identify the projected smolt requirements but to decide how and where this can be met.  How can we double the production rate and still cater for the smolts without having any effect on our freshwater lakes?  I have done some research into this.  There are 25,000 smolts in one tonne or four million smolts in 160 tonnes. It takes approximately 250 million litres of fresh water to produce one tonne of smolts, that is, 55 million gallons.  It would require 8,800 million gallons of fresh water to produce four million smolts, or 160 tonnes, each year.</P>
    <P>Galway City, for example, uses ten million gallons of water each day or 365 million gallons of water each year.  The annual production of four million smolts would require about 3.5 times the amount of fresh water used by Galway City each year.  This is a massive amount of water, and the only fresh water available in such quantity is in Lough Corrib and Lough Mask.  That is the reason for the fear.</P>
    <P>In 1987, at the height of a campaign against the rod licence, there was a real threat of planning permission being given for smolt cages on our freshwater lakes.  This is what united the people in a common stand against the idea of the rod licence.  The fear was that the rod licence would confer control of the lakes on the Government and take it away from the people of the area.  This threat existed in 1987 when planning applications and appeals in connection with smolt cages on our freshwater lakes were able to win through the planning law.  One application at the time was a double planning application.  Planning permission was sought under reference 52454 from Galway County Council.  It was a planning application for permission for fish cages at Lough na Fooey at the head of Lough Mask which feeds the Mask and also connects to the Corrib.  It was first refused by Galway County Council on 17 July, 1986 on the grounds that (1) such fish cages would be a public health hazard to the headwaters on Lough Mask, which is the major source of a public water supply, and (2) they would result in injury to the visual amenity.  The application <Col N="1091" /> was appealed and was refused by An Bord Pleanála which mentioned only visual amenity as a ground for refusal.  The application was then renewed under reference 55416, and it was decided by Galway County Council on 17 February 1988, only months after the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1987 was passed, to grant temporary permission for five years.  The county manager at the time said that he had no option in the matter because the planning appeals board had refused the previous application only on the grounds of injury to visual amenity and that, as the second application was for submerged cages, he was obliged to grant it.  However, submerged cages would pose the same threat to the headwaters of a lake as over water cages.  I put this on the record to illustrate that the fears of people at that time about the possibility that smolt cages on the great western lakes, Corrib and Mask, was not imaginary, and the real risk that planning permission will be granted for smolt rearing on our freshwater lakes.</P>
    <P>If production is increased by 100 per cent, how is it proposed to cater for it?  Is the fear of people in Galway and Mayo justified?  People outside the area may think we are head cases, but between 1987 and 1991 when the rod licence Bill was abandoned it was illustrated that our fears were not imaginary but were real and caused consternation in our community.  In my lifetime I do not want to see that happen again.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the protection of our waterways, we cannot take any chances.  Galway City, with a population of 60,000 and the surrounding areas from Galway to Oughterard, Headford, Tuam, Oranmore, Maree and Clarinbridge, are all supplied from Lough Corrib.  How do we know what effect it would have on the waster if fish farms were allowed on the Corrib, or so-called land based fish farms on the edges of rivers, tributaries to the Corrib?</P>
    <P>We will not be thanked if we allow anything to harm the jewel in our midst, the Corrib-Mask, the greatest free fishing lake in Europe.  That is why I have taken a different approach to previous speakers.  I have complimentary things to say about the Bill also, but I will reserve them for Committee Stage.  I wanted to alert the Minister to the real fears that exist on the ground in the area I represent.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with other Members of the House in giving a general welcome to this legislation.  A cursory perusal of the Minister's speech gives one a graphic understanding of the growth and development that has taken place in the aquaculture industry over the past number of years.  The figures are significant.  If the industry continues to grow, the need for this legislation will become all the more urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fish farming is very much a west coast phenomenon, not something we are familiar with on the east coast although there are aspects of the aquaculture industry that are significant. <Col N="1092" /> There have been significant developments along the coast in my constituency in recent years, particularly in the area of Carlingford Lough.</P>

      <P>This is an opportunity for this House to revisit and have a detailed debate on the crying need for reform of our prison service. Notable in the recent display of openness which the Department of Justice has adopted in relation to the prison service is a distinct absence anywhere in this process of the Minister for Justice. A headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Tuesday, 4 February, read: &ldquo;Prison Chiefs Admit the System is in Chaos&rdquo;.  These senior civil servants are being paraded out by the Government in a selfstyled <i>glasnost</i> orchestrated by the Minister.  This is no more than a cynical exercise of a defeated Government.  It is truly Government by spindoctoring. While the openness at long last is welcome, its motivation is suspect.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Glasnost</i> is a credo which, if genuine, is undertaken and embraced by an incoming Government or Administration.  I believe it is a cynical abuse of the term to cite <i>glasnost</i> as a description of a Government on its knees admitting to defeat as far as the management of prisons is concerned. For over two years this Government has used all the classic retentative methods of secret Government to conceal the truth of the chaos and difficulties in the prison service.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the record of this Government on the issue of crime and lawlessness.  There is evidence for all to see of a dereliction of duty to protect the citizen.  One of the first acts of this Government was to cancel the prison building programme which had been set in train by the outgoing Administration in recognition of the crisis of accommodation in the prison service.  The rainbow Government maintained this denial of the need for extra prison spaces.  It was distracted and paralysed into inaction by a woolly-minded preoccupation that all criminals are ultimately victims until it was forced by the white heat of rage among citizens after the murder of Veronica Guerin and an escalation in organised crime to sign up to a range of measures, including extra prison spaces, which it had only a few weeks earlier voted down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been a unique feature of this Government that any reforms which it has eventually embraced have only been brought about by its response to the latest calamity.  It has been at the mercy of events rather than in control of them. Nowhere is this more evident than in the prison <Col N="1093" /> service.  Time after time the Minister has been unwilling to give figures in this House for the number of crimes committed while on temporary release, the average portions of sentences served, the number of prison spaces needed if the State abuse of temporary release was discontinued and even the cost per unit of the meagre number of spaces this Government can claim to have added to prison spaces.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to account for the chronic inability to tackle overtime.  Some £53 million has been spent on prison overtime in the past three years.  The Minister was similarly unable to deal with the appalling breaches in work practices in Limerick Jail, the bungling in her private office and in the Department, which led to the Special Criminal Court being improperly constituted with disastrous consequences, and the number of escapes and continuing absconding from open jails.</P>
    <P>Now that the prison chiefs, if not the Minister, have admitted that up to 50 persons are released each day to make space, do we need a Minister for Justice?  It would appear by way of the new <i>glasnost</i> that this information is being given to the media by civil servants.  The Minister has political and statutory responsibility and, under existing prisons legislation, she has a duty to provide prison spaces.  She is not providing adequate prison spaces to meet the need of persons sentenced by our courts.</P>
    <P>Time after time whenever there is a crisis in the prison service the Minister dives for cover.  If there is an escape, the prison officer's union is sent out to bat.  If there is a disaster, suicide or a story about the terrible addiction and chaos in relation to the treatment of drug addicts in Mountjoy Prison, the governor is sent out to bat. Every matter which required the Minister's attention since she came into office has been long fingered. Eight months after the commitment to deliver a new prison at Wheatfield, this grand plan is still at the ponderous planning stage in the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>During the Special Criminal Court fiasco and in the aftermath of the Cromien and Molloy report on the catalogue of disasters which caused the non-implementation of a Government decision to delist a judge, the Minister devised a new concept &mdash; a new definition of accountability. She said that accountability means a duty to furnish information, but there was not mention of responsibility.  It is the duty to furnish an account, but no obligation to pay that account.  The same formula is now being applied to prisons &mdash; account by <i>glasnost</i> but no political responsibility for the admitted chaos over which this Government has presided for over two years.</P>
    <P>The purpose of our Bill is to ensure that over the next two weeks there will be a six hour debate on what needs to be done to put order back into the admitted chaos in the prison service.  Our proposal is simple and is one which this Government voted down this time last year when we moved this measure in a Private Members' Bill, but yet <Col N="1094" /> again responding to calamity it was forced to sign up to it after the Special Criminal Court fiasco in November.  It proposes that the Minister for Justice, in addition to her existing duty to provide prisons and control custodial accommodation, should have a duty to assess periodically the need for prisons and custodial accommodation and to provide adequate prison spaces to meet that need.  This is not being done at present.  The key proposals are that the management of prisons be transferred to the prison service's executive headed by a director of prisons appointed by the Government, the appointment of an inspector of prisons, a duty on the Minister to provide adequate prison spaces to meet the needs of prisoners sentenced by the courts and a register of temporary release.  With these four key proposals, some element of accountability could be injected back into the prison system.</P>
    <P>The statements and disclosures by the six civil servants who have been sent out to admit to the chaos are an abdication of political responsibility. I understand there is an acceptance among those who work in the prison service, including the governors, that they agree with measures in this Bill. In a submission made to the expert group looking at the practicalities of reform, they agree with our criticisms that there has been woeful waste and mismanagement of the huge resources spent on the prison service by the Department of Justice. That is reflected in the governors' submission to the expert group, contrary to the mistaken impression given on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today in a taped interview with Governor Lonergan.</P>
    <P>The cost of running the prison service is a colossal £120 million per annum or £2 million per week.  That is only the running cost and not capital projects.  This represents an average cost of £45,000 per prisoner per year.  Last year prison officers' overtime costs ran to £18 million, overshooting the budget as usual.  Prison service costs overall have risen by 50 per cent in the past five years, yet only 8 per cent more prisoners are in custody.  Our prison building costs are extremely high.  The new 400 space remand centre at Wheatfield announced recently by the Minister is estimated to cost £40 million, which works out at £100,000 per unit.  There is no evidence of any competitive tendering to reduce the building costs or any willingness to invite a more energetic involvement of the private sector who could design, finance and build prisons and lease them to the Government.</P>
    <P>Temporary release is an ongoing problem.  On 24 January last a total of 465 prisoners were on temporary release.  More than 4,000 orders for full temporary release are made every year.  This is a scandalous abuse of the system of temporary release as a way of creating space.</P>
    <P>The notion of full temporary release is a complete misnomer, it is unconditional, permanent, unsupervised release.  Escapes have continued unabated with more than a dozen persons escaping from closed institutions last year and 200 walking out of open institutions and not <Col N="1095" /> returning.  The absconding of a 15-year old youth while on a mobility trip to the cinema, only days after conviction, was yet another manifestation of the incapability of our justice system and our so called education system in administering the justice handed down in public by the courts.  For that, as in all the escapes nobody has been made responsible.  Some 1,316 offenders were unlawfully at large on 25 July 1996.  In July a convicted murderer escaped from Mountjoy while on his way to a workshop, 197 persons escaped from open prisons and 53 of them remained at large. Nobody seemed to be bothered about that.  One quarter of the country's entire prisons population, 722, were transferred to open prisons last year. Open prisons cost the taxpayer £700 per week per prisoner.</P>
    <P>The most basic function of any prison system is to detain people.  After all this money has been spent the State is not providing detention.  Leaving aside any dreams of rehabilitating, curing or detoxifying the hopeless drug addicts, who form such a huge part of our prison population, we cannot even detain prisoners because of shortage of space.</P>
    <P>The public is slowly awakening to the true horror of what has been going on in our prisons and that is good.  This comes as no surprise to those of us who have studied the Irish prison system, read the successive Mountjoy visiting committee reports, visited the prison, put the questions to the Minister for Justice and extracted the statistical information which forms the basis of the knowledge which is now being given out by way of <i>glasnost</i>.  Various visiting committee reports describe Mountjoy as a potential volcano and forecast a prison service spiralling to certain disaster. There have been cries of despair from the committee that all their reports seem to disappear unheeded into a vacuum.  All of these provided adequate warning to the Minister and to those of us who have had access to these reports.</P>
    <P>The recent hostage crises provided an opportunity for some level of debate about the management of Mountjoy and the need for better facilities for dangerous prisoners.  Some efforts have been made on that score.</P>
    <P>As Mountjoy is the major committal prison, people are sent there without any assessment of their psychological make-up or their psychiatric background and put into the general body of the prison population.  That is a recipe for disaster. Prisoners should be accommodated in accordance with the results of assessments at point of entry. Decisions on lock-up requirements and privileges should be made on the basis of each assessment. Due to the chronic overcrowding and the turnover of prisoners, every time a judge sentences a prisoner another prisoner is freed from Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>On a range of measures the Government has only reacted.  Every reform has been in response to a calamity.  At one point the Minister accused us of hyping up the crime problem, as if there was <Col N="1096" /> a need.  At the beginning of this month a national opinion poll showed that the public had twice as much confidence in the Opposition parties' commitment to tackling crime as in the Government. This is no wonder because the Government has no overall strategy; it is not in control, it merely responds to disasters.</P>
    <P>This indecisiveness and lack of direction in policy has its roots in the ideological differences between the parties of the left and Fine Gael. There are strong elements in the Coalition Government, particularly in the left, which place more importance on the rights of the criminal at the expense of the rights of law abiding citizens. The classic left approach to crime is to dismiss criminality and put it all down to social deprivation. The premise is that ultimately we are all responsible for the crimes of the disadvantaged. It is wrong reasoning, it blurs the difference between right and wrong and spreads blame on the victims of crime and on law abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>The Government opposed a change in the bail laws, refused to provide extra prison spaces and amend the right to silence until it was forced, by public outrage at the murder of a journalist in broad daylight, to embrace measures which ten days earlier it had voted down.  Not until people marched on the streets of Dublin about the drug activities in the communities and the rising vigilantism was Operation Dóchas initiated.</P>
    <P>There is a need for an immediate 50 per cent increase in the number of prison places available to bring the total to 3,500.  The threat of prison is no longer a disincentive to crime because convicts know they will serve only a fraction of their sentences. Recently a prosecution counsel in a case where a person convicted of a serious charge was given a three year sentence was horrified to see that person on the street a month later.  That the number of people convicted of serious crimes has risen by 52 per cent in the past five years is evidence that the threat of crime has never been greater.  How can citizens have confidence in the system if we do not have an adequate prison service? If the prison service is ineffective, inefficient and not providing even the minimum requirement of any prison service it sets at nought the work of the Garda, the work we do in legislating to protect our citizens, the work of judges and the whole administration of justice up to that point. If every time a judge sentences a person another person goes free not because he has served his sentence but because there is no space for him, that undermines everything we do in terms of criminal justice.</P>
    <P>Suicides continue in Mountjoy.  We have a very high rate of prison suicide, twice that of Britain. Statistics indicate it is more frequent in the absence of separate remand facilities and when drug addicts are put into the general body of the prison population and there is no segregation.  It is important to stress that the Mountjoy Visiting Committee highlighted serious inadequacies in the provision of medical services to inmates in the prison.  These problems have been ongoing since <Col N="1097" /> 1992.  The matter was urgent in 1992 and 1993 and it remains urgent, yet the common contract with the IMO has not been thrashed out and concluded by the Department.  The Minister and her Department have neglected to deal with the burning issue of the inadequate medical service in a prison where the majority of prisoners are drug addicts with hepatitis C and serious psychological and medical problems.  The provision of a proper medical service in Mountjoy Prison has not been sorted out and all that is being provided for sick inmates is a sheep dip service.  The report of the Mountjoy Visiting Committee stated that one prison doctor saw up to 60 inmates in one hour.  This is a profanity given the massive amounts of taxpayers' money spent on the prison service.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for some degree of accountability for the invisible decision-making process which is the temporary release system.  This system began as a method of integrating persons into society, but it is now over-used by the State in order to create space in prisons.  It is an absolute scandal that, as we have been told by the prison chiefs under the new <i>glasnost</i>, 4,000 people a year or 50 people a day are released by the prison authorities just to make space in prisons.  Three settlements amounting to £73,000 have been made in cases involving injury to people by those who should be in prison and for whom the State has responsibility.  It is little wonder that no case has gone to court.  There is no annual report or record of the number of temporary releases and we have only been able to ascertain the figures by way of parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>Temporary release, which is known as &ldquo;shedding&rdquo; in the prison service, is an unaccountable, invisible decision-making process undertaken by prison authorities.  It is extraordinary that people who have been tried and convicted in public and sent to prison are secretly released back into society without any rehabilitation or supervision and are merely told &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice and other Government speakers will doubtless make two points: first, what we propose costs money and, second, the Minister for Justice has only been in office for two years and this problem was growing for a long time before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second point, it is 12 years since the report of the Whitaker committee of inquiry into the penal system was published.  At that time Dr. Whitaker and the people on the committee looked to the future in ascertaining what would happen to the penal system.  They examined the trends that were developing and what was happening on the ground.  I do not agree with all their conclusions but an interesting one was that, in 1995, two years ago, there would be a need for 4,000 prison spaces.  That was a very conservative estimate because, as we now know, a huge cohort of people &mdash; most crimes are committed by people between the ages of 15 and 25 &mdash; is in the age group where criminality and delinquency are <Col N="1098" /> at their maximum.  We also know there has been a massive growth in organised crime and a massive recrudescence of the drug problem which was also at a height in 1985.  As a result, the prison service is totally inadequate to deal with the crime problem.  We were warned in 1985 that 4,000 prison places would be needed unless corrective action was taken.</P>
    <P>The report deals with many other issues, including the manning and overstaffing problems in prisons referred to by Deputy O'Donnell.  It is illuminating to read the figures given by the Whitaker committee in its report published 12 years ago.  At paragraph 2.52 it states that the staff-prisoner ratio increased from 100:280 in 1987 to 100:160 in 1973 and increased further to 100:120 by May 1985.  It also states that this growth is not justified by the exigencies of the prison service and sets out at considerable length in a later section of the report what should be done about industrial relations problems.  The staff-prisoner ratio is now approximately 100:92 and there are significantly more prison officers in the prison system than there are prisoners.</P>
    <P>This remarkable transformation during the 26 years between 1970 and 1996 must be explained by some process.  Why could 100 prison officers look after 280 prisoners in 1970 but more than 100 prison officers are needed to look after 100 prisoners in 1996?  The answer is gross mismanagement, dereliction of duty and capitulation by the Department of Justice in relation to its obligation to control the cost of the prison service.  It is not a question of, and cannot be portrayed as such, the staff being pushed to the limit of endurance because in addition to the massive growth in the staff-prisoner ratio there has been an explosion in overtime, with some prison officers earning £900 a week in overtime and many officers earning between £20,000 and £30,000 a year in overtime in addition to their basic salaries. This has come about as a result of a process of mismanagement, capitulation and abdication of the management of the prison service by the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I accept that all this did not happen during the Minister's period in office.  As the Whitaker report shows, this problem has been growing for the past 26 years.  However, it is grotesque to think that it costs twice as much to accommodate a prisoner in an Irish cell, which sometimes holds four prisoners, as it does in an English cell and three times as much as it does in a New Zealand cell.  Why is our system such bad value for money?  Why has the cost of the prison service escalated by 50 per cent during the past five years?  The answer is that there has been no proper or strategic management of the prison service.</P>
    <P>Some people will ask where the Progressive Democrats Party proposes to get the money to build more prison space.  The money is there already and if we applied British, New Zealand or other international standards to our prison service and demanded parity in terms of cost and staffing implications we would have plenty money <Col N="1099" /> to run a decent prison service.  Instead we have an unholy shambles of a service.  As a barrister I have had the opportunity to see the process from beginning to end.  I have been in many of our prisons and have seen many people sentenced to them.  I have been on both sides, prosecuting and defending, in the criminal process.  I have seen judges imposing sentences.  I have sat in this House on many occasions and heard people decrying the Judiciary for not taking crime seriously, but I know the facts and I will now outline them.</P>
    <P>If one asks the Department of Justice, as I and many other Deputies have done, to give a rough figure of the percentage of prison sentences served by prisoners, it refuses to give it even though it could obtain that information if it wanted to.  The Department says it does not keep records in a way which would yield that information without undue trouble and expense.</P>
    <P>I will outline what is happening in Irish jails. On anecdotal information I am satisfied is correct, the average prisoner, excepting politically sensitive cases and sexual offenders, is serving approximately 15 per cent to 25 per cent of the jail term imposed by the Judiciary; one-fifth is a fair rule of thumb of the nominal sentence.  The Department of Justice knows that is happening in our prison service.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to somebody sentenced for a serious crime who was released within days of starting a three year sentence.  That was done by departmental officials or prison governors; there is a record somewhere of that decision.  Those releases happen day in and day out.  People are taken to the Governor's office and released to make space in the prison for somebody else.  A decision is made that a judge's conviction and sentence can be cancelled by a secretive process in which justice is effectively set at zero.  That is the penal system today.</P>
    <P>An enormous moral dilemma is posed for society when one visits Mountjoy and sees the circumstances in which prisoners are currently being housed.  During the early part of the Minister's period in office, Deputy O'Donnell and I participated in a debate on the Estimates in which the question of drugs in Mountjoy arose.  I used the phrase that Mountjoy was &ldquo;awash with drugs&rdquo; and received a haughty response from the Minister that was exaggerated language which I should not use.  I was amused when Deputy Eric Byrne, who had not heard the debate, came into the Chamber and used the same phrase, but there was no rebuke for him.  To use the phrase that Mountjoy is &ldquo;awash with drugs&rdquo; and to suggest that the majority of its prisoners are abusing drugs is not something I said irresponsibly; Governor Lonergan has admitted it.  We have found out from television reports that even when drug abuse occurs under the noses of prison officers, they feel helpless to intervene.</P>
    <P>If a young man goes into Mountjoy Prison drug free, which is rare, how can he survive a situation <Col N="1100" /> where he is in a cell with three other young men who are shooting up drugs?  Many prisoners in Mountjoy run up overdrafts to crime bosses of £5,000 and £7,000 and when they are released they must pay for the gear, as it is called, they consumed in prison.  I asked the Minister about that and she expressed the somewhat flowery view that everybody was strip-searched and internally searched going into Mountjoy.  In fairness to her she came back later that afternoon and said that was not correct information.</P>
    <P>I put the proposition to the Minister that day that if she were serious about curtailing the drug problem she should have urine tests carried out on prisoners in Mountjoy to determine the percentage that are on drugs.  Urine tests have been carried out on prisoners who have indicated they want to be drug free, but for the vast majority of prisoners the test is not carried out on a random basis because the Department of Justice does not want to know the figures.  Like the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, which found out in a survey that bonemeal is still being used in cattle feed, it did not want to know.  We had the grotesque announcement on radio by Governor Lonergan that prisoners in Mountjoy were so excited by participating in &ldquo;West Side Story&rdquo; rehearsals that some of them had gone off drugs for the duration of the rehearsals.</P>
    <P>Our prisons are not prisons, they are internment camps where people are suffering in overcrowded cells awash with drugs.  The Government is aware of that but has denied it.  The Minister said the prison was not awash with drugs but we hear the truth from prison chiefs.  The truth is terrible and it is a scandal, but not one which emerged during the Minister's two years in office. It is remarkable that for the first three-quarters of her period in office, she stonewalled on these matters.  Now, with an election looming, the Minister throws open the prison gates and lets the cameras in so that public opinion can say she is wonderful.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell used the term &ldquo;<i>glanost</i>&rdquo; in a charitable way.  The last person who tried <i>glasnost</i> suffered the same fate the Minister is about to suffer &mdash; a left wing Administration proving inadequate to the purpose.  <i>Glasnost</i> is about renewal and openness.  It is not simply saying &ldquo;there is nothing more I can do, in with the cameras and let the prison officers take the blame&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the question of cost.  We need more accommodation in the prison system.  We need to lease prison accommodation from those who would build it for us on a turnkey project basis.  We do not need to go through the debacle of Wheatfield where it took virtually a quarter of a century, from planning to completion, to build a single prison.  We do not need a slow planning process for modest proposals to increase the size of the prison service.</P>
    <P>We can have a modern prison system sufficient to accommodate prisoners sent to jail by the courts.  Because of the demographic bulge I referred to earlier, which is now passing through <Col N="1101" /> the critical 15 to 25 year period, it will soon be possible to retire out of commission the Victorian hellholes we now call our prison service.  If we take the right decisions and have prisons built by those who can do it at good value, and service them in an economical way, prisons like Mountjoy will no longer be the future of the prison service.  That requires the establishment of an independent prisons services agency.  It requires also a new commitment on the part of the public to ensuring that when judges send people to jail, they serve their allotted span.  Irish people are willing to have that done.  They are sick of the invisible tax of crime on their communities, the constant burglaries, muggings and beatings caused by a failed prisons system.  Young men being sent to jail do not believe they are being punished.  They have a spring in their step because they know the Minister, Deputy Owen, will release them when they have completed between 10 and 20 per cent of their prison sentences. God help the guards, the judges, the witnesses and the victims who see that spectacle.  It is a grave scandal of which this society must take cognisance.  That is why this Bill is so necessary.</P>

      <P>I read some of the Dáil debates from 1993 and 1994.  Less than one year after Deputy McDowell's party went out of Government he castigated Fianna Fáil for the revolving door system and overcrowding.  Deputy O'Donoghue should be cautious for fear there might be a possibility &mdash; I do not believe there is &mdash; of his party marrying the Progressive Democrats.  If his party has an opportunity to go into Government with the Progressive Democrats in the next century it should be very careful because the Progressive Democrats will turn on Fianna Fáil, as Deputy McDowell did in the past.</P>

All the opportunism from the other side of the House will not change that fact.  When we complete Committee Stage debates Deputy O'Donnell and others usually have the generosity to compliment the Government on the improvements it has made in the legislation, but when they come into these coloured debates they seem to forget that work is being done.</P>
      <P>The terms of Deputy O'Donnell's Bill, particularly given the extravagant claims made publicly about it, are a major disappointment.  Much of it is redundant in that it purports to confer powers on the Minister which already exist or which are not necessary to put on a statutory basis.  In so far as the measures contained in the Bill might allow for a new management structure they are superficial virtually to the point of meaninglessness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>For these and other reasons which I will outline, the Government has no choice but to oppose the Bill.</P>
      <P>Does anyone believe the way to tackle accommodation problems in our prisons is to insert a provision in a Bill allowing the Minister for Justice &ldquo;to erect, maintain and keep open such prisons as are reasonably necessary&rdquo;?  There is already a clear legislative basis to enable the provision of prisons and other custodial institutions. What is required is for the Government to devote the necessary resources to allow extra prison places to be provided and this is what the Government has done.  By the time our prison programme is complete, we will have spent £73 million on the provision of additional prison places which successive Governments should have been doing to ensure the bill would not be so high or the gaps so obvious and dangerous.</P>
      <P>Equally, does anyone believe the way to establish a new management structure for the prisons service is to declare that &ldquo;there may be established as a separate executive office a body known as the prison service&rdquo; without giving a definition of &ldquo;executive office&rdquo;?  The establishment of an independent prisons board or agency to run the prisons service, to which the Government is fully committed, would give rise to complex issues which essentially this Bill ignores. Those are only two examples of the types of approach taken in the Bill and, consequently, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that we are dealing with a sterile exercise in propaganda rather than a genuine attempt at legislative reform.  I regret having to say that because Deputy McDowell at least went to the trouble of examining Dr. Whitaker's report and made some substantive points.</P>
      <P>I never sought to pretend that the prison service is without difficult problems.  The record will show that I have been more open and frank about the problems in the prison service than any of my predecessors.  It is fair to say that, more than any of them, I have adopted a policy of openness.  For example, I authorised the unprecedented access of a television documentary team to film in Mountjoy last summer.  The results of that can be seen in the well made series, &ldquo;The Joy&rdquo;, which is running on RTE.  We are also in the course of an exercise which will allow the media access to all custodial institutions under my control.</P>
      <P>Let me explain why and when I decided to do that.  I wrote to newspaper editors last summer saying that we were receiving so many requests from individual journalists to visit our prisons that it was causing difficulties for internal management and that I was putting together a mechanism whereby there could be open days in prisons. When did any other Minister open the doors of the prison&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and allow taxpayers to see precisely what is going on so that they will know where their money is going and where more is needed?  There is no shame in that and I proudly say it was my initiative that set that policy in motion.  I know I left myself open to these programmes showing the warts of our prison service. Is it not better that it be seen rather than hiding what is going on, like Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, Deputy Ray Burke, Deputy Collins and some of my other predecessors did, despite the exhortations of officials in the Department of Justice? It is those who were politically responsible for the previous nine years that I particularly criticise for not doing what is now being done by this Government. At the start of the exercise, I authorised senior officials of the prisons division to brief the media fully and frankly on prison issues.  They were not sent out, as Deputy O'Donnell claimed on radio this morning, to say that the prison system is in chaos and they were not reported as having said that.</P>
      <P>I would like Deputy O'Donnell to make up her mind.  If I am seen photographed with the Garda or looking at drugs, which I did once, she criticises me.  She should save her lecturing for her leader.  Yesterday, her leader turned up unannounced at the door of Templemore with an entourage of cameras and media people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but she is upset now because I would not allow in any of the media.</P>
      <P>It does no service to anyone to exaggerate the real difficulties which the prison service faces.  It would be a pity if we failed to recognise in the course of a debate such as this that, day in day out, the prisons hold about 2,300 prisoners, providing an essential service for the protection of the community.  I am happy to pay tribute to the prison service management and staff.  They carry out an extremely difficult job on behalf of the community and deserve our support and not the kind of criticism which I have heard tonight from Deputies.  I want to mention the recent siege incident in Mountjoy and thank all those who helped bring it to a peaceful conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I strongly believe that the public are entitled to know what goes on in our prisons, that policy of openness would amount to very little by <Col N="1106" /> itself.  That is why I am pleased the record will show that I, together with my colleagues in Government, have taken a series of initiatives in relation to the prisons which will fundamentally and effectively address the difficulties which have been known for a number of years, something Deputy Michael McDowell was gracious enough to accept, but have been ignored by some previous Governments, including that in which Deputy O'Donnell's party participated.</P>
    <P>There are four main prison issues which I have given priority to since coming into office: the revolving door syndrome,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am about to come to that.  The Deputy should be patient.  This will ultimately bring about a much improved prison system appropriate to the needs of our community.  I invite any fair minded observer to contrast this record of substance with the type of &ldquo;magic wand&rdquo; approach evidenced in the Bill before this House.</P>
      <P>Much, understandably, is made of the revolving door.  Despite what Deputy O'Donnell might like to pretend, it is not a door of my making.  It was a door which was increasingly well oiled when her party was in Government.  When I became Minister for Justice, the lack of adequate prison accommodation was clearly the major problem facing the prison system, if not the criminal justice system as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The record of this Government will show that we have launched upon the greatest prison building programme since the foundation of the State involving the provision of around 800 extra places.  The Bill before the House refers in section 6 to an assessment to be made of the likely need for prison and custodial accommodation for three year periods.  However, when the Castlerea project was postponed, <Col N="1107" /> allowing for a thorough review of accommodation requirements&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It was cancelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not cancelled.  The Deputy should stop making up fairy tales.  He is an awful idiot.  Every time I raise this issue in the Dáil, he says it was cancelled.  He should look at the diggers on the site and visit the prisoners in the prison. If he cannot do that, he should be quiet.  He is making me sick with his old nonsense. I was in Kerry last week and heard some of the airy-fairy stuff Deputy O'Donoghue has been saying to the people there.  The first part of Castlerea prison is open and not one single prisoner would be there if I had continued with the Fianna Fáil proposal. The Deputy should find a new line.</P>
      <P>When the Castlerea project was postponed allowing for a thorough review of how best to accommodate and provide accommodation, this was roundly condemned, yet Deputy O'Donnell said in her Bill that there must be three years to plan prison places, etc.  She should make up her mind and be consistent in her projects.</P>
      <P>Including a provision in this Bill allowing for the building of prisons, as section 5 purports to do, would not achieve one extra place.  The thinking behind the Progressive Democrats approach to prisons seems to be that an improved prison system with additional prison accommodation can be achieved by some sort of legislative declaration without spending a single shilling.  One just says one will do it and it happens.  It is worth contrasting that empty legislative provision with what is being achieved in reality through the Government's accelerated programme for the provision of additional prison accommodation.</P>
      <P>Thirty extra places were provided in St. Patrick's Institution in February 1996, 25 extra places have been provided in the special unit at Castlerea and 125 extra places will be provided by the end of this year.  The D Wing at Limerick Prison will provide 55 extra places next October. The Curragh Prison is holding up to 68 prisoners and was brought into use at the end of last year. We are about to go to tender for the new women's prison with 60 places and the new remand centre for 400 at Wheatfield.</P>
      <P>That paragraph could not have appeared in any speech by previous Ministers in the last nine years because no new prison places were provided since the last Fine Gael-Labour Government in 1986 built and planned Wheatfield Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Collins made that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Collins did not.  The decision was taken in 1986 and all the work was ready when Deputy Collins came in and gathered the kudos.  I congratulate all involved in this accelerated programme, especially the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy <Col N="1108" /> Coveney.  I am satisfied that as much progress is being made as is humanly possible and on the basis of professional advice available to me.  I reject suggestions from Deputies opposite that there are cheaper or quicker ways of providing appropriate additional prison accommodation.</P>
      <P>We are not building hotel bedrooms, we are building secure prison places for dangerous prisoners who will, at the drop of a hat, break out of a prison if it is not secure.  Deputy O'Donnell is right to raise the issue of open prisons but she appears to suggest that we should cast aside our security advice and get somebody who is used to building hotels and so forth.  The Wheatfield extension of 400 prison places is being built in the way Deputy O'Donnell previously suggested, although I did not need that suggestion.  We have invited the country's most important building contractors to tender for the project and they have done the design work to accelerate the process.  Providing these extra places has placed a heavy burden on the Exchequer but the Government believes it is right to give priority to the programme.</P>
      <P>Costs in the Prisons Service are undoubtedly high and would be a cause of concern for any Minister for Justice.  However, it is not good enough for Opposition Deputies to simply assert they will reduce those costs by a third, or whatever other figure they pluck out of the air, without being specific as to how this is to be done.  I read the transcript of Deputy O'Donnell's interview on the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; radio programme this morning.  Every time Áine Lawlor tried to pin the Deputy down on where she would make the savings the Deputy went on to talk about something else, such as management, without offering concrete examples.  Is she arguing that the levels of security, for example, are too high?  If that is the case, it seems difficult to reconcile that with her tendency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to issue immediate public statements complaining about inadequate security when prisoners have escaped from escorts. Does she propose to reduce expenditure by reducing staff levels through changes in regimes, changes which could result in a deterioration in conditions for prisoners, the conditions about which Deputy McDowell wept bitter tears today?</P>

      <P>If that is the case, how would she reconcile that approach with the statements she makes about prison conditions when prisoners, regrettably, take their own lives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting there could not be further efficiencies in the operation of our prisons, but sweeping, unsupported statements by the Deputy are no help to that cause.  In this context, it is <Col N="1109" /> right to put on record that the comments the Deputy made about alleged mismanagement of the prisons by the Department of Justice are deeply unfair to the officials who have been involved for years in the administration of prisons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is responsible then?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy were to ask any of my predecessors, they would agree that the people involved have performed a difficult role with distinction and absolute commitment to the improvement of the Prisons Service.  They are not blind to the difficulties either&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is up to Government to give them the necessary resources.  This Government is giving them the resources.  In the next three years £135 million will be spent in our prisons on building and maintenance alone.  That is the type of commitment that is necessary, not airy fairy, magic wand solutions.</P>
      <P>Bland comparisons of staffing ratios between one jurisdiction and another, without having regard to matters such as the number and types of prisons involved and the nature of prison regimes, are clearly fraught with difficulty.  Rather than taking the inadequate approach which the Deputy has to this issue, the question of achieving greater efficiencies in the Prisons Service must be approached in a strategic way which acknowledges the complex realities.</P>
      <P>Last autumn, I established a prisons operating costs review group to review the operating costs of the Prisons Service in light of the following: the requirements of safe custody, requirements of the regimes in prisons, the variable and unpredictable nature of demands on the service, particularly court and hospital escorts, the need to optimise efficiency and professionalism of prison staff, the need for cost effectiveness, and to make recommendations.  The group is chaired by Mr. Declan Brennan, a former Secretary of the Department of Education and an employers' representative in the Labour Court.  In addition, there are varied and diverse experiences represented in the group.  The wide cross section of experience should provide a unique opportunity for the formulation of a strategy to maximise the return which the taxpayer gets from the Prisons Service.  I am particularly pleased that both staff and management from the Prisons Service are working with representatives from the wider public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to have an interim report from the group by the end of this month and I make no apologies for the fact that, unlike Deputy O'Donnell, I do not pretend to have instant solutions to the issues involved.  It is appropriate to call on a wide range of expertise to assist me in this process, <Col N="1110" /> which will fundamentally shape the future of our prison system.  I will probably be accused of saying I do not know enough about the prison system, although I probably know more than anybody else in this House apart from the staff and officials who accompany me.  However, I am big enough to admit that I have not been working in the system for the same number of years as the staff, and I am willing to take advice from experts who know about the system.  If the Opposition Deputies ever take office in Government I hope they will be man and woman enough also to take advice from experts.</P>
    <P>The implementation as quickly as possible of the Government's commitment to the establishment of an independent prisons board or agency will also fundamentally shape the future of our prison system.  The Bill's proposals in this regard are clearly inadequate.  Section 10 does not even spell out how the separate executive office is to work.  The approach taken by the Bill fails to address a series of questions.  What will be the legal status of the proposed agency?  Will it be able to sue or be sued?  What will be the status of the staff of the Prisons Service?  Will they remain civil servants?  What role will the service have in decisions about temporary releases?  It is just mentioned in the Bill but there is no provision for how it will work.  What role will the service have in decisions on transfers of prisoners between institutions?</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas is being asked to buy a pig in a poke as the legislation does not address these and other fundamental issues.  It is useless to say some of these matters could be dealt with under section 16 which purports to repeal the legislation specified in the First Schedule, subject to the right of the Minister to set the date of the repeal taking place and to make regulations governing any matters contained in those Acts.  The power to make regulations contained in section 16 is so wide ranging and unspecific that I doubt it would be permissible under the rules governing delegated legislation.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to a new management structure for the Prisons Service.  That decision does no disservice to anybody who is involved in prisons management.  It simply recognises, in the context of developments in thinking in relation to public service management, that new structures of management would be appropriate for the service.  Obviously, complex issues arise and that is why the Government decided to establish an independent board and to set up an expert group composed of people from outside and inside the public service to work out the detailed aspects of the proposed new service.  I met the distinguished chairman of the group, Mr. Dan McAuley, recently and he informed me that the group had made considerable progress on its work and it is hoped its report will be completed by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>There will be no delay in the Government's consideration of the report and we will make any necessary arrangements regarding the establishment <Col N="1111" /> of a new prisons agency, including bringing forward the legislation as a matter of priority. Members will agree that this is a measured, sensible and effective approach in contrast with what is contained in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I will now discuss the drugs problem in prisons because it is a matter of grave concern.  I took a number of steps, during my first year in office, to try to stamp out drugs in our prisons.  Using measures with minimal cost effects, I have managed to reduce the problem and to turn some of our prisons into drug free zones.  Everybody laughed at the net that was put over the prison yard in Cork.  However, the prison governor now tells me that Cork prison is virtually drug free. Better cameras and search rooms have been installed in Mountjoy but a great deal more must be done.  More can be done.  I do not throw up my hands in despair and say we must abandon prisoners who are on drugs.  If they are on drugs when they enter prison we must try to get them off drugs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we have better relations with the health boards.  There is no point in the Prisons Service trying to get young people off drugs when they are in prison through the training unit, which is a drug free unit, and the medical care unit, which is a detoxification unit, and the new methadone treatment service if they return to the same habits when they leave prison.  I am determined to do more in this area.  One of the most serious issues which I discussed with the prison officers recently is the problem of syringes. They are terrifying to people who must search for them.  They fear they will be pricked by one of them.  The new law on non-fatal offences against the person will tackle that issue both inside and outside prisons.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell took a minute of my time so I will finish what I wish to say. Section 6 of the Bill gives the Minister power to assess the needs of prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 provides that no person under the age of 18 shall be detained.  A number of the provisions in the Bill have not been refreshed or rendered more modern than the provisions of last year's Bill.  If Deputy O'Donnell had done so, she would not have included this section.  It is already included in section 133 of the Children Bill and a number of other issues are also covered in that Bill.  Others are covered in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the Criminal Law Bill, both of which are before the Houses of the Oireachtas at present.  There are proposals in the Bill which in some cases are redundant and in others ineffective.  In outlining what the Government has delivered, I hope the Opposition will be a little more generous and recognise that the public do not want to see us arguing across <Col N="1112" /> the House about what they will do better than us and so on.  They want us to come together and find realistic, effective solutions to the problems of crime, marginalisation and deprivation in society.  I am sorry to tell Deputy O'Donnell that I do not commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I express the fervent hope that my performance tonight will live up to the Minister's billing.  When the epitaph of the rainbow coalition is written &mdash; the bewitching hour approaches &mdash;&ldquo;By a Lonely Prison Wall&rdquo; will go up in lights with &ldquo;Ballad of Reading Gaol&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Auld Triangle&rdquo;.  There was a tide in the affairs of the Government which, if taken at the flood, may have rescued it from annihilation.  As it drifts towards its ineluctable fate with the electorate, the members of the rainbow coalition Government must rue the day they cancelled the outgoing Administration's prison building programme. Their fate was sealed on the day the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, cancelled planned prisons at Castlerea and Mountjoy, which had been provided for by Fianna Fáil in its published Estimates prior to leaving office.  The Minister for Justice was not present when that fateful decision was made, nonetheless she subsequently showed she was treated with the political contempt she deserved when she supported a decision about which she was not even informed. Having taken the sup she proceeded to scatter to the four winds Fine Gael's reputation as the party of law and order and embraced her leftist comrades in a political death dance which effectively sealed her own fate.</P>
      <P>The backdrop was painted and the scene was set for 1995 to become the year of the criminal. Larcenies, robberies, burglaries and savage attacks on the elderly were reported <i>ad nauseam</i> in the print and electronic media.  When Fianna Fáil said that things were going out of control, we were accused of scaremongering.  When we pointed out that our criminal laws were inadequate to deal with a heightening crisis, we were dismissed with contempt by the rainbow coalition Government.  When we said that insidious forces were at work in the undergrowth of Irish life, the Minister for Justice turned a blind eye.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a direct line between the rainbow coalition's regressive reasoning in 1995 and 1996 and the current crime and prisons crisis.  There was a gradual erosion of the ideal of crime and punishment.  The revolving prison door became an open prison door.  The right of an individual to his or her safety and the safety of his or her property was no longer a fundamental or sacred right.  The obligation of Government to protect people's lives and property was no longer a superior obligation.  The message trickled quickly down the line to the criminal community that a serious offence would at best go unpunished and at worst half punished.  Criminals became more daring and when we warned that contract killings were cogent evidence that those involved in organised crime considered themselves to be <Col N="1113" /> untouchable, we were scorned and laughed at. The Government which had flailed around in the wake of the Brinks-Allied raid was lost in the maze of its disparate philosophy.</P>
    <P>We campaigned for a bail referendum throughout 1995.  Fine Gael agreed with us but voted against us.  The Tánaiste bowed deferentially to his so-called civil libertarian wing and said &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The North Korean connection, as always in matters of this kind, saw no problem, but there was a problem; there was a crisis.  Increasingly, women had become the subject of attacks, hardened criminals were escaping from custody, savage attacks on the elderly living in remote rural areas became the order of the day, drug related crime started to go through the roof, murders became an increasing feature of everyday life and prisoners were released on the sole criterion that there was no place to keep them.  In one year, in excess of 1,300 prisoners had breached the conditions of their temporary release.  Clearly they had got the message, the rainbow coalition did not want them, and they knew when they were not wanted.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, members of an illegal organisation gunned down a member of the Garda Síochána in Adare, County Limerick.  This was quickly followed by the murder of a young investigative journalist and mother in her car in the middle of the day.  There is not a democracy on earth which would not be abhorred that this could happen within its jurisdiction.  The people were rightly incredulous that it could happen in a relatively small community where everybody had felt reasonably safe up to a couple of years earlier. Even then the rainbow coalition was like a cork at sea.  Bereft of philosophy, ideology or definite direction, the sages of the rainbow coalition ignored the wailing of the Minister for Justice and accepted Fianna Fáil's Proceeds of Crime Bill, 1996.  It is a matter of public record that this legislation was the central plank of the Government's response to organised crime.</P>

      <P>Those cynical enough to remember the Tánaiste's visit to the hangar at Dublin Airport before the 1992 general election will not be rocked off their armchairs by the sight of the Minister for Finance recently seeking to claim this Fianna Fáil initiative as the crowning glory of the rainbow coalition's fight against crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was believed by many, following its barren response to organised crime, that the Government had learnt a salutary lesson and that there would be no more legislative droughts or bungling in the Department of Justice, there would be no more lost extradition warrants and there would be a level of accountability at last. Unfortunately, the same lethargy and gross negligence which had been the hallmark of the Minister, Deputy Owen's reign was about to reach its apex.  Few could credit that a Minister for Justice, <Col N="1114" /> having proposed that a judge of the Special Criminal Court be delisted on 1 August 1996, would have failed to enforce that decision until November 1996.  Excuses were tossed around like snuff at a wake.  Letters were not received, read, replied to, seen or heard of.  Nobody knew anything. It was like the day the county council shovel was stolen &mdash; when nobody was unduly concerned the ganger said that what is everybody's business is nobody's business.  It would have been a pantomime if it had not been such a tragedy.</P>
    <P>Once again the Minister for Justice had pulled open the curtain and her latest drama was enthralling the lawyers of Ireland.  The Taoiseach, deciding to get in on the act, came into the House and put his foot in his mouth.  He said that Deputy Owen was the most successful Minister for Justice in the history of the State.  The people gazed ruefully at their television sets, shook their heads and proclaimed aloud that they could not take much more of this kind of success.  Meanwhile the Minister for Justice, under severe Opposition pressure, had decided to find company for the lonely prison wall at Castlerea.  Too little too late, the soothsayers said, but the <i>femme fatale</i> of the rainbow coalition could be heard saying &ldquo;800 more places and soon&rdquo;.  Old people used to say &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;, those who have been waiting for the Minister, Deputy Owen to deliver say &ldquo;the cheque is in the post&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, back on the streets, crime continued unabated.  Hardened criminals were not frightened off by the bail referendum which was forced on the Government.  There was no legislation to give effect to it and they knew that, even if it was belatedly held, they would not be adversely affected by it.  They knew there was no prison place for them.  When the Government announced it was taking half of the functions of the Department away from the Minister, Deputy Owen, by setting up an independent courts commission and an independent prisons board, everybody heaved a collective sigh of relief, even if they knew it was a face-saving exercise initiated by the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>When the siege occurred at Mountjoy we heard the familiar anthem from at least some Labour Deputies that the rights of convicted criminals should be on the same plateau as the rights of victims.  Lately there have been leaks to the effect that things are not as bad as they really are and that crime figures are falling.  Crime figures are possibly falling because the official record does not show the truth anymore.  There are people in this country, and I have met many of them, who do not bother to report that items are stolen from their cars or, in some instances, that their cars are stolen.  At a time when people are seeking an adequate response to a problem which is scourging Irish society, the harsh ironic reality is that the Rainbow Coalition Government is still looking for a motive for the Brinks Allied robbery.</P>
    <P>The Government recently decided to open the prison system to public scrutiny.  It revealed what we already knew that the system was in chaos. <Col N="1115" /> The Government appears to be of the opinion that opening the gates will gain them some sympathy from the public.  However, the public know that the problem has been allowed to escalate out of control.  They know who cancelled the prison building programme and why.  There is no reason the public should sympathise with the Rainbow Coalition Government on its self-inflicted wounds.</P>
    <P>There are complicated issues to be addressed in the context of the Progressive Democrats Bill and certain questions must be addressed in drawing up structures for prison administration.  How will or can a new body improve the existing regime?  What, if any, powers and means will a new prison body have at its disposal to eliminate overcrowding?  What, if any, concrete ways will be open to a new body to enable it to improve the morale, working conditions and performance of prison staff?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Will a new prison body be able to improve conditions in a cost effective way?  What significant powers and responsibilities relating to prisons will be retained by the Minister for Justice and will the responsibility of the Minister legally be affected in any way by the proposed changes?  These are fundamental questions about the efficacy and rationale of the new proposals but they strike at the heart of the relationship between the Department of Justice and the prison system.  However, they are only a fraction of the wider issues raised by the current crisis in the Prisons Service.</P>
      <P>One of the larger issues at play here is a complete restatement of the resolve and definition of the Rainbow Coalition in regard to its own identity in the cycle of justice administration.  The message has filtered down through every possible medium to the criminal and the potential criminal &mdash; simply and starkly, this Government is soft on crime.  It has no sense of individual or collective responsibility in regard to the current crisis.  It seems to have no shame.  It has attacked crime with the resolve of a retired J-cloth.  They have lain in wait for serious crime by crouching behind pillars of candy floss clutching handfuls of cotton wool.  The Rainbow Coalition cares more about protecting themselves and what is theirs than about protecting old people in rural areas from violent attack.  They are a mismatched quilt of diametrically opposed ideologies held together by a common thread of lust for power at all costs.</P>

      <P>There are a number of obvious steps which could be taken by the Government if it was interested, but it is more interested in laying poison, caring little as to who might or might not consume it irrespective of their guilt or innocence, once it is not one of them.  That has been the way of all oligarchies but this oligarchy is soon to learn that it is subject to democracy.  The head of this oligarchy, Deputy Bruton, will also learn that people expect him as Taoiseach to uphold the constitutional right to due process and the rule of law.</P>
      <P>In any event, Fianna Fáil was the first to advocate a separate remand prison in recent times&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a remand centre which will be constructed as soon as Fianna Fail return to Government.  While a remand prison remains a fundamental necessity, interim methods could be employed while one is being built.  Of course, that would require a little innovation and imagination and would probably be too much to expect. The housing of even a small number of remand prisoners in a secure temporary prison facility on a priority basis, depending on the existence of previous convictions, would at least show some degree of attention to the very real problem posed by the lack of a remand prison.</P>
      <P>The question of prison suicides is another area which must be addressed.  Why do we have one of the highest statistical incidence of prison suicides? Why is it that the relationship between inmates and prison staff is not a priority for the current Administration?  This relationship and its regulation are surely of fundamental importance.</P>
      <P>The drug problem in Mountjoy Prison is out of control.  The staple diet for 65 per cent of the male population there would appear to be drugs. How can a Government which is soft on hard drugs in the world outside prison be expected to recognise drugs as a problem within that system? Conversely, how can a Government which allows drugs to be rampant in a State institution be expected to tackle drugs on the streets?  The failure of the Government to tackle the drugs problem in Mountjoy Prison has led to a situation where the lives of prison officers and prisoners are now at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can an unarmed prison officer be expected to tackle a prisoner who is wielding a syringe which may result in the infection of the prison officer with AIDS?  The frightening statistic from the visiting committee for Mountjoy Prison is that up to 35 per cent of the inmates are intravenous drug users.  Staff members have even commented that their opinion is that, if drugs <Col N="1117" /> were totally eradicated from the prison, the tension level would inevitably lead to the injury of prison officers.  That does not mean we should accept the present situation.  A responsible and co-ordinated plan to make prisons drug-free should be implemented.  It will not be done by this Government.  It will be done by Fianna Fáil in Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed establishment of a prison service and the creation of a post of inspector of prisons under this legislation.  It is a development which Fianna Fáil has put forward on numerous occasions.  It is rightly important that an inspector would have the powers to, for example, interview prisoners, hear their grievances on appeal, examine prison conditions, hold inquiries, and recommend reforms.  There is a strong likelihood that, had the present Administration established an effective inspector of prisons, the shocking recent siege at Mountjoy Prison could well have been prevented or, at the very least, diffused much earlier.  That would have been too much to hope for.</P>
    <P>One slight concern which I have about the two new positions of director of the prison services and inspector of prisons is that it is unclear from the Bill what relationship these posts are expected to have with each other.  The creation of a single post of inspector of prisons would perhaps have avoided any possible conflict of overlap on the roles of both.  It would also clarify the position publicly as to who was ultimately responsible for the prison system on a day to day basis.</P>
    <P>The Irish Commission for Justice and Peace made a very worthwhile assessment of the proposal to establish a prisons body in their submission in January of this year.  They rightly point out that this decision has been taken almost as a knee-jerk reaction in the aftermath of the Judge Dominic Lynch fiasco and the bail referendum. The need for consultation and the consideration of the wider issues is heightened by the very real implications of this Bill for other bodies.  The Minister's Dáil reply on 21 November last included almost incidentally the information that the probation and welfare services would be brought under the new body.  There must be an extremely strong argument for bringing this service under the new courts commission.  It would certainly appear to be more appropriate.  Also, in her reply of 21 November last, the Minister indicated that a group had been established by the Government to review and report on all aspects of the proposed prison's body.  This review group was mandated to complete its task and submit its findings to the Government by the end of last month &mdash; January 1997.</P>
    <P>Given the extremely tight deadline afforded to the review group, it is not surprising to report that there has been slippage with regard to the submission of a final report to the Government. Hopefully, this delay will turn out to be positive and will augur well for a considered and comprehensive report.  At least the review group has not been poked and pressed into providing a kneejerk <Col N="1118" /> response to complement the never-ending knee-jerk reactions of the Rainbow Administration. On this side of the House, we await the publication of the group report with great interest.</P>
    <P>The prison system is not, as much as this Administration would have us believe, some inconsequential, irrelevant, insignificant or immaterial arm of the State.  The prison system is one of the rocks upon which the Irish criminal justice system rests.  A shaky foundation in the prison system reverberates rapidly throughout the criminal justice system and seeps quickly and lethally into all sections of Irish society.  A Government which does not ensure that the prison system is, in all its manifestations, adequate to serve the society in which it is established, is guilty of the most basic dereliction of duty.  In this respect, the Rainbow Coalition has dismally failed the Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past two years, the tax treatment of trade-ins as applicable to finance leases has been under question by the Revenue authorities who were, and I believe still are, unsure how to apply the tax treatment to those trade-ins.  Two years ago many accountants and tax advisers followed the vibes coming from the Revenue, but some did not.  The result following the briefing published in December 1996 means that clients of those who did not are now liable to tax retrospectively.  In the farming community most of the work is being done by agricultural contractors whose machinery normally needs replacing every four years.  The result of this change in the treatment of trade-ins is that those agricultural contractors will find themselves with large tax bills for which they had not been prepared. This will affect their cash flow position enormously and many are likely to go out of business.</P>
      <P>It will not only affect those who are purchasing but also those who are selling machinery.  From discussions in recent weeks with many of those involved, I am aware that sales in January were down by at least 80 per cent, an enormous figure. Inevitably, this will mean job losses and that unsafe machinery will be on the roads and in fields.</P>
      <P>In addition to agricultural contractors and other purchasers of farm machinery, hauliers carrying produce to the Continent have been hit by this measure.  Continental countries do not allow tractor units of five years or more on their roads.  This sector will be affected by the change in Revenue practice.  Leasing as we have known it is finished if we follow what was published in December 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> A further tax briefing document is coming from the Revenue in February which will bring forward more amendments.  That shows that the treatment of this matter is not definite in the minds of Revenue.  We should revert to what has been the practice.  Those leasing should be allowed to roll over the trade-in value and when at the final cessation of business the liability should be taxed.  If that is not to be followed, the whole area of capital allowances should be looked at.</P>
    <P>The idea of allowing a seven year write off period for farm machinery and tractor units for haulage companies is unrealistic.  A more realistic write-off time should be allowed if we are to have safe machinery in the agriculture and haulage sectors. Otherwise people will not be able to afford safe machinery and equipment capable of doing the necessary work.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that this area will be finally decided upon.  Up to April 1997 the system that has been in operation should be accepted by the Revenue Commissioners and by that date an agreed system of dealing with trade-ins should have been decided.  I understand discussions are going on between all the interested bodies and an agreed procedure should have been arrived at by that stage.  However until then, the system that has been in operation should be accepted by Revenue.  I request the Minister of State to contact the Minister for Finance to have this matter clarified by the Revenue Commissioners immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  With his background in accountancy, I understand his interest in this complex item relating to the detailed accounting and tax treatment of leases.  In issue 24 of <i>Tax Briefing</i> issued in December 1996, the Revenue Commissioners clarified the correct tax treatment that should apply to finance leases of assets used for the purposes of a business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the publication of the article, the Revenue Commissioners met with representatives of the Irish Farmers' Association, the Road Hauliers' Association and the Irish Agricultural Contractors' Association.  At the meeting it was represented to Revenue that many users of assets entered into transactions involving the trade-in of an asset against a replacement leased asset on the understanding that a deduction could be taken immediately for the trade-in value of the asset. Where the old asset had been leased, this deduction would have been netted off against the rebate of rentals.  Where capital allowances had been granted in respect of the old asset, the deduction would have been used to cover any balancing charge arising.  In such circumstances, the user did not receive the rebate of rentals/proceeds of sale into his hands.  Some users made up-front cash payments, which may <Col N="1120" /> have derived from the private sale of an asset on which a balancing charge arose and which were dealt with similarly.</P>
    <P>As a result of the representations made and to avoid causing hardships to users who may have entered into such leases on a misapprehension as to the correct treatment, Revenue has agreed that up-front payments under leases entered into prior to 6 April 1996 may be deducted in the year in which the payment was made.  Accordingly, where a leased asset was traded-in prior to 6 April 1996, the rebate of rentals, which is chargeable in the year of receipt, may be netted off against the up-front payment for the replacement asset, i.e., the value of the trade-in.</P>
    <P>Full details of the change, together with clarification of a number of other issues arising from the article in issue 24 will be carried in the next issue of Revenue's <i>Tax Briefing</i>.  The 6 April 1996 deadline was chosen because Revenue had previously published guidelines in December 1995 which set out the correct treatment of rebates of leasing charges and up-front payments of leasing charges.  A further period, to 6 April, was allowed to enable details of the changes to be communicated by practitioners to clients.</P>

      <P>It says something about the heavy handed control by the Department of Education, that Galway City Vocational Education Committee is unable to spend £2,800 on essential alterations to a special toilet for people confined to wheelchairs without having the Department's approval for spending this small amount of money.  The special toilet provided some years ago for people confined to a wheelchair is not suitable for persons with muscular dystrophy.  As a result the pupil in question has to travel almost 200 yards in the open air to the recreation hall to go to the toilet.  This is a source of embarrassment for the pupil in question and causes great inconvenience. Other aspects, which I do not want to go into here, are also very embarrassing for him.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Department has not yet decided whether to approve the grant.  As a result the board of management is unable to proceed with the alterations.  This does not say much for the caring attitude of the Government.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to take whatever steps are necessary &mdash; I hope the grant is winging its way to Galway &mdash; to ensure the work is undertaken. Five months is too long to wait.  The lack of concern and a caring attitude on the part of the Department and its disinterest in the matter display the wrong image.

      <P>In 1994 the Department approved the provision of toilet facilities at the college.  These works have been completed at a cost of approximately £8,000.

This application encompasses both alterations to existing facilities and the provision of specialist equipment.  The project is being considered by departmental officials.  As with all applications, certain technical evaluations and public procurement procedures must be adhered to.  The project will, however, be examined expeditiously and a decision conveyed to the City of Galway Vocational Education Committee as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The 1997 post-primary school building programme was announced last week when the substantial sum of £30 million was mentioned. By common consent, De La Salle College, Dundalk, had a most compelling case for inclusion of its extension.  The college accommodation is causing appalling problems for both teachers and students.  I cannot understand why the extension has not been included in this year's school building programme.</P>
      <P>I contrast the treatment of the De La Salle College project with a project in County Meath.  The Taoiseach said today on local radio that the most up-to-date facilities will be provided at the school in question.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider the decision not to include De La Salle College in this year's school building programme.  There is unbelievable pressure on space and general accommodation. The teachers, parents and students have been very patient.

      <P>I thank my colleague for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I concur with everything he said.  There is all-party consensus in the constituency in relation to this college.  Each Deputy has put his shoulder to the wheel.  I regret that the Government Deputies were not able to convince the Minister of the merits of the case.  As the project proceeded through the various stages, it was made clear to the school authorities that the final stage, the production of finance, was the most important.</P>
      <P>The teaching staff, parents and pupils have been let down.  They had a compelling case.  In the not too distant past a lawnmower shed had to be renovated to accommodate a class.  It has been suggested that another classroom situated in the middle of the building without proper ventilation presents both a fire and health hazard.</P>
      <P>This morning on LMFM the Taoiseach eulogised about the fact that in the past three weeks £46 million has been produced out of the hat for various projects in County Meath.  The people of County Louth who were listening must have been envious of his efforts on behalf of his own constituency.  He appears to be going out of his way to portray himself as the saviour of his county.  I do not know if previous Taoisigh acted in the same way.  There are schools not too far away, however, whose accommodation requirements need to be catered for urgently.  It ill-behoves the Taoiseach to place so much emphasis on his own county.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline the position regarding the proposed extension at De La Salle College, Dundalk.  I wish to outline the background to this project.</P>
      <P>De La Salle College, Dundalk, is a post-primary school with an enrolment in the 1996-97 school year of 687 boys and ten girls.  Accommodation at the school consists mainly of a traditional building with a number of prefabs.</P>
      <P>Following a visit by officials from the planning and building unit of the Department to assess accommodation needs it was agreed to undertake a fundamental examination of future curricular policy for the school.  An educational work sheet was completed by the school principal in consultation with the senior inspector from the building unit and a schedule of residual accommodation was drawn up by the Department and approved by the school.  The school was then given approval to appoint a design team for the project. At the request of the school authority, the schedule of residual accommodation was amended and approved in June 1994.  Subsequently a planning briefing meeting was held in the Department and a design submission was forwarded to the Department in late 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> Following a meeting between the school principal, his architect and members of the Department's building unit, it was agreed to resubmit plans to incorporate the agreed changes to the proposed extension.  Further revisions were necessary to fully incorporate the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Regulations, Statutory Instrument 138 of 1995.  The proposed extension comprises an area of 1,094 square metres and includes such specialist rooms as a language laboratory and a science laboratory.</P>
    <P>This project has continued to progress through the various stages of the design team procedures at a satisfactory rate and two weeks ago the Department issued a letter to the school authority in relation to the stage 5 &mdash; bill of quantities submission.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise a matter of importance not only for the animal world but for the human population &mdash; the incorporation of meat and bonemeal in animal feedstuffs.  For the past 12 months the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, has told everyone he had tightened up the regulations and he could give assurances that meat and bonemeal had been excluded from animal feed thereby reducing the risk of BSE contamination in our livestock herd.</P>
      <P>Last week I tabled a question on this matter and was told on Wednesday, 5 February, that the Department had found 76 positive samples since the beginning of 1996 and 39 of them were being further investigated.  On the following day, Thursday, 6 February, I was told in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 81 that there were 58 positive samples.  I do not know how that discrepancy arose.</P>
      <P>From January to December 1996 nine samples were found in mills in County Cork.  This is a serious matter.  The Minister sought to suggest that his predecessors had not policed this area properly but he had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> This week's <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> states:</P>
    <P>We have had several official announcements about the tightening up of the regulations governing the production of meat and bone meal and its use.  We had assumed that mills allowed use meat and bone meal were not allowed manufacture compounds intended for bovine use.  It now seems that our assumptions were based on nothing more than cosy but misleading assurances.</P>
    <P>The report also stated:</P>
    <P>Those in responsible positions talk about the difficulty of distinguishing fragments of bone from chickens to those of mammalian origin. We have heard no reputable scientist repeat such implausible excuses.</P>
    <P>The IFA yesterday issued a statement by Mr. Michael Slattery, chairman of the IFA's national animal feedstuffs committee, which referred to the fact that Minister Yates was recently forced to reveal in the Dáil that meat and bonemeal of mammalian-avian origin was found in 58 samples of ruminant feed on compounders' premises in 17 counties during 1996.  He added that the behaviour of compounders in including meat and bonemeal in livestock feed was highly irresponsible and is only exceeded by the failure of the regulatory authorities in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to stop the practice.  He said he was appalled by the fact that there were repeated breaches of the regulations and no apparent action was taken by the Department.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State give an assurance to the House that the practice of adding meat and bonemeal in animal feedstuffs will be stopped and that we can be assured there will be no recycling of contaminated feedstuffs, which the scientists tell us lead to the spread of BSE?  That is the bottom line.  If those regulations are breached, are there likely to be prosecutions?</P>
    <P>We have a problem securing markets in the European Union and third countries.  There has been a severe fall in the morale of the farming community, particularly the beef community. They deserve an assurance that this practice will be stopped.  I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply to this matter.  I hope he can give an assurance on this so that consumers can be confident that the feed Irish livestock eat is safe and contains no recycled meat and bonemeal of any kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to clarify the position regarding the results of the Department's controls on animal feeds on sale in Ireland.  As the Deputy will be aware, the ban on the incorporation of meat and bonemeal derived from the carcase of any ruminant animal into any animal feed intended for feeding to ruminant animals was introduced with effect from August 1990.  This ban was introduced in Ireland well before most other EU countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sampling of ruminant feeds since the introduction <Col N="1125" /> of this ban has revealed that some cross-contamination of ruminant diets has occurred, particularly in those mills where both ruminant and non-ruminant diets were produced.  Accordingly, the Minister introduced an order with effect from October last which, in effect, restricted the use of meat and bonemeal to those mills which produced non-ruminant diets only.  The rigorous enforcement of the provisions of this order has now effectively ended the problems of cross-contamination which were occurring prior to its entry into force.</P>
    <P>In no case has the Department found any evidence of deliberate inclusion of meat and bonemeal in ruminant diet by a compounder since the entry into force of the feed ban in 1990.</P>
    <P>However, there is a remaining control problem which the Minister will be resolving by means of a further order to be signed tomorrow.  Recent samples of ruminant diets have shown that traces of poultry offal, which is incorporated in non-ruminant <Col N="1126" /> diets and which poses no danger as far as BSE is concerned, are being found in ruminant diets from compounders which do not use any mammalian meat and bonemeal in their plants. To ensure that this control problem can be overcome, a new order is being introduced which will also subject the use of poultry offal in animal feeds or the holding of poultry offal on any premises used for the manufacture of animal feed to the holding of a licence.  It has already been announced that, in practice, compounders manufacturing ruminant feeds will not be given licences to use poultry offal in their mills.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the Department regards it as a priority that any possibility of the spread of BSE by means of animal feed is eliminated. The measures taken with effect from last October, which supplemented the ban introduced in 1990, have, in my view, achieved that result.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 12 February 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 20, 23, 33 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>Initial recruit training is of approximately 16 weeks duration on successful completion of which recruits are assigned to a range of duties in barracks. They then undergo private three star training which is of approximately eight weeks duration and on successful completion of that training they may then be assigned to the full range of duties carried out by the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
      <P>The number of applicants for enlistment is always likely to reflect the prevailing economic climate and employment opportunities.  The growth in the economy and the consequent increase in job opportunities combined with the lowering of the age limit, it is felt has a bearing on the likely pool of applicants.</P>
      <P>The reduced upper age limit of 22 years for general service recruits was introduced in 1996. This followed specifically on the recommendation of the efficiency audit group and their consultants who recently completed a review of the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very unsatisfactory age profile of the members was identified by the efficiency audit group as one of the serious problems facing the Defence Forces.  If the problem were to remain unaddressed a situation would be reached where the operational effectiveness of the Force could be seriously compromised.  Therefore, in order to <Col N="1128" /> address the age problem it is necessary to recruit persons in the younger age-group.</P>
    <P>The reduced age limit, combined with the scheme for voluntary early retirement of certain categories of personnel, is designed to reduce the overall age profile of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces review implementation plan provides for recruitment of 400 in each of the years 1997 and 1998.  Enlistment in 1997 will initially be from the panels of applicants found suitable for enlistment that have been set up arising from the recent recruitment campaign.</P>

      <P>The current recruitment drive to the Defence Forces envisages the recruitment of 600 personnel between December 1996 and the middle of 1997.  It is not possible to say at this stage how many of these recruits will be allocated to the Border area, but the Deputy may be assured that the operational requirements of the Defence Forces in the Border area will be a priority when a decision is being made as to the deployment of these recruits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of increased operational commitments in the Border area it has recently been decided to provide assistance to officers rostered for Border duty by selecting for such duty a number <Col N="1129" /> of officers who are attending university. However, any such officer selected for Border duty will be required to complete only two Saturday weekend duties over a six month period.</P>
    <P>Since April 1996, additional personnel have been assigned to the Border area from time to time as necessary to assist with the BSE crisis.  It is not the practice for security reasons to indicate the numbers of personnel deployed for particular operations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>In addition to basic pay, a military service allowance is payable to all members of the Permanent Defence Force up to and including the rank of colonel to compensate personnel for the special conditions associated with military life, such as the unsocial hours of duty, being subject to transfers and a requirement to service in all conditions.  The current rate in the case of officers in £2,091 per annum, and in the case of non-commissioned officers and private is £40.08 per week, £2,091 per annum, with the exception of privates with less than three years' service who receive £14.43 per week.  The allowance is paid irrespective of the actual hours worked.  In addition, all personnel posted to Border units are in receipt of a Border duty allowance of £50.07 per week in the case of officers and £44.91 per week in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates. The allowance is paid, irrespective of the actual hours worked, on a continuous basis, including periods of annual leave, sick leave, etc.</P>
      <P>The commission on remuneration and conditions of service in the Defence Forces, which examined and determined the rates of remuneration of the Permanent Defence Force in July 1990, expressly stated its conclusion that military duties were clearly in a distinctive category and that it would not be appropriate to fix military pay on the basis of a direct comparison with the pay of gardaí.</P>
      <P>The provisions governing the payment of subsistence allowance to Defence Forces personnel are provided for in Defence Force regulations. These provisions are currently under review in the conciliation and arbitration scheme forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, the payment of allowances comes within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) and the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers (RACO) and may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in <Col N="1131" /> agreement with the associations.  The question of the payment of an allowance to personnel involved with the recent BSE-related operations in Border areas has been raised by PDFORRA under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Under the terms of the scheme, as agreed with the associations, discussions on claims which are being processed are confidential. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that as the matter is under active consideration at present it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 30 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners. The Defence Forces, including the Naval Service, respond to requests from the civil authorities for assistance, including assistance in combating the illegal importation of drugs, and they will continue to do so.  It is not the practice for operational and security reasons to give details of such requests.</P>
      <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to requests for assistance from the civil authorities.  Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of a joint task force involving the gardaí, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, will help to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act 1994 also serves to increase the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area. The question of the equipment required by the Naval Service to fulfil the roles assigned to it, including the interdiction of illegal drugs is kept under continual review.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to change the redress system as I recently introduced far-reaching changes in the system following extensive consultations with RACO and PDFORRA, the representative bodies of the Defence Forces.  The new procedures, introduced on 1 May 1996, widened the scope of complaints which can be entertained from personnel and included the appointment of an independent complaints inquiry officer.  In addition, the new system provides for time limits at various military levels dealing with complaints.  The system is also more open in that the outcome of a complaint and the basis for the decision is conveyed in writing to the complainant.  The new procedures are due to be reviewed in May 1998.  I am confident that the operation of the new system is proving satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The detailed information requested by the Deputy in the first part of the question is not readily available from my Department's records. When the information has been compiled I will have it forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 278 together.</P>
      <P>At present the Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying patrol vessel, four off-shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  The Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone.  These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed at all areas of Irish waters as necessary.  Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
      <P>As I outlined previously to the House, the EU has introduced a five year programme of financial aid towards the cost of measures to enforce the common fisheries policy.  Approximately £1.35 million was committed by the Department on EU-funded projects in 1996.  The position in relation to the programme for 1997 is that Ireland's submission provides for a down payment on an additional naval patrol vessel. Requests for proposals for the supply of an additional vessel were advertised in the official journal of the European Community.  The deadline for receipt of proposals was 10 January 1997. The proposals received are currently being assessed with a view to developing a shortlist of suitable tenderers who will be invited to submit definitive tenders for the supply of the vessel.  It is anticipated that the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the latter half of this year.</P>
      <P>The Commission is currently considering Ireland's application in conjunction with those of other member states and indications are that a decision will be made by the middle of March on the level of funding to be made available in 1997. Pending the implementation of the five year programme the Naval Service will continue to carry out its various roles using the existing seven patrol vessels.  Two of these vessels were refurbished in recent years and another is currently undergoing a major overhaul to replace and refurbish obsolete or deteriorated equipment and extend its operational life.  A further vessel will undergo similar refurbishment commencing in August next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the ongoing introduction of additional reporting requirements for fishing vessels operating within the exclusive fisheries limit of the State, the volume of data to be processed at the national supervisory centre operated by the Naval Service will increase.  There is already a requirement for fishing vessels to report their entry and exit to and from the Irish box and, from <Col N="1135" /> 1 January 1998, vessels will also be required to report their catches.  This information requires to be verified as far as is possible by boardings and inspections of fishing vessels at sea by the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>While the main day to day role of the Naval Service is one of fishery protection, Naval Service vessels also respond to requests from the civil authorities for assistance in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  It is not the practice for operational and security reasons to give details of such requests and the number of occasions on which the Naval Service may be involved in such operations in the future cannot be predicted.</P>
    <P>The current strength of the Naval Service is 1020.  Arising from the recent recruitment campaign for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Forces in 1996 and 1997, 30 recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service in recent weeks.  Further enlistment will take place this year but the actual number that will be enlisted for service in the Naval Service has yet to be decided.</P>
    <P>The question of the resources in terms of equipment and personnel required by the Naval Service to enable it to fulfil its role is kept under continual review.</P>

      <P>The tidal and freshwater boundary of the river Shannon <Col N="1136" /> is set at the weir or dam known as Corbally Mill Weir.  The number of licences allowed on these tidal waters are prescribed under section 23 of the Shannon Fisheries Act, 1935 which establishes a maximum of 70 drift nets and 25 draft nets or seines in this area.</P>
      <P>Section 88 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959 empowers the Minister to make regulations altering the number of licences in this area, provided the new number does not exceed the statutory maximum.  There are no proposals at present to reduce the number of net licences on these tidal waters, although, as the Deputy is doubtless aware, the number of commercial drift and draft licences in the Limerick district have been capped at 1995 levels under the new Control of Fishing for Salmon (Amendment) Order, 1996.  The Shannon regional fisheries board has advised that any such proposal could be assessed in the context of the local catchment salmon management plan which the board is developing, in consultation with local fishing interests.</P>

      <P>There is growing awareness in fishing communities around the coast of the considerable commercial potential of lobster fishing and the consequent need for <Col N="1138" /> effective conservation and management strategies to protect and enhance this valuable resource.</P>
      <P>In response to this, a series of regulations have been put in place, backed up by the availability of financial support, under the EU PESCA initiative, for local lobster conservation and management programmes.  The conservation measures, notably, ban the sale of lobsters under 85 millimetres in length and require female lobsters which are &ldquo;V notched&rdquo;for breeding purposes to be returned to the sea.</P>
      <P>The conservation measures are designed to underpin development of lobster fisheries on a managed basis and to maximise the returns of the fishery in terms of jobs and revenue in coastal communities. The regulations were introduced at the request of lobster fishermen and in full consultation with them. The measures are also being kept under review with the advice and input of the fishermen themselves.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that conservation programmes involving the V-notching of lobsters are now under way around the coast and are fully eligible for grant-aid under the PESCA community initiative.  In 1996 I approved £11,000 in grant-aid for a lobster V-notching programme being undertaken by the north-east lobster association which covers the coast from Carlingford Lough to Dublin Bay, including Louthshinney. A number of fishermen from Loughshinney have become active in the association.</P>
      <P>The development of local lobster fishery programmes is set to continue and expand and will receive every encouragement from the Department and BIM.</P>

      <P>Following the tragic accident involving the fishing vessel <i>Jenalisa</i> on 4 February 1996, it was decided to raise the wreck of this vessel in order to progress the investigation into its sinking.  A number of tests and experiments have been carried out by the marine survey office of my Department in order to try to establish how the accident happened.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the marine survey office is awaiting a stability assessment of the vessel which I am advised should be completed shortly.  Once this has been completed a report will be finalised and made available subject to normal legal considerations.</P>
      <P>Since the accident happened, the Department has had a number of inquiries from the bereaved relatives and has kept them fully informed of progress in the investigation.  A designated Department official, or officials, will maintain regular contact with the families.</P>

      <P>Statistics for the 1996 eel catch are not yet available.  I can advise the Deputy that the estimated eel catch in 1995 totaled 137 tonnes at first sale.  The annual reported catch of eels has tended to be less than 150 tonnes, with an estimated value of between £450,000 and £750,000.  They are a high species worth between £3,000 to £5,000 per tonne.</P>
      <P>A study by the marine institute's fisheries research centre, the ESB and Forbairt indicates that there is considerable potential for development of the fishery and an integrated development strategy plan is being formulated.</P>

      <P>The dredging contractor has finalised operations at Kilmore Quay, which completes this major capital project, involving an investment of £3.25 million in the fishing harbour.  The completed harbour development will underpin the future of the fishing and marine tourism industries at Kilmore Quay.</P>
      <P>In addition to the original programme of dredging works the Department negotiated an additional agreement with the contractor at the end of last year to provide a 40 metre wide approach channel dredged to 4.5 metres on the entire approach.</P>
      <P>In relation to criticism of the dredging operation, it is acknowledged that the contractor was delayed in coming on site and it is also the case that difficulties were experienced with plant breakdown due to the heavy toll on equipment caused by the solid bedrock composition of the seabed at Kilmore.  Problems early on in relation to the disposal of dredge spoil were resolved.</P>
      <P>Overall however the harbour reconstruction project has been acknowledged as a professional job to the highest engineering standards by the Department and will, I believe, be generally welcomed as such by local interests.  In that context I should say that recent requests for a major additional dredging programme at the harbour approaches, which was not part of the present project, would have to be fully assessed and costed in the first instance.</P>

In determining the exact location, I will be guided by an expert assessment of a number of locations in the south-east and south which is currently being carried out under the aegis of the Irish marine emergency service.  This assessment will have due regard to marine activity by area and to levels of coverage by other services.  It is envisaged that deployment by the dauphin will occur at the time the east coast medium load carrying helicopter is put in place.</P>

      <P>Section 30 (6) of the Harbours Act, 1996 provides that the Minister for the Marine shall appoint three members of a prescribed local authority or local authorities, each of whom has been nominated in the prescribed manner by a prescribed local authority or local authorities to be a director of a company.</P>
      <P>It was, therefore, necessary for me to prescribe in regulations the nominating local authorities and the manner in which the local authority directors are to be nominated.  The Port Companies (Appointment of Local Authority Directors) Regulations, 1996 (S.I. No. 335 of 1996) were signed by me on 14 November 1996.  The Regulations provide, <i>inter alia,</i> that Cork Corporation will nominate two directors to the Port of Cork Company and that Cork County Council will nominate one director.  In drawing up the regulations, I endeavoured to structure representation in a fair and reasonable manner.  In so far as local authority representation on the Port of cork Company is concerned, I took the following into consideration: (i) the main areas of economic activity at the public quays in Cork Harbour are Ringaskiddy in Cork County and Tivoli in Cork city, which between them handled a throughput of 1,752,480 tonnes in 1996; 41 per cent of this was handled at Ringaskiddy and 59 per cent at Tivoli; (ii) in financial terms, the 1996 revenue yield to Cork Harbour Commissioners from operations in Ringaskiddy and Tivoli can be broken down as to 35 per cent Ringaskiddy and 65 per cent Tivoli and (iii) historically, Cork Corporation has had representation on Cork Harbour Commissioners since 1946 while Cork County Council was only granted such representation in 1991.</P>
      <P>It was for these reasons I concluded that it would be fair and reasonable to grant the corporation two seats and the county council one seat on the board of the port of Cork company.</P>

      <P>The Government's position on the proposed undergound developments at Sellafield was set <Col N="1143" /> out in detail in the Adjournment Debate on 5 February.  In that debate the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Mr. Stagg, who has the lead responsibility on this specific issue, indicated quite clearly the Government's determination to prevent this dump being located at the Sellafield site.  The Government's position is that the potential transboundary effects of such a development so near to the Irish coast represents an unacceptable risk to the health, environment and economic wellbeing of the Irish people.  The Government's strenuous objections to the Nirex proposals have been put directly to the relevant United Kingdom Secretary of State, Mr. Gummer, and a request has been made for the plant to be abandoned.  I understand that the United Kingdom Government has decided to engage in a public consultation process on the new information which has become available on the Nirex proposal and the Government will be included in that consultation.</P>
      <P>As Minister for the Marine, I am, of course, concerned about the potential of this proposed development to have a negative effect on the marine environment in the Irish Sea.  This specific concern contributes to the Government's overall opposition to the proposal.</P>

The information gathered in this report will allow for assessment of the environment of the area, including water quality, and will provide a firm basis for future monitoring and management of the maritime area covered by the OSPAR Convention.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of the report the Convention area has been divided into five sub-regions. Ireland and the UK are responsible for the preparation of the report in respect of that part of the North-East Atlantic region (Celtic Seas) extending westwards of the UK mainland to the edge of the continental shelf, 200m depth. the area includes all of Ireland's marine and coastal areas.</P>
      <P>The report will comprise a compilation of existing knowledge &mdash; physics, chemistry, biology, human activities &mdash; of the area; an assessment of this information in relation to agreed criteria of environmental quality and a statement of the prevailing condition of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> In conjunction with similar reports on the four other parts of the OSPAR region, the Celtic Seas QSR will be assimilated into a convention-wide QSR that will be published in the year 2000.  It is expected that a draft of the report in respect of the Irish-UK region will be completed early in 1998.</P>
    <P>The Irish contribution to the QSR is being managed by the Marine Institute on behalf of the Departments of the Environment and the Marine. The institute has established a QSR Office at the Forbairt laboratory in Shannon, County Clare, staffed by a team of four marine scientists. The team is lead by Mr. Rick Boelens, a recognised international expert in marine environmental science, who has been seconded to the institute for this project.</P>
    <P>A national QSR steering group, comprising senior officials from the Department of the Marine, Department of the Environment, the Marine Institute and the Environmental Protection Agency meet regularly to review progress on the preparation of the report.  I am advised by that group that work is well under way in reviewing scientific reports and publications on all facets of the physics, chemistry and biology of coastal and sea-shelf areas of the Celtic Seas.  The group are satisfied with the progress that has been made to date.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Priority Question No. 20 of 11 December 1996 in which I outlined the steps being taken by the EU in order to help bring about an early return to democratic rule and full respect for human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria.  I have also outlined in my reply the ongoing process of consultation and close review being undertaken by the EU in relation to Nigeria.  This process includes the situation in Ogoniland and possible further Ogoni trials within its remit.  As part of that process, the Government and our EU partners will continue to monitor closely developments in relation to the treatment of the Ogoni 19 and will press for the presence of EU human rights monitors at any relevant hearings.</P>

      <P>A reappraisal of Bloody Sunday and the role of the Widgery Tribunal has been prompted by the new information and a re-evaluation of existing evidence which has emerged recently.  I regard this information as significant.  It is certainly significant enough to warrant official consideration and examination.  The support for a formal apology to the families of the victims which has come from within both communities in Northern Ireland is also encouraging.</P>
      <P>Both the Taoiseach and I have impressed on the British Government the need for movement on this issue.  It was discussed by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister during a telephone conversation on 31 January 1997.  It has been raised through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  I also discussed Bloody Sunday in some detail with the Secretary of State when we met in London on 6 February 1997.  I understand that Mr. John Hume MP will lead a delegation of relatives to meet the Secretary of State this week and will impress on him the need for the British Government to take account of the new material and to act on it.</P>
      <P>My Department, in co-operation with other relevant Departments, is currently assessing the material now available on Bloody Sunday.  We will pursue this matter with the British Government. The Government's primary concern is the need to meet the legitimate concerns of the relatives of the victims and to help to bring an end to the suffering they have endured as a result of the report of the Widgery Tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 72 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>The major initiatives which Ireland has undertaken in regard to the United Nations follow from the priorities set out for our policy towards the United Nations in the Government's White Paper on Foreign Policy.  These priorities continue to focus on areas which we have traditionally attached importance to, such as disarmament, human rights and economic and social development.</P>
      <P>In our view the United Nations continues to have a key role to play in securing agreement on further disarmament measures.  Ireland, through its role as Presidency of the European Union, in concert with the other partners, was instrumental in obtaining widespread international support for the adoption in September 1996 of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  This followed extensive lobbying by Ireland and its EU partners in over 100 UN member states.  This treaty is a significant further measure to promote nuclear disarmament and has to date been signed by over 140 countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland also undertook to press strongly for support for a UN resolution urging states to pursue vigorously an effective legally-binding international instrument to ban the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines. After extensive lobbying, this resolution was adopted by the overwhelming majority of UN member states.  As a complementary initiative in this area Ireland, as Presidency of the EU, promoted a resolution on assistance in mine clearance which was adopted by consensus. Through these efforts, Ireland has contributed to giving further impetus to the movement by the international community towards a ban on these particularly devastating weapons whose victims are predominantly innocent civilians.</P>
      <P>In view of the clear need for a continuing and strong advocacy by the UN for further disarmament measures, Ireland initiated a resolution which sought to further expand the membership of the UN conference on disarmament which has a key policy role to play in the disarmament area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Human rights has also continued to provide a focus of our policy within the United Nations.  As a consequence Ireland took the initiative in 1996 of campaigning for election to the commission on human rights.  This is one of the main United Nations bodies concerned with human rights and has responsibility for monitoring and reporting on human rights issues, legislation and international <Col N="1150" /> agreements on human rights, and the human rights issues, legislation and international agreements on human rights, and the human rights situation in specific countries.  Ireland was successful in its election bid and took up its three year term of membership in 1 January 1997.</P>
    <P>As a member of the commission on human rights, Ireland will have the opportunity to make a more direct and positive contribution in support of the important role of the United Nations in the promotion of human rights, as well as pursuing our traditional policy priorities in this area.  At the 1996 session of the Commission, Ireland took the initiative of tabling, for the first time, a draft resolution on the human rights of persons with disabilities which sought to draw attention to the rights of the disabled as well as disabilities caused by violations of human rights.  A further initiative was the introduction by Ireland at the same session of a resolution in the elimination of religous intolerance.  Ireland worked successfully to have both resolutions adopted by consensus.</P>
    <P>There remain many challenges and obstacles facing the United Nations in its efforts to promote and defend human rights throughout the world, not least the need to strengthen the role of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights as well as providing additional resources within the UN system for human rights activities.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been a consistent advocate, within the UN forum, of the vital role of the organisation in advancing the economic and social development of all nations, and particularly the lesser developed countries.  In the light of the ongoing debate within the United Nations on how it can become more effective in fulfilling this role, Ireland, in co-operation with its EU partners, undertook to seek to elaborate proposals of the European Union for reform of the United Nations system in the economic and social areas. This initiative was developed during our Presidency of the EU and a set of proposals outlining the common view of the EU on reform in this sector was agreed in December 1996.</P>
    <P>The proposals have been conveyed to the new UN Secretary-General and it is intended that they will serve to give impetus to the effort to reach agreement on necessary reforms within the current activities and programmes of the UN system. The objective of reform, for both Ireland and its EU partners, is to create a more efficient and well-targeted UN effort in the area of sustainable development, with particular emphasis in policy and programmes on having real impact on the priority needs of poorer developing countries in particular.  The thrust of the proposals is not on cost-cutting but on restoring confidence, both in developed and developing countries, in the United Nations as an efficient multilateral instrument to promote real sustainable development throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Another initiative to be noted is the declaration by Ireland, in April 1996, of its canditature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council, in elections to be held in the year 1999 for the <Col N="1151" /> term 2000-2002.  This candidature follows from our long held view that it is important that all states who are members of the UN, and in particular the smaller states within the organisation, should have the opportunity within a reasonable time period of serving on the Security Council, which is the main organ concerned with decision-making on issues affecting international peace and security.</P>
    <P>As regards the activities of the United Nations in Rwanda and Burundi, I would not propose to comment on these operations in detail as this is a matter for the organisation itself.  I can however inform the Deputy that in 1996 the United Nations launched a consolidated inter-agency appeal for the Great Lakes Region including Rwanda, Burundi, Eastern Zaire and parts of Tanzania.  The appeal was co-ordinated by the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs.  The UN implemented this appeal through its agencies including: the High Commissioner for Refugees, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, World Health Organisation, the UN Children's Fund, Food and Agriculture Organisation, World Food Programme and the UN Development Programme. The appeal had raised over US$555 million by 4 November 1996.</P>
    <P>In early November 1996, due to the increasingly volatile situation in the region, the United Nations launched a consolidated inter-agency flash appeal for the Great Lakes Region.  This new appeal was established to cover the period 1 November 1996 to 31 January 1997.  A comprehensive financial summary for this appeal is not <Col N="1152" /> yet available.  However, more than US$145 million was contributed to the flash appeal.</P>
    <P>The UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs are currently preparing two new appeals for the region, one of which will be for Rwanda and the other for the rest of the Great Lakes Region including Burundi.</P>

      <P>The total EU funding available to the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland is 300 million ECU (IR£240) over three years.

At least 15 per cent of the overall amount is devoted to activities carried out in a cross-Border context.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, funding for a further two years is subject to a European Commission review.  An independent evaluation of the programme is at present being undertaken and I have every confidence that the progress to date will support the Commission's case in respect of funding for the final two years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76,78 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>Under the National Lottery Act, 1986 the Government may designate additional purposes for which national lottery funds may be allocated. As the Deputy will appreciate, demands for lottery funding greatly exceed the resources available. I have no plans at present to propose that additional beneficiary categories be designated. However, I am arranging that the representations made by the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals will be brought to the attention of the National Lottery review group.</P>
      <P>I would also draw the attention of the Deputy to the reply by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry on 29 January 1997 to a Parliamentary Question regarding assistance by his Department to animal welfare groups.  The following is the reply:</P>
      <P>The operation of the Control of Horses Act, 1996 is a matter for the local authorities.  In December 1996 I made grants of £50,000 each to the Blue Cross Animal Welfare Society and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (DSPCA).  I also made a grant of £50,000 to the DSPCA in September 1995.  These grants will enable both organisations to continue the important work which they undertake in relation to the welfare and care of animals.  The grants to DSPCA recognise the value of the service it provides in the Dublin area, often in difficult circumstances, while the grant to the Blue Cross marks the centenary of the organisation which was established in England in 1897.</P>

      <P>I announced increases in the rates of excise duty on unleaded and leaded petrol and on diesel in this year's <Col N="1155" /> budget.  This was done mainly for revenue raising reasons.</P>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy is inquiring as to why the rate of increase on super unleaded petrol was 0.5p greater than the rate of increase on premium unleaded petrol.  Lead in petrol is an octane enhancer.  In formulating its products to meet the unleaded standard it is common practice for producers to use benzene as a substitute.  To meet the higher octane rating of super unleaded petrol, greater amounts of benzene and other aromatics are often used.  Benzene is a known carcinogen. At present its use in petrol is restricted to a maximum of 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the higher duty increase on super unleaded petrol is justified on environmental grounds.</P>

      <P>The medical criteria which must be met in order that a person may qualify for tax relief are set out in regulation 3 of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994.  Six different types of disability are listed and a qualifying person must meet at least one of them.  I should point out that these regulations were drawn up following consultation with a wide range of interested organisations representing the disabled.  The issue of the medical criteria for qualification under the scheme was examined in considerable detail in the course of the consultations. The purpose of the scheme is to target what are costly reliefs on those clearly severely and permanently disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of the qualifying medical certificate &mdash; as required under regulation 4 &mdash; is a matter of medical judgement on the part of the certifying physician, i.e. the Director of Community Care and Medical Officer of Health, as to whether an individual meets one or more of the particular medical criteria.  If such a certificate is refused, the person may appeal to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal.  It would not be appropriate <Col N="1156" /> for me to intervene in this independent medical process.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the operation of the scheme is kept under periodic review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no evidence that false names are used to avoid family income tax liability.  To work and get a tax advantage under a false name, a taxpayer would need to establish a whole new identity for himself or herself and get tax documentation accordingly.</P>
      <P>To secure tax documentation it is necessary to have an RSI number.  Without tax documentation, employers are obliged to deduct tax on the emergency basis.  A Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number is allocated by the Department of Social Welfare to a child when a claim for child benefit is being made by the child's parents.  Children, on reaching 16 years of age, are notified of their RSI number by the Department of Social Welfare.  The RSI number is their personal life-long reference number for all tax and social welfare purposes and is traced when employment commences or there is a change of employment.  RSI numbers can be allocated to individuals not falling within the child benefit scheme and these are subject to similar controls.</P>
      <P>When an employer takes on a new employee he or she must notify the tax office of the commencement and give relevant personal details including the RSI number of the employee.  These details are verified by the tax office before issuing tax documentation.  In the meantime, the employer will deduct tax on the emergency or temporary basis.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has any information on this matter, the Revenue Commissioners will be happy to receive it.</P>

      <P>The matter has been considered and it was decided that no change be made in the treatment for milk quota purchase expenditure.  Milk quotas are treated as capital assets for tax purposes.  The proceeds of sale of a quota are, therefore, treated as a capital receipt and as such are liable for taxation as a capital gain rather than as income.  If the cost of acquiring a milk quota was to be allowed as a <Col N="1157" /> trading expense for the buyer, it would logically follow that the payment for the quota should be treated as income in the hands of the seller.  It would clearly be inappropriate to continue to treat the quota as a capital item for the farmer selling it and as a trading expense for the farmer buying it.</P>

      <P>The full year cost of the income tax, levies and employees' PRSI element of the personal tax reductions introduced in the 1997 budget was £393 million. This sum does not include the £14 million in revenue arising from the final phase of standard rating of mortgage interest relief introduced in the 1994 budget which would have to be taken into account to compare with the costing of the tax reliefs under previous national programmes provided in reply to the Deputy's Questions Nos. 110 and 111 on 26 November 1996.  This £14 million was already taken into account in the tax revenue receipts published before the budget in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure for 1997.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to provide a cumulative cost for Partnership 2000, as was done for earlier national programmes, until such time as the 1998 and 1999 budgets have been introduced. However, as the Deputy is aware, Partnership 2000 in paragraph 3.9 states that the Government will introduce personal tax reductions over the three years of £900 million on a full year basis.</P>

      <P>The following are the EU directives, regulations and coventions in respect of which my Department has responsibility and which have not yet been transposed into or made part of Irish law.</P>
      <P>Department of Finance</P>
      <P>Council Regulation 2988/95 on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests sets out the broad framework for a system of administrative penalties in cases of irregularities committed against the EU budget.</P>
      <P>The implementation of this regulation is currently being considered in conjunction with the Attorney General's office, with a view to the early implementation of this regulation.</P>
      <P>Council Regulation 2382/96 repealing regulations (EEC) No. 990/93 and (EC) No. 2471/94 and concerning the termination of restrictions on economic and financial relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), the United Nations protected areas in the Republic of Croatia and those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, under the Treaty on European Union Council, regulations are directly applicable in all member states and this regulation is already being implemented by the Central Bank.  The repeal of the relevant Statutory Instrument should be effected in the near future.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Treaty on European Union concerning monetary financing prohibit further Central Bank financing of the public sector. Provision is being made in the Central Bank Bill, 1996 for the deletion from various Acts governing Ireland's membership of various international organisations of provisions for borrowing by the Exchequer from the Central Bank to fund its contributions to those international organisations.  It is expected that the Oireachtas will have completed its consideration of the Bill by the summer of 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> Office of the Revenue Commissioners: Council Directive 94/74/EC on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty was due for implementation on 30 June 1995.  The main provisions of the directive were implemented in the Finance Act, 1995 (sections 99 to 102).  The remaining applicable provisions are to be implemented by regulation very shortly.</P>
    <P>The only outstanding issue in relation to direct taxes is the ratification of the convention on the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises.  The convention was signed on 21 December 1995 and it is hoped to have it ratified in the near future.</P>
    <P>Convention on the use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes (&ldquo;CIS Convention&rdquo;): This convention was signed by Ireland on 26 July 1995.  In order to ratify the convention, it may be necessary to introduce domestic legislation to give effect to one of its provisions; this issue is currently being considered.  It is not yet possible to give a timescale for ratification.  The intention, however, is that it should be ratified as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Agreement on the provisional application between certain member states of the EU of the Convention on the use of Information Technology for Customs purposes: This agreement was signed at the same time as the CIS Convention &mdash; mentioned above &mdash; and domestic legislation may, in this case also, be required before ratification can take place.  Until the matter has been clarified, no deadline for ratification may be set.</P>
    <P>Protocol to the CIS Convention: A Protocol to the CIS Convention was signed on 29 November 1996 and will have to be ratified in due course.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that the review referred to by Deputy Moffatt is that of the 1978 working party established to examine the grading structure for physiotherapists in hospitals.  The report of the working party was circulated in 1979.  However, this was not a pay review.</P>
      <P>Physiotherapists, similar to all other paramedical professions, have benefited in full from all standard and special pay awards under the various national pay programmes down through the years.  The relative position of physiotherapists, in terms of remuneration, has been maintained with those of their colleagues in other paramedical disciplines.</P>
      <P>IMPACT, on behalf of physiotherapists, is currently pursuing a pay claim under clause 2 (iii) &mdash; annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  These negotiations are complex and are ongoing under the auspices of health service employers' agency, with a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I am sure that the Deputies will appreciate that any further comment on my part would not be appropriate or helpful.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The main source of funding for the development of health services, including the primary care services, comes from the annual Exchequer allocation to the Department of Health.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is difficult to predict the level of such investment, over the timescale referred to in his question, which is dependent on a number of factors including the general financial situation at a particular point in time and the priorities for the development of the health services as a whole.

In addition, from 1992 to the end of 1996, an amount of the order of £17 million has been made available by my Department from the capital programme for investment in the community health area of primary care.</P>

      <P>It is the usual practice of the Eastern Health Board to engage in discussions with residents, either directly or through their representatives, in relation to the purchase of houses for residential units in order to explain the operation of the unit and to allay any fears and concerns which residents may have.  However, there was a difficulty in this case due to the absence on sick leave of a member of the board's staff which resulted in the residents becoming aware of the proposal before they were officially informed.  I understand the board has expressed its regret to the residents' association on this account.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has a statutory duty to provide care for children at risk.  At present, the board has approximately 1,400 children in its care of whom about 1,000 are placed in foster care.  The remaining 400 are placed in residential settings operated directly by the board or by voluntary agencies acting on behalf of the board.  In line with national policy the board aims to accommodate children in small family group homes in local communities rather than large institutional settings.  This helps to integrate children with the community and the house in question is suitable in this context.</P>
      <P>I understand the board plans to establish a liaison committee with the co-operation of the residents' association in order to deal with any concerns which may arise.  The board has assured me that any complaints or queries will be dealt with by the unit manager and-or the area social work manager as effectively and speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Human immunoglobulins are prepared from pooled plasma of blood donors who are negative to hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV antibodies. Immunoglobulins contain antibodies to a range of viruses such as measles, hepatitis A and other prevalent viruses.  They may be given as an immediate preventive measure to close contacts of persons who are diagnosed as being infected with such viruses if the doctor considers it clinically necessary.  An example would be where a person whose immune system is compromised comes in close contact with a person who has measles and where infection with this virus could have serious consequences for the immunocompromised person.</P>
      <P>As with all medical interventions, the final decision as to whether immunoglobulins should be given is one to be taken by the doctor and the fully informed patient.  As recommended in the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland and referred to by the Deputy the need to get expert advice from a consultant paediatrician, infectious disease consultant or specialist in public health medicine should be taken into account in arriving at a decision.  This recommendation arises from a recent review carried out by a committee of experts under the auspices of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and whose report I have accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose taking Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>Under the 1970 Health Act, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision I do not think that it is justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or, in the case of children, to their parent's means, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.</P>
      <P>Assessment procedures are also a matter for the chief executive officers.  Medical cards, including those issued on hardship grounds, are usually granted to persons for a limited period only as a person's circumstances may change and it is standard procedure for health boards to send renewal forms to all medical card holders.  I understand from the North Western Health Board that a medical card was issued, on hardship grounds, to the child concerned for her own personal use and is subject to review in the normal way.  I am satisfied, as in this instance, that the health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances justify it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Diabetic services for the Southern Health Board are currently provided at Cork University Hospital, where the board's endocrinology service is based, at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital and also by a number of general physicians in Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a consultant led service in Kerry has been raised in the recent past and the health board has examined the options in relation <Col N="1166" /> to the delivery of this service in consultation with senior medical, nursing and other staff.</P>
    <P>Following its consultation process, the board is now of the opinion that the establishment of a diabetic clinic at Tralee would require the appointment of an additional consultant.  In view of the significant resource implications for this development, it will have to be prioritised, in the first instance, by the board.  In this regard, CT scanning for Tralee has already been identified by the board as its top priority and funding is being provided for this development in 1997.</P>
    <P>In addition, the board is proceeding to appoint a consultant geriatrician for Tralee, which was also identified as a priority.  My Department has also approved funding to improve accident and emergency facilities and renal services in the hospital, all of which have been identified by the board as priority requirements.</P>
    <P>On the specific question of consultant appointments, following the Comhairle na nOspideal review of consultant staff in the Southern Health Board area, the medical staff and the hospital management met and agreed that the priority consultant posts for the hospital are a pathologist, a radiologist and an anaesthetist.  My Department is currently in discussion with the health board in relation to these priority posts.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the question of interim arrangements for the delivery of a diabetic service at Tralee, the Deputy will wish to know that a number of options are being explored by the board in consultantion with the hospital authorities and my Department.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): In line with a recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, arrangements have been put in place to ensure that secure multi-annual funding is provided through the health boards to rape crisis and sexual abuse counselling centres-services nation-wide. These arrangements are intended to assist in the establishment of close liaison between the centres and the health boards, thus resulting in the provision of a more comprehensive service to the victims of rape and sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Government has assigned responsibility for coordinating policy on women and violence across Government Departments to the office of the Tánaiste.  The office has established a working group on violence against women chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, on which both the Department of Health and the health boards are represented.  The working group is due to report to the Government by the end of this month.</P>
      <P>As evidence of my support for the work of the group, I will make £0.5 million revenue available in 1997 to implement its recommendations as far as the health and personal social services are concerned. I also hope to contribute £0.25 million capital moneys in this area.  The needs of Tralee Rape Crisis Centre will be considered in this context.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of speech and language therapy service in the County Louth area is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board.  At present, there are two speech and language therapists in Monaghan and one in Cavan.  The board expects to appoint a principal speech and language therapist for Cavan-Monaghan in the next few months and has held interviews recently for the appointments of two senior speech and language therapists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have informed the House on previous occasions, the speech and language therapy service has improved in recent years.  Health boards, including the North-Eastern Health Board, have viewed its development as a priority.  A total of 28 additional therapists have been recruited tothe health services in the last three years.  Notwithstanding these improvements, it is clear that further development of the speech and language therapy service in general is required.  This issue will be given careful consideration in the context of the implementation of the report of the review <Col N="1168" /> group on services for people with physical and sensory disabilities which has examined speech and language therapy services among its review of health services generally for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Superintendent Registrar's Office in Joyce House, to which I presume the Deputy is referring, is engaged in the business of providing certificates for all births, marriages and deaths occurring within the Dublin City and Dublin County area, and can become very busy, sometimes unexpectedly. I understand that these difficulties were compounded on a recent occasion because of an unusually high incidence of staff sick-leave, a situation which has since improved significantly.  I also understand that, in circumstances where it would prove difficult for personal applicants to wait, they may deposit their application (s) for certificates with the appropriate fees and the relevant certificates which are posted within a few days, or are made available for collection at a time which is more convenient for the applicant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.  The pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities is overseen by an interdepartmental monitoring committee of the programme.  The review of the pilot programme carried out by the monitoring committee was completed late last year.  A Government decision of 28 January 1997 approved the extension of funding for people with disabilities employed under the pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities, for a further year.</P>
      <P>All aspects of sheltered employment, including the pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities, are being considered by the national advisory committee on training and employment (NACTE) established by the NRB which is due to report this summer and will advise on effective models of employment.  In the meantime it is not proposed to expand the pilot programme for the present.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to create 500 sheltered employment places for the period of the partnership.  In the course of providing additional places, it is intended, through the NRB, to pilot new models of sheltered work and to develop minimum standards for all forms of of NACTE.  To that end I allocated £500,000 in 1997 for work places for people with physical and sensory disability to fund innovative projects and new models for employment.</P>
      <P>A further review of the pilot programme will be conducted by the monitoring committee later this year as part of the overall assessment of new models of employment under the NACTE initiative. A decision will then be taken on what are the most successful models of employment.</P>
      <P>Following this and in the event of a new programme, as in the case of this pilot programme, it will be a matter for the evaluation committee of the programme to recommend which projects should be funded.</P>

The service needs of children with a mental handicap are reflected on the national intellectual disability database which was recently established.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities Towards an Independent Future refers to the need to identify service user needs on a regional and national basis in a consistent manner for planning purposes.  It recommends the development of a national database on the service requirements of persons with physical and sensory disabilities and this could include the needs of children with birth defects.  The review group recommended that a database development committee be established to prepare detailed proposals for the development of the database.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The salary scale for full-time home helps with effect from 1 January 1997 is in the range of £207.98-£220.19 per week.  This is the same rate as applies in the health services group 1 non-officer grades.  This scale applies throughout the country and is increased from time to time in accordance with increase granted to non-nursing personnel.</P>
      <P>The latest available details of the rate if gratuities applying to part-time home helps and the numbers in each board are given in the following Table 1.  With regard to persons engaged in the home help service on a part-time basis, the position is that the rate of remuneration varies considerably throughout the country.  In particular in the Eastern Health Board area, the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups which accounts for the wide variation within the area.  In all boards the rates are determined by the particular requirements and the type of task undertaken in individual cases.  It is a matter for each health board to decide on the level of home help services required and the level of payment to be made in respect of these services.  The actual number of home help hours to be provided is assessed individually for each client.  The chief executive officer of each board is in the best position to decide on these issues as my Department has no involvement in the day-to-day management of the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Since taking office, I have been anxious to address the problems in the provision of accident and emergency services which have arisen in Beaumont and other major accident and emergency hospitals, particularly during the winter, over the past number of years.  I have provided additional funding to Beaumont Hospital in respect of measures to improve observation facilities adjacent to the accident and emergency department.  However, a wider view is required to address comprehensively the problems which have arisen in hospital accident and emergency departments.  There has been a shortage of subacute beds in Dublin for quite some time and this has caused problems for the acute hospital sector in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers and quickly <Col N="1173" /> enough, to cater for new patients seeking the services of the hospital.</P>
      <P>In order to provide relief for the acute hospitals and enable them discharge patients no longer in need of acute hospital care but who require subacute care, my Department has agreed a plan of action with the Eastern Health Board for the winter of 1996-7.  This involves tackling a number of areas including services for the elderly, services for the chronically disabled and the management of services provided by the acute hospitals themselves.</P>
      <P>The plan will cost £2.75 million annually and I have now provided the funding for this major initiative.</P>
      <P>Included in the plan are the following measures; an additional 30 beds in nursing homes; a new 25 bed community unit in Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital; 17 extra beds in Leopardstown Hospital; 25 extra beds for the elderly in Peamount Hospital; six new community ward teams for the elderly; additional beds in acute hospitals, and public education campaign on the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments. I am glad to inform the Deputy that arrangements are well under way to put these initiatives in place and some of the facilities are already in operation.</P>
      <P>This is the largest package of measures by any Minister for Health to deal with the relief of the winter problems of the acute hospitals and I am confident that it will provide much needed relief for the hospital service in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The hygiene standards to be observed in premises engaged in the provision of food services to the public are set out in the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950-89.  These regulations are enforced on a day-to-day basis by the environmental health services of the eight health boards through programmes of inspection, sampling and monitoring.  Where the hygiene standards in a food premises are found not to be in accordance with the regulations, there is provision whereby the relevant health board can take a prosecution for breach of the food hygiene <Col N="1175" /> regulations against the proprietor of the premises or the undertaking operating in the premises, as appropriate.  Where a health board considers a food premises to pose a grave and immediate danger to public health, the health board can apply to the District Court for the immediate closure of that food business.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances referred to by the Deputy, I understand that the veterinary services of a local authority brought to the attention of the Eastern Health Board the hygiene conditions in a number of meat premises which, it was alleged, amounted to breaches of the food hygiene regulations.</P>
      <P>I understand that, following receipt of the information, the environmental health officers of the Eastern Health Board inspected the various premises.  While deficiencies were noted during the inspections the health board did not consider there to be sufficient grounds for prosecution or for a closure order in any of the cases at that time.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Eastern Health Board that the situation in these premises, including rectification of the deficiencies which it identified and brought to the attention of the proprietors, has been monitored by the health board and that this monitoring is continuing.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied from the information which I have received that the health board has fulfilled its obligations with respect to public health in this instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the provision fo creche facilities for children. Under the Child Care Act, 1991, health boards are empowered to assist voluntary organisations who are providing pre-school services such as creches as part of their general obligation to promote the welfare of children in their areas who are not receiving adequate care and protection. However, it is not a function of health boards to involve themselves in the commercial pre-school sector, aside from their obligation to inspect such services under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996.  I am not, therefore, aware of the problem referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that in order to develop a strategy which integrates the different strands of the current arrangements for the development and delivery of child care and early educational services, there is a commitment under Partnership 2000 to establish an expert working group involving the relevant interests.  This group will be chaired by the Department of Equality and Law Reform and will devise a national framework for the development of the child care sector. The financing of child care provision by a variety of means in the interests of affordable and accessible child care is part of the remit of the expert working group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): There is already a notable degree of cross-Border co-operation at both ministerial and official level regarding health matters.  Agreement has been reached on the establishment of a joint institute of public health which will be multidisciplinary in nature and will concern itself with disease surveillance, development of information systems, research, education and training.  It will act as a resource centre on issues affecting public health.  Discussions with the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland are well advanced in relation to the location of the institute in the college and it is hoped that it will be established within months.</P>
      <P>Another initiative relates to the disposal of helthcare waste of a potentially hazardous nature. Regular contact between the two Departments of Health led to the conclusion that both jurisdictions had similar problems in this regard.  The advantages of a joint approach in tackling this difficult problem were recognised, particularly in providing mutual support to each system and achieving economies of scale in the provision of a service for disposal of waste.  Following examination of the issue by a joint working group it was agreed that there would be at least one disposal facility in Northern Ireland and at least two in the Republic.  Tenders are currently being examined and it is hoped to have a contractor appointed by the end of this month.</P>
      <P>Following discussion with the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland, an informal arrangement has now been entered into which will allow for the referral of a limited number of adult patients from Northern Ireland to St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin for liver transplantation.</P>
      <P>In general patients from Northern Ireland requiring a liver transplant will continue to be referred to Kings College Hospital, London. However, it has been agreed that there may be occasions when it would be clinically advantageous to refer a patient to St. Vincent's Hospital, rather than to London, if, for example, the additional travel to London is considered to be unduly hazardous to the patient.  The Department of Health is at present finalising a number of aspects of the arrangement with St. Vincent's Hospital.</P>
      <P>Finally, &ldquo;Co-operation and Working Together&rdquo; is an initiative undertaken since 1992 by the four health boards responsible for services on both sides of the border.  The aim is to improve the health and social wellbeing of the resident populations in the CAWT boards' areas by: exploiting the opportunities for co-operation in the planning and provision of services; involving other public sector bodies in joint initiatives where this would help fulfil the primary objectives; assisting Border areas in overcoming special developmental problems; developing joint initiatives that would merit application for EU and other external funding.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The health research board is the statutory body with responsibility for health research in Ireland.  The board's primary function is to promote, assist, commission or conduct medical, health and health services research.  In addition, the board assists and supports other health agencies including health boards and co-operates with other research bodies in promoting or conducting such research in Ireland.  The health research board is the primary vehicle for health research funding from my Department.  The board provides grants for, among other things, post graduate research projects.  The board considers all applications for funding and selects projects on a competitive basis subject to the board's peer review process whereby experts in the field assess the merits of each individual project.  Any person or body seeking funds to enable research to be undertaken should submit a proposal to the board.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I would refer the Deputy to replies given on 26 September and 17 October on this issue.  I have already outlined that the report of the review group on the ambulance service was published in November 1993.  The group, in its report, stated that the ambulance service is an emergency service similar to the Garda and fire service.  The report of the review group has been accepted by Government and forms the basis of Government policy in relation to the ambulance service.</P>
      <P>While the ambulance service acts as an emergency service in respect of its accident and emergency work, approximately half of all ambulance calls are not of an emergency nature but are related to the routine transport of patients.  In addition, classification as an emergency service does not suggest that ambulance personnel are being asked to carry out the same duties as either the fire service personnel or indeed the gardaí.</P>
      <P>In relation to the pay and conditions of ambulance personnel and controllers in provincial locations in 1993, I have clarified the nature of the claim made by SIPTU on behalf of ambulance personnel in previous responses.  Final agreement was reached on a package of proposals in December 1996.  A ballot on this package was started at the end of last year.  For technical reasons on the union side the ballot had to be rearranged for the coming weeks.  It is my hope that this offer will be accepted and that this group's parity with their Dublin counterparts will be restored.</P>

    <P>I understand from the board that in addition to the increase in the number of clients, a new centre was opened in Loughlinstown which required additional transport runs out and back each day. This increased the cost but provided a more comprehensive service to those attending the services. Details in relation to the funding for this service in 1997 are not yet available.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The provision of dental treatment to eligible persons in County Mayo is the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Western Health Board that persons in the over 65 category are seen almost immediately for routine and emergency treatment under the dental treatment services scheme. There is a waiting period of approximately three months for persons awaiting routine treatment in the 16-34 years age group and four months in respect of persons in the 34 to 64 age category awaiting full denture treatment.</P>
      <P>I understand from the board that the number of private dentists participating in the scheme has been low in the Mayo area.  However, as a result of a recent recruitment drive by the board the situation has improved.</P>
      <P>The board also has a recruitment problem in recruiting health board dentists for the Mayo community care area.  Despite the best efforts of the board through advertising and using every available means open to the board, it has not been possible for the board to fill a number of posts.  A number of dentists in the Mayo community care area currently availing of maternity leave makes the position more difficult for the board.</P>

      <P>The new system of local authority funding is based on assigning the proceeds of motor taxation to local authorities.  The amount of this taxation collected by the different authorities will vary, in some cases significantly, from the income levels generated by the existing system &mdash; some authorities will collect considerably more and others considerably less.  This requires a transfer of resources to ensure, as already stated, that every local authority, including those in County Louth, benefits from the changes.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed equalisation system, local authorities will retain 80 per cent of the proceeds of motor tax on non-goods vehicles and contribute all other motor tax revenues to an equalisation fund.  The resources of the fund will be distributed, in the first instance, to ensure that the income lost through the abolition of domestic water and sewerage charges and the rate support grant is made good in full to each local authority. The balance remaining will be allocated as equitably as possible among local authorities, having regard to needs and resources.  All local authorities will gain from this new funding system.</P>

      <P>Arising from the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, my Department asked each local authority in January 1994 to reexamine their existing practices in relation to the question of creches and child care facilities to ensure that they were in keeping with the findings of the report to the fullest extent possible.  The authorities were reminded of the importance of the development plan as a mechanism for setting out a blueprint for the development of residential areas, commercial and industrial centres, and all <Col N="1190" /> of the associated infrastructure and servicing, to meet the local community's development needs, including the particular needs of women, as identified in the report.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts permit the attachment to planning permissions of conditions requiring the provision of facilities for child care, where these are considered necessary in the context of the particular development proposal and subject to proper planning and development considerations.</P>

      <P>The guiding principle that informs the Framework for Action on Special Needs Education is that: &ldquo;...schools should accommodate all children regardless of their physical, intellectual, social, emotional, linguistic or other conditions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, sets out the Government's policy for the provision of suitable education services for pupils with a disability in either special educational facilities or in an integrated environment.</P>
      <P>The fundamental objective of the commitment in the White Paper is to ensure to the maximum possible extent that all children with disabilities will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own area and within the ordinary school system.  The degree to which integration can be achieved will depend on the specific and evolving capacities of the individual children concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special educational needs of pupils with a physical or mental disability are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system with the assistance, where necessary, of a remedial resource or visiting teacher for the handicapped.  In more severe cases, provision may have to be made for pupils in special classes <Col N="1203" /> or schools dedicated to the particular special need.  The White Paper outlines substantial education provisions for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures outlined in the White Paper demonstrate this Government's commitment to the objectives of the UN's Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on Special Needs Education.</P>

      <P>I understand from Offaly County Council, the body statutorily entrusted with the administration of the higher education grants scheme, that while the reckonable income in this case exceeds the income limit for the payment of a full maintenance grant, the two students in question are in receipt of part maintenance grants at the non-adjacent rate.  The local authority can re-assess the level of the grant awarded where there is a change of circumstances in the candidate's reckonable income, which is likely to be permanent. Accordingly, if there has been a change in the reckonable income in this case, the application for a re-assessment should be made to Offaly County Council.</P>

Where independent mature students can produce evidence that they are maintaining a residence other than their address while attending college and the non-college residence is more than 15 miles from the college, it is open to the local authority to regard that address as the normal residence and to award a non-adjacent maintenance grant.  This applies to <Col N="1207" /> students pursuing courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate level.</P>

      <P>The staffing allocations for primary schools for the 1997 school year have not yet been determined. However, there has been a substantial drop in enrolments at the school in question between September 1995 and September 1996, and, in the circumstances, it is likely that at least one post will be suppressed at the school in June 1997.</P>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 108 of 29 May 1996, the school to which he refers already has the full-time services of a remedial teacher.  In addition, as part of an unofficial local arrangement, an assistant teacher at the school has been deployed as a remedial mathematics teacher.</P>
      <P>The national programme of training in remedial education for teachers of first and second level pupils is only available to teachers in permanent posts who are fully probated and are employed as teachers in officially designated remedial posts.  It is not possible for the teacher in question to attend the course, as she is not employed in such a capacity.  I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teacher posts to primary schools.

      <P>The County Cork Vocational Education Committee has been providing in a very effective way day release courses for motor car engineering apprentices in its second level school, Davis College, in Mallow for many years.</P>
      <P>Under the new &ldquo;standards-based&rdquo; apprenticeship system, which was developed under PESP and the Programme for a Partnership (PPG) Government 1993-97 and is being implemented on a phased basis, all day release courses will be discontinued and will be replaced by block release courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the new system is fully operational and the additional day and block release courses are fully phased out, some regional technical colleges and vocational schools which have been involved in the delivery of day release motor apprentice programmes will no longer be required to be providers of such programmes.  The management <Col N="1212" /> authorities of these colleges and schools, including that of Davis College, have been notified of this situation.</P>
    <P>However as a result of representations made to me by the college management and members of the motor industry in the Mallow area, I have arranged that the situation will be kept under review in the light of recruitment patterns in the motor apprenticeship area.</P>
    <P>A new replacement school building for Davis College is currently being planned.  County Cork vocational education committee has submitted its proposed design team and a stage 1 report for the project.  These documents are currently being examined by my Department's technical staff.  A response will be conveyed to committee as soon as possible and a planning and briefing meeting will then be convened in order to advance the project.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it is not possible to indicate when the project will proceed to construction as this will depend on the availability of funding and the Department's other commitments and priorities. However, every effort is being made to have the planning of the new school completed as soon as possible with a view to being in a position to invite tenders as soon as funding is available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190, 191 and 192 together.</P>
      <P>On 4 February 1997 I announced the establishment of a high level group to advise on the criteria which would be applied to the redesignation of a regional technical college as an institute of technology, including the devolution of responsibility to colleges within the technological sector in relation to the award of qualifications, at various levels, within a national certification framework. The high level group will also advise on the most appropriate means whereby institutions would be independently evaluated in relation to such criteria.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise the importance of the work which the group is being asked to undertake for the future development of the technological sector. Work has already commenced to facilitate the deliberations of the group.  I would be anxious that the group would complete its work without any unnecessary delay.</P>

      <Col N="1217" /> With regard to the future plans for these sittings of the District Court, the Deputy will be aware of queries raised in court in Donegal by a solicitor concerning planning requirements for the use of rented accommodation for sittings of the District Court and the subsequent decision of the district judge concerned that he would not hear cases in places where specific planning approval had not been obtained.</P>
    <P>Before arriving at his decision the judge had heard the views of a solicitor representing Donegal County Council who argued that such permission was not necessary.  Following consultation with the Attorney General, 16 District Court areas where court sittings have up to now been held in non-court accommodation were rearranged so that hearings would be held in dedicated court facilities.</P>
    <P>I understand that Donegal County Council, as the local authority with a statutory duty to provide court premises, has referred the question raised in relation to the need for planning consultation in these cases to An Bord Pleanála under section 5 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 for determination.  I am awaiting the ruling by An Bord Pleanála in the matter before taking further action.</P>

      <P>As I have explained to the House on previous occasions, a petition does not place a stay on the order of the District Court judge.  Notwithstanding the fact <Col N="1218" /> that a petition has been lodged by or on the defendant's behalf, if the fine is not paid within the time allowed by the judge, a warrant will be issued to enforce the court's decision as is the normal procedure in cases where fines are not paid on time.  Second 1 (1) of the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1991 provides that a warrant must be issued within six months of the due date of payment of the fine imposed.  Statistics in relation to warrants related to fines which are under petition are not maintained.</P>
      <P>While there is no statutory requirement on the Garda Síochána to defer enforcement of a warrant in respect of a fine which is under petition, it is normal practice for them to do so upon production of an official acknowledgement of petition and to await the outcome of a petition.</P>
      <P>Statistics relating to petitions are maintained by reference to petitions finalised, i.e. either refused or mitigated, rather than penalties petitioned or warrants in respect of such penalties. The number of petitions finalised in 1995 was 818 and 295 in 1996, the majority of which were refused in both years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212 and 213 together.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give any guarantee that similar incidents will not recur.  Disturbances and incidents of disorder are unfortunately a feature of running prisons worldwide.  It would be wrong to give the impression that overcrowding caused the recent Mountjoy incident as there was no overcrowding in the part of the prison where it took place, and it would be wrong also to give the impression that prison staff had no knowledge of the background and disposition of the individuals concerned.  They were held in a part of the prison generally reserved for prisoners who are known to be more difficult to manage than others.</P>
      <P>While the difficulties which arose on this occasion cannot be put down simply to overcrowding, it is a fact that there is overcrowding in Mountjoy and throughout the prison system generally. This is being addressed by the extensive prisons building programme which is now under way.  This programme will, when fully implemented, provide over 800 additional prison places.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the arrangements which exist between the prison service, the Garda and the medical and psychological services are quite sound but, like all arrangements, they are capable of refinement and susceptible to ongoing review. This is happening on a continuing basis.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 218 and 223 together.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to all insured people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, self-employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension. They are, of course covered for widow's, widower's and orphan's pensions.  However, self-employed <Col N="1224" /> people in that age group, who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56, could qualify for the old age contributory pension, subject to the normal qualifying criteria, as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Detailed consideration has been given by my Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self-employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  In this regard however the cost of any proposals has proved to be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to relax the requirement that a person must have entered insurance for the first time at least ten years before pension age.</P>
    <P>At present a self-employed person who entered social insurance for the first time in April 1988 when social insurance for the self-employed was introduced qualifies for a refund of the pensions element of their class S social insurance contributions, provided, of course, that they do not qualify for an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  In my recent budget speech I announced that this would be extended to the self-employed who were over age 56 on 6 April 1988, but who had also paid social insurance contributions between 1953 and 1988, subject to the same conditions.  Up to now their earlier contributions would have prohibited them from receiving such a refund.</P>
    <P>I would also point out to the Deputies that in my budget speech I announced details of the extension of <i>pro rata</i> pensions from November of this year to persons with a yearly average of between ten and 19 contributions.  At present a minimum yearly average of 20 is required.  Persons with an average of between 15 and 19 will receive a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while those with an average of between ten and 14 will receive a pension of 50 per cent of the maximum rate.  To qualify a person will also need to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions. Adult and child dependant allowances will be payable at the full rate.  These pensions should enable some self-employed contributors who were over 56 in 1988 but who had previous social insurance contributions to qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension.</P>
    <P>I am making arrangements for officials from my Department to meet a deputation from the Self-Employed Pension Association to outline this position.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is to provide a basic weekly payment of people who have little or no income.  Apart from those categories specifically excluded by the legislation-people in full-time work, people in full-time education and people involved in trade disputes &mdash; any person living in the State who satisfies a means test and who has applied for any other benefit, assistance or allowance to which they may be entitled may be eligible to receive assistance under the SWA scheme.</P>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy is in receipt of the maximum rate of deserted wife's benefit which is greater than the basic SWA rate and therefore she has no entitlement to a basic SWA payment.  She is also in receipt of a fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>As the claimant is living in local authority housing, she is debarred from receiving rent supplement under the legislation.  Provision in relation to the payment of exceptional needs payments (ENPs) is contained in section 181 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, which states that &ldquo;a health board may, in any case where it considers it reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, so to do, determine that supplementary welfare allowance shall be paid to a person by way of a single payment to meet an exceptional need&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of ENPs is to help prevent hardship by providing for essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure which applicants could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  There is not an automatic right of entitlement to the ENP and my Department has no role in determining individual entitlement.</P>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy has applied for and received two ENPs in the last month, totalling £88.00.  Should this person have further essential and exceptional expenditure, it is open to her to claim assistance by contacting the Midland Health Board who will make a decision on entitlement based on the legislation and the circumstances involved.  If dissatisfied with the community welfare officer's decision she can appeal to the appeals officer in the Midland Health Board.</P>

      <Quest>if he will investigate the case of a person (details supplied) in County Cork who has been awarded deserted wife's benefit backdated to August 1996 and who is also in receipt of a rent allowance from the community welfare officer of the Southern Health Board.</Quest>

      <P>Under the provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.  Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and my Department has no role in determining individual entitlement.</P>
      <P>In assessing a person's entitlement to a rent supplement, all cash income must be taken into account in order to determine eligibility and the rate of supplement to be awarded.</P>
      <P>Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources towards their accommodation costs.</P>
      <P>The SWA rate for an adult and two children is £88.80.  All cash income in excess of this amount is calculated as means when determining entitlement to a rent supplement.  This amount is then added to the £6 minimum contribution and deducted from the amount of rent payable.  Any increase received in social welfare payments will therefore result in a decrease of rent supplement.</P>
      <P>The legislation also enables the Minister to make regulations prescribing the circumstances and conditions under which a supplement may be paid, the class or classes of persons to whom a supplement may be paid and the amount of supplement that may be paid, and this has been done in SI 382 (Social Welfare (Consolidated SWA) Regs.) of 1995.</P>
      <P>Article 9 (2) (g) (iii) of the regulations requires the health board to be satisfied, in deciding entitlement to a rent supplement, that the rent payable by the applicant &ldquo;is just and proper having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In order to comply with this legislative provision, each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels in respect of the various classes of persons, as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has been awarded deserted wife's benefit (DWB) of £67.00 plus child dependant allowance (CDA) of £34.00 in respect of her two children, giving her a total weekly income of £101.00.</P>

    <P>The maximum rent level for accommodation for a single parent with two children in the Kinsale area is £80.00 per week.  The health board has advised that a ceiling of £85.00 per week was applied erroneously in this case, and the error only came to light when a re-assessment of rent supplement was carried out as a result of the award of DWB.  The correct maximum level will now be applied in keeping with the regulations. However, any overpayment which has accrued as a result of this error will not be recouped from the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>It is a qualifying condition for DWB that an applicant make appropriate efforts to obtain maintenance from her husband.  The health board has advised that it is normal procedure to request an applicant for SWA to commence reasonable efforts to obtain maintenance in such cases. Reasonable efforts may include a request to pursue the matter through the courts, but this is not required in cases where it can be shown by the claimant that such a course would be fruitless, or, in cases where domestic violence was an issue, dangerous to a claimant.</P>

The categories of employers obliged to notify have been extended to include the beef processing industry from 1997, and includes: construction, forestry, security, contract cleaning, the licensed bar trade, catering, private road transport and private road haulage.</P>
      <P>Some 9,000 employer inspections were carried out in 1996 resulting in savings of £15.7 million and a similar number are planned for this year. These inspections comprise a number of tasks, one of which is to verify the identity of employees.</P>
      <P>Where data cross checks reveal persons using false names the employers are visited and the matter is investigated.</P>

      <Col N="1229" /> I am determined to deal effectively with fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and to apply the full rigour of the law to those employers and claimants who deliberately set out to defraud the system.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 226 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered social insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions &mdash; or 24 in the case of a retirement pension &mdash; registered since January 1953 &mdash; when the unified system of social insurance came into effect &mdash; or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>As announced in my budget speech I am introducing new <i>pro rata</i> pensions so that, in future, people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age contributory pension.  From November of this year a yearly average of between 15 and 19 will give a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 will give a pension of 50 per cent of the maximum rate.  To qualify a person will also need to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions.  Adult and child dependant allowances will be payable at the full rate.</P>
      <P>I am also signalling that from 6 April 2002 all claimants will require 260 paid contributions to qualify for old age contributory pension or retirement pension.  This requirement will increase to 520 contributions from 6 April 2012 onwards.</P>
      <P>These proposals are broadly in line with the recommendations contained in the final report of the National Pensions Board &ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In relation to the self-employed any person who was over 56 in April 1988 when insurance for the self-employed was introduced, and who also had paid social insurance at the full rate at any stage between 1953 and 1988, will receive a refund of the pensions element of their class S social insurance contributions provided, of course, that he-she does not qualify for an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  Up to now their earlier contributions would have prohibited them from receiving such a refund.</P>

    <P>The increase in advertising in the provincial papers during 1994 was due to a series of new schemes and significant changes to existing schemes introduced i.e. back to work allowance, survivors pensions, PRSI exemption and voluntary and community grants schemes including locally based mens and womens groups and respite care scheme.</P>
    <P>In 1996 the Departments regional offices became more active in the assessment of grant applications under the various voluntary and community grants schemes requiring a major promotion of the schemes in local newspapers.  Also advertised widely in the national and local newspapers was the disability allowance scheme, the various initiatives under task force for the elderly and the anti-fraud campaign.</P>

      <P>The Council of Ministers for Social <Col N="1231" /> Affairs, at a meeting on 2 December 1996 during the Irish Presidency, agreed a directive amending Directive 86/378/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes. The directive which has since been formally adopted will be published shortly in the Official Journal.  The amendments provided for are designed to ensure that Directive 86/378/EEC, as amended, is consistent with Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, as interpreted by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the Barber and related judgments.  Article 119 requires for equal pay, including occupational benefit, for men and women doing like work.</P>
      <P>The terms of the amending directive are required to be transposed into national law by 1 July 1997.  The provisions of Directive 86/378/EEC have already been transposed into national law in part VII of the Pensions Act.  This part has also been amended on a number of occasions since 17 May 1990 &mdash; date of the Barber judgment &mdash; to bring its provisions into line with various judgments of the European Court. The pensions board are currently examining the new amending directive and will be reporting to me shortly on the remaining legislative changes required to transpose its provisions into Part VII of the Pensions Act.</P>
      <P>There are no other directives, regulations or conventions for which my Department has responsibility awaiting transposal into Irish law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 235 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first question dealing with the issue of increases in motor insurance costs, I would refer the Deputy to the detailed and comprehensive reply given by the Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology to the House on this issue on 4 February 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second question regarding research into comparative motor insurance premiums in Ireland and other European countries, the results of a survey comparing the price of insurance premiums among various categories of driver in the UK, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Ireland in incorporated in the recently <Col N="1233" /> published Deloitte and Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland. This survey was based on premium quotations obtained from a number of insurance companies in each of these countries.  The companies were asked for their rates for 1990, 1992 and 1994 in respect of 36 risk combinations covering different age and vehicle categories.</P>
    <P>In general, the Deloitte and Touche survey found that Irish private motor insurance premiums were the highest of the countries surveyed.  Excluding younger drivers, who pay higher rates everywhere, the UK was 48 per cent lower, Denmark 10 per cent lower, France 21 per cent lower and Holland 6 per cent lower.  However, the report found that the differences in premium rates quoted between Ireland and the other European countries narrowed over the period 1990-1994.</P>
    <P>For the information of the Deputy the detailed results of the comparative study are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Comparison with the UK</i>
    </P>
    <P>Over the period 1990 to 1994, aggregate average Irish motor premiums quoted for the 36 risk types increased by 30 per cent whereas UK quoted premiums rose by 49 per cent.  This reduced the gap between Irish and UK rates &mdash; total UK rates were 56 per cent of Irish rates in 1990, converging to 74 per cent in 1994.</P>
    <P>The comparison is disproportionately affected by high UK rates for the 21 year age group, where UK rates for comprehensive cover exceed Irish. Eliminating 21 year olds from the comparison, UK rates on average are 52 per cent of Irish rates, unchanged since 1990.</P>
    <P>For male drivers in the 27 and 40 age groups the differences range from 23 per cent to 30 per cent lower than Irish rates for comprehensive and 27 per cent to 47 per cent lower than Irish rates for non-comprehensive.</P>
    <P>In summary, young drivers pay the same or slightly higher in the UK than in Ireland for comprehensive cover and about 33 per cent less for non-comprehensive, but otherwise Irish rates are about twice UK rates.</P>
    <P>With regard to claims comparisons with the UK market, the difference in premiums is broadly proportional to the difference in motor claims costs in each State.  Although UK drivers lodge more claims &mdash; car theft is more common in Britain &mdash; the average Irish motor claims estimate was over four times the UK average and the claims bill per registered vehicle &mdash; as a proxy for motor policy numbers &mdash; was nearly three times the UK's.</P>
    <P>The difference is partly structural.  Britain has relatively more claims involving low cost damage to vehicles, because they have a higher proportion of comprehensive policies which are offered with cheap no-claims bonus protection, and because they have more urban driving <Col N="1234" /> characterised by low-speed &ldquo;fender bender&rdquo; collisions in traffic.  Ireland has a large rural road network and a lower traffic density &mdash; nine private cars per km of road as against 56 in the UK &mdash; which increases the proportion of high-speed accidents involving personal injury.</P>
    <P>Under the 1986 Health (Amendment) Act, Irish road traffic accident victims are charged an &ldquo;economic recovery rate&rdquo; which is twice the rate for VHI members or private patients, to be recovered against the insurance companies, whereas UK hospitals charge normal national health service rates.</P>
    <P>Motor car spare parts are estimated to be 28 per cent more expensive in Ireland than in the UK &mdash; IIF Survey December 1995.  A quarter of motor claims costs are due to material damage, of which perhaps half is due to purchase of spares. Deloitte and Touche estimated that spare parts prices contribute at most 3.5 per cent to the difference in claim costs between Ireland and the UK.</P>
    <P>The cost of claims caused by uninsured drivers at 6 per cent is the same in both jurisdictions &mdash; Garda Siochána statistics.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Comparisons with other EU States</i>
    </P>
    <P>Deloitte and Touche found that, as with liability insurance premiums, comparison of motor premiums with Denmark, France and the Netherlands is complicated by different rating systems in each country.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Denmark</i>
    </P>
    <P>Danish premiums are lower than Irish by 31 per cent on average, or by 10 per cent if young drivers are excluded.  Denmark does not differentiate by age or gender but only by car type.  Premiums reduce for every accident-free year.  This means that by restricting all drivers in the questionnaire to three years accident-free driving the 21 year old is favoured; most drivers in this age group would not have three years driving experience. A major Danish insurer recently raised motor premiums by 50 per cent, and it is likely that Danish rates will soon match or exceed Ireland's.</P>
    <P>
      <i>France</i>
    </P>
    <P>Overall, the French rates are 25 per cent less than Irish, 21 per cent less if young drivers are excluded &mdash; young drivers' premiums are not as relatively expensive.  French rates have risen by 23 per cent between 1990 and 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Holland</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Dutch rates for comprehensive insurance are higher than Irish rates for the two larger motor categories, for the 27 year old and the 40 year old driver.  Overall, the Dutch rates are 16.5 per cent lower than Irish, 6 per cent if young drivers are excluded.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Deloitte study found that, for most categories of driver, there is a reasonably <Col N="1235" /> competitive market for motor insurance in Ireland.  Drivers belonging to groups characterised by maturity and good claims experience have seen their premiums reduce in real terms since 1990.  Young drivers as a group and individuals with poor safety records will have limited choice of insurer and will face high premium costs in Ireland as elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The report found that, following a period of rapid increases, motor insurance costs in Ireland have stabilised since 1991, and have declined for the most favourable risk groups.  The motor insurance market is relatively as competitive as in the UK, and is equitable in that premiums are related to the claims experience of groups of drivers.</P>

Part VIII, regulation 37 of the same regulations also provides that electrical equipment which is exposed to hazardous environments, including flammable or explosive substances or atmospheres, must be constructed and installed with due regard to preventing danger arising from such exposure.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Chemical Agents) Regulations, 1994 (S.I. No. 445 of 1994) outline clearly the duties of employers in relation to the prevention and limitation of exposure of employees to chemical agents in the workplace.  These activities are also governed by the Cellulose Solutions Regulations, 1939, (Statutory Rules and Orders No. 385 of 1939).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> I have no plans, at present, to introduce new regulations on controlling the use of spray paints in the workplace.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply by the Minister of State responsible for commerce, science and technology to the Adjournment Debate on 30 January 1997.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, recalled that he had met earlier that day with representatives of the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA) to discuss the increases in the price of beer over the past two months.  He went on to point out that: &ldquo;At the meeting it was established that a minority of Dublin publicans had taken a price increase over the last two months and this number has been rising over the last week.  At recent area meetings, the LVA had recommended price restraint at this time.  It was noted that in the recent budget, no further excise was imposed.  Both the LVA and the Minister agreed to call on these publicans to take immediate steps to bring their price levels back to those obtaining in early November 1996. If this dosen't happen forthwith, the Minister made clear that he will make a price fixing order retrospective to, and feezing prices at, the November 1996 level.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the meantime the LVA agreed unanimously at its meeting on 5 February that drink prices by its members would be brought back to its November 1996 level, and the competition authority has initiated an investigation, under section 11 of the Competition Acts, of the Irish drinks market, which shall comprehend a broad range of issues, focusing particularly on barriers to market entry and the impact of the licensing laws.</P>

    <P>Forbairt only assists those overseas industries in the food and natural resources sectors.  About 110 people are now employed in Forbairt client <Col N="1240" /> companies in these sectors in counties Sligo and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Significant developments under way in these counties include the construction of the Masonite plant in County Leitrim.  In 1996 over 350 people were employed in its construction which should be completed by mid-year.</P>
    <P>In addition, industrial land and buildings are being developed at the Finisklin estate in Sligo and this, together with other vacant building space in the county, will be aggressively promoted this year with the objective of attracting new investment.</P>
    <P>As indicated in reply to a number of questions on this issue in the Dáil last week, I have emphasised to the industrial development agencies Government policy on the regional distribution of employment opportunities and I am satisfied that every avenue, including financial where appropriate, is pursued to implement their statutory remit in this regard.  There are, however, limitations to the extent to which that policy can be enforced in relation to inward investment projects. In the final analysis, individual foreign investors themselves decide on the particular locations which best suit their own range of requirements.</P>

      <P>There is no EU initiative, as such, to establish a US-style food and drugs administration. It has, however, been mentioned by the EU Commission that it considers that it would be desirable to divide functions in regard to food safety between the Agriculture and Consumer Affairs Directorates, with the former being responsible for legislation and the latter for control on implementation.  In so far as my responsibilities extend I will favourably consider any initiative which may be presented which is aimed at strengthening the controls on food safety.</P>
      <P>In this regard the Government has already decided to establish a food safety authority whose functions will be primarily to audit the food safety controls carried out by Departments and official inspection agencies.</P>

      <P>This particular case has been the subject of extensive contacts between the farmer in question and my Department and has been assessed from a number of different perspectives. No common cause of the animal health difficulties being experienced on the farm has to date been identified.  My Department has now offered to undertake a programme, to be carried out by its veterinary laboratory service (VLS), under which it will periodically test livestock on the farm at regular intervals; in addition, it will undertake free of charge to the farmer in question, pathological testing at the Regional Veterinary Laboratory in Cork of material from the farm which may be submitted by the farmer or his veterinary surgeon.  Consideration of any more extensive investigation would be contingent on the completion by the farmer in question of certain farm improvements which have been indicated as necessary by a study jointly carried out by the VLS and Teagasc in 1996 and which have been advised to him.  It is considered that the results of any such investigation would be prejudiced and its scientific worth devalued if such works are not first carried out.</P>

      <P>Measures adopted by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in October 1996 obliged member states to introduce an early marketing <Col N="1250" /> premium scheme for veal calves or the calf processing scheme.  As Ireland has no veal industry we are obliged under Council Regulation (EC) No. 2222/96 to introduce the calf processing premium scheme.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the measures is to assist in bringing the market into balance thereby assisting producer prices to recover to reasonable levels and orderly marketing to be restored within the EU and internationally.</P>
      <P>A processing premium of 120 ecu is payable on male dairy breed calves and 150 ecu on beef breed calves which are less than 20 days old.  The premium will be paid only on animals which are in a fit and healthy condition on presentation and are processed in conformity with the terms and conditions of the scheme.  Nine EU export licensed meat premises have been selected as processing centres and to date 144 calves have been processed under the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>the number and locations of markets which were open to Ireland in each of the years from 1990 to 1996 for live and carcase exports; if he will make a statement on the markets which are currently available for Irish cattle; and the action, if any, which is being taken for the expansion of these markets.</Quest>

      <P>Ireland trades freely in cattle and beef with over 80 countries around the world.  As regards live cattle, the principal markets are other EU countries, Libya and Egypt.  In so far as carcase <Col N="1252" /> beef is concerned, the main destination are the other EU countries, with some small quantities going to eastern Europe and, from time to time, to Iran.  The following tables illustrate the position in respect of the years 1990 to 1996.  It is worth noting that Ireland also exports substantial quantities of boneless beef to a wide variety of destinations.  For the sake of completeness figures are also attached in respect of the total beef export trade.</P>
      <P>Since the outbreak of BSE, Ireland has experienced a number of difficulties in its cattle trade with countries outside the EU.  Libya suspended imports from Ireland in May 1990 but lifted the restriction in late 1992.  However trade was again suspended in April 1996 when Libya imposed a ban on the import of all cattle and beef from Europe.  Egypt suspended imports of Irish cattle in 1990 but lifted the ban in 1992.  Trade continued unimpeded until January 1997 when the Egyptian authorities imposed a further ban.  The BSE-related difficulties have also affected the trade in carcase beef with Iran.  However this market is volatile, with exports liable to vary widely from year to year.</P>
      <P>Strenuous efforts are being made to have the markets in question reopened.  In so far as Egypt is concerned, the Egyptian authorities are currently considering the report of a high level veterinary delegation which visited Ireland last month. I am monitoring the situation closely and I am pressing for an early and favourable decision.  The position in relation to Libya is that renewed efforts are being made to finalise the visit of a technical delegation to Ireland.  I am also arranging for a veterinary delegation to visit Iran in the coming weeks with a view to resumption of that trade.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, my Department and I are working closely with the other agencies &mdash; Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia &mdash; to promote the quality and safety of Irish beef by means of diplomatic representation, promotional visits, attendance at trade fairs, technical delegations and other activities which have the effect of confirming and reinforcing the excellent image of Irish cattle and beef.  Following are the tables:</P>

      <P>My Department has received an application under the REP scheme from the person concerned.  It is one of a number which have elements of leased commonage for which payment is being claimed.  My Department has had lengthy discussions with the REPs planning agencies concerned and has now commenced discussions with the European Commission as to whether REPs payment can be made in these cases.  Decisions on payments in cases such as this will be made when these discussions have been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of an upsurge in pirate radio activity in recent years, particularly in the Dublin area.  Because pirate stations go on and off the air on a regular basis it is difficult to be precise as to the number involved.  However, in a recent monitoring exercise my Department established that there may be up to 17 such stations operating on the airwaves in Dublin from time to time.</P>
      <P>Given these numbers it appears to have become relatively easy for determined people to acquire the necessary equipment for illegal broadcasting.  On the other hand, it is sometimes difficult to identify the operators and the location of the transmissions due, for instance, to the transient nature of the activity and the tendency of these stations to move about on the frequency bands.  This has led to difficulties in the effective enforcement of the law in this area.</P>
      <P>This function is among those to be transferred shortly to the new telecommunications regulator. My Department is in the course of a review of the enforcement procedures with a view to strengthening the regulator's enforcement powers. In the meantime, I want to make it clear that the full provisions of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Acts will be invoked against such stations where the circumstances allow, and those involved in illegal broadcasting, including businesses and people advertising on, or providing services to, illegal stations, should have no doubt that action may be taken against them at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government approved the provision of a new 120MW peat fired power station in the east midlands, it decided that the project should be implemented by an open competition to build, own and operate the new station.  It had been envisaged that the ESB power procurer would run the competition for the new peat power station.  In view of the ESB's wish to bid for the power station, every effort was made to find fair and transparent arrangements which would allow the ESB to bid <Col N="1260" /> and which would also have ensured the confidence of other bidders.</P>
      <P>Detailed legal advice was sought concerning the arrangements proposed for the competition. In spite of the best efforts to find a mechanism within the context of the ESB running the competition, legal advice indicated that independent experts should be employed to run the competition. The recruitment of consultants was conducted by competition under the EU procurement rules.  This is a complex consultancy assignment, covering a range of areas of expertise, with an overriding requirement for the consultants to carry out the assignment in an efficient and independent manner and for this reason the process took some time.  The consultants have been charged with the task of designing a framework for the competition and running the competition process itself.  They have been working on the project for the last few months and have almost completed their consideration of the framework for the competition.  Some further work is required on completing the project documentation and, allowing for that, I expect that the competition will be formally announced by the end of March.</P>

With regard to the Reserve Defence Force the position is that applications from officers to resign their commissions are processed by means of a memorandum for Government which is submitted on a quarterly basis.  The next such memorandum will be submitted at the end of March 1997.  To date, my Department has received only one application which will be included in that memorandum.  The application is from an officer of second-lieutenant rank who is serving with 8 Infantry Battalion FCA, Eastern Command.</P>

      <P>My Department completed its most recent review of Civil Defence in consultation with each local authority in early 1992.  This review resulted in the launch of the &ldquo;Towards 2000&rdquo; programme which consists of 12 development activities designed to focus the organisation to better serve the needs of the local community. These include stewarding, providing an enhanced search and rescue capability, river, lake and coastal area search and recovery, responding to radiological emergencies and environmental problems, assisting in hazardous weather conditions, forest fire fighting and evacuee reception.</P>
      <P>The Civil Defence organisation is administered on a local authority area rather than on a county basis.  At present there are about 6,000 active volunteers in the organisation and some 3,000 trained persons who are no longer active but are available in an emergency.</P>
      <P>The total expenditure by my Department on Civil Defence for the period 1990-96 was £16,481,921.  This expenditure in the main, related to grants to local authorities to cover local administration, training and maintenance of equipment. The balance related to capital purchases of vehicles and equipment by my Department for issue to the local authorities for Civil Defence use, the running of the Civil Defence school and the organisation of national exercises annually to assess the preparedness of Civil Defence volunteers for their main tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mission of the organisation is to facilitate, through the local authorities, Civil Defence responses for emergency relief and support to ensure the operation of vital services and the <Col N="1262" /> maintenance of public life and to provide other community supports as directed by the Government.</P>

Over 90 per cent of the operational sea-time of the Naval Service is occupied with this task.  Other roles carried out by the Naval Service, generally in support of other Departments, include search and rescue operations, aid to the civil power, drugs interdiction at sea, salmon fishery patrols and assistance with oil pollution control at sea.</P>

      <P>Occupational health and safety in the Defence Forces is co-ordinated by the Defence Forces Advisory Committee on Safety.  This committee, which has a positive and proactive interaction with the representative associations, was established shortly after the enactment of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and has been engaged in directing and monitoring a comprehensive implementation of the provisions of the Act.  The committee has remained in place as recommended in the report of the Advisory Committee on Defence Forces to the Health and Safety Authority.  The 1994 report of the Advisory Committee to the Health and Safety Authority acknowledged the excellent work undertaken by the Defence Forces and specifically <Col N="1267" /> acknowledged the excellent work done in the area of education and training.</P>

      <P>Defence Force regulations provide for the payment of subsistence allowance to military personnel in respect of those occasions where they perform duties away from their stations and are not provided with meals.  This does not arise frequently, however, as there is a comprehensive catering system in place in the Defence Forces, in which there has been heavy investment, to cope with feeding troops in the field.  Claims for subsistence allowance must be certified by the officer commanding the claimant's unit.  Separate records are not maintained by my Department in respect of subsistence allowance payable for BSE-related operations and, regrettably therefore, the precise details sought by the Deputy are not available.</P>

      <P>The Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Department are working intensively together to ensure that all our fishery surveillance resources are deployed to maximum effect.  Since 1 January 1996, all fishing vessels over 18 metres entering or leaving the Irish zone have had to report their entry and exit in advance to the fishery protection services. These reports, together with the data provided by the aerial surveillance flights of the CASA aircraft, are transmitted electronically to fishery patrol vessels at sea.</P>
      <P>The combination of aerial surveillance and entry/exit reporting data has enabled increasingly accurate and effective targeting by our patrol vessels and is providing a detailed overview of both the patterns and levels of fishing activity in Irish waters.  This control and enforcement regime backed up by stringent penalties is paying dividends. Boardings of fishing vessels increased in 1996 while the level of detentions proportionately decreased.  Additional EU measures including the introduction of satellite monitoring together with &ldquo;realtime&rdquo; catch reporting which are scheduled for 1998, will further enhance our ability to monitor and deal with illegal fishing activity.</P>

These proceedings concluded on 27 September 1996 at the maritime tribunal at Lorient when both men were found guilty of negligence for their part in the sinking of the <i>Orchidee</i>.  They were sentenced to one year and to three months imprisonment, respectively.  Both sentences were suspended for five years on the strict condition that no further offences of any sort were committed.</P>
      <P>My Department is awaiting a report on the proceedings of the maritime tribunal from the French authorities.  Once this is received, the Department's own investigation into this accident, which had necessarily been suspended because of the French legal action, will be completed and a report made available, subject to normal legal considerations.</P>

      <P>Pending enactment of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, which will provide for a new licensing and regulatory <Col N="1271" /> framework for aquaculture, licence applicants are being assessed and, where appropriate and possible, determined under the existing statutory regime provided under the Fisheries and Foreshore Acts.  The assessment and public consultative process in respect of the licence application in question is not yet complete.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill provides that an application for a fish culture licence received by the Minister but not as yet determined, will be deemed as an application for an aquaculture licence on commencement of section 74 of the Bill and will be determined accordingly.  Section 74 of the Bill also provides that where public notice procedures have been undertaken that they do not have to be repeated.</P>

      <P>The Harbours Act, 1996, provides for the transfer of a number of small &ldquo;non-commercial&rdquo; harbours from harbour authorities to local authorities. Once transferred, the relevant local authorities will be responsible for the control, management, operation and development of the harbours in question.  The local authorities will be empowered to introduce bye-laws for the good rule and government of these harbours.</P>
      <P>I have no guidelines as such for the local authorities in question.  I should mention, however, that quite a number of local authorities are already responsible for harbours, piers and landing stages around the country.  I am convinced, therefore, that there is already in existence a wealth of expertise which could be tapped into through the forum of, for example, the County and City Managers Association.  I should add that my Department will be available to assist with advice where appropriate and relevant.</P>

    <P>Preparatory work for the transposition of many of these directives is at an advanced stage and it is my intention that all these will be transposed into Irish law as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>EU regulations, once they come into force, form part of Irish law without any need for transposition.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Deputy, in referring to EU conventions has in mind international agreements, falling within my Department's area of responsibility which have been signed by Ireland but have not been ratified.  An amendment of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974, was adopted in London on 29 November 1995 under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation and was <Col N="1274" /> signed by Ireland on that occasion.  Ratification is proposed as soon as the necessary implementation measures are in place.</P>
    <P>In the field of marine environment, the 1992 Protocols to the international convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, and the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971, will be acceded to and ratified when preparations, including necessary legislation currently being drafted, have been completed.  This proposed legislation will also allow the Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness Response and Co-operation to be ratified.</P>
    <P>In fisheries matters, the UN Agreement on Straddling Stocks was adopted in New York in August 1995.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is currently taking the necessary steps to allow for Ireland's accession to and ratification of this agreement.  It is intended also to accede to and ratify a number of conventions and Protocols, adopted under the auspices of the Brussels International Maritime Law Conventions and the International Maritime Organisation, relating to the liability of shipowners and others.  The Merchant Shipping (Liability of Shipowners and Others) Act, 1996, effects the necessary changes to domestic law to allow ratification of these conventions and Protocols.</P>

      <P>Progress on implementing harmonised tonnage measurement throughout the EU has been slow. It is still the case that GT values for fishing vessels are not consistently available, with vessels continuing to be measured in a variety of ways depending on the methodology employed in the member state concerned.
