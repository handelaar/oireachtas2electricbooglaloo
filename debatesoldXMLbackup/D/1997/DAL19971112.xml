      <Quest>if he has received the report of the Strategic Management Initiative on the Garda, which was commissioned by the previous Government; if so, the date on which the report was received by him; when it is intended to bring it to Government; when it is intended to publish the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The report in question was received by my predecessor on 11 June 1997.  It will be submitted to Government shortly and will be published following Government consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not think the general public would find it extraordinary that he sat on this report given that the Government is in its fifth month and came to power on the basis that it would fight crime and make all the difference?  Will he explain to the general public why he has been unable to bring it to Cabinet and has been unwilling to publish it?  Does he consider there are serious implications in terms of contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Constitution?  Is he aware that the report has been widely leaked to the newspapers?  As a consequence will he place it in the public arena immediately?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important report.  I appreciate the efforts of those who worked to complete it.  In view of its scale and complexity I have an obligation to look at it and most of its recommendations require detailed and careful consideration.  It is not just a matter of publication, there is a need to do something about the important policy issues raised.  There is danger that a number of human rights and other provisions might be breached if they are not properly examined.  That is what we are engaged in.</P>
      <P>This is one of a number of reports correctly commissioned by the previous Administration on the criminal justice system covering the Garda Síochána, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General, the Chief State Solicitor, the courts and prison systems.  They are interrelated and because of this there is a need to deal with them collectively.  A number have been published. I am committed to an overall assessment to deal with them in a co-ordinated and comprehensive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree this is a failure of Government, that he has been sitting on this report and not acted on it?  We have reached the point where it has been leaked to the newspapers in recent weeks.  The taxpayer has paid for it.  Since he has delayed for so long will the Taoiseach agree that it is time to publish it? Everybody accepts the Cabinet will have to discuss and consider aspects of it but we have gone beyond the point where we can treat it as a document that is not in the public arena.  The public has been given an abridged version through the newspapers.  The Taoiseach bears responsibility for this sorry state of affairs.  Will he at least rectify the damage by placing the full report in the public arena so that the public will know what it contains and the implications of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report has not been sat on, and it is not a sorry state of affairs.  It is important that the issues raised in it are dealt with.  I have referred to a number of them.  Since various reports dealing with the Garda, the courts, the prisons, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor's office reach the same conclusion, it is important that their implications for our criminal justice system be considered together.  The Deputy will be aware that a further criminal justice Bill will be published shortly. There will be many other changes highlighted by the report of the Strategic Management Initiative on the Garda and other areas which will need to be and will be examined.  It is not unusual nowadays for some of the data contained in such reports to have been in the public domain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that the then Opposition spokesman on Justice, now Minister for Justice, Deputy John O'Donoghue, called for the immediate publication of this report on 21 May last even before its receipt in the Department of the Taoiseach?  Can the Taoiseach <Col N="1011" /> explain why the Minister for Justice, who now has an opportunity to influence its publication, has not had it published?  Am I correct in understanding from the Taoiseach that he does not intend to publish this report until he has taken decisions on all of its recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy O'Donoghue may have said at that time is a matter for him.  I am setting out the present position, which is that I will publish this report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a general health warning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as soon as some of our work on it is ready.  I am not saying we will await completion of all of the work.  It contains a number of sensitive issues, of which the Deputy will be aware, some of which relate to Garda pay, conditions and so on which are being dealt with. I do not intend to place that report in the public domain until some of those issues have been moved along.  Other than that specific one, I am glad examination of the other issues has been done fairly comprehensively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in understanding the Taoiseach's Department has been considering the implications of this and some other reports and that he will not be in a position to bring any memorandum to Government until those considerations have been completed.  Since his Department has no operational responsibility for anything other than the strategic management initiative in respect of the operations of the Office of the Attorney General, the Chief State Solicitor's office or for the Garda through the Department of Justice, can he indicate what specific action, if any, has been taken in his, or the relevant line Departments?  Is there a working document or draft memorandum?  Will the document the Taoiseach will bring to Government accompanying this set of reports be a memorandum prepared by him recommending certain proposals or will the Department of Justice bring forward a memorandum proposing the implementation of the results of whatever discussions will have taken place in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since a substantial amount of this report relates to the strategic management initiative &mdash; the organisation, recruitment, methods of dealing with members of the Garda Síochána and their promotional aspects &mdash; I will deal with many of its objectives and structures. All but one of the detailed recommendations set out in the report are being dealt with by the Minister for Justice.  I will bring forward proposals on the strategic management initiative whereas the Minister for Justice has been dealing with its recommendations in respect of criminal justice issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that his and other parties identified crime as one of the most urgent national priorities in recent times?  Furthermore, does he agree that, whenever this report is published, there will have to be a public debate before its recommendations are implemented?  If the crime issue is an urgent one, does he not agree that the sensible thing for him to have done would have been to publish the report in full on receipt rather than await an internal Government debate before taking the public into its confidence on the issues that have to be decided?  Would that not have been a better way to have dealt with the issue urgently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Deputy received the report on 11 June last, to follow the logic of his argument, no doubt he would then have published it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He was right not to have done so, since its contents cover many aspects requiring consideration.  Taken with the other reports the Deputy commissioned, it comprises a worthwhile study all of which is being considered in conjunction with the preparation of the additional criminal justice Bill and other matters.  Many of the recommendations in this report are similar to proposals we are examining for the Bill which will be published shortly.  My work on the report in terms of its SMI aspects is almost complete, but Minister O'Donoghue's work is not and will not be for some time.  That report and the other reports are at a stage where I will be able to deal with them shortly, possibly in a matter of weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is being slowed down by the lethargy of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who called for this report to be published last May, has not completed work which is preventing its being published in November?  Does the Taoiseach agree that it suggests a gap between the intentions expressed by the Minister before he came into office and his ability to perform after that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to say the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will shortly introduce important criminal justice legislation. He has already made some useful changes to the structures of the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept there is public disquiet at the approach taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? He has been responsible for a number of U-turns on what was perceived as fundamental Government policy.  He is now sitting on a report which should be in the public arena.  Does the Taoiseach accept that even in the Government's deliberations on this report he would be assisted by public comment?  Why is he closing off the possibility of the public, which I have no doubt paid well for this report, having its input?  Is this a new style of Government &mdash; the opposite of openness and accountability, namely closure and secrecy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy read the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, she would not find anything in this report other than SMI issues.  As the Deputy might remember when she was a Minister of State, the previous Government asked Deloitte &amp; Touche to prepare an interim report which is the basis for many of the changes recommended in this fine report on the Garda Síochána. However, there are other issues which deserve deliberation.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will visit the Stormont negotiations in view of the fact that the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, attended Stormont in October 1997; and his views on the current state of the talks process.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18903/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have visited Northern Ireland on two occasions since I became Taoiseach.  The first was to address the biannual conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 1 July, and the second occasion was when I visited Derry and met John Hume on 10 October.  I propose to make further visits to Northern Ireland at appropriate times depending on invitations I receive and events that take place.</P>
      <P>There has been an initial exploration of each of the agenda items under the three strands in the talks.  Participants have set out their positions and have responded to questions about them.  The Government is anxious to see the talks get down to detailed negotiations and develop a momentum towards the agreement which we all seek and which, for our part, we will do everything possible to bring about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Taoiseach as ucht an fhreagra sin.  I thank the Taoiseach for his answer and am glad he confirmed he will be visiting the negotiations.  This is very important in asserting the common ownership <Col N="1014" /> of the talks by all parties and both Governments.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the lack of progress at the Stormont talks is a cause for grave concern, especially the failure of the Ulster Unionist Party to engage constructively in the negotiations, thus preventing movement forward? Mr. Paisley and his allies, including a former Member of this House and Government Minister, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, are trying to wreck the talks from the outside.  The Ulster Unionist Party is engaged in sabotage from the inside. Would the Taoiseach also agree that the issues of prisoners and demilitarisation remain neglected by the British Government?  British military fortifications have been extended in South Armagh during the negotiations.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the position of Irish political prisoners in England.  Four men are entering their 22nd year of incarceration &mdash; Joe O'Connell, Hugh Doherty, Harry Duggan and Eddie Butler. There is no indication of a transfer or release date in their cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already posed one question in my supplementary.  Will the Taoiseach reflect the alarm the situation is causing and emphasise to the British Government the importance of the vital issues of confidence building, equality and the central need for real progress at the talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy.  I am not sure if he made a speech or asked a question.  All parties come to the talks with their own objectives and priorities.  There is no doubt that the talks are difficult.  Over the past few weeks in all the strands we have had explorations of the initial positions of each of the parties.  Each party has presented its paper and we have had questions and answers on those papers.  I share the view of my ministerial colleagues who have been attending the talks on a weekly basis that the discussions and negotiations are at a difficult stage involving many issues, including some of those correctly raised by the Deputy.  It is our assessment that we can make progress with the determination, good will and willingness of all the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having gone through the initial assessment and presentation of papers across the strands it is hoped that we will be able to inject greater momentum into the talks than has been the case over the past few weeks.  We hope that there will <Col N="1015" /> be greater dialogue and an understanding by all of the essential need to inject the &lsquo;South African momentum&rsquo; into the talks.</P>
    <P>We are conscious of the need for confidence building measures for all groups, Unionists, loyalists, Nationalists and republicans.  The prisoners issue affects all groups and it is regularly raised by them.  I have highlighted confidence building measures such as the prisoners issue, the Bloody Sunday report, the need to deal with education, community involvement and industry with the British Government, the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Murphy and other Ministers I have met in recent weeks.  I will do so again when I meet the Prime Minister next week.  There is useful dialogue, contacts and work going on at the talks.  It requires the efforts of everyone to give the talks greater momentum in the weeks before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it is a matter of some urgency that the pace of the talks be intensified?  A plenary to examine progress in the decommissioning issue will take place, as agreed, from 1 to 3 December, and if that plenary is not to be taken up exclusively and unproductively with decommissioning issues, it is important that there is substantial progress to report in the three strands.  Will the Taoiseach consider attending that plenary, if he can satisfy himself in the meantime that progress is being made?  Does he agree that perhaps the format of discussion needs to be changed, with a more active role for the Chair and more use of bilateral and multilateral meetings, rather than the present format?  If we continue with the present format there is a risk the parties will surf the agenda, so to speak, for the next number of weeks up to the December meeting.  Will the Taoiseach agree we need to inject much greater pace into the discussions at this stage if the very tight deadlines set for the talks are to be met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The need to progress the talks more speedily is self-evident, and I agree with what the Deputy said on that matter.  For the next two weeks the format will change in the hope of speeding up negotiations.  The chairman will directly engage in a process of bilateral negotiations with all of the parties, taking from the various presentations of all parties over the past four weeks.  Through those negotiations, he hopes to frame what is important and what needs to be brought forward into the joint meeting which will take place in early December.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and other Ministers will be engaged in those bilateral negotiations next week; in some cases we hope to engage a number of parties.  The following week I hope to meet the leaders of the political parties who will attend, as we agreed in July, so that we can get a clear emphasis on what we should do as a Government. Next week, on the margins of the employment summit in Luxembourg, I will review with the <Col N="1016" /> British Prime Minister and his officials precisely what the two Governments can do together in the coming few weeks.  In addition, a meeting of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation will be held in early December.</P>
      <P>Over the next few weeks we hope we can get all parties to engage directly with each other.  We hope also that we can get the chairman with the parties into bilateral negotiations to try to move their agendas forward and allow them state their objectives more clearly than they have in the past four weeks.  These weeks will be crucial.  If we lost time or the momentum between now and Christmas as Deputy Bruton stated, it would be a setback in view of the tight programme that has been set between now and early summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to press the Taoiseach unduly on this because it may not be a good idea, but will he at least consider the possibility of attending the bi-monthly review plenary in December with a view to giving this matter extra emphasis, bearing in mind that if we do not make progress by the December plenary we are then into the Christmas period, a slow resumption of the talks perhaps in January followed soon after by the February bi-monthly plenary?  Progress may not have been made by then and within two months of the February bi-monthly plenary we are very near to the May deadline.  Without any disrespect to the Ministers who are doing good work, will the Taoiseach agree that he needs to become involved between now and 1 to 3 December with a view to moving matters forward so that we have something substantial before the plenary in December and not just a &ldquo;mark time&rdquo; report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are important meetings taking place this month to move some of those issues forward.  Arrangements have been made for me to engage in some of the issues raised by the Deputy at an appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of a view among the parties in the Stormont talks that there is a general lack of information in the South about what is happening, the workings of the talks and the progress being made?  Will he urge non-governmental organisations and other parties to travel to Stormont and meet with parties in addition to efforts I hope the Government will be making to advance the talks process?  The Green Party and I will be present on 24 November to meet Unionists and Nationalists.  Would the Taoiseach welcome such an initiative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of what is happening are in the public domain.  Not much of what is happening is hidden.  There is an agreement among those in the talks that certain matters will not be put in the public domain in order to provide an opportunity to build confidence between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> I have no difficulty with people going to Stormont once the appropriate arrangements are made.  I emphasise that the forum meeting which will take place on 5 December &mdash; although dates have still to be agreed by all parties &mdash; will be seen as important and part of the process of trying to achieve something before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Overriding priority should be given to progress in Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy, but the forum meeting is significant.  I am giving Deputy Bruton the view of the parties who are anxious that that meeting take place.  The talks are taking place in Belfast and what happens within the three strands and the various subcommittees is the main issue, but there are other meetings which I am sure Deputy Bruton accepts are important and which take place on the margins of these meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there is a clear and important distinction between confidence building and substantive negotiation?  The only place substantive negotiation can take place is in the talks in Belfast and priority must be given by both Governments to making progress on the substantive issues in negotiations.  While confidence building of the kind the Taoiseach refers to is perhaps helpful to all parties, given the short timeframe the emphasis must be on rapidly moving forward the talks chaired by Senator Mitchell and his colleagues.</P>

      <P>While Deputy Bruton is correct, he should understand that we are still engaged in trying to get people to talk to each other.  There is a difference between being in the one room and engaging with each other.  We have no difficulty here with engaging with each other but it is a difficulty in the talks process.  For people to engage they must have confidence and to have confidence we have to have confidence building measures.  That is why it is so important.</P>

      <P>The Government will be considering proposals in relation to constitutional issues which arise from commitments in party manifestos, developments in relation to revisions to the European Treaty and recommendations from the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. I have previously indicated a willingness to consider further the Cabinet confidentiality issue in the light of the work of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and the actual <Col N="1018" /> operation of the Moriarty and Flood tribunals. When decisions for constitutional change are taken on these issues, the Government's position will be announced and any necessary legislation brought forward.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the experience of the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality was an absolute shambles?  Does he recognise there is a need to revisit that amendment to deal both with its deficiencies and the serious deficiencies in the way the Government presented it to the public?  There was a shocking level of spoilt votes.  The number of spoilt votes was greater than the margin between the yes and no votes.</P>
      <P>The public was bewildered and confused by the lack of information provided and the information which was presented was unreadable.  I have not yet met anyone who understood the purpose of the amendment from reading the newspaper advertisements.  Does the Taoiseach accept that if he does not deal with this issue, revisit it and present another amendment to the people he is simply feeding the cynicism about politics which is building up?  Does he not feel there is an onus on him to state publicly where he stands?  It is not enough for the Taoiseach to say he is prepared to look at the issue at some time in the future in a particular context.  This is a real issue.  We have all seen that it is an experience which can go badly wrong.</P>
      <P>I remind the Taoiseach that he was dependent on the support of the Opposition when his own colleagues in Government were very vocal against him and his position on this amendment. The Taoiseach has a duty to respond positively on this issue in the public interest.</P>

      <P>Legislation was prepared on the basis that two tribunals were up and running. It was felt that legislation had been well analysed and I decided to proceed with it.  The Bill was presented to the Dáil and the debate on it was one of the most lively we have had on legislation in this House and in the Seanad where I also dealt with the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Supreme Court decision set down a process to be followed in relation to referenda. A commission was set up and members of the Bar Council were asked to prepare the cases for and against the amendment.  Those cases were subsequently advertised in the national media and put to the people.  That is precisely what happened. The Deputy asked whether I believe that people clearly understood this issue.  Obviously a number of them did not.  We have had far bigger issues in referenda than this one.  I did not receive any letters from anyone who had lost any sleep over this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy O'Malley lost too much sleep over this issue.  He put his case in this House as did others.  Far more people voted in the recent referendum than did in other referenda.  There was only a 29 per cent turn out in the bail referendum and people understood that issue very well.  Cases were put forward by a number of Deputies.  Deputies Howlin and O'Keeffe, who were present during the entire debate, asked me to have these other issues looked at by the Constitution review group when it was set up, and I agreed to do so.  There was agreement across the House at that stage to consider whether this change was too limited and, based on the conclusions of the tribunals, to look at the issue again.  I repeat that I will be happy to do that.</P>
      <P>As to the ability of Government, following the Supreme Court decision, to explain referenda more fully, that is a matter we should look at. There seems to be a case being made by the people that we should look at another way of putting forward cases at referenda so that they can be explained in a more thorough way.  That being so, we in this House have an obligation to examine the means we used in this and a number of referenda recently.  I will be glad to do that.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the implication of his last remark is that the Government will need to introduce legislation to govern the provision of information at referenda and have that legislation tested as to its constitutionality so that it will come into effect before we have the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty?  Would the Taoiseach agree that there is a considerable risk that that referendum might not go the way all of us in this House would wish it to go, because of an information deficit?  Would he further agree that there is a serious obligation on political parties in this House not just to publish articles in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; and we are grateful to <i>The Irish Times</i> for allowing us to do so &mdash; in favour of or, as in one case, against the proposal, but to inform voters in their constituencies on a house to house basis about the implications of constitutional amendment proposals? That is part of our obligation as political parties in this House, part of the purpose for which we are given public funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last part of what Deputy Bruton said.  We are obliged to use our own resources and our own voluntary workers to do that.  It is something we have to reflect on in future referenda.  This one was more complicated than some of the others.  We have just begun to examine how precisely we will deal with this issue.  There is the difficulty that if one strongly believes in something and wants to get it passed one is prohibited from doing so.  We have to analyse how that can be overcome.  The <i>ad hoc</i> group which was set up following the Supreme Court ruling has laid down that the case for and against should be put, but we were not instructed as to what means we should use to do that.  That was done in respect of this referendum but it is too limited a way to adequately sell a referendum with which practically everyone in this House agrees.  Admittedly the amendment in question had its faults, and nobody was able to quantify them, but it achieved what we were trying to achieve.  Many people who have only read a few articles on it seem to have become experts on the issue.  However, the people who spent over two years examining the issue in detail believe they reached the only conclusion they could reach.  It is not true to say it is a simple matter of revisiting it and finding a formula that is adequate for a constitutional amendment.</P>

      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's view and that of his colleagues in Government that the constraints imposed by the McKenna judgment seriously inhibited this Administration with regard to the provision of information to the public on a measure in respect of a referendum that passed both Houses of the Oireachtas?  If that is the case will he clarify his response to the question posed by Deputy Bruton to the effect that the Government is considering the introduction of legislation which would enable the Government of the day with perhaps a two-thirds <Col N="1021" /> majority in both Houses to vigorously sell a referendum to the public and that he would have the legal authority to do so which he currently does not?  Will he outline a timetable because two very important referenda are on the way?  The first deals with the Amsterdam Treaty; the treaty is not all that significant but the referendum is.  The second will be a plebiscite-referendum on the successful outcome of talks in Stormont.  Whatever about one's attitude to either issue, it is important that the public is better informed than for the previous referendum.</P>

      <P>It is only ten days or so since that referendum and the Government has no memoranda on the issue.  However it will examine it.  If one believes passionately in an issue and there are extreme limits on what can be done to sell it, then there is a problem.  The Government will discuss whether this can be done legislatively or in some other way.  No conclusions have been reached but at least two and probably, in terms of the work of the all party committee on the Constitution in the immediate years ahead, several important referenda will be proposed.  They must be sold by the political system otherwise we will not achieve what we are here to achieve.  An examination will take place but no conclusions have been reached or any decision made on any line to be taken.</P>

Will he further accept that it was examined by the Whitaker committee and the all party committee on the Constitution proposed in its first report the establishment of an independent commission consisting of the Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the Clerk of the Dáil, the Clerk of the Seanad and a judge which would have the power and responsibility to deal with the information deficit and to allocate funding on an equitable basis for a proper debate?

Will he and the Cabinet give consideration to voting thresholds for future referenda in light of the poor endorsement of this proposal?  In considering legislation will he look at the position in Switzerland where <Col N="1022" /> referenda are held frequently and different issues are put to the people on the same day?

Will he also agree that we can take no risks in this regard and that any measures the Government has in mind to allow more information to be provided to the public in regard to referenda must be in place before the treaty is put to the public?  Will he further agree that Switzerland is a very good example of a country which has become paralysed by referenda?

      <P>My officials have kept the EU Commission informed of all developments in relation to the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> If the consultancy study concludes that an on-street light rail system is the preferred option and the application for a light railway order is approved on the basis proposed by CIE, construction could get under way early in 1999 and take about three years to finish.  On the basis of this timetable it could be possible to complete the project by end 2001.  Under EU Structural Funds regulations expenditure incurred up to end 2000 is eligible for grant assistance.  The Commission has a discretion to allow an extension, normally for a further year.  Such a decision would facilitate the full drawdown of EU funds in respect of the project, based on an end 2001 completion date.</P>
    <P>If the consultancy study concludes that an underground section in the city centre is the preferred option, this will necessitate a redesign of CIE's current proposals and will defer completion of the project beyond 2001.  The mid-term review of the Community Support Framework provides that a review of the EU funding allocated for the light rail project will take place next spring and it is anticipated that this will coincide with the completion of the underground study.</P>
    <P>I have arranged a meeting with the Commissioner for Regional Policy and Cohesion, Monika Wulf-Mathies, on 28 November to discuss matters of mutual interest, including the Dublin light rail scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that the Minister has not already had a discussion with the Commissioner for Regional Policy and Cohesion on this matter?  As the monitoring committee of the Community Support Framework, which oversees expenditure across the whole Structural Fund spectrum, decided in July that &ldquo;if in the spring of 1998 it cannot be proven that sufficient progress has been achieved to secure the likely completion of Luas within the existing agreed timescale, all or part of the funds will be decommitted and reallocated&rdquo;, and given that a public inquiry must be carried out after the consultancy study, has the Minister received assurances that the study will not put in jeopardy EU funding for Luas?</P>

The Commissioner will visit the North on 28 November and will travel to Dublin on the enterprise train via Dundalk.  I will meet her that evening and we will have a full discussion on the matter.  I am satisfied the money will be drawn down and we will have a light rail system for Dublin which will best suit its needs. As I continue to examine this matter I am convinced it is proper that a study be carried out of the underground option, which was not done heretofore by an objective group.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the provision of a properly assessed light rail system.  There is no prevarication on that issue. There is a perception that the money from Europe will be sufficient for a complete light rail system, but it will finance the Tallaght to Dublin line and Dublin city to Dundrum line to the tune of £114 million while the Exchequer will provide £106 million.

It is useful to have an opportunity to clarify that point. I am aware of the report of the monitoring committee, but the Government is committed to a light rail system in Dublin.  I cannot understand why a proper objective study was not carried out of the underground system.  Rather than say afterwards that is what we should have done, we are looking at that option now.

      <P>The matters to which the Deputy referred must be addressed.  In deference to the Irish haulage business generally and the economy, it is my intention to introduce a new road transport Bill in the next session of the Dáil, but a number of factors impinge on the timing of its introduction. Efforts are continuing to develop a suitable provision to enable effective enforcement of road transport legislation in respect of out-of-State hauliers.  The Bill published by the previous Government did not deal with this important and complex issue.  A draft provision is with the Office of the Attorney General for consideration. There have been developments at European Union level regarding a directive concerning access to the profession of road haulage and bus operators which may require legislative change.  I am also proposing that the carriage of dangerous goods Bill be given priority.  That Bill is required to enable Ireland accede to the European agreement on the carriage of dangerous goods by road and to bring two EU directives on the carriage of dangerous goods by road into Irish law.  I hope to publish the dangerous goods Bill before Christmas.</P>

Will he examine this problem in the context of Northern Ireland where, if our hauliers break the law, the law in that jurisdiction can be applied to them?  The model in Northern Ireland could be applied here.</P>

      <P>I am benefiting from the frustration endured by Deputy Stagg and the work he put into bringing the legislation to its present stage, and I thank him.  I agree with the Deputy's analysis of the situation.  However, the provision regarding out of State hauliers deals only with breaches of road transport legislation and not with road traffic legislation.  Finding a workable solution is proving difficult.  There is no point in bringing forward an unworkable provision which would fall into disuse in a short time.  A new provision has been drafted with the assistance of the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and is with the Attorney General.  I intend to include the provision in the Bill when it is published.</P>

      <P>Will the Department examine the position of large hauliers in the meantime?  Many have offices in this jurisdiction, mainly on the docks, although the offices may not carry the hauliers' names.  Perhaps summonses could be served on those offices so the hauliers can be brought to heel under current law until the Minister of State's work on the legislation is brought to fruition.</P>

      <Quest>if her Department has ever carried out a study into the proportion of households in the country which will be unable to receive MMDS service; and if she will give details of the information she has in this regard.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has not carried out such a study.  The MMDS system was chosen as the system best suited to provide for the nationwide retransmission of television services in non-cable areas to a standard equivalent to that provided by cable relay.</P>
      <P>MMDS is a line of sight system and it is to be expected that difficulties can arise in some cases in the provision of television signals due, for example, to the signal being blocked by a topographical feature.  However, I am confident that in most cases there are technical solutions, such as the use of beambenders, which will overcome the difficulties and facilitate the provision of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> The legal function of licensing television retransmission systems is now a matter for the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, Ms Doyle.  It will be a matter for her to monitor the degree of success achieved by MMDS in maximising access to multi-channel services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>As this matter relates to the period prior to the Minister taking office, I ask her to objectively reflect on the answer she has given.  In the 1980s a decision was taken to give exclusivity to the MMDS retransmission system.  Before making such a decision, the first question which should have been asked was whether MMDS could cover every household in the country.  I have received technical assessments which state that between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of households which are not within cable areas cannot receive MMDS.  In other words, the beambenders for topographical problems will not produce coverage.</P>
      <P>I have also met the director who told me policy matters are the remit of the Minister.  People who cannot get MMDS are without multi-channel television and they look to the Minister to provide the service.  Will the Minister consider a dual licensing system, especially in areas where MMDS technology cannot be received, to provide for licensed community deflector groups and licensed MMDS operators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a recent court case about this matter which received wide coverage in the newspapers.  The judge is due to give his decision and that could lead to another court case.  We await his decision.  I will not comment on the matter pending his decision.  The regulator will conduct a study which will take into account all the matters being debated here now as well as future developments in the system.  She expects that report early in 1998.  Two events will come together: the judgment on the court case which may or may not lead to a second court case and the comprehensive report which the Director of Telecommunications Regulation will issue.  Both events will provide a framework for what is to happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of what the Minister said.  Is she aware that people who are part of community deflector groups received legal letters requesting that their masts be taken down?  They complied and asked for service from the MMDS licensed operators who said, following a test signal, they could not provide a service.  Does the Minister, who has responsibility for policy in this area agree, in principle, that everyone should have a right to multichannel TV in one form or other and that if MMDS cannot provide it, other alternative means should be looked at?  The Minister's predecessor in the previous Government tried to do something about this but the Department of Finance refused to sanction it.  Given the positive financial position, if the Minister was <Col N="1028" /> able to come to grips with the issue and make it known she agreed in principle that people have a right to multichannel TV and had conducted a technical study to see whether MMDS could provide it, that might indicate to everybody the Government was giving leadership on this issue? Will she consider conducting such a study and giving leadership on the issue?</P>

      <P>I reject the implication that Deputy Dukes was not a strong Minister.  He would have been well able to deal with the Department of Finance.  The terms of the Government decision were such that he felt unable to recommend it.  I understand the point made by the Deputy.  It is not that I would not take a stand or make a policy decision.  That is not the matter at issue.  The matter at issue is that it would be totally incorrect for me to take a stand.  We are awaiting a judge's decision in a case.  It will be made in a matter of weeks, either before or immediately after Christmas.  We are also awaiting the study being carried out by the regulator.  Where two influential matters will emerge within a matter of weeks, it would be inadvisable to pre-empt those decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I met Commissioner Kinnock on Thursday, 6 November 1997 to discuss the French truck dispute.  I gave him a comprehensive briefing on the impact the blockades were having both on Irish exports and imports and on the international haulage sector in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The question of compensation was discussed arising from the dispute in November 1996 and the recent dispute.  Commissioner Kinnock assured me he had pressed the French authorities throughout the year both at meetings and in writing to meet their commitments in relation to compensation. He agreed that the French response to date had not been satisfactory.  We also discussed possible alternative approaches to compensation in respect of future disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State elucidate on the possible alternative approaches to compensation referred to in his reply?  Will he agree it is intolerable that hauliers, particularly small hauliers, who were in serious financial difficulty as a result of the dispute one year ago are still <Col N="1029" /> awaiting compensation, assessed at £1.1 million? This present difficulty, following the difficulties of a year ago, means that unless the compensation arrangements are clarified reasonably quickly some of those involved could go to the wall.  What can we report to those people who are in difficulty and their organisations which will give them hope?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy particularly in relation to small operators, the hardship being experienced and the potential hardship for the future. On the question of the amount of compensation claimed, the Deputy refers to a sum of £1.1 million. I am trying to get a handle on this, because I should know and be able to give that information to the Deputy.  The first indication was that it would be £6 million and later the figure was £1.1 million.  This morning I was advised of a much lower figure, £350,000.  These claims which were submitted some weeks ago refer to the difficulties of November 1996.  There is some ambiguity and confusion regarding the amount of compensation which ought to be forthcoming following the difficulties in November 1996.  We are shoulder to shoulder with the Irish Road Haulage Association in endeavouring to push for settlement of that claim and the claims which will be made following the most recent difficulties.</P>
      <P>During the course of the meeting with Commissioner Kinnock I asked about this issue.  We discussed two possibilities: that a national compensation fund would be put in place by each member state and that a central fund would be established in Brussels.  There were difficulties with both systems but if any legal practical way could be found the Commissioner indicated he would not hesitate to implement it and would endeavour to follow it up.  The main problem from the Commissioner's point of view was the vast differences in such disputes from member state to member state.  There is also the problem that workers would find it easier to go on strike in the knowledge that a central fund exists to pay compensation.  To answer the Deputy's question, alternative measures are being pursued but I emphasise there are difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that following the recent meeting between the British and French Prime Ministers a period of three months in which to resolve the compensation issue was mentioned?  Will this apply to Irish as well as English hauliers?  The Minister of State mentioned different figures which, in discussing the issue of compensation, tend to fluctuate. There is increasing co-operation between the Irish Road Hauliers' Association and its counterparts in Britain and other European countries. Will the Minister of State encourage this because certain heads have been knocked together to ensure there are no discrepancies?  To get to Italy drivers had to travel through Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria which caused great <Col N="1030" /> inconvenience.  The extra costs incurred in toll charges alone amounted to £500.  Will the Minister of State ensure this is taken into consideration in assessing the compensation to be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made excellent and valid points which were raised in the negotiations. The United Kingdom authorities submitted a large number of claims covering the period of the 1996 dispute, of which only a handful have been paid.  The French authorities found petty reasons to return documentation and refuse claims.  The Irish claims have been prepared by a United Kingdom firm of solicitors which has taken great care to ensure they are properly documented with supporting evidence.  It has learned from the mistakes of other states, particularly the United Kingdom.  It is too early to say whether the Irish claims will meet with a more favourable response but they have been submitted in a more efficient and, I hope, expert fashion.  The IRHA made the right decision in asking the United Kingdom firm of solicitors to which I referred to prepare claims for submission.</P>
      <P>My senior colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, has written to the French Transport Minister expressing appreciation of the work of the French Government in bringing about a speedy settlement to the dispute.  She was quick off the mark. Before the blockades were put in place she took the opportunity to speak to her French counterpart. She was in touch with him in writing and by telephone throughout the dispute.  Claims for compensation should be satisfactorily settled without delay.  The Minister also took the opportunity to ask the Luxembourg Transport Minister to include the compensation issue on the agenda for the December Transport Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State in a position to give the House an estimate of the total losses incurred by Irish business as a result of the most recent blockade?  In view of the frequency with which this type of dispute occurs, the disruption it causes and degree to which it compromises the principle of free movement guaranteed by the European treaties did the Minister of State put any suggestions to Commissioner Kinnock whereby the European Union would take more effective action or put mechanisms in place to deal with this type of industrial dispute so that the disruption caused outside the state where the dispute is taking place is minimised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a pertinent question and broadens the subject matter of this question but I am happy to address it.  Total daily exports to France are estimated at just under £7 million and perishable goods account for <i>circa</i> £1 million of this.  Throughout the week my senior colleague and I kept in close contact with the trade organisations. As a result of the early settlement of the dispute we escaped more serious consequences than would have been the case if the strike had continued into a second week.  We are unable to <Col N="1031" /> quantify with great accuracy the overall losses incurred.</P>
      <P>There is also the human factor which many failed to mention or comprehend from the television pictures of the blockades or messages in the media.  It must be remembered that the French appear to have a robust way of doing business.  This is the fourth time in two years there have been blockades.  Will there be further blockades?  Wives and families worry about their dear ones stuck in a blockade, particularly when there is physical violence.  That should ring bells and instil a sense of urgency.  Life is more precious than commerce or finance.  That should spur us on to ensure there is no recurrence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that the reason there are lorries blocking the roads in France where the cost of living is much higher than here is that lorry drivers are paid miserable rates, even by Irish standards?  Will he also agree that last year the French Minister gave the Council of Ministers which I attended an absolute undertaking that the matter of compensation would be dealt with centrally and within one month?  Will he further agree that this has been welshed on by the French Government by the use of petty bureaucratic trickery?  This should not be tolerated within the European Union.  It is not just the road haulage sector that suffers in this type of blockade, exporters and manufacturers also suffer.  Will the Department assist directly in the compilation of the necessary compensation claims, not just from the road haulage sector which is better organised than most but from the other sectors also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's comments on the manner in which the French Government and various French organisations dealt with this issue in the past &mdash; when their undertakings were not honoured &mdash; including the manner in which they dealt with claims for compensation when, to use the Deputy's word, their pettiness was a major factor.  One of the problems of the French <Col N="1032" /> compensatory scheme is that French law stipulates claims must be referred to the local authority in whose area the loss has been incurred. The requirements of properly documented proof to validate a claim are very onerous, such as tachograph charts, preferably stamped by local police, fuel receipts, ferry tickets and photographs.</P>
      <P>I made inquiries at any fora available to me in Brussels.  I talked to everybody to obtain as much information as I could about the to deal with these claims.  It appears they seek some type of professional witness who will go into court and testify that X truck or lorry driver was held up at a blockade for X period of time and so on, which is very difficult to establish.  That is the base from which we are endeavouring to exhort those concerned at all levels to do something constructive by way of processing of future claims.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 23, 28 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>I assume Deputy Cosgrave is referring to my arrangements for a meeting with the United Kingdom Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions, Mr. John Prescott.  Due to other pressing commitments, he could not attend an earlier meeting arranged.  Following this I suggested another date but found I could not attend, thus making it necessary to postpone our meeting. However, I hope to agree a mutually convenient date in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> As I said in response to previous questions, one of the key priorities of the programme for Government is to resist EU plans to abolish intra-Union duty free shopping after June 1999.  I am concerned about the economic and social consequences for Ireland of the scheduled abolition of intra-Union duty free sales&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most genuinely concerned about it, in particular its effects on employment and access costs for tourism and trade.  For that reason I am taking an active role in the campaign to raise awareness of the duty free issue.  As I said here on 24 September, I was the main speaker and highlighted the position of the Irish Government at the meeting of Council of Transport Ministers in June last, calling on the European Commission to conduct an EU-wide study of the economic and social effects on Europe of ending duty free sales, the results of which could pave the way for an open-ended derogation which could be reviewed as circumstances change.</P>
      <P>At that Council meeting in June last, prior to the change of Government, Transport Ministers supported the concept of this European Unionwide study.  However, reversal of this scheduled abolition is primarily a matter for Finance Ministers and requires a proposal from the European Union Commission and unanimous agreement of the Council of Finance Ministers.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that I availed of the opportunity to raise this duty free issue in the course of recent discussions on the draft Airport Charges Directive at the meeting of European Union Transport Ministers on 9 October.  I pointed out the inextricable links between access costs to markets and competitiveness and reiterated and elaborated on the Irish experience.</P>
      <P>To date, the Commission has held its line on the matter and has not agreed to conduct an EU-wide study.  However, I remain confident that continued and increased pressure will yield results.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Minister for Finance has himself instigated a study, the results of which he hopes to receive before the end of the year.  I also understand that at the forthcoming Summit on Employment in Luxembourg the Taoiseach intends to raise the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Tansey Webster report indicates that some 2,500 jobs here and some 240,000 jobs throughout the European Union depend on the continuance of duty free shopping, is the Minister aware of the very great unease among those engaged in the industry?  While appreciating the Minister's undertaking to meet Mr. John Prescott, I would hazard a guess that, if this involved an industry of some 2,500 people in Athlone, we would witness much greater urgency on her part.  Will the Minister undertake to visit European capitals to take up the special Irish case <Col N="1034" /> there, bearing in mind that the British take over the EU Presidency on 1 January next, so that with their support and especially that of Mr. Prescott, who I understand is very supportive of the retention of these facilities, she will have a more active role in canvassing throughout the European Union to have this included on the agenda for 1 January next?</P>

The financial aspects are a matter for the ECOFIN Ministers but our Minister for Finance rightly wishes to be armed with the results of the study undertaken, which he will receive within a month, as he makes his case to the ECOFIN Ministers.

      <P>The Taoiseach is not capable of ensuring reversal of the relevant regulation, it must have European-wide consensus.  Nonetheless, I envisage this campaign gathering momentum. We will be armed with our study which I am sure will point out the job losses which were mentioned &mdash; we cannot predicate the results. The EU promised in 1991-2 there would be a European wide study on the matter, a promise which was not fulfilled.  It was indicated this was in the context of harmonisation of VAT and other rates which has also not happened.  The predications upon which that was based have not come to fruition and I imagine that at the beginning of 1998 there will be an irresistible urge towards changing this position.</P>

It is his job to get a reversal if the Government has finally agreed to seek one. Following the belated conversion of Fianna Fáil on this issue and given that the Taoiseach voted to abolish duty free at the ECOFIN council in 1991 will the Minister agree this was done on the basis that there was an integrated tax package which turned out to be a bottle of smoke with no <Col N="1036" /> substance except for the abolition of duty free and that the Taoiseach bought this pass from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree the information she is giving us is much more optimistic than the reality would lead us to believe?  Is she aware the Luxembourg Council presidency has informed the Parliament it is in favour of the abolition of duty free and sees it as being against the principles of the single market?  This is the position of one transport minister and one minister of ECOFIN.  Will the Minister state clearly whether it is her opinion that she will convince all the finance ministers and heads of state to change their opinion on this and force the Commission to bring forward a new proposal?  Will she agree it is virtually impossible for the Taoiseach, who voted for the abolition of duty free, as Minister for Finance to now go to Europe and say he was wrong and try to change their minds? Does the Minister think this is a viable proposition?</P>

He will answer questions as Minister for Finance but I was asked a question by four Deputies so I am fully entitled to answer it.  The Deputy then went on to credit me with great powers because he asked me if I intended to persuade the finance Ministers and the Heads of State.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  I am either peripheral or central.  Going back to the point the Deputy raised about the Taoiseach, in 1991-2, when this matter was decided at ECOFIN, there had to be unanimity among the 12.</P>

      <P>In my experience of dealing with Brussels I found that the Commission is the most political of all institutions.  It meets every Wednesday morning, as the Minister knows, and if a vital national interest of a member state is under discussion, the Commissioner of that government can act through negotiation.  Commissioner Monti will want benefits for his country that will come under the Social Affairs portfolio. Has the Minister devised a strategy with Commissioner Flynn, as we did with the beef fines, to exercise leverage in the Commission and in the <i>cabinet</i> of President Santer?  I am advised that the Commission, under persuasion, would be open to a further derogation of two years if the right strategy was invoked.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore asked whether the derogation was open ended.  That will depend on the way the campaign develops.  Obviously, in practical terms, as the campaign accelerates and other countries become more aware of the dangers to employment arising out of the abolition, the final outcome will begin to take shape.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for tabling their questions and affording us an opportunity to discuss this matter publicly in the House.</P>
      <P>I received a report on Monday from the railway inspecting officer who visited the scene of the accident on Saturday.  On Tuesday I met the chairman and senior executives of Iarnród Éireann.  Based on the report and discussions I want to outline first the facts of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 08.25 Heuston to Westport passenger train was derailed at approximately 10.30 a.m. on Saturday, 8 November, at a point between Knockcroghery and Roscommon town.  The initial point of derailment was approximately 250 metres beyond Curry level crossing, with various sections of the train coming to a halt over the next 500 metres.  The train in question comprised a modern 201 class locomotive with seven modern mark 3 carriages.  The locomotive remained on the track but all the carriages were derailed. The train divided with the result that the front of <Col N="1039" /> the train travelled 400 metres beyond the point where the four rear carriages came to rest.  There was extensive damage to the track and rolling stock, although damage interiorly was minimal.</P>
    <P>Fifteen people, all passengers on the train, were taken to Roscommon Hospital.  Eleven of those were treated in the casualty department and discharged.  There were four admissions, mainly for observation, and two of the patients have since been discharged.  I understand the remaining two will be discharged this evening.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has established an internal joint inquiry board to investigate the circumstances of the accident.  It commenced its work yesterday and it is expected that the board will make a preliminary report available in three weeks.  The report will be reviewed by the Department's railway inspecting officers.  Initial indications suggest the accident was caused by a broken rail joint.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the implementation of safety related measures is paramount in Iarnród Éireann and at the meeting yesterday I emphasised the paramount importance of safety measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it was a miracle that this derailment did not have horrific fatal consequences?  Is she aware that this line was originally constructed in 1862 and that the last major realignment of this permanent way was in the 1930s?  Will she agree also that in this case there was probably metal fatigue in the fishplate, the train derailed and the sleepers snapped like matches?  Given that there is no provision under the co-financed programme for this route beyond Athlone, or the Sligo-Mullingar or Dublin-Rosslare routes, between now and 1999, will the Minister consider having an independent international review of safety carried out immediately to assure those of us on this side of the House, and herself, as to the safety of our railways and to provide a basis for a comprehensive investment programme so that we can all sleep easy knowing that there will be no such recurrence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that this crash was potentially very serious.  I visited the scene on Sunday and spent a considerable time talking to many of the people working on the line.  I agree that potentially it was a very serious incident.  Thank God it was not more serious.  I extend sympathy to those who were injured and my admiration to the emergency services who acted with great speed.  I also admire those who worked on the train, including the driver, who kept their cool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the international review of safety, I will give consideration to an input from some consultancy on a European wide basis when I receive the report of the internal inquiry.  It is necessary to do this.  Mr. Pat Lynch, a member of the board, has been appointed by the board as <Col N="1040" /> head of the safety committee which has met and begun its full investigation.</P>
    <P>I know about the laying of the permanent way. It is a matter of history when the permanent ways were laid.  There is a method within Iarnród Éireann for examining on a regular basis all lines and in particular all tension areas, namely the fish-plates or joints, which are inspected twice weekly.  This particular joint was inspected and reported upon on the Friday preceding the Saturday on which the accident occurred.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> I thank the Minister for her reply.  Is she aware of the chaos that invariably ensues on platform 5 at Heuston Station every weekend?  This is the platform from which the train to Westport and Ballina departs. A long queue of people is left waiting while the train is being cleaned but when the white flag is raised there is a massive stampede of people because of the huge shortage of seats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> The situation is very serious.  There is a human logjam right through the train with people who have paid the full price for a ticket standing in the aisles and between the carriages from Dublin to Roscommon.  Because of second hand and substandard materials, with replacement tracks and sleepers taken from lines which have been closed in some cases &mdash; something that can be confirmed &mdash; when the train crosses the Shannon there are speed variations from 30 to 80 miles per hour.  In this case there would have been a holocaust if it had not been for the fact that the accident happened at an off peak period and did not occur near a steep incline.</P>
      <P>In the light of Deputy Yates's statement that this does not qualify or was not included in the original plan submitted to Brussels in 1994 and the ongoing mid-term review, will the Minister consider having this project included for 50:50 cohesion funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins spoke of chaos on the platform and long queues waiting and then stampeding.  I am aware of this and it is worrying that if people had been standing between the carriages the accident could have been more serious.  However, there was a low capacity of 180 passengers.  I spoke to the officials in Iarnród Éireann yesterday about this and the solution would involve a curtailment of the numbers who could board the train or the sale of tickets. The Deputy mentioned that each person had paid for their ticket and if so they are entitled to get on the train.</P>
      <P>Regarding the speed variations, this train was travelling at the allowable speed for that stretch so there was no question of speeding or trying to make up time.  It was a few minutes late but nothing of any consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> The Deputy asked that co-financing under the Cohesion Fund be sought for lines other than the main ones which have been substantially invested in by this method.  They were originally turned down under that programme but they could be re-examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>This was an accident waiting to happen and it was not surprising given that the tracks were second-hand.  People in the west are regarded as second class citizens.  Even the media coverage suggested that because the accident happened in the west it did not matter.  If it had happened on the track into Dublin, RTÉ, Channel 4 and every media station in the country would have reported it.  The people of the west deserve better.  The accident last weekend was a warning.  If it had happened on a Friday or Sunday night, 30, 40 or 50 people would have been killed and there would have been more inquiries and tribunals.</P>
      <P>What plans does the Government have to invest funding in this line as a result of an accident last weekend in which people were nearly killed in a second-hand train?  Public representatives have been talking to Iarnród Éireann officials for many years and they do not care about us.  All they care about is setting up Luas and the Dublin to Belfast line.  As a public representative of the west, I have had enough.  I want funding provided because the next accident will not be a few people in hospital but a major tragedy.  I intend raising this matter many times in the Dáil.  I want to know what plans the Minister and the Department of Finance have to provide proper funding in the budget on December 3.</P>
      <P>It is the same with the Structural Funds; everything goes to the east coast and there is nothing for the west.  We got away with a warning but we may not the next time.  If funding is not provided, I want an independent investigation to see if the line is safe.  I know it is not safe.  How can it be when it is comprised of sleepers taken up in the east and laid in the west?  If they are not good enough for the east, they are not good enough for the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Ring's strong feelings on the matter.  He said the media treated the issue as if the people of the west were second class citizens.  It was the second item on the 6 p.m. news, the first being the tragedy in Westmeath where a husband and wife were murdered in their home.  There was extensive coverage of the accident on Monday's papers; it was probably too late to make Sunday's.  I know how the Deputy feels but I think the accident received extensive coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked about Government funding. The previous Government, of which his party was the main partner, has been out of office only four months, but I do not want to make a point of that as I acknowledge the accident could have been very serious.  Funding is allocated to Iarnród <Col N="1042" /> Éireann in a general budget and its disbursement is a matter for it and its general planners.  I am sure the Deputy's comments and strong feelings and those of Dáil Éireann will be brought to its attention and I intend to do that myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>If this accident had happened 12 hours earlier, the train would have been overcrowded and we would have had a major disaster on our hands.  Has the Minister any plans to reduce the overcrowding on trains by either increasing rolling stock or the number of departures on the Westport, Sligo and Galway lines? This would reduce the overcrowding and eliminate the intolerable situation which mainly affects young people and students.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister received a report on the recent tragic accident where a young girl was killed at an unmanned level crossing at Dunamon, County Roscommon, only a few miles down the line from where the other accident happened? If so, what new proposals does she have to increase the safety at this type of level crossing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of things can happen as regards overcrowding on the Ballina-Westport and Sligo lines.  Rolling stock can be increased, for which Iarnród Éireann would have to arrange within its budget.  The number of people on a train can be limited if they are to travel in safety.  All travel, by road, rail or air, involves the chance of accident but, if safety is to be maximised, numbers must be reduced.  That causes problems at 5.30 on Friday evening when young people want to go home and it is something CIE will have to address.</P>
      <P>I had a discussion with Iarnród Éireann on the issue of level crossings.  The Deputy will know from the Ballybay crossing outside Athlone in his constituency that there is an ongoing programme of changing level crossings from manual to automatic. The chief rails engineer has specific duties in this regard.</P>
      <P>I will receive the report of the inquiry on the young woman losing her life at a level crossing at the same time as I receive the report of the inquiry into this accident.  The crossing was one where a person was required to be conscious of approaching trains.  It was a sad incident which occurred not far from the scene of the other accident.</P>

There should be no reason people should not have a more practical, efficient and competitive service.  The situation in Heuston Station on Fridays, the inability to book seats when one can do so almost everywhere else in Europe and the impossibility of providing trolley service on the train because of crowded aisles is not good enough and could be improved.</P>

      <P>This is a question.  Can the Minister give an assurance there is no danger to the transport of acrylonitrile for the remainder of Asahi's duration in Mayo?  There was a derailment a number of years ago but there was no threat to life.</P>
      <P>Yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> carried an advertisement for Iarnród Éireann's City Gold and refers to the ability&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The advertisement refers to the customer's ability to spread notes and operate fax machines in every carriage and to have laptops and briefcases provided.  It is impossible to do business in a Western sense given the level of service on this train.  The Estimates are being published today.  Given that this will not be an EU funded plan, at least for the moment, and that someone must do something about it, can the Minister readjust the Estimates within her Department's Vote to provide Exchequer funding to deal with this problem immediately?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter raised by the Deputy is one of practicality.  Better arrangements for booking tickets in advance is an operational matter for any company.  I will bring it to the attention of Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>I wish to give a guarantee on the Asahi derailment. I do not have all the facts but I am familiar with the incident and I will get back to the Deputy on this matter.</P>
      <P>The facility to operate laptops on the City Gold service is a matter for Iarnród Éireann in its efforts to attract customers.  Perhaps the Deputy availed of it in the past and would be glad to have access to it again.  However, it has no bearing on the matter we are discussing.</P>
      <P>The Estimates are printed and are being commented on by the Minister for Finance.  Within the considerable subsidy given to Iarnród Éireann, both by this and previous Governments, a clear effort is being made to manage the system with regard to line and carriage replacement, signalling, infrastructure and so on.  This is a complex, multi-faceted operation and moneys must be given to fund it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ring stated how the west of Ireland gets a second class service and second class equipment. The cars on the train were of the latest <Col N="1044" /> design and the highest quality.  This provided a buttressing effect and a safety net in combination with the steep embankment.  The carriages were modern.</P>

      <P>The Minister said she met Iarnród Éireann executives yesterday.  Did they tell her, as they told me, that the only way to prevent a recurrence of Saturday's accident is to have continuous welded track as opposed to jointed track? This applies on Dublin-Belfast, Dublin-Cork and our mainline routes.  Will she report to the House and bring a memorandum to Cabinet to ensure that such accidents are prevented by having continuous welded track on all radial routes?</P>

      <P>The Deputy should allow me to finish.  It would cost £275 million to convert all our track to continuous track.  That is a mammoth task.  The Estimates are printed.  Safety is of paramount importance within the considerable subsidies given to Iarnród Éireann.  I stressed this to them even though I did not need to; they are very aware of it.</P>
      <P>Ireland has one of the lowest rates of rail fatalities in Europe.  I am not saying this is wonderful and we should clap each other on the back.  We would prefer if there were no fatalities.  However, I cannot guarantee there will never be a fatality on Irish rail.  I would be foolish to do so as would CIE.  CIE is endeavouring to bring safety standards to the highest possible level.  I assure the House that I emphasised the safety aspects to the executives yesterday.  We will make the report findings public within the legal due process.  I will bear in mind Deputy Yates's suggestion that a European consultancy group should look at the results of the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree it is not possible for Iarnród Éireann to have the highest level of safety?  Would she also agree that trains have to travel at 15 miles per hour on some tracks because they are so dangerous?  Money is required to make the railways safe.  The £200 million referred to by the Minister is the cost of building, approximately, 12 miles of motorway.  Very large numbers of people use the trains and money is not invested.  As a result, travelling by train is dangerous.  Does the Minister agree?</P>

For the information of the House, it has been open to local authorities to use their various powers to deal with wandering horses since 18 March last. The regulations mentioned by a number of Deputies were introduced on 24 April last.  As to the supply of microchips which I stated was still outstanding, I have subsequently been informed that that matter was cleared with the local authorities on 24 September last.  All issues have been dealt with.  I asked the Minister to arrange for his officials to meet the four Dublin local authorities with a view to ensuring progress.  The legislation was passed in the House, contrary to what was said last week.  The regulations contained therein have been enacted and signed by the relevant Ministers and have been in place for a number of months.  It is now a matter of enforcement by local authorities.</P>

      <P>This issue has been around for a long time.  The original motion moved on 8 October 1992 by the then Minster of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, was agreed to.  It is a pity there was not a proper discussion on its merits.  Many of the problems that have emerged since could have been teased out.  Members did not fully appreciate the full complexity of it.</P>
      <P>The Minister moved the Bill in the Seanad recently to clarify the legal position of the Commissioners of Lights, a proud body which has provided tremendous service for navigation, but the saga of Loran C and the implications for the area around Loop Head in Clare continues to run after seven years.  The Minister said in the Seanad that he intended to have consultations with all interested parties and that the Bill would go through with the consent of both Houses.  Will he clarify what is meant by consultations and when does he intend to hold them?  Will the meetings be informal?  Will he meet groups and accept their reservations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is aware of an article in a newspaper this week which stated that almost £1.5 million has <Col N="1055" /> been spent on this project to date and that the Committee of Public Accounts should investigate this.  It must be considered that 136 acres were purchased in the earlier stages and the landowners objected to the mast at that time.  Nobody who agreed to this in October 1992 was told it would be 700 feet high, slightly less than the Eiffel Tower.  When the landowners objected originally the point was made that it was probably not subject to the planning process.  However, it went through the planning process and the local council in its wisdom refused planning permission on health and environmental grounds.  An Bord Pleanála subsequently overturned that decision and said it would have to be blended into the landscape.  I do not know what type of trees it had in mind to camouflage a 700-foot mast in a flat landscape.  The Clare farmers took the case to the High Court and the Supreme Court, won their case and were vindicated.</P>
    <P>The issue will now go back again for consultations. I am not sure what the Minster expects to find because I anticipate that the people who resisted and went to the Supreme Court will not have a sudden change in their attitude to the mast.  The Minister must forget about the mast in Loop Head and start again.  There is a great deal of emotion aroused by this issue, as witnessed in radio interviews which refer to French involvement. Why have the French taken up 50 per cent of the cost of this project?  It has led to suspicions, perhaps erroneous, with regard to the French involvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome amendment No. 3.  My understanding is that the Bill as it went before the Dáil prior to the election would have effectively given the commissioners the power to continue to put in place the Loran C system.  The amendment changes that.  If it is be introduced at any future time, it has to be voted on in both Houses.  I thank the Minister for this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is a waste of legislative time.  I do not understand why it was necessary to introduce it.  In the Loop Head area there is total opposition to the mast.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights have purchased lands and a substantial investment has been made in the area.  This is in accordance with our international obligations.  The previous Minister gave an undertaking that all these matters would be examined by a commission.  Deputy Killeen said there has been a major change and the House will now have the privilege of voting on the resolution agreed following consultation.</P>

      <P>However, he reversed his opinion during the general election campaign. There has been a change of opinion by the Deputies opposite on this matter but I have never changed my opinion on it &mdash; the Loran C mast should not be located in County Clare.</P>
      <P>A representative of a private company which is in competition with the Loran C model was very vocal on local radio and made some extraordinarily nasty comments about my contribution as an elected representative.  I have always acted honourably during the debate on this highly emotive issue.  I am totally opposed to this mast. My party inherited the issue from the previous Government and we did our best to deal with it properly.  This amendment is a sleight of hand and waste of time.</P>
      <P>The previous Minister ordered a full consultation process in Kilkee or Kilbaha.  I hope the Minister is not shying away from giving the people of this peninsula an opportunity to properly discuss the matter as envisaged by the previous Minister.  If that is the intention of the amendment then it is a con job.  If the consultation is private rather than public then the campaign will become vicious.  The people of the area are opposed to the mast and only an honest and open debate will resolve the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not made clear the purpose of the amendment or said when the resolution will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are being asked to accept the amendment on the basis that there will be some sort of consultation.  We are all aware of the need for consultation and if it had taken place some years ago the same confusion would not exist in County Clare.  There have been many suggestions and much innuendo about who bought the land, while somebody is supposed to have objected to the purchase of certain lands for political reasons etc.  The House should know the exact consultation process before accepting an amendment of this kind.</P>
      <P>The Bill arose from High Court challenges.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights have been left without protection for some months and individual members are now responsible for anything that goes wrong.  These people carry out a vital service in terms of marine safety and it is an absolute disgrace that the legislation has been held up.  The legislation was held up in the Seanad when I was Minister because of a lack of political support.  The two Clare Deputies opposite should be ashamed of themselves.  There is no point in praising the Commissioners of Irish Lights at this stage when their party held up the legislation in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The Minister is well aware that the Department was very anxious to have the legislation enacted.  My party was prepared to consult with the people of County Clare through a commission which would ensure that all queries and worries were addressed in a professional manner. I sincerely hope that that is still the position.  We also gave an undertaking that we would seek planning permission in the proper manner, if and when that was required.</P>
      <P>The Minister should remind the House, and his fellow colleagues, that we are tied into an international obligation in relation to Loran C. Will he spell out clearly the position if we withdraw from the Loran C system and confirm for his colleagues in Fianna Fáil that we will be liable to pay compensation?  Will he indicate the moneys we are talking about and the other obligations on us under the agreement entered into by the Government of which Deputy Daly was a member? These matters should be spelt out clearly so that the people of Clare are made fully aware of the agreement we entered into, why we were put in this position by the then Fianna Fáil Government, the obligations on us if we withdraw from the agreement, how the consultations will take place and when the House will be informed about whether it is intended to proceed with the Loran C system or to withdraw from the international agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was dictated to by some of his own people in the Seanad and as a result he did not endeavour to put the Bill through that House.  His attitude was that the Bill, in the form in which it stood at that time, was to be put through the Seanad.  That would have ensured it would be possible for the Commissioners of Irish Lights to erect the mast without consultation.</P>
      <P>It is important to put on record that there has been much discussion of this matter in recent years.  It is obvious now that, regardless of how much consultation was undertaken, the people in the area where it was planned to put this development would resist in every way possible the erection of the mast and the development of the Loran C system.  The people have argued that the Loran C system is antiquated and that developments, particularly in satellite communications, offer a positive and excellent substitute to it.  I encourage the Minister to identify and proceed with an alternative system to the Loran C system, that is the satellite system, the modern system used by other states, particularly America.  It is possible to introduce such a system which will deal with the shortcomings in our navigational aid systems and be far superior to the Loran C system.</P>
      <P>A clause in the agreement provides for an opt out after a certain time.  It will take some time to fully research the new satellite system and develop a scheme which would give Ireland the most modern satellite system.  In the meantime it is desirable to put on hold the plans for the Loran C system and avail of the opt out clause when the time comes.  In that way we would ensure an adequate system of navigation around the coastline. It would resolve the problems that arise from an outdated system &mdash; it has been overtaken by developments in technology &mdash; and would be more sensible in terms of navigation safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Past differences about this issue will not advance matters.  It is necessary to introduce this Bill speedily because of the position as outlined by Deputy Barrett.  Regardless of the negotiations that take place, the Loran C proposal, in so far <Col N="1061" /> as it relates to County Clare, will never be acceptable. It would be much better to seek an alternative system and opt out of the Loran C agreement when the opportunity arises in a few years' time.</P>

      <P>The Minister should clarify with whom he is having consultations.  Will the consultations be public?  While not wishing to pre-empt discussions with the local people, if the case goes to the High Court or the Supreme Court they will be determined that a Loran C mast will not be erected at Loop Head.  The Minister can probably pre-empt the outcome of consultations with the local people and this matter will be revisited in the Dáil and Seanad.  I understand one of these masts is stored in Paris at a cost of £900 per month.  Given that, at a height of 700 feet, it is visually intrusive, will the Minister say why it was considered in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a mast and it is not like the Eiffel Tower, as some have suggested.  It is very thin, but covers a substantial area.  It depends on where it is placed and this is one of the issues that has arisen regarding Loop Head. Deputies are correct to emphasise the urgent requirements of the commissioners.  They need to be covered and assured of their position and, consequently, this legislation must be enacted quickly.  The commissioners currently provide a wide range of radio based aids to marine navigation, including radio beacons, radar beacons, radar enhancers and the differential global positioning system.  The primary purpose of this legislation is to enable them to continue to provide radio navigation systems in the interests of maritime safety.  I am sure Deputies will acknowledge the importance of that.  It is essential, therefore, that the necessary legislative framework is in place to allow the commissioners to provide seafarers with those vital radio based aids to navigation.</P>
      <P>The amendment will ensure the Loran C project does not proceed unless a new order is made by the Minister and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I assure Deputies the Loran C project will not proceed unless new legislation is adopted by the Dáil and Seanad.  The site chosen, and any subsequent issues that arise, will have to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas for discussion by Deputies and Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> In the meantime, I intend to carry out a fundamental review of all aspects of the Loran C project. Deputies Finucane and Barrett asked what form that review would take.  It will consider all aspects of the project and the current state of technology and allow me to hear at first hand the views of all interested parties, particularly those living in the Loop Head area.  The proposed amendment would ensure interested parties can contribute to the wide ranging consultation process in the secure knowledge that no action can be taken in the meantime to progress the project.</P>
    <P>These amendments provide that the powers conferred on the Commissioners of Irish Lights to develop and operate radio navigation systems shall not apply to the Loran C system until such date as the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources may appoint by order and subject to any conditions as he or she may specify in the order.  The amendments also provide that such a draft ministerial order shall come before both Houses of the Oireachtas for debate and shall not be made unless approved by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It would be useful to outline the background to the Bill and the Loran C project.  Deputies will be aware that the need for the Bill arose out of a legal challenge to the commissioners' powers to proceed with the erection and operation of a Loran C long range navigation system at Loop Head, County Clare.  Those legal proceedings culminated in a Supreme Court decision to the effect that the powers given to the commissioners under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 could not be interpreted to cover the proposed Loran C radio mast and, by implication, the existing radio based aids currently provided by the commissioners.</P>
    <P>Ireland's involvement in the Loran C project arises from a commitment under an international agreement, approved by Dáil Éireann on 8 October 1992, to provide a Loran C radio mast and ancillary facilities in the west.  Following a detailed site selection study undertaken by the commissioners, with the assistance of relevant expert bodies, the proposed site at Loop Head was chosen as most suitable.</P>
    <P>When the Bill came before this House last February there was general support for its objective to remedy the lacuna in the commissioners' legal powers in respect of the provision of existing radio navigation systems.  I am aware, however, that there was considerable disquiet that the passing of the legislation, as introduced at that time, would enable the commissioners to proceed with the Loran C project.  Concerns were expressed that the Loran C system poses a threat to health, represents a damaging environmental intrusion and may also be considered obsolete.</P>
    <P>When I recently reintroduced the Bill in the Seanad I gave a commitment to carry out a fundamental review of all aspects of the Loran C project and, to this end, to engage in a comprehensive consultation process concerning all the relevant issues involved.  This process will involve seeking the expert advice and opinions of domestic <Col N="1063" /> and international authoritative bodies responsible for navigation, along with the EU Commission.  The purpose of these consultations is to elicit the international view on current requirements in the area of maritime safety, medium to long-term developments and requirements in the area of radio based navigational aids and, in that context, the case for a land based complement to support a space based system.  The views and concerns of the people of west Clare and others regarding installations such as the Loran C mast will be fully taken into account.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendments under discussion is to allow the Bill to be enacted as soon as possible, thereby ensuring that the commissioners can legally operate and maintain their existing radio navigation systems in the interests of the safety of mariners.  They would also allow time for the whole Loran C issue to be reviewed in the context of the consultative process which I propose to initiate.  This process can take place in the secure knowledge that no action can be taken in the meantime to progress the project.  I believe this approach meets the concerns of all interests to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>Regarding the other questions raised by Deputies, a hearing on the planning issue is set to take place in the Supreme Court on 6 February. The countries involved are France, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and Ireland.  As it depends on when the last country signs up rather than when the project starts, the earliest date for withdrawal is 2005.  A provisional sum has been provided in the Estimates to meet legal or other costs.  If those costs do not arise I am sure the money can be used in other areas.  Bearing in mind that no action can be taken without bringing the matter before both Houses of the Oireachtas, Deputies should agree to the legislation to put the matter right for the commissioners while allowing discussion on the other issue to proceed. On that basis, I ask Deputies to agree to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply, particularly as he does not propose to engage in public consultation.</P>
      <P>Regardless of whether I agree with a proposal, there must be public consultations with local people.  Even if the Minister has good reasons to promote this development in Loop Head he will cause terrible difficulty for the local population. The IDA, Forbairt and other promotion agencies have established systems to consult people prior to the establishment of an industry in their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of public consultation proposed by the previous Minister, Deputy Barrett, is the most important aspect of this matter and I am disappointed the current Minister, Deputy Woods, will keep the consultation process within the Department under a marine inspector.  The same information will be trotted out again and the Minister will claim that as we have international obligations in this regard and as time has already <Col N="1064" /> been given to the matter, he must again bring it before the Houses.  The Government has an inbuilt majority in both Houses so the measure will be passed.  That is not fair to the people of County Clare.</P>
    <P>The best indicator of the difficulties that arise for politicians with regard to serious developments such as this is a general election.  The opposition of Deputies Daly and Killeen to the Loran C mast did them no harm in the last election. The Minister should be aware that there is an obligation on those Deputies and if there is no public consultation it will cause them great difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Even where there might have been a level of support in the west Clare area for the Loran C mast when it was initially proposed &mdash; the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, said the mast was essential to control the illegal importation of drugs &mdash; there is no such support now.  In addition to the people who vehemently opposed the proposal, challenged its legality in the courts and won their case in the</P>
      <P>Supreme Court, the general view in the west is that the Minister should not proceed with the proposal.</P>
      <P>Regardless of what consultations the Minister or a consultative committee undertakes, the mast will never be acceptable in the location which was identified and purchased for it by the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  The site should be abandoned and the land resold to the initial vendors. The prospect of getting this mast erected on the site in Kilbaha is so remote that no amount of consultation and dialogue will make it acceptable. The people just will not wear it and if they cannot accept it in their own locality, I doubt they would wish to have it built elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be aware that opposition to the proposal is widespread and unanimous. The sooner the Loran C mast proposal is abandoned the better.  He should look at the alternative global positioning system which is more accurate, modern and adaptable to our situation.</P>

      <P>In an effort to be constructive our party did not put down negative amendments in the Seanad.  We wanted this measure passed. The Minister has removed the Loran C mast from the equation so the legislation will probably be passed.  However, with the benefit of hindsight the Minister will agree the Dáil was probably remiss when, on 9 October 1992, it agreed to the rather innocuous motion on the international agreement moved by the then Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gallagher. There was no discussion as the question was put and agreed to.</P>

I refer the Minister to the files in his Department which contain a great deal of research on the different systems involved.  About 40 sites in Kerry and Clare were visited and Loop Head was chosen as the most suitable by the officials.</P>
      <P>The Loran C proposal appears to be dead.  If it does not appear on Loop Head it is unlikely to appear elsewhere as the publicity and concerns generated by the current proposal will be emulated and repeated regardless of what site in Kerry or Clare is involved.  Deputy Barrett asked a pertinent question.  What will be the impact of not proceeding with Loran C?  What is the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs if Loran C does not proceed in view of the binding commitment we made in the context of the international agreement?  What type of compensation is involved?  If the proposal does not proceed in County Clare what will happen to the land for which the State paid £420,000?  What about the money that has been poured down the drain on this project?</P>
      <P>We are discussing this matter seven years too late.  If proper discussion had taken place when it was first proposed we might not have entered into many of these financial commitments.  This is a white elephant for the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Report of European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to avail of this opportunity to make a statement to the House on the occasion of the publication of the annual report on the state of the drugs problem in the European Union by the European Monitoring Centre for drugs and drug addiction, or EMC, for short.  I will address what the Government is doing about the problem but first I want to give the House some information on the EMC and its role and functions.</P>
      <P>The centre was established by European Union regulation in 1994 with its headquarters in Lisbon. Its task is to provide objective, reliable and comparable information at European Union level concerning drugs and drug addiction and its consequences. It gathers information on the demand for drugs and measures to reduce the demand; national and European Union strategies and policies; international co-operation and the geopolitics of supply; control of trade in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and precursor chemicals and implications of the drug phenomenon for producer, consumer and transit countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The centre is governed by a management board which has representation from each member state and nominees of the European Commission and the Parliament.  It is headed by a director who is supported by administrative and technical staff. The centre's main source of information is a network <Col N="1068" /> of focal points located in each member state.  The Irish focal point is the Health Research Board.</P>
    <P>All the information produced by the centre helps provide the EU and the member states with an overall view of the drug and drug addiction problem.  The data obtained in different countries is not completely comparable as methods of evaluation are not standardised, but the EMC is working on developing instruments of measurement and evaluation to address this problem.  For this reason we must be careful when comparing Irish figures with those of other member states.</P>
    <P>The tasks of the centre are the collection and analysis of existing data, the improvement of data-comparison methods; the dissemination of data and co-operation with European and international bodies and organisations and with nonUnion countries.</P>
    <P>The centre adopts a three-year work programme. Each year the management board adopts the centre's annual work programme on the basis of a draft submitted by the director.  Part of the requirements of the EMC is that it produces an annual report on its activities.  In 1996 it produced its first report on the state of the drugs problem in the European Union.  Today marks the publication of the second report.  The figures it contains are mainly in respect of 1996.</P>
    <P>The key elements of the 1997 report are: cannabis continues to be the most commonly misused illegal drug in the European Union. Depending on the country, from 5 per cent-8 per cent to 20 per cent-30 per cent of the population have tried it.  Amphetamines are the next most commonly misused illegal drugs with up to 3 per cent of adults acknowledging that they have tried them.  Ecstasy and LSD are more popular among young people and their use is linked to a youth culture based around discos and the rave scene.</P>
    <P>Although less than 1 per cent of adults have tried heroin, it is the drug which gives rise to the greatest social and public health problems.  It is estimated that there are between 750,000 and one million heroin addicts in the European Union. These heroin addicts face a risk of death which may be 20 to 30 times higher than that for those in the general population.</P>
    <P>Among drug users, sharing contaminated infected equipment is the main transmission route for HIV and hepatitis C. The rate of hepatitis C infection among intravenous drug users is worryingly high.  This suggests that risk behaviour is continuing, albeit at a lower rate.  It is estimated that there could be up to 500,000 drug users with hepatitis C in the European Union.</P>
    <P>Since 1980 all but a few countries report increasing numbers of drug offences.  Drug users constitute a significant proportion of the prison population in several countries.  On a slightly more positive note, the rate of HIV infection in Europe appears to be stabilising or reducing.</P>
    <P>A recent European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs, ESPAD, indicated that 37 per cent of the 2,000 16 year olds surveyed in <Col N="1069" /> Ireland had at some stage tried cannabis.  While on a par with the United Kingdom, this was high by comparison with other EU member states. This figure should be qualified by noting that of this group 10 per cent had used cannabis 20 times or more.  The prevalence of the use of cannabis among the group in the past 12 months was 33 per cent and in the previous 30 days 19 per cent.</P>
    <P>The mean age of those in treatment for drug misuse in Ireland at 23.6 years is the lowest in the European Union.  The average age in most countries is 27 to 29 years.  The number in treatment under 25 at 65.3 per cent is also the lowest in the European Union.  These figures may reflect the fact that hard drug use in Ireland began later than in other EU member states.  In addition, Ireland has a young population with approximately 47.3 per cent of the population under the age of 25.</P>
    <P>The report does not give a figure for the number using hard drugs in Ireland but the ministerial task force suggested a figure of 8,000 confined in the main to Dublin city.  The Health Research Board report on treated drug misuse in Ireland in 1995 gave a figure of 3,400 in the greater Dublin area and 766 in the remainder of the country receiving treatment.  It must be emphasised that these are the numbers receiving treatment and that the numbers misusing drugs are greatly in excess of these figures.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the approach being taken by Government to respond to the threat posed by drug misuse.  In 1991 a Government strategy to prevent drug misuse was published.  This strategy emphasised the necessity for a multi-agency approach in addressing the problem.  Since 1992 additional funding has been made available to health boards each year for the provision of drugs and AIDS services.  The misuse of drugs has however continued to grow.</P>
    <P>The drugs problem in Ireland manifests itself in two ways &mdash; the misuse of heroin which is a problem unique to the Dublin area and the misuse of other drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy which is a nationwide phenomenon.  Although, as the EMC report indicates, a relatively small number are engaged in the misuse of heroin, the consequences in terms of social order and public health can be serious.  A major part of our effort therefore is concentrated on addressing the misuse of heroin.</P>
    <P>In February 1996 the then Government approved proposals on new demand reduction measures to prevent drug misuse.  The objectives of the proposals were based on two key elements: reducing the number turning to drug misuse through information, education and prevention programmes; and providing a range of treatment options for those addicted to drugs, the ultimate objective of which must be a return to a drug free lifestyle, although this may not be a realistic goal in every instance in the short-term at least.</P>
    <P>Following this a ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs was established and it produced its first report in <Col N="1070" /> October 1996.  The report identified a response to the heroin problem as a priority.  Its recommendations on service provision were: speedy establishment of information databases by the health boards to establish the extent of addiction; health boards to move to eliminate drug treatment waiting lists with the Eastern Health Board waiting list to be eliminated in 1997; particular attention to the needs of young misusers in priority areas with priority status for community employment applications offering integrated services for recovering addicts; a series of education and prevention steps, including stronger truancy measures and anti-drug programmes for all primary schools in priority areas; an estate improvement programme for severely run-down urban housing estates; local authorities to develop sports and recreation activities in priority areas within the national sports strategy framework.</P>
    <P>In addition, new structures were put in place involving the establishment of a Cabinet subcommittee on drugs, a national drugs strategy team and 13 local drugs task forces in areas where the hard drugs problem was most acute.  Twelve of these are in Dublin and the other on the north side of Cork city.  A sum of £10 million was made available for the implementation of service development plans in the task force areas as well as £1 million for services in health boards outside Dublin and £3 million for estate improvements by local authorities.</P>
    <P>When this Government assumed office it decided that the work already in progress should not alone continue but be given a new impetus. The figures published in this report confirm what everyone in Ireland is aware of, that despite the commitment of successive Governments, the tireless work of a great many in the voluntary sector and significant investment much more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The brief of the Cabinet subcommittee therefore was expanded to include social inclusion and local development as well as drugs.  The drugs problem is a manifestation of wider problems of economic and social deprivation that contribute to a sense of exclusion for some sectors of our society.  This is borne out by the Health Research Board report on treated drug misuse in 1995.  It is noteworthy that of the 3,600 cases treated in the greater Dublin area 63 per cent had left school at or before the official school leaving age of 15 years and 87 per cent were unemployed.</P>
    <P>The response to the drugs problem therefore must be part of a wider response which will also tackle the issues of poverty, deprivation and social exclusion.  The Government is focused on dealing with this problem.  A Minister of State was appointed at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation with special responsibility for local development and the national drugs strategy team.  The Minister of State concerned, Deputy Flood, will be making a statement to the House on progress made in his area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> The ministerial task force published its second report in May 1997.  This report dealt with drugs other than heroin and found that the misuse of such drugs is a nationwide phenomenon, the misuse of ecstasy and cannabis being the most common. Its key recommendations were: to establish a youth services development fund with contributions from the Exchequer and the corporate sector to develop youth services in the most disadvantaged areas; and to develop a number of other initiatives aimed at meeting the needs of young people in disadvantaged areas where drug misuse is most prevalent.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children and other agencies continue with the implementation of the recommendations of the two ministerial task force reports.  I wish to outline the progress made in the development of treatment, prevention, education and other services.  I will start with information and research.  All health boards are working on the establishment of information databases which will provide accurate timely data on the subject of drug misuse.  Earlier this year at a meeting of all health boards their representatives were briefed on developments at European level regarding the standardisation of data to render it comparable from one area to another.  As a result, a working group has drawn up a range of data sets, for example, treatment data, schoolbased surveys, national surveys, drug-related deaths and other demand reduction measures which will form the basis of a common set of data to be provided by all health boards at the earliest opportunity.  It is expected that, by 1998, all health boards will be working toward establishing a proper information system.</P>
    <P>On research, during 1997, 26 research projects were given a total of £1 million funding through Forbairt's &ldquo;Science and Technology against Drugs Initiative&rdquo;, grant-aided by Europe for this purpose.  Research includes investigation into the detection and analysis of illegal drugs, biochemistry and pharmacology, such as the neurotoxicity of various forms of &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo; and social sciences studies.  The results of these studies will prove useful to public health services, the Garda and forensic scientists.</P>
    <P>A number of health boards have also undertaken research into the extent and nature of drug misuse.</P>
    <P>One area I consider hugely important is addiction. During 1997 the Addiction Studies course in Trinity College, funded by the Department of Health, was given additional funding to double its input of students in the 1997-98 academic year. The college is developing a master's course in addiction studies.</P>
    <P>On treatment services for those already caught up in the drugs scene, the Eastern Health Board developed a comprehensive service plan for 1997 aimed at eliminating waiting lists for treatment by the end of the year and at expanding all of its services, particularly rehabilitation.  The board has commenced an emergency and assessment <Col N="1072" /> service in a number of its treatment centres. Treatment services are being expanded across the board, emphasis being placed on the provision of treatment to people in their local area.</P>
    <P>There are six treatment centres and 15 satellite clinics providing services in the Eastern Health Board area.  The mobile clinic provides services to drug misusers at Dr. Steevens Hospital and Empress Street in the north inner city.  Work is continuing on the extension of mobile services to the Ballymun and Inchicore areas.</P>
    <P>The methadone prescription-dispensing scheme continues to be expanded, evaluated and regulated.  The total number of people on the central treatment list is 2,550 with the involvement of approximately 60 general practitioners and 50 pharmacies.  A review group was established to examine the arrangements for prescribing and dispensing methadone and its recommendations are being implemented.  I am satisfied that the full implementation of these recommendations will help to redress the present unsatisfactory elements of this service.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to remember that although significant progress has been made in establishing a network of new services throughout the city and bringing new clients into treatment, estimates of the total number of drug misusers suggest that considerable further expansion of services is required to enable health services to adequately address the needs of drug misusers presenting for treatment.  The Eastern Health Board service development plan for drugs misuse, published in March 1997, suggests that, in addition to the existing six treatment centres and 15 satellite centres, an additional 20 satellite centres are required.  There is also a requirement for a drug treatment centre in the south inner city and on the north western side of the city.  Therefore, much work needs to be done.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the need to consult communities, in an endeavour to reach a consensus regarding the location of these satellite centres in addition to the couple of drug treatment centres also required.  At some stage, the level of consultation must be fruitful.  Sometimes consultation can lead to further prevarication without ever reaching agreement.  If we are to embark on a consultative process it will have to be on the basis that there is agreement in principle that we will locate satellite centres within communities where the perceived need has been established.</P>
    <P>I recognise the difficulties the Eastern Health Board faces in endeavouring to reach agreement and have these satellite centres established.  It is clear to me, based on the level of the problem and the board's plans to endeavour to provide the types of services needed throughout the city, we need to make positive progress in this area, and to add to the already established 15 satellite centres.  While I do not under-estimate the difficulties involved, I shall endeavour to work with everybody concerned to bring that about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> People approach me from various parts of the city contending there is considerable overloading in specific areas because satellite centres have not been established elsewhere.  In fairness, local communities understand the extent and nature of the problem and what has to be done to solve it, and are prepared to contribute, recognising that members of their own communities are experiencing this unfortunate problem of addiction.  At the same time, they make clear their concerns that, if progress is not made in establishing satellite centres where the need has been established they will be required to withstand a load perhaps disproportionate to the size of the problem in their local area.</P>
    <P>I recognise that all public representatives must be as sensitive as possible in resolving these problems while ensuring that satellite centres are established and that we shall be unable to deal with the problem adequately if we cannot make progress in that area.</P>
    <P>A freephone telephone helpline was initiated by the Eastern Health Board in July last.  It is operating successfully in assisting people in crisis and, when necessary, referring them to the appropriate service.  The helpline handles an average of 55 calls per week, once again showing the need for the health board to have adequate services in place to guarantee clients identified through such a helpline, can be provided with the right support as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is providing a total of £2.2 million to voluntary and community organisations to support the valuable work done in the area of drug misuse, prevention, treatment and support for drug misusers and their families. In addition, up to 30 community support workers will be employed by the board by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance of rehabilitation, plans are being drawn up to expand the SAOL and SAOILSE rehabilitation programmes, operating in Amiens Street and Henrietta Street respectively.  The board is awaiting contracts for the purchase of property in the inner city to provide an aftercare and rehabilitation unit.  Plans are also being drawn up to extend Domville House in Ballymun for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>Health board schemes are operated in close liaison with community employment schemes, FAS and other back-to-work schemes to maximise the chances of stable drug misusers obtaining employment and becoming socially reintegrated.</P>
    <P>Significant expansion of the present rehabilitation services is required if the needs of persons coming off treatment programmes are to be addressed.  Realistically, when people are weaned off heroin and have reached a stable state &mdash; but have no self-worth and no chance of acquiring a place in society &mdash; the chances of their returning to drug misuse are very high.  For this reason, the Eastern Health Board, in conjunction with other agencies, will prioritise resources on rehabilitation in 1998 and provide as many people as <Col N="1074" /> possible with the support and care necessary to resume productive active lives.  This development of further rehabilitation facilities for stabilised drug users will be a priority of mine as Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>My Department continues its implementation of the recommendations of the two reports of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs.  In the fight against drugs, education is the first line of defence.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the Department of Education and the many voluntary and community agencies, my Department is working on a number of initiatives aimed at preventing young people turning to drugs in the first instance.  Some of these initiatives are as follows: the health promotion unit of my Department liaises with the Department of Education on its development of resource materials for primary schools.  The programme has been successfully piloted and work is continuing on its wider implementation.  Special emphasis is being placed on the delivery of the programme in schools in priority areas.  This programme follows the successful dissemination of a similar programme &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; to second level schools since 1994.</P>
    <P>Health boards, through their health promotion officers, provide a range of services including parenting programmes and modules for youth clubs and other agencies dealing with young people. The Health Promotion Unit, in conjunction with the Cork social and health education project of the Southern Health Board, has developed a parenting programme on drugs and family communication. The programme focuses on the skills and personal attributes that help family members to deal with problems caused by drugs.  The course has been widely used in the Southern Health Board and wider dissemination is planned.  The Health Promotion Unit has also funded Community Awareness of Drugs, a voluntary organisation with offices in Dame Court, Dublin 2, to develop a parenting for prevention programme. The unit's &ldquo;Drugs Questions &mdash; Local Answers&rdquo; programme, which is being disseminated throughout the country, helps local communities to address the drugs problems in their locality.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board area, six education officers have been appointed and four others will be in place by the end of the year.  The board launched an anti-heroin campaign in May. The education officers are engaged in the development of a programme for youth leaders, a community drug awareness programme and an inter-agency drug awareness programme already operates successfully in the north east inner city. It is also working with the National Parents' Council on the development of a parenting for prevention programme.  Plans are being drawn up for a conference on the use of ecstasy later this month and for a directory of information, education and preventative initiatives in the EHB area.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit has run a national drug awareness campaign in April and September <Col N="1075" /> this year with the message &ldquo;Drugs destroy lives, not just of users, but people close to them too&rdquo;, using cinema, television, radio and billboard sites, mainly in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations play a key role in supporting statutory agencies in providing a range of preventative and treatment services.  It is acknowledged that the most successful way to provide treatment for those misusing drugs is in their own community.  It has been demonstrated that, with proper supervision and control, those centres work effectively with the minimum of interference to the local community.  The success of the proposals to provide further treatment centres depends on the co-operation of the local communities.  In its service plan for 1997 the Eastern Health Board identified the areas where it is proposed to establish drug treatment facilities which will be developed in full consultation with local communities and voluntary groups.  The ministerial task force recommended continued support for the work of such organisations whose work complements the work of State agencies. All regional health boards give funding and support to these organisations.</P>
    <P>I have dealt up to now with what is known as the demand reduction aspect of the drug problem. The EMC report deals with other aspects, such as strategies on supply reduction, the joint actions being taken by the European Union and the overall international environment for co-operation. As Members will be aware, the drug phenomenon requires an integrated response at national level, where demand reduction measures go hand in hand with supply reduction strategies.</P>
    <P>In so far as supply reduction is concerned, a range of legislative measures have been put in place aimed at cutting off the supply and ensuring that those who profit from the misery of others are brought to justice.  It is important to remember that significant strides have been made, nationally and internationally, to deprive the merchants of evil of the drug trade of their illgotten gains.  The establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau in 1996 represents a major step forward in the fight against such people who amass vast wealth at the expense of other people's lives and happiness.  Legislation has been introduced to give the Garda the powers necessary for effective action.  The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, enables the Criminal Assets Bureau to take the action necessary to identify, freeze and eventually seize the assets acquired as a result of crime.  The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, provides for periods of detention of up to seven days.  Other key legislative measures include the Disclosure of Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996, which provides for more effective exchange of information between the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners; the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Act, 1997, which provides more powers for the Garda to deal with drug abuse in dance halls and pubs and the Criminal Justice <Col N="1076" /> (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, which reduces the amount of time spent by gardaí on court related duties, thus helping to ensure a greater presence of uniformed gardaí in our communities. The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, has focused on remedies to deal with new life threatening menaces such as syringe attacks.</P>
    <P>As we all know, drug traffickers know no borders. They carry on their illicit trade on an international scale.  It is only through effective action at national level, complemented by wider measures at European and international level, that we can hope to tackle the perpetrators of these despicable crimes.  In late 1996 Ireland ratified the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime.  These conventions require participating states to afford each other extensive criminal law co-operation, as well as to put in place certain domestic criminal law provisions. Ireland's role in the field of international co-operation has significantly improved and expanded since signing up to the conventions.</P>
    <P>Ireland is working at EU level to improve co-operation among member states in responding to drugs issues.  In this context, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has asked me to express his congratulations to the Garda and appreciation of their vigilance which resulted in the weekend seizures of drugs at Enfield, County Meath, and Dublin Airport. Both operations stemmed from joint investigations between the Garda and other EU countries, clearly highlighting the benefits of international co-operation.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the fight against drugs is one in which a number of Government Departments and State agencies have a role.  I have resolved to play my part in stopping the increase in drug abuse.  It is an essential part of my job that the health services continue to develop their role, particularly in the areas where the drug problem is most acute.  This must be matched by a commitment from other agencies, statutory and voluntary. The Government must work with local communities to build up social and economic infrastructures where people are encouraged to turn from drug misuse as a way of coping with life.  It is at community level that real success can be achieved.  There must be a particular focus on rehabilitation and viable life options for former drug users, encouraging them to once again take an active part in society.</P>
    <P>So-called recreational drug misuse is also a worrying phenomenon which is widespread throughout the country.  Our primary defence here is the education system, both formal and informal, where, through life skills programmes such as the &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; substance abuse programme, young people can be equipped with the skills and knowledge to make informed decisions about the use of drugs in their lives. <Col N="1077" /> Such programmes deal not just with illegal drugs but with the legal ones of tobacco and alcohol which cause so much damage in society.  I know my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for youth affairs, Deputy O'Dea, will address the House on this aspect of the problem during the debate.</P>
    <P>The extent of drug misuse in Ireland, as identified in the EMC and ESPAD reports, highlights the need to intensify our efforts at prevention and treatment levels.  The health services have responded by putting structures and services in place to address the problem.  I compliment them, particularly the Eastern Health Board &mdash; its members, its management and its staff &mdash; on their efforts to date.  In doing so, I make it abundantly clear that I recognise we all have a lot more to do.  We have developed the foundations for appropriate responses to the drug problem, and we must now continue to build on this with the aim of reducing the extent of drug misuse in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that the Minister has recognised the work done by the previous Government, especially that contained in the first and second reports of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs, laid the foundations for the comprehensive response required to tackle the drugs problem.  One of the reasons I was anxious this debate took place was that, on examining the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme for Government, little of substance was stated on the drugs issue, and it was not clear the policies proposed and measures prescribed in each of those reports would be continued and built on in the desired manner.  I welcome the approach taken by the Minister in that context.</P>
      <P>Two surveys were published last week which many people regard as disturbing.  Some of the information contained in them was not all that new for those of us in this House familiar with the drugs problem.  Nevertheless, it was surprising to learn where we stood in comparison with other European Union member states in the context of the problems we are experiencing.  The two surveys showed that more Irish teenagers drink alcohol, smoke and take drugs than the European Union average.  The European schools survey on alcohol and other drugs and the annual report of the EU's monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction make it clear we have a long way to travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have laid the foundations for a whole series of policy initiatives and various steps have been taken in the health area in the past two years. However, we are opening doors which require much work to be done and that work to be built on.  One of the things which emerges from the surveys is that the background data in the EU monitoring centre survey derives from the European schools survey.  Despite all that has been said about our drug problem and the problems experienced by so many families, one of the difficulties <Col N="1078" /> is that we do not have the comprehensive data necessary to ensure that policy responses are correct.  This was highlighted in the second report of the ministerial task force.  It is urgent that we ensure the responses and initiatives of the health boards and the Department of Health and Children are based on accurate data rather than assumptions.  This has been a problem over the years.  Too frequently social policy and health initiatives concerning addiction have been based on assumption rather than accurate information. There is a need to monitor and understand the trends and the changes occurring in drug and substance abuse.  Initiatives primarily based on a wing and a prayer insight into social trends are doomed to fail on the day they are announced. The Minister and his task force recognise the importance of operating on accurate information, as did his predecessor.</P>
    <P>Why more Irish than other European teenagers abuse drugs is not clear from the reports.  We are not unique in having areas of deprivation in our cities.  That is replicated in other states, some of which have larger areas of deprivation.  There is a need to ask why more Irish teenagers abuse drugs or whether this conclusion is inaccurate because of the different methods used in conducting the surveys.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the drugs issue, I wish to refer to tobacco and alcohol which are dealt with in the schools survey report.  I raised the issue of tobacco smoking in my first Question Time as Fine Gael spokesperson.  No matter how horrendous the drug problem is, the numbers affected by addiction to illegal substances is extremely small compared to the extraordinarily large number of young people who smoke cigarettes, who are becoming addicted to nicotine and who ignore, or are oblivious to, the long-term health implications.  The schools survey highlights the problem of large numbers of people using tobacco. We have not come to terms with the reality of tobacco use and the necessary action to discourage young people from smoking cigarettes. Many young people who smoke are below the legal age limit for purchasing cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Tobacco companies internationally have pinpointed young children as their primary target market.  Political parties and Governments have not addressed this issue because of a conflict of interest.  Over £400 million is raised in taxes from tobacco sales each year.  The financial expenditure within the health service on tobacco related illnesses has never been audited on a year to year basis.  I suspect we spend a great deal more in both the medium and long-term in treating those suffering from tobacco related illnesses than we raise from taxes on tobacco sales.  The time has come for all parties in this House to declare war on the tobacco companies.  We need a different approach to dealing with these companies.  I have urged the Minister to co-ordinate the bringing of the type of litigation which has taken place in the US.  This Government has been lethargic in pursuing this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> We must look at health policy on tobacco in a different way.  It should not be an issue to be dealt with in one way by the Department of Health and Children and health spokespersons in this House, and in a different way by the Department of Finance. We should have a concorde between political parties in which we agree that it is good to increase tobacco taxes in the budget.  Governments should not be criticised for increasing taxes on tobacco.  The experience is that as cigarettes become more expensive they are less available and young people smoke less because they do not have the funds to acquire as many cigarettes as they would otherwise.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons that Ministers for Finance are reluctant to increase taxes on tobacco is because cigarettes are included in the basket used to determine increases in the consumer price index.  Cigarettes should be taken out of that basket. We should treat them as a separate product which pose a real danger to the health of every child.  This should be seriously looked at in the context of a Government initiative.</P>
    <P>I agree with the ministerial task force report and the monitoring centre's report that whether one is talking about the use of illegal drugs, tobacco or excessive use of alcohol, it is important to deal with demand reduction.  For too long we concentrated on the supply side and not always that effectively.  The Minister has correctly referred to the raft of legislation over the past two years which has given the Garda important new powers to tackle those who seek to prey on the young by importing drugs in order to benefit financially.  We can see those powers working and I join the Minister in congratulating the Garda on the seizure of drugs in Enfield, County Meath. The experience of prohibition in the US in the 1920s when there were speakeasies on every corner shows that if people demand a product, whether it is legal of not, no matter what the police do that product will ultimately be acquired by those seeking it.  Education is the key to ensuring that young people do not use drugs and are educated about the health implications of smoking. Reference has been made to the pilot projects that have been undertaken.  I take the view that not enough money and energy has been put into education programmes in both schools and other areas such as youth organisations.  There is a need for specially prepared teaching programmes and materials, not simply on the pilot projects we have seen but in every school.  There should be at least one teacher who has special training in teaching both primary and secondary children about the risks of drug and tobacco addiction and the risks posed by excessive alcohol.</P>
    <P>The importance of education is clearly demonstrated by the clear concerns of people, particularly those in the under 35 age group, in regard to environmental protection.  In the context of our school programmes over the past 20 years, there has been a growing interest in and concentration on environmental issues.  As a consequence, teenagers <Col N="1080" /> today will rush to the barricades to protest about the destruction of the rain forests or to protect the whale, but the same teenagers are disregarding the damage they are doing to their own health by smoking cigarettes, playing around with cannabis or taking ecstasy at rave events or at discos.  Our education system can inculcate a set of values in young people that they take with them into adult life in a way that gives them a different perspective from those their elders may have had at their age.  It has worked on environmental issues but we must ask ourselves why it is not working on health issues in relation to the use of drugs and tobacco consumption in particular. It is of great importance that we emphasise the demand reduction strategies required in this area.</P>
    <P>Before I am accused of playing down the problem of illegal drugs, it is worth recording that Dr. Mark Morgan, who carried out the schools survey in Ireland, noted that while many people have given a great deal of attention to illegal drugs, it remains the case that the main problem in Europe is legal drugs like cigarettes and alcohol, and that this is especially the case in Ireland.  The Minister said that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, will be addressing the issue of cigarettes but Deputy Cowen is the Minister for Health.  In his Estimates today he is coping with determining allocations for hospitals and medical treatment for those dependent on the GMS.  In those allocations he is providing huge sums to cope with the consequences of nicotine addiction.  Just as we have declared war on the drug barons, we should declare war on the cigarette companies.</P>
    <P>The Minister has correctly highlighted the major problem with regard to heroin, particularly in parts of Dublin.  He is correct in saying there is not a single strategy to tackle that issue.  A whole series of steps need to be taken in the context of the communities from which the vast majority of those addicted to heroin come.  It is simply not acceptable in a State which is committed to tackling the drugs problem that those who are addicted and who seek treatment to restore their lives to some sort of normality are put on waiting lists.  Those people are condemned to continue their addiction, to acquire illegal drugs and allow their health to deteriorate while space is found to provide them with treatment.  I have talked about demand reduction but we must create a situation where addicts who take the step of recognising their need for treatment have that treatment available.  There must not be any question of being put on waiting lists and perhaps further deteriorating because treatment is not available.  That is an extremely important issue in regard to which the Minister must take substantial initiatives.</P>
    <P>In the context of drugs policy objectives, there are three essential objectives which encapsulate the direction in which we should be going.  There must be vigorous enforcement policies, and we now have the legislation to allow for that.  There must be a new dynamic emphasis on both education and prevention.  I referred to some aspects <Col N="1081" /> of that but in the time available I do not have the opportunity to refer to all of them.  The blueprint for that is contained in the two published reports. It is the Minister's responsibility to ensure they are implemented as a priority and that health boards do not find themselves caught up in bureaucratic difficulties in putting in place what is required in this area.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that education on this issue should start in primary schools.  We have looked initially at education in secondary schools but it is beginning in primary schools.  It is in primary schools where young people of eight, 12 or 13 are conditioned into particular views and values.  The 12 or 13 year olds starting secondary school have already decided whether they will smoke, may already have formed a view of drugs or may have a brother or a sister, if they live in particular communities, already taking drugs.  It is important that we get into primary schools not just to talk about the dangers posed by taking drugs but to facilitate young people to resist peer pressure which is a particular problem in this area.  The desire to conform can result in young people trying cannabis, cigarettes or other drugs.  As they head into their teenage years children should come out of an education system which has assisted them to resist pressure from their peers who may encourage them to use some of these substances.</P>
    <P>Obviously parents have a role in this area but we know there are communities in which some of these young people are living where the parents cannot exercise that role. In the context of our school system there is a need to establish parent groups which are committed to ensuring that children in particular schools do not involve themselves in the taking of drugs or legal drugs such as tobacco.  I will not be popular with the teaching profession for saying this, and many teachers are careful not to smoke in sight of children, but it should be a rule in all schools that teachers cannot smoke cigarettes in the schools.  I have no doubt that will upset some teachers but teachers and schools cannot present credible education programmes to children about the evils of tobacco or drugs if the teacher presenting it is seen smoking in the school playground by children on their way home or during break time.  We need to examine these issues in the context of a series of different strategies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, recognising the invaluable work being undertaken by those charitable <Col N="1082" /> organisations which constitute the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group, acknowledging that tax relief similar to that being sought by the Irish Tax Reform Group is available in other European jurisdictions and in the United States, Canada and Australia, calls on the Government to allow tax relief on certain corporate donations to charities, to announce this decision in the Budget Statement of 3 December 1997, and to implement it in the Finance Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Deenihan and Perry.  The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group has not been long established.  Its membership consists of the main charitable organisations which do such excellent work with which all Members are familiar and in one way or another have praised, endorsed and sometimes assisted them. The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group wants every Member to support the motion in my name. I know the policy it proposes has virtually universal support among not only members of Fine Gael but of all parties and Independent Deputies in this House.</P>
    <P>We are fully aware of the work of individual charities and we can assist their work in ensuring the funds they have at their disposal are substantially increased.  This will be done if the House agrees the motion, if the Minister for Finance announces on budget day that he will introduce tax relief on certain corporate donations to charities and if he implements that decision in the Finance Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>At present, tax relief is available in respect of payments to certain charities whose activities take place abroad, particularly in the Third World. There is no tax relief on either personal or business donations to charities whose sphere of operation is in Ireland.  This is surprising as our tax code contains a multiplicity of tax reliefs.  It is very surprising that a code which is so well endowed with reliefs of all sorts has never been amended to exempt from tax donations made to charitable organisations by individual donors or businesses.</P>
    <P>It is doubly surprising because there has been a tradition in this country of imitating tax reliefs which apply in other jurisdictions, especially reliefs available in the United Kingdom.  The relief being sought through this motion is available in many of our European partner countries, in the US, Canada and Australia.  From advertisements on British television I know that in the United Kingdom tax relief is available even on donations to charities by individuals.  The tax authorities in the UK have a mechanism in place whereby they top up donations made by individuals to charities by the appropriate amount of relief due to the individual.  This guarantees that the amount available to charities is increased substantially as the tax benefit accruing to the individual is transferred to the charity.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House makes a far more modest proposal.  It confines itself to the proposal which is being made by the Irish Charities Tax <Col N="1083" /> Reform Group in their correspondence to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The proposal is confined to certain donations made by businesses and deals with the principle of the issue rather then the detail, which is more appropriate to the Minister for Finance and the Finance Act.  The detailed proposals are that business donations made to certain charities should be allowed for tax purposes as normal business expenses; tax relief should not apply to either outlandish or nugatory amounts or to donations of less than £100 or in excess of £10,000 made to individual charities; it should be subject to an overall ceiling of £50,000 or 10 per cent of taxable profits in respect of individual companies.  This will avoid painstaking paper work of little benefit to charities in respect of small donations while at the same time provide a ceiling which will alleviate fears that the relief may be used in a manner which would operate in an unacceptably adverse way to the Exchequer.  It would allow successful Irish businesses to make donations of £10,000 to five charities of their choice and to claim tax relief on these donations in any particular tax year.  It is a modest proposal which I know the Minister favours in principle and I ask him not to press the amendment tabled to the motion but to accept it in the principle in which it is put before the House and to give a commitment to act in accordance with its terms.</P>
    <P>Relief should be confined to charities with a registered CHY number.  The Revenue Commissioners have a straightforward scheme in place for supplying eligible charities with CHY numbers, operated through their office in Nenagh. Naturally, Deputies would like to ensure that donations to which relief applies would go only to properly run charities which are totally above board in their activities.  Consequently, if the Minister for Finance decides to introduce the scheme I advocate in the 1998 Finance Act, I expect him to introduce conditions relating to the eligibility of charities, including conditions in respect of annual audits, filing returns with the Companies Office and compliance with other conditions or provisions of company law which the Minister may consider appropriate to ensure the relief would operate as intended by Members.</P>
    <P>It is not the first time this case has been made in the House.  During the debate on the last Finance Act, the Minister for Finance tabled amendments to achieve exactly what I now advocate. The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, was in favour of the relief proposed but reluctantly did not accept the amendments.  I understand his advice was that his officials and the Revenue Commissioners were afraid that too wide a door might be progressively opened and that the cost of the extended relief might be difficult to justify and onerous on the Exchequer.  This fear would be well founded if tonight's motion resulted in the introduction of general relief for both personal and business donations without any ceiling on the amount of the donation.  Some <Col N="1084" /> charities would regard this as the ideal position. We know, however, that frequently in life and politics the best is the enemy of the good and that the representatives of the charities who have contacted Members would be extremely happy if the motion before the House was accepted by the Minister and if relief was introduced but confined to certain business donations with appropriate ceilings and conditions as to how the scheme would operate.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that corporate donations in Ireland to charities amount to about £12 million per annum.  The rate of tax applying to the corporate sector varies.  Manufacturing industries and certain financial services pay a maximum rate of 10 per cent while other businesses pay a maximum rate of 36 per cent.  Consequently, the relief to individual companies would depend on the sector in which they trade.  The general estimate which I do not think is too far off the mark is that the amount of relief which would be levered by this motion would be around £3 million.</P>
    <P>My proposal, if accepted, would result in tax relief of this amount applying to different companies. If this were the end of the affair, such relief would be of very little benefit to charities because it is the donor companies, rather than the charities, which would benefit.  The charities and those who run them are confident that the existence of the relief would encourage the corporate sector to significantly increase their donations. Rather than companies pocketing the new relief it would, in effect, be transferred to individual charities through increased donations.  I would prefer the UK system where the relief to which a business is entitled arising from a charitable donation is paid directly to the charity rather than to the individual business with the compliance of that business.  It would be a better scheme if the relief were remitted directly to the charity rather than to the donor.</P>
    <P>Some observers and contributors to this debate may argue that this is much ado about nothing. They may assert that the amount of money involved is too small to make any significant impact on social injustice and that the real needs of individuals and communities are of greater magnitude than £15 million or an additional £3 million could meet.  Many people outside this House would be of the view that we should always deal with grandiose sums in here. Deputies would take a different view; they are well aware of the ways in which social injustice can be effectively targeted by relatively small amounts of money.  Other people would argue that the State should undertake to fund the activities currently being carried out by charitable organisations.  This is an age old ideological argument which is frequently made by the extreme left of the political spectrum.  Such an argument maintains that the work carried out by charities rather than alleviating social injustice ensures the State is relieved of the responsibility of dealing with these issues.  As charities can never do the job in full because of limited resources they, in <Col N="1085" /> some ironic way, provide a safety net for an indolent State which is relieved of its responsibility and consequently does nothing.  In my view that argument is rubbish; it may have been true in the 19th century but it is certainly not true in modern democracies.  I do not want to dwell on the issue, I merely mention it as a potential argument.</P>
    <P>I would like to acknowledge the excellent work done by charities over the years.  If they had not been active in so many areas, the work they carried out might not have been done at all.  We have a very proud tradition of co-operation and partnership between public bodies and voluntary organisations.  This partnership has enhanced and improved the delivery of many social services and the work of charities, in particular, has dramatically improved the quality and degree of assistance available to persons with needs, problems and disabilities.</P>
    <P>The amount of relief advocated here is approximately £3 million.  If this proposal succeeds corporate donations to charities in 1998 will be approximately £15 million.  This may seem small in contrast with the enormity of the social problems of which we are all only too aware.  In this context, however, it is worth recalling that £15 million approximates to the total annual expenditure of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which provides real practical assistance to over 200,000 persons in Ireland.  We are not talking about nugatory amounts but about amounts which can be used to supplement the work already being carried out by State agencies and Government Departments, money which, in the hands of people living in communities, can be very effectively targeted to supplement what is already in place and to provide additional relief and assistance where necessary.  If we were to take the Society of St. Vincent de Paul as an example of the way in which so many people can be assisted through the expenditure of £15 million, we would have a clearer view of what the charities are looking for when they seek this relief.</P>
    <P>No words of mine could sufficiently praise the work of the charitable organisations.  I commend and congratulate them and their dedicated workers, many of whom are voluntary.  I also compliment the dedicated professional staff employed by the charities who ensure they are effective, efficient and have a high reputation.  If there were any question mark over the charities in Ireland, people would stop donating to them. It is because they are of such high repute and are held in such high regard that people continue to donate more to charities on a <i>per capita</i> basis than those in any other country.  This is due to the dedicated staff and to the voluntary workers involved in charitable organisations.  I do not want to single out any one charity but I have been contacted not only by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group but by several of the individual charities which are members of that group and by all the principal charities which are household <Col N="1086" /> names.  I commend them all for their excellent work and I commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion which calls for tax relief on corporate donations to charities.  That is also the proposal which the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group presented to the Minister for Finance recently.  The motion and the group's proposal are set against rapid economic growth and buoyant tax receipts.  They are made in the knowledge that Ireland remains one of the very few advanced economies which does not allow corporate bodies to offset for tax purposes a proportion of their yearly profits against donations to a variety of charitable institutions. Most OECD countries permit companies to make donations, free of tax, to properly registered charities in their home country.  Apart from altruistic motives, this activity is seen by many companies as an important form of promotion.  It also serves the purpose of funding many types of charitable agencies working in vital areas.</P>
      <P>In the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Hungary and Japan it was found that the non-profit sector as a whole employs something of the order of 11.8 million people with a further 4.7 million unpaid volunteers.  The non-profit sector's operating expenditures in these countries are equal to 5 per cent of GDP.  The non-profit sector employs one in every 20 people and one in every eight service jobs in these countries.  One out of every seven new jobs created in the US, Germany and France is created by the non-profit sector.</P>
      <P>We should ask who the members of the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group are.  The membership list reveals that most of them are prominent charities which deal on a daily basis with the problems of poverty, illness, homelessness, inadequate services for people with disabilities and many of the other ills which continue to beset this country.  Were it not for the commitment and dedication of charities' paid employees and the large number of volunteers, far more pressure would be placed on the national finances and the Minister would not find it as easy to balance his books as he currently does.  There would certainly be a major burden placed on our health and welfare services but for the great work which charities are doing.  As somebody who is constantly involved in fund-raising for one cause or another, I fully appreciate the difficulty of getting money when so many other charities are competing for it.  People are becoming frustrated by the level of demands on them from charities and fund-raising groups.  However, the Irish are a charitable and kind nation, and they still give, out of Christianity, out of the goodness of their hearts, although under protest at times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan's proposal would provide a source of funding that would appeal to the corporate sector.  I am involved in a project in Kerry which benefits from relief from the Department of Finance contributions.  We have found this to be a very important part of our fund-raising initiatives and have collected a large amount of <Col N="1087" /> money because there is a tax benefit for the contributors. I am convinced if this motion is accepted it will ease the burden of collecting and servicing initiatives on the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group who provide support and services to the weaker and more vulnerable sections of our community.</P>
    <P>There is no need to remind anyone in this House about the contribution of the voluntary sector to Irish life.  Many Members of this House have been glad in the past to call on local charities to come to the aid of one of their constituents. Without the thousands of volunteers who give of their time to work for charities and voluntary organisations, this country would be in a much poorer state.  It should be noted that research in other countries indicates that the non-profit sector can be shown to employ one in every 20 people and provide one out of every eight service jobs, that at a time when it is sought to create jobs with the emphasis on manufacturing industry, it is important to realise that there is great job potential in the service industry.  I have no reason to believe the Irish situation is any different.</P>
    <P>The idea of tax relief on donations to charities has been considered in the past.  Certain gifts to education, culture and the arts are deductible for tax purposes.  Also, the principle of tax relief on corporate social responsibility is reflected in provisions relating to support for certain local enterprise development activities such as First Step and the Enterprise Trust.  However, donations to the wide variety of other charities are disallowed, and this acts as a disincentive to companies to donate money to charity.</P>
    <P>The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group have commissioned important research on this matter. Fifty-two per cent of the companies who responded to the research carried out by Fitzpatrick Associates said they would increase donations to charities in the event of tax relief being introduced.  Companies want to give back to the communities out of which they have grown. Thriving companies, of which we have many in the current economic climate, want to be able to respond to the needs of the local community. More than this, they feel obliged to do so because they have grown out of the local community.  Why then should the tax system act as a disincentive to this giving?  Why should companies not be able to regard donations to charities as a legitimate business expense as requested by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group?  It is vital, if the Irish charitable sector is to continue to meet the required level of operation, that charities have further access to corporate sources of income. The limited scope of the present proposal ensures the cost to the Government would be small.  Personal giving in Ireland is very high.  However, this does not apply to corporate giving which is lower than it should be because of the absence of tax relief.  The £11 million which would be likely to be donated from the corporate sector to charities <Col N="1088" /> in the event of tax relief being introduced is minuscule. When one considers that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul helps about 200,000 people annually on a budget of £15 million, it puts the £11 million in perspective.  That is a significant figure which would greatly benefit Irish charities.</P>
    <P>This proposal promoted by Deputy Noonan would bring Ireland into line with other European countries.  The level of support for charities by the corporate sector is not in proportion to personal giving.  This proposal would remove the most frequently cited obstacle to corporate giving, namely the absence of tax relief on donations.  When companies are giving to charities, they take out advertisements in charity magazines in order to get over the difficulty posed by the absence of tax relief.  This is an inefficient practice which could be eliminated if our proposal were introduced.  It would also allow all charities to obtain additional sums from a previously untapped source and, accordingly, to extend the range of services they offer.  It would be of particular benefit to smaller charities who do not have the resources to mount large-scale fund-raising campaigns and would also, to a limited degree, compensate charities for revenue lost to the national lottery which has taken much of the revenue from local charities.  We need this tax relief because, despite economic growth, the massive increase in house prices and in the sale of consumer products, poverty and social exclusion in our society remains at unacceptable levels.  That is commonly accepted.  We have only to go down the street to see the number of people begging and living rough in the city quite close to this building.  We can see examples of marginalisation throughout our society, especially in this city.</P>
    <P>Charitable organisations, including those represented by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group recognise and deal every day with poverty, illness, homelessness and services to people with disability.  They provide services to the weaker and more vulnerable sectors of the community, including the young, the old and the disabled. They are, however, the first to admit that only a small percentage of needs are being effectively met.  The only obstacle to provision of a more effective service to those in need is the lack of funding.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept this motion. It would send out the wrong message to people who are working hard in local voluntary and community groups and who are frustrated by the level of support they receive particularly from Government and Government agencies if the House were to divide on this issue.  Acceptance of this motion would send out a clear signal that we are listening to them and taking on board what they are telling us.  Because they represent so many people, the Minister would get much credit if he accepted our proposal.  Given that the Minister is a pragmatist and has always listened to various demands from this side of the House, he should look at this reasonable proposal.  I appeal to him <Col N="1089" /> to accept it.  The arguments for it are clear and straightforward.  There is a very strong case. Opposition Deputies often make impossible demands by way of motion.  This one is possible, it will not upset the nation's finances, and it is something the Minister could justify to his Cabinet colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the motion.  Why is tax relief needed?  Despite huge economic growth, a massive increase in house prices and the sale of consumer products, poverty and social exclusion in society remains at a most unacceptable level.  This change would allow all charities to obtain additional funds from previously untapped sources and to extend accordingly the range of services they offer.  I support the call for tax relief to be allowed on corporate donations as set out by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group because it is simplistic.  Companies would be allowed to write off their donations as ordinary business expense.  As soon as guidelines would issue to companies about the relief, little or no further administration would be involved from the Government's point of view.  The proposal would benefit all charities, but particularly smaller charities which is very important.  Many small charities do not have the wherewithal to mount large fund-raising campaigns but if a tax relief was introduced on corporate donations they would be in a position to make contact with local companies, show them their work locally and request donations.  This has enormous potential.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to put a value on the amount of work done voluntarily.  Local fundraising helps local services.  For example, Daffodil Day provides funds to support local hospices and home care nursing in the community.  The hospice in Sligo is doing great work.  If the voluntary element were taken from it, it would be extremely difficult for it and similar hospices which provide invaluable care to continue.  They need further funds as it is.</P>
      <P>According to the Irish charities group proposal companies when making donations to charities would police them.  They would not give their hard earned resources out in a reckless manner. They will want to ensure the local charity they support is bona fide, well run and carrying out valuable charitable work in the community under supervision.  This form of fundraising is efficient. Fundraising events inevitably incur higher administration costs compared with this proposal.  It would tighten up fundraising considerably on a local basis.  Companies are run devoid of sentiment and a businesslike approach would be used in dealing with contributions.  Working with charitable organisations is very effective for companies in terms of public relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that charities will respond positively to calls for more openness and transparency on how funds are spent.  Deputy Noonan pointed out that controls would be included in a Bill to ensure transparency and adherence to the <Col N="1090" /> companies Acts.  Most OECD countries allow tax relief on donations to properly registered charities. Virtually every EU country allows tax relief on charitable donations.</P>
    <P>IBEC and the Small Firms' Association, which represents the backbone of small industry, support this call.  This proposal is aimed at average Irish companies.  In the current economic climate there are in excess of 150,000 small to medium-sized companies doing well which would like to be seen helping local charities, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which does great work throughout the country.  Despite the economic boom, a great deal of poverty still exists and this measure would tap into a new source of funding that would benefit many people in need.  Many people are marginalised and earn low salaries.  I am aware of the great work done by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Ballymote and the number of people it helps is amazing.  If companies in the region knew they would obtain a tax write-off on a donation it would give them a bona fide excuse in their accounts to make a contribution to those causes.</P>
    <P>The proposal will benefit all charities, but particularly small and medium-sized charities which cannot mount substantial campaigns or enter into sponsorship arrangements.  There are companies which would genuinely like to help people but need reform of the tax system to do so.  It will result in imaginative ways of obtaining donations from companies.  If employees of a company decided to give £3,000 as a collective contribution, the employer could match it knowing that it would be subject to a tax write-off.</P>
    <P>A sum of £3 million has been mentioned for expenditure but the measure would be a selffinancing way to collect money.  It would benefit and tighten up charities.  The economic boom has been very good for many people but there are many for whom there is no benefit and we are obliged to help those people.  I appeal to the Minister to consider incorporating this measure into the budget.  I fully support my colleagues on this issue.</P>

      <P>&mdash;also recognises the considerable resources and exemptions from tax already available to charitable bodies.</P>
      <P>&mdash;notes the submission from the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group and acknowledges that the Minister for Finance will give careful consideration to it during the preparation of the budget in December.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> Domestic charities sought the introduction of a tax relief on donations since a relief on personal donations for Third World charities was introduced in the 1995 Finance Act.  As Deputy Noonan did not embarrass me by quoting me except for brief references to debates on Finance Acts over recent years I will not embarrass him or his colleagues by asking why the previous Government did not do anything about this.</P>
    <P>I readily recognise that the work done by charities relieves the Exchequer of a considerable burden. I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Noonan's reference to people on the far left of politics when I was a student who used to make the nonsensical point that the State should provide everything. If charities were not doing their work, the State would have an inordinately large burden. One of Ireland's pluses which will hopefully continue into the next millennium is the voluntarism of its people.  There is a stronger ethos in certain regions than in others.  Our growing prosperity may dampen traditions in many respects but I hope it does not change that aspect of our culture and continues into the future.</P>
    <P>I also recognise that the dedicated staff of various charities do outstanding work.  The lobbying carried out by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group has been very effective.  It has brought this matter to notice over recent years and has been successful.  Complex issues are involved and I will endeavour to address them.  I think the House will agree that domestic charities play a vital and cohesive role in society.  The Government is fully aware &mdash; as the previous Government was &mdash; of the important work done by the domestic charities and this is reflected in the significant sums of money provided to those charities from public funds every year.</P>
    <P>The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group has been campaigning strongly for the introduction of a tax relief on corporate donations between £100 and £10,000 subject to a maximum company contribution limit of 10 per cent of company income or £50,000, whichever is the lesser.  As Minister for Finance, I receive many requests for tax relief from many worthy causes in the lead up to the budget.  It is not possible to accede to all these requests and the normal procedure is that they are carefully considered in the context of the resources available for the budget.</P>
    <P>I am not a magician or a Harry Houdini who can escape with one bound from the constraints imposed by budgetary parameters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>My background in another sphere stands me in good stead in some matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot satisfy the many demands for extra funding for entirely laudable causes.  If I want to meet any of the demands made on me I have to prioritise the list and other Ministers must do the same.  This is the essence of framing a budget <Col N="1092" /> whether for a nation or one's finances.  As I pointed out to some groups I met recently, the principles of sound finance are not complicated. They can be made to look complicated by some people but essentially it is a matter of matching what one can prudently spend on one side with what one can prudently tax on the other.</P>
    <P>I have taken an interest in the group's submission, as I did in Opposition.  At my request and as part of the preparation for the budget next month senior officials of my Department met representatives of the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group to discuss its proposal in some depth without committing to its introduction.  I am grateful to the group for setting out its proposal with such clarity and precision.</P>
    <P>It is often claimed that the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group's proposal is only seeking a level playing field with Third World charities. However, there is a distinct difference between the group's tax proposal and the tax relief available for Third World charities.  First, the relief for Third World charities is only available for personal donations and not corporate donations and, second, it goes to the charity, not the donor, as proposed by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.  This is an important distinction.</P>
    <P>Before discussing in detail the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group's tax proposal it is relevant to set all such requests for relief and resources in the context of Ireland's recent economic performance. This performance has led to heightened expectations in certain quarters and I have spoken elsewhere about the consequences of such expectations.  Ireland has enjoyed strong economic growth over the past four years.  This year growth is expected to be 7 per cent or more &mdash; the fourth year in succession of growth of this magnitude.  We are broadly acknowledged as being Europe's economic success story of the l990s, with increased prosperity, stable prices and a level of employment growth which is the envy of many larger countries.  However, the question about how we use this growth and its subsequent benefits is a pressing one.  We still have a very high level of debt.  While this has been falling as a percentage of gross domestic product, the physical amount of the debt remains and has to be serviced and ultimately repaid.  This can only be done by the Government operating budget surpluses.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, sets out a commitment to eliminating Exchequer borrowing over the next two to three years.  At this stage of the economic cycle we should be using the opportunity of strong growth to run surpluses and reduce the debt burden.  This approach is consistent with the terms and the spirit of the stability and growth pact which is an integral part of EMU.</P>
    <P>The medium-term outlook for the economy also points to the need to run budget surpluses now.  It is clear that the economy is growing at a rate which cannot last indefinitely.  It is expected <Col N="1093" /> that over the medium term growth will moderate from the current very high rates, although it should remain higher than the EU average.  It is only prudent to plan for that eventuality.</P>
    <P>Moreover, in recent years the economy has benefited from substantial EU Structural and Cohesion Funding.  The economy still has very significant investment needs and I am confident that the EU will recognise this and provide considerable further Structural Funding for some time to come.  However, the prospective enlargement of the EU will make other demands on the Union budget and we must take account of the likelihood that EU Structural Funds to this country after 1999 may not be on the same scale as in recent years.  It is vital that we maintain, to the extent necessary from our own resources, the essential infrastructural investment that our strongly growing economy requires, while of course continuing to respect the fiscal disciplines of EMU.</P>
    <P>The current favourable demographic factors are also contributing to our strong economic performance at present but will diminish in the decades ahead.  The long-term ageing of the population will lead to an escalation in health and pension costs which will place a burden on the public finances, and this will take place when labour force growth is expected to decelerate.  The strong economic performance can give rise to heightened expectations.  It is ironic that the nature of economic success is such that, if allowed, it can also sow the seeds of future failure.  The strength of our current growth rates may generate an unrealistic set of expectations in relation to a dramatic enhancement of public services.  It can also lead to expectations in relation to what is possible in terms of tax reform.  Such expectations could undermine the conditions necessary for further economic and employment growth.</P>
    <P>We have to be careful about how we use the benefits of our recent economic success.  I am sure we all remember the consequences of the difficulties that were caused by political decisions taken in the 1970s and early 1980s and the subsequent need for fiscal rectitude.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years all Governments have undertaken tax reform and have appreciated the importance of tax reductions in increasing competitiveness and growth, thereby contributing to the creation and maintenance of sustainable employment.  The main concern has been to redistribute the burden of taxation between the different sectors of production in favour of labour. The primary focus has, therefore, been on reducing the level of income tax while implementing base-broadening measures across the various tax heads.  This strategy of concentrating on income tax reduction has also been guided by the desirability of achieving moderate wage developments through a consensus approach with the social partners.</P>
    <P>Significant progress was made in improving the income tax system, despite at times the constraints of the serious imbalance in the public <Col N="1094" /> finances.  The standard income tax rate has been cut from 35 per cent to 26 per cent and the top rate from 58 per cent to 48 per cent, substantially reducing marginal rates for the majority of taxpayers. The number of tax rates has been reduced from three to two, while personal allowances and the standard rate bands have been considerably increased.</P>
    <P>The progress made in improving the income tax system can be seen from the following two examples.  For a single person on the average production wage, which is currently estimated at approximately £14,800, the income tax improvements, when combined with changes in employees' PRSI, have resulted in their tax, PRSI and levies burden as a proportion of their gross wage falling from 36 per cent in 1987 to 27 per cent this year.  In the case of a married couple with one earner and two children on the same level of income, the fall in the average tax burden has been from approximately 26 per cent in 1987 to slightly below 20 per cent this year.  This is real progress.  My Department has recently made presentations to a number of visiting delegations. One consisted of Scandinavian Members of Parliament who had come to see what lessons they could learn in getting their very high tax rates down &mdash; they are making pilgrimages here to seek the Holy Grail.  This is a major turn around from the past.</P>
    <P>Widening the tax base across the various tax heads has played a significant part in facilitating these improvements in the income tax system. The corporation tax base has been greatly widened through the abolition or restriction of reliefs, for example, the abolition of accelerated capital allowances, ending of export sales relief and restriction of section 84 loans.  This has enabled the standard rate of corporate tax to be cut by 14 percentage points from 50 per cent to 36 per cent.  Through this process the balance of incentives, as between capital and labour, has shifted greatly in favour of job creation.  A wide range of reliefs and exemptions in the income tax code have been restricted or abolished, for example, life assurance premiums, share options, certain loan interest, 10 per cent dividends and ESR-Shannon dividends.  In more recent years tax relief for covenants has been considerably limited and reliefs for mortgage interest and medical insurance premiums have been restricted to the standard rate of tax.  In addition a number of new reliefs introduced have been provided only at the standard rate.  Furthermore, disability and unemployment benefits have been made reckonable as income for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>Changes in capital taxation have included the introduction of a probate tax.  Changes in VAT and excise duties have been in line with Ireland's commitment to the single market.  The standard rate of VAT has been reduced from 25 per cent to 21 per cent.  In addition, there has been considerable simplification and consolidation of the rating structure, with a 12.5 per cent reduced rate now applied to a range of employment sectors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> The VAT base has also been extended to cover electricity and telecommunications.  Excise duties have been increased on some energy products and on consumer products that are damaging to health, for example, tobacco and alcohol.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of the overall tax system has been improved through tax administration measures, including the introduction of selfassessment, the extension of withholding tax and tax clearance systems.  There has also been an increase in resources allocated to the various audit, investigative and compliance programmes in Revenue and in Revenue powers.  Continued progress is required to further reduce the tax wedge for low to middle income earners, thereby improving the returns from and the incentives to take up employment.  If this goal is to be achieved, particularly when account is taken of the proposed reductions in the standard rate of corporation tax, it is essential that tax reliefs are kept within reasonable bounds and the tax base broadened where possible.  This approach has served us well over the past ten years.  Consequently any proposals to widen existing reliefs or introduce new ones, no matter how laudable in their own right, must be carefully examined and judged against our overall objective of reducing the tax burden on earned income which facilitates the creation and maintenance of employment.</P>
    <P>Before considering the proposal before us in detail, it would be useful to look at what constitutes a charity.  As matters stand there is no comprehensive definition of what is a charity or what is charitable in legislation.  The only definition which may be found for a charity is contained in section 334(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and this only states that: &ldquo;.  .charity means any body of persons or trust established for charitable purposes only&rdquo;.  Let us face it, this is not of much help.  There is no guidance in legislation as to what the phrase &ldquo;charitable purposes only&rdquo; means and so it has been left to the courts to interpret that expression.  The modern interpretation of what is meant by charitable purposes stems from a judgment in a court case as far back as 1891.</P>
    <P>To this day, the four categories of charitable purposes as established in this case form the basis of what activities are charitable for taxation purposes both here and in the UK.  These categories are: the advancement of religion, the advancement of education, the relief of poverty and other purposes beneficial to the community not falling within the other three categories.  Deputies will agree the latter definition involving purposes beneficial to the community could include bodies that would not be considered as charities in the commonly understood sense of the term.</P>
    <P>Before looking at what may be available in the current tax system for charitable bodies, it is important to look at the present supervision and regulation of charities, or rather lack of regulations. Unlike other countries, there is no register of charities in Ireland.  In 1989 a committee <Col N="1096" /> under the chairmanship of Justice Declan Costello was set up to examine the position regarding charities in Ireland.  Among other things, the group recommended there should be a system of registration of all organisations fund-raising for charitable purposes.  Furthermore, the last Government through the Minister of State at the Department of Justice had established an advisory group to examine the whole area of charitable and fundraising bodies.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the principal authority for the administration of charities law, including fundraising. That Minister also has responsibility for the Charities Act, 1961 and 1973.  These Acts provide for the jurisdiction and powers of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests in relation to charitable trusts.</P>
    <P>In the absence of controlling legislation the whole area of charities can be complex and the general public's understanding tends to be uncertain and confused on occasions.  This misunderstanding also extends to the role of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to charities.  The Revenue Commissioners do not grant charitable status <i>per se.</i> They merely grant bodies which have proven their case certain exemptions from taxation.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy John O'Donoghue, has included in his legislative programme the reform of the law relating to the administration and regulation of charities along the lines of the report of the Committee on Fundraising Activities for Charitable and Other Purposes &mdash; the Costello report &mdash; and the subsequent report of the Advisory Group on Charities and Fundraising Legislation &mdash; Burton advisory committee.  The advisory group comprised representatives of organisations working in this area and reported to the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen, who referred the report to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  The select committee issued a report early in 1997.  Work is proceeding as quickly as possible on this legislation in the light of other legislative priorities.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a proper statutory regulatory regime, members of the public with grievances may have no means of having them addressed. There would be no ready means for Dáil Éireann to ensure that charities are using the money raised with the support of any new tax relief in a proper manner.  Such issues would have to be considered in framing any relief.</P>
    <P>There is no general tax relief in the Irish tax code for charitable donations, although there are a number of designated reliefs for various types of charitable bodies.  I intend to begin my consideration of this matter by briefly outlining the current tax regime for charitable bodies.  Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1995, provides for tax relief in respect of personal donations to certain designated Third World charities.  The donations have to be between £250 and £750 per annum.  The 1995 measure was introduced in memory of the <Col N="1097" /> 150th anniversary of the Great Irish Famine and in recognition of the type and scale of the problems encountered in the Third World.  The scheme of tax relief on personal donations to Third World charities also forms part of Ireland's official overseas development aid.  By allowing certain personal contributions as a tax relief this allows people to exercise choice with regard to the agency to which they wish the State to contribute to our overseas development aid.</P>
    <P>The amount Ireland contributes to overseas development aid has increased substantially in recent years.  Third World charities benefit from Exchequer support through the overseas development aid.  Ireland's contribution to overseas development aid in 1997 is £122 million, which is more than double the 1993 contribution of £55 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy needs advice on that subject I am willing to share with him my past experiences.</P>
      <P>The decision to grant relief only to Third World charities is not a reflection on domestic charities but was introduced by the previous Government for the reasons outlined above. What the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group is proposing is a tax relief on corporate donations to charities whereas the tax relief for Third World charities is for personal donations.</P>
      <P>I understand that to date the Minister for Foreign Affairs has designated 17 charities for the purposes of this relief.  I also understand that to date the designated charities have not utilised this provision to any great extent.  A body of persons or trust which meets any of the four categories of charitable purpose arising from the 1891 court case mentioned earlier is entitled to claim certain exemptions from the following taxes: income tax, corporation tax, where the body is incorporated, deposit interest retention tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty and probate tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By far the best known exemption available to charities is the income tax exemption found in sections 333 and 334 of the Income Tax Act, 1967. Under these provisions most types of income are exempt.  As regards income from trade it is a requirement that the income must be applied solely to the purposes of the charity and this does not pose any difficulties generally.  There is also a second requirement that the trade must be exercised in carrying out a primary purpose of the charity or the work connected with the trade must be carried on mainly by the beneficiaries of the charity.  The position in relation to corporation tax and capital gains tax is similar to that for <Col N="1098" /> income tax.  The profit or gain must be applied for charitable purposes only.</P>
    <P>These are significant concessions.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that statistics are not available which would enable them to cost the current scheme of charitable exemptions.  The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that since the foundation of the State they have received close to 12,500 applications for exemption from tax from organisations claiming to be charitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they studied the Fitzpatrick report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of those, about 8,000 organisations have been proved entitled to these exemptions and Revenue estimate that about 4,000 of these are currently active.  These numbers could be underestimated because they may not include bodies engaged in charitable work which have not applied for tax exemption.  It should also be noted that the Revenue Commissioners receive applications for charitable exemption on a regular basis.  While the number varies it is approximately 200 each year.</P>
      <P>Experience has shown that the majority of charitably exempt bodies are small local organisations operated on a voluntary basis. The data on bodies granted exemption between 1992 and 1996, inclusive, show that 7 per cent of the applications approved were for religious purposes, 12 per cent for poverty, 24 per cent for educational purposes and 57 per cent for purposes beneficial to the community.  It is significant that most of the recently exempt bodies fall into the &ldquo;beneficial to the community&rdquo; category.</P>
      <P>I mentioned briefly the role of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to exempt bodies. Their role in relation to charities is solely to deal with claims for exemption from tax in accordance with statutory conditions.  As part of this procedure they request bodies approved by them as charities for the purposes of tax exemption to submit audited accounts within 18 months of receiving their charitable exemption.  In addition, they carry out random checking of bodies to confirm continuing entitlement to exemption. However, they have no function in supervising the activities of such bodies and it would not be desirable or practical for the Revenue to undertake the supervision of charities.  The main role of the Revenue Commissioners is the collection of taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as the general provision providing for tax exemption for charitable bodies, there are a number of other tax reliefs which could be of benefit to charitable bodies, one of the main ones being section 32 of the Finance Act, 1984.  This section provides for tax relief, either from income tax or corporation tax, for gifts to approved bodies, which are essentially third level colleges, university bodies or other approved bodies concerned solely with the advancement in the State <Col N="1099" /> of one or more specified approved subjects. Approved subjects include the practice of art and design, music and musical composition, theatre arts, architecture and film arts.  A majority of the organisations applying to become approved bodies under this section also have charitable exemption. For the purposes of this section the definition of an approved body is interpreted quite widely and to date about 158 bodies have been granted relief under this section.</P>
    <P>When determining an application from a particular organisation to become an approved body under this section, I normally seek the views of the Revenue Commissioners on the legal aspects of the application and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands on its artistic merits. However, the final decision in relation to any application rests with me.</P>
    <P>The limited information available on what is donated to charities makes it hard to cost the proposal with any confidence.  The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group estimated in its submission that the cost of this relief would be about £3.3 million based on corporate donations of £11 million. These figures were arrived at by determining the level of corporate donations to charities in certain European countries as a percentage of gross domestic product and applying that percentage to Ireland's gross domestic product.</P>
    <P>The proposed relief would undoubtedly benefit charities in their endeavours and would certainly regularise corporate donations, some of which are currently given in the form of sponsorship and advertising which may be allowable as a deduction for tax purposes.  It should also be noted that the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group estimate of the cost of the relief does not take account of any possible increase in corporate donations, but assumes that certain expenditure will be switched from existing advertising and promotional expenditure.</P>
    <P>The material supplied by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group suggests that the breakdown on the Continent between individual and corporate donors tends to be about 2 to 1.  Although accurate information is not available it appears that in Ireland individual donors provide a much bigger proportion of charities' income than they do on the Continent.  In Ireland the breakdown between individual and corporate donors is estimated to be about 20 to 1.  If the introduction of a tax relief for corporate donations leads to an increase in the amount of corporate donations to charities, the cost of the relief would be higher than suggested by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.</P>
    <P>The introduction of tax relief on corporate donations to charities would inevitably lead to demands for a similar relief for personal donations at a significantly greater cost to the Exchequer.  It was estimated in a study carried out on behalf of the national lottery that personal contributions to domestic charities come to about £200 million in 1995.  This figure of nearly £200 <Col N="1100" /> million compares with the figure of £130 million in 1991, which suggests donations to charities are increasing significantly.  This figure is unlikely to include personal donations to churches or religions which may also be exempt bodies for charitable purposes.  That personal donations exceed the level of corporate donations to domestic charities by an estimated twentyfold illustrates how costly a tax relief for personal donations could be.</P>
    <P>Voluntary and community bodies, many of which would be charitable bodies, receive considerable resources directly from the Exchequer and the national lottery.  It is estimated that the voluntary sector received about £490 million from various Departments in 1995.  The voluntary and community groups in receipt of this funding provide a range of essential services.  For example, one of the most important schemes being provided by voluntary and community groups is the community employment scheme.  Other schemes operated by these groups are community training, community training workshops and community enterprise and co-operative development.  As Deputies will be aware, these programmes are making a substantial contribution to community-based local activities.  For example, workers on community employment schemes are used to provide staff for projects run by voluntary and community organisations.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children, through the health boards, also commits large scale resources to a range of services for the elderly and the disabled.  The Department provides funding to a range of voluntary organisations, religious orders and community-based groups. This would include providing services for child care, people with disabilities, the elderly, drug users, rape crisis centres etc.</P>
    <P>This is only a sample of what is being done by the Government to assist the voluntary and community sector.  I recognise that if these services were not provided by these bodies the demand for the services would fall back on the State.  The valuable work being done by voluntary bodies in these areas is recognised by the Government and the country at large.  I also appreciate that these bodies could do with additional resources.  Unfortunately, as I have stated previously, resources are not unlimited and difficult decisions on where and how resources are to be allocated have to be made.</P>
    <P>The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group's proposal will receive careful consideration.  However, any decision in that regard is for the Government in the context of the budget.  Nonetheless, I will consider the comments and suggestions of Deputies in my deliberations.  In return, I ask Deputies to recognise that introducing a tax relief for charities is not a simple matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity to revisit the issue.  Neither he nor the civil servants who drafted the speech told us anything.  We had an opportunity today to examine the Minister's Estimates and they make extremely interesting reading.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I am sure all Members are familiar with the issue.  It was discussed in the House on previous occasions, particularly during the debate on last year's Finance Bill.  My view has not changed radically since then.  Neither I nor the Labour Party has any difficulty in principle with the measure.</P>
      <P>Preparing for this type of debate is somewhat difficult because, after 130 days, it is nearly impossible to keep track of all the promises made by the two Government parties prior to the last general election.  Deputy Brady, my colleague from Dublin North-East, and I have had many telephone calls today from workers in TEAM Aer Lingus reminding us that they have a document signed by the Leader of Fianna Fáil pledging support for the letters of comfort given to the majority of the workforce by Deputy Brennan.  I hope the commitments given to the workforce will be honoured, but as the weeks pass many of the promises made by the Government prior to its election are being broken.  On the Adjournment I must again discuss the issue of Sunday trading because the Fianna Fáil Party has reneged on a commitment by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to retail workers before the general election.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to pin down where the Government parties stand on their famous pre-election promises because so many of them have been broken.  The latest breach can be seen in the Estimates. Today's announcement by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is the most significant U-turn by the Government.  For two years prior to the election Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats cried &ldquo;foul&rdquo; at the level of public spending by the previous Government.  There were rumours for many years that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, would jump ship and join the Progressive Democrats and it seemed he would fulfil that projection.  Egged on by supporters in the media, spokespersons on behalf of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats accused Deputy Quinn of squandering a unique opportunity in economic history.  However, today's figures give the lie to that accusation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economy bequeathed to the Minister by the previous Government is so healthy that, despite the front loading of considerable amounts of Government expenditure, the Government will still be able to considerably reduce personal taxation, which most parties support, while balancing <Col N="1102" /> the national accounts.  There is much to be welcomed in the Estimates, particularly the increases for technological education, health and other areas.  However, they are not the Estimates promised by these parties before the election and in the programme for Government.  A few weeks before the announcement of the budget, the current spending limit has been breached and will increase to at least 7 per cent.  The increase in the capital spending target, the need for which has been recognised for a long time by everybody except those who framed the Fianna Fáil manifesto, has been exceeded by up to 300 per cent. What happened in the intervening period?</P>
    <P>It is extremely frustrating for Members such as myself and the Minister who have accountancy or economics training to read the mis-Estimates by the Department of Finance every year.  A previous leader of Fianna Fáil from Dublin who dominated the party for a long time was accused of cooking the books in the early 1980s.  Every year there are massive overruns in taxation.  Why bother preparing a budget if the projections will be wrong?  They are wrong because economic projections are consistently reactionary and direly conservative and these are, unfortunately, the hallmarks of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I support the motion and commend the Fine Gael Party on proposing it.  Many of the bodies in the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group have played a distinguished role in our communities. Many of them are well known and include the Central Remedial Clinic, Concern, the Irish Cancer Society, Irish UNICEF, Rehab, Cerebral Palsy Ireland, the Simon Community, St. Michael's House, the ISPCC and Victim Support. These outstanding organisations will not be amused to hear the Minister refer them to the tiny budgets for voluntary and community affairs under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs or to the hope of raising additional funding from the national lottery.</P>
    <P>Many of these organisations have suffered significantly as a result of the popularity of the national lottery.  No Deputy representing the northside of Dublin can be unaware that St. Michael's House needs a vastly increased budget to help senior citizens who have adult children with learning disabilities.  Deputies have had numerous cases brought to their attention of people desperately seeking a place in St. Michael's House for a young man or woman with such disabilities.  The Fianna Fáil Party, despite its many periods in Government, has not dealt with this issue.  In the health service there is also the scandal of St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane which was highlighted by Mr. Vincent Browne on radio recently.  That hospital demands massive resources.</P>
    <P>An outstanding case can be made for massive increases in resources for many of the organisations within the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.  There is a projected increase of 9 per cent in the Estimates for the Eastern Health Board budget.  That health board has been the Cinderella <Col N="1103" /> of the health boards and has often received a lower proportion <i>per capita</i> of the resources available than other health boards.  It is clear from the Estimates that many charitable organisations will not get sufficient support from the State.  What can they do?  Their only option is to fund raise. They were doing that reasonably successfully for a long time but since the establishment of the national lottery they have found it extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>I participated in fund raising activities for people with learning disabilities as I am familiar with the problem.  Fund raising is difficult.  It is difficult to hold a flag day, race night, dance or other fund raising events.  We must commend and salute our fellow citizens who are involved in the charitable bodies referred to in the motion on their outstanding work for our community.  We should come to their aid.  This country is the celtic tiger which has growth rates of between 7 per cent and 10 per cent.  The economy is doubling in size every decade or so and we are enjoying the rates of growth which were enjoyed by east Asian states until recently.  Why can we not take this small step on behalf of the men and women who have freely donated so much of their time and effort to raise funds for these valiant causes?  The figures outlined by Fitzpatrick and Associates are accurate and involve a small tax relief.  I ask the Minister to look at this proposal again and think seriously about it.  It is a small cost for a wealthy country.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, liked to envisage this country in 2010 as being one of the wealthiest countries in Europe. He saw it as a country which would be socially cohesive and in which all members of the community would support each other, where there would not be huge gaps in income, where everybody would have a decent home, where there would be an outstanding health service for all and which would continue to have an outstanding education service.  Deputy Quinn's dream is valid and we should work towards it.  However, it must be an inclusive dream.  If this Government wishes to establish us on the path towards that dream for 2012, which will be the centenary of the Labour Party, I implore the Minister to accept the motion and include it in the preparations for the 1998 budget to be announced next month.</P>
    <P>One cannot exaggerate the impact of the success of the national lottery on fund raising by smaller charities.  That is one of the most cogent arguments in favour of this motion.  We have seen the huge popularity of the national lottery in the past ten years.  Its card games and bi-weekly draws are immensely popular and there is great excitement on nights of draws for huge prizes.  If one is fund raising outside a newsagent's shop or seeking donations in a public house when there is a massive prize fund in the lottery draw, one has little chance of success.</P>
    <P>The major party in Government, Fianna Fáil, has had a chequered record in its disbursement <Col N="1104" /> of lottery funds.  All the major golf clubs throughout the country were festooned with money by Fianna Fáil Ministers.  I recall a few years ago a Fianna Fail Minister who proposed national lottery funding for a yacht club in Kilkenny.  There were many other similar proposals.  Five or six years ago a Fianna Fáil Minister submitted a note for a £40,000 grant on the back of a cigarette box which was later examined by the Committee of Public Accounts.  Thankfully applications are no longer submitted on the back of cigarette boxes. There have been extraordinary anomalies in the manner in which funds were disbursed by the national lottery while it has restricted the operation of smaller charities.  There has been a double whammy.  There have been bitter complaints in the city &mdash; I am sure there have been similar complaints in the Minister's city &mdash; from areas such as Coolock and Ballyfermot where a huge proportion of people support the national lottery and receive only a pittance in return from the Department of Education and Science or the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  That is a major problem.</P>
    <P>A recent study revealed that in 1996 our predecessors intended that national lottery funds should be additional spending and not a substitute for Exchequer spending.  In the health and education budgets lottery funds became a substitute for Exchequer funds.</P>
    <P>In the lead in this week and next week to the budget civil servants will be looking at the concessions offered in the budget.  This evening the Minister referred to concessions in the arts area. Most Members would commend a former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey, on his initiative in this regard.  Clearly the strides made in the film industry, the music business and so many other art areas, such as writing where we have had a great tradition in two languages, can be attributed to the former Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance. He took a risk but one which has paid off over the years.  This was a huge concession to the artistic community.  I do not know what it could be costed at now.  Frequently in the rock music area and so on artists move in and take advantage of our tax concessions.  This evening we are seeking a small concession of £3.3 million from the Government but we are greeted by the stony face of Fianna Fáil Ministers.  We can also look to many other areas, including that of corporation tax.  For various reasons we believed it should be reduced significantly over the years.  There have been arguments about the 12.5 per cent or the 10 per cent rate.  Here we have made major concessions for jobs and enterprise.  An issue which affects the Minister's constituency is the horse breeding industry.  As I understand it, if one is in the breeding business, one is entitled to certain major tax free concessions across one's whole agricultural business if one keeps a few mares and stallions.</P>
    <P>Remarkable concessions have been made in different areas in the past but why are we not prepared to salute the smaller charities on their <Col N="1105" /> outstanding work for the community?  St. Michael's House, on the northside is one example.  It needs massive resources and given that it is difficult to fundraise the Government should come to its aid rather than present a stony faced refusal.</P>
    <P>Since the Government came into office, my colleagues and I have been looking for the commitments made by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties to the Irish tax reform group. We checked it earlier today on the Fianna Fáil website but conveniently its election website has been deleted.  We are not clear what category of promise was made to the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group or whether the expression of support dates back to last year's Finance Bill. However, we came across a commitment from Fianna Fáil to remove the cap on prizes for charity organised lotteries.  That is another commitment on which I have heard nothing since Fianna Fáil assumed office.</P>

      <P>I have examined the proposals forwarded by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group to every Member.  As outlined by Deputy Noonan they appear to be eminently reasonable. The difficulty, as I understand it, relates to how we regulate charities here.  That is probably the difficulty that was experienced in the past couple of years.  While Deputy Noonan referred to charities which are accorded charitable status by the Revenue Commissioners, my understanding is the rules under which the Revenue Commissioners operate are governed by a British court case dating back to the 19th century referred to earlier by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Recent years have seen a proliferation in the growth of charities.  For both charities and the public it is crucial to establish a register of legitimate charities.  I have heard people articulate some fears that if we do not tie down sufficiently a usable definition we could find ourselves in a situation where companies effectively give donations to charities acting as fronts for themselves. That was part of the problem we had to deal with.  Under the previous Government, an advisory group on charitable funding was established by the Department of Justice whose mandate was to revisit the Costello report on charitable status.  It reported about this time last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> The matter was also examined by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  I do not know whether it is considered rude to remind the Government of a committee system which operated under the 27th Dáil.  I understand also but I am not sure why Deputy Noonan did not mention that the heads of a Bill were circulated.  Where is the Bill?  There are two ways of looking at it.  As Deputy Rabbitte pointed out on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; earlier this week, the Government appears to be allergic to legislation.  While I appreciate the significance of the EU's drug monitoring service, the truth is it has been allowed a two-day debate simply because the Government has no legislation to bring before the House.  However, on the other side of the coin, the only legislation the Government appears to be interested in bringing forward is legislation developed by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>The onus is on the Government to bring forward appropriate legislation as soon as possible. The matter has been kicked around in Government for too long, it requires decisive action. During the course of this debate Deputies Noonan and Deenihan paid tribute to the work done by the charities.  Those of us who represent constituencies of unemployment blackspots and rampant poverty know only too well that without the effort of these groups and individuals many people would be considerably worse off.  I agree with Deputy Noonan who said charities will always be with us and that the work done by many of them is crucial.  However, I believe it to be a legitimate aim of the Labour Party to aspire to a situation where charities may no longer be necessary.  The onus is on the Government to bring forward comprehensive legislation on charities to modernise the present confused position.</P>

      <P>For the fourth year in succession we are faced with the prospect of industrial action by retail workers in Dunnes Stores in the run-up to Christmas.  SIPTU, the MPGWU and MANDATE have no alternative but to bring the problem to our attention as in the past four months the Government has done nothing to deliver on its promises.  Prior to the general election at a meeting in Wynn's Hotel attended by a number of Labour Party Deputies, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who was absent last week when the matter was raised by me and a number of other Deputies, made a pledge to introduce <Col N="1107" /> legislation to regulate Sunday trading.  He referred to the Protection of Workers (Shops) Bill, 1996, which he introduced on 26 November 1996.  It is comprehensive legislation and includes a definition of Sunday work and provisions relating to the prohibition of discrimination, notification of contracts of employment and the appointment of a rights commissioner.  It also lists various entitlements and penalties.  Its stated objective is to provide protection for those employed in shops which trade on Sundays and where Sunday work is optional as opposed to obligatory.  What has the Minister of State done? He has done U-turns and abandoned retail workers in a disgraceful way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this issue last week in the Minister of State's absence because during the general election campaign I met many concerned workers.  In carrying out research I discovered the Bill introduced by the Minister of State and was impressed by it.  I am perplexed as to why it has not been reintroduced.  As the Minister of State is well aware, shop workers are in a weak position. What they are looking for is an opt-out clause, a matter dealt with in the Bill which was introduced by the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>There are wider issues that need to be addressed.  The role of the family is crucial.  In recent months the drugs problem among others has been discussed in the House.  If mothers have to leave their families to work on Sundays we only add to the problems.  Sporting bodies increasingly find that many of their members have to work on Sundays.  Ireland is one of only two countries in Europe which have not introduced regulations to control Sunday trading. There is something wrong when large multiples can trade 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State is trying to reach consensus between traders and workers but for the fourth year in succession there is a confrontation between one of the large multiples and its workforce.  The multiple in question is refusing to honour the Labour Court's recommendation. It is akin to David and Goliath.  The Minister of State whose heart is in the right place has a duty to intervene to protect the workers who are low paid.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem of casualisation.  The Minister for Finance informed us in recent weeks that the potential pensions bill is enormous.  Due to casualisation many workers will depend on social welfare pensions.  More than 50 per cent of retail workers are employed on a casual or part-time basis.  This is not good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a related issue, many small shops in towns and villages are seriously affected by Sunday trading.  I ask the Minister of State whose sincerity I acknowledge, to act by introducing legislation. <Col N="1108" /> If a referendum is necessary this should be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Broughan referred to commitments made by me and my party prior to the general election on this issue which was raised last week in my absence when the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, stood in for me.  I understand the Deputy also received a written reply.</P>
      <P>Prior to the general election all parties were asked by MANDATE to outline their positions on the question of a referendum.  My party stated that if re-elected to Government it would undertake a consultative process with all interested parties &mdash; owners, managers of retail outlets, both large and small, unions and consumers &mdash; with a view to regulating Sunday trading hours through consensus and agreement.</P>
      <P>There are two issues I will address.  I am not aware the retail trade generally is threatened by the prospect of industrial action prior to Christmas as alleged by the Deputy.  As reported today, there is a disagreement between Dunnes Stores and its employees and their trade unions regarding the implementation of a Labour Court recommendation on the issue of the appropriate rate of pay for employees working on Sundays in the run-up to Christmas.  The Labour Court's recommendation, dated 22 August 1997, was that Dunnes Stores pay double time to all employees recruited on or after October 1994 who work &ldquo;Christmas Sundays&rdquo; and double time and time off for time worked, in the form of additional leave, for employees recruited prior to October 1994.  The Labour Court also recommended that the four Sundays prior to Christmas be regarded as &ldquo;Christmas Sundays&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I understand Dunnes Stores advised the unions it could not accept the terms of the Labour Court's recommendation.  Regrettably further direct negotiations between the company and the unions have failed to resolve the issue.  The unions have decided to ballot their members, commencing next Monday, on the issue of industrial action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In these circumstances the Deputy's call for the introduction of legislation to control Sunday trading is misplaced and does not address the issue in this dispute.  The issue concerns the rate of pay for Sunday working in the run-up to Christmas, not whether these shops should open on Sundays.  What is at issue is not a threatened crisis in the retail trade but a more limited and straightforward dispute in one company as regards the appropriate rate of pay for Sunday work in the weeks immediately preceding Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised at the Deputy's great interest in the matter of Sunday trading-Sunday working <Col N="1109" /> given that he said little on the matter on Committee Stage of the Organisation of Working Time Bill at the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy earlier this year.  The Deputy's then colleague, Eithne Fitzgerald, who was responsible for the promotion of the Bill through the Oireachtas, indicated to the House how it addressed the issue of Sunday working &mdash; by providing that all those who work on a Sunday should have a statutory entitlement to a Sunday premium.  The Bill set down criteria for the calculation of such a premium.  These criteria will come into operation when this aspect of the Bill, now enacted, comes into effect early next year.</P>
    <P>When the issue of Sunday trading arose at that time some Deputies called for the introduction of legislation to prevent large stores and supermarkets trading on Sundays.  Eithne Fitzgerald indicated that the legal advice available to her was that any attempt in legislation to distinguish between shops for the purpose of controlling Sunday trading on the basis of type or size would be vulnerable to constitutional challenge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore Sunday trading could not be banned on the basis of square footage or different rules for large and small shops.  I understood the Deputy agreed with the line taken by his colleague.</P>
      <P>I come now to the issue raised by both Deputies and thank Deputy Stanton for his remarks.  While in Opposition I introduced a Private Members' Bill which attempted to allow for voluntary Sunday working.  While that Bill was accepted on Second Stage by the then Government, it was overtaken by the Organisation of Working Time Bill and eventually lapsed with the calling of the last general election. However, mindful of what I had been attempting to achieve through my Bill, immediately on taking office I made arrangements to meet representatives of IBEC and ICTU to review the position on Sunday working in the retail sector.  Resulting from this dialogue I invited both parties to open discussions with a view to exploring the possibility of an agreement addressing the issue between employer and employee representatives of the main players in the sector.  I have offered to assist in this process in any way I can.  It is my firm belief that the partnership approach is the cornerstone of any initiative in this area holding out the possibility of a successful conclusion.  The social partners are at present considering my proposal and I hope progress will be possible in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputies Stanton and Broughan that I am anxious to advance this issue.  I agree with them that workers' rights are at stake.  I also agree with Deputy Stanton who raised the overall matter of the smaller shops and their position.</P>

      <P>In the current Dunnes Stores dispute, it is my view that the type of intervention suggested by the Deputy would be entirely inappropriate. While I am disappointed that the parties were unable to utilise the recommendation of the Labour Court to resolve their dispute, the services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court remain available to them.  There is ample time for the parties to resume negotiations before the commencement of any threatened industrial action.  I urge them to resume negotiations and avoid a damaging dispute which would not be in the interests of the company, its workforce or its customers.</P>

      <P>Access to higher education should be available in a fair and equitable manner to all third level students, whether in urban or rural areas.

Subsequently, the 15-mile rule was introduced, which removed the discretion previously available to local authorities to assess local factors such as the availability of public service transport in determining the level of grant aid applicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regrettably an incorrect decision was taken in 1995 that students living in many villages not readily accessible to colleges and universities would henceforth receive reduced grant aid.  One such example is my village of Ballymore in County Westmeath.  I am aware of a female student, whose home is located a fraction of a <Col N="1111" /> mile within the 15-mile limit from the regional technical college in Athlone.  Her grant aid amounts to approximately £15 per week throughout the college term instead of the £40 per week she would receive if her home were located one mile further east.</P>
    <P>Flats in Athlone cost approximately £28 per week, leaving an unbridgeable financial deficit in the case of this female student and her family. This means she is faced with either abandoning her course at the regional technical college or hitching the 14-mile journey twice daily to and from Athlone.  Would the Minister allow his 18 year old daughter to hitch a lift to college daily in this manner?  Certainly I would not want any daughter of mine to do so.  Is this the type of choice that should be foisted on 18 year old students? There has been a huge number of attacks on hitchhikers and this young girl is in the precarious position of having to commute daily to college.  It is totally unacceptable to expect her and other young people to undertake such hazardous journeys daily.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to review the position immediately, to allow commonsense prevail on an issue crucial to the future well-being of many young people.  I know he will take an interest in this case.  I hope his response will not be a rehash of his reply to a recent parliamentary question but will set out his clear commitment to amend this discriminatory rule.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McGrath for sharing his time with me.  When the higher education grants scheme was introduced in 1968, such grants were payable on the basis of adjacent or non-adjacent rates.  At that time and for some ten years thereafter no specific mileage criterion was applied.  The sole arbiter of whether a student qualified for an adjacent or non-adjacent rate of grant was the relevant local authority.  That criterion was changed in 1978, when the adjacent rate of grant was applied in the case of every candidate who could reasonably be expected to travel daily between his or her home and college.</P>
      <P>The 15-mile criterion for determining which rate of grant should be payable was introduced in 1979 to facilitate a standardised approach by local authorities in determining which rate should be paid to an applicant student.  If a local authority determined that an applicant could be reasonably expected to travel daily to his or her college, the adjacent rate was payable implying the availability of a public transport system.  The availability of a regular public transport service was implicitly recognised within the provisions of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the same force of argument applies to persons who live in isolated rural areas, within the 15-mile criterion, where there is a clear absence of a public transport scheme.  Students in that position will be obliged to reside in the town or place where their college is located and, in such circumstances, should be eligible for the <Col N="1112" /> non-adjacent rate.  A change was introduced in 1995 which stipulated that, once a student resided in excess of 15 miles from his or her college, the non-adjacent rate was paid automatically.</P>
    <P>I concur with Deputy McGrath that it is ridiculous that a student in a rural area such as Ballymore, some 13.5 miles from the regional technical college in Athlone, who has no public means of transport and whose parents do not have a vehicle to bring her there, is deprived of the non-adjacent rate, despite the fact that she clearly must live in Athlone.  The same applies to students living in Drumraney, Tang and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a practical person.  I would remind him that his Department is saving peanuts but that these criteria are causing major financial headaches for those unfortunate students caught in the trap.  It involves an almost 60 per cent reduction in grants to students, many of whose families are in receipt of social welfare assistance.</P>
    <P>I exhort the Minister to see sense and give these parents and students an even break.  Let us distribute a small proportion of the spoils of our buoyant economy among them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992 provide for the award of grants by local authorities to students pursuing third level studies under terms and conditions that may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister for Education and Science with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Under the student support schemes, maintenance grants are payable at either adjacent or non-adjacent rates.  The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grant-holder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college he or she is attending.  The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.</P>
      <P>When the higher education grants scheme was introduced originally in 1968 provision was made for the payment of maintenance grants at the adjacent and non-adjacent rates.  The adjacent rate of maintenance was paid to a grant-holder whose normal family residence was adjacent to the college being attended.  In all other cases the non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant was payable. No specific mileage criterion was applied and the decision on whether grants would be paid at the adjacent or non-adjacent rate was a matter solely for decision by the relevant local authorities.</P>
      <P>In 1978 a new provision was introduced which required a local authority to decide, first, whether a grant-holder's normal family residence was in or adjacent to a university town or, second, whether the grant-holder's course was provided in an educational institution adjacent to his or her normal family residence, in the light of the distance and local public transport services.  The adjacent rate of grant was applied in the case of every grant-holder who could reasonably be expected to travel daily between his or her home and college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> The 15-mile criterion for determining which rate of grant was payable was introduced in 1979 to standardise the approach taken by local authorities. This followed an examination by the Committee of Public Accounts of the manner in which some local authorities were administering the adjacency provision.  In addition to the 15-mile criterion, a local authority also had regard to whether the grant-holder could reasonably be expected to travel to college daily where his or her family residence was located more than 15 miles away.  If the local authority determined that the grant-holder could reasonably travel, the adjacent rate of grant only was payable.  Apparently differences of interpretation had led to difficulties.</P>
    <P>In any such grants scheme terms and conditions have, of necessity, to be introduced and I appreciate that in some cases students may experience difficulties in the implementation of this adjacency requirement.  In the 1995-6 academic year, 72 per cent of all grant-holders were paid grants at the non-adjacent rate, and 28 per cent were paid grants at the adjacent rate.  In general, it is accepted that the 15-mile adjacency condition is applied fairly and reasonably.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to examine cases, such as outlined this evening.  I will agree to review the situation without any commitments at this stage and in the context of clearly definable scheduled public transport being available.  We have to combine the issue of balance with some degree of standardisation around the country in different local authority areas.  I would be concerned about a disadvantaged student, who did not have access to public transport and neither she nor her parents had transport of their own, being denied a grant.  If the Deputy can give me the individual cases which have caused this matter to be raised, I will see if we can be of some assistance to the students concerned.</P>

      <P>I recently announced that arrangements have been made to examine the question of rationalising the various student support schemes with a view to having them administered by a single agency.  A joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has begun an examination of various options and the possible role of both Departments in any new system.  When I have the report I will give it full consideration with a view to having any recommendations for improved and more efficient and effective administrative arrangements implemented as soon as possible.  I intend to continue to seek ways of improving support for students attending third level institutions, and I will consider a range of options to achieve this objective.  That said, the Deputy will accept that changes inevitably have financial implications and will have to be dealt with in the context of the <Col N="1114" /> wider Estimates provisions for third level education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue and the Minister for being present to address it.  I raise this matter following replies to a number of written questions tabled to the Minister.  I discovered from those that 60 out of the 102 primary schools in County Meath exceed the pupil-teacher ratio by between 5 per cent and 40 per cent.  This is very unfair as it places teachers under severe hardship, the majority of whom wish to do their best for their pupils.  It is also unfair to the children in these classes.  The INTO's agreeing the parameters for the loss of teachers by 30 September in any given year has perhaps led to a huge increase in some of the percentages.  Where some schools would have been under or at the ratio before that date, they would have lost teachers after it, thus increasing their ratio.  With substantial funding now coming into Government coffers on a daily and weekly basis, we should push for decreasing the pupil-teacher ratio to the acceptable level of 22:1 in as many schools as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably inform me that many of the 40 other schools in the county have a considerably lower ratio.  However, I will cite the examples of a number of schools I know personally: Stackallen national school is five more than the ratio which is 30 per cent over; the Convent of Mercy in Kells is 4.5 more which is also 30 per cent over; Cannistown primary school in Navan is 5.6 more which is 35 per cent over; Drumconrath national school is 30 per cent over; Moynalty primary school is 25 per cent to 30 per cent over the agreed guidelines; Rathregan primary school is 40 per cent over; and Enfield national school is 40 per cent over.  I am sure it is the same in every county in the country.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider the seriousness of the problem and the need for funding to be made available to deal with the issue.  Can he inform us if he has plans to deal with this matter over the next one to three years by providing the necessary extra funding?  Having young children myself, I appreciate the importance of having small numbers in classes.  It gives the teacher and the students a better opportunity than is the case at the moment.  I know that a system, implemented by previous Ministers and Governments, pays special attention to certain disadvantaged areas by providing additional teachers and resources.  I want fairness for everyone &mdash; teachers and children.  All children should be treated equally and I would appreciate if the Minister could inform us if he can examine this and provide sufficient funds over a period of one to three years to bring these figures in line with Government guidelines of 22:1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  In the terminology of the Adjournment it <Col N="1115" /> is referred to as Government guidelines but the pupil-teacher ratio as calculated is not really a Government guideline.  It is the number of pupils divided by the number of teachers nationally.  The ratio of 22:1 at which we now are does not mean that every school has that ratio.  The demographic shift in the country has had a significant impact in the areas which have experienced massive urban growth and classes at higher levels, a different situation prevails in rural Ireland with reductions in enrolments and teacher numbers.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to address the matter.  Staffing arrangements for primary schools are determined on a national level rather than on a county by county basis.  We look at the national picture.  In March 1997 the then Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the current school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation in the context of the demographic dividend which was being redistributed. These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of all surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend. Accordingly, I do not have resources at this time to allocate additional teachers today or tomorrow to primary schools, although I will be dealing with staffing schedules for the 1998-9 school year and would like to be then in a position to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to An Action Programme for the Millennium.  This document contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  Since there are no teaching posts available to me at present for allocation to schools, I am currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments in this regard.  The staffing arrangements for 1998-9 will be the subject of discussion with the partners in education and it will be early in the new year when we will be in a position to outline the staffing schedules for the next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also point out to the Deputy that the pupil-teacher ratio is not a measure of class size <i>per se</i>.  Rather, it is the ratio of the total primary teaching population relative to the total primary school population. Accordingly, it serves the very useful function of indicating the relationship at national level between teacher numbers and pupil numbers.  A pupil-teacher ratio of 22:1, as prevailed during the 1996-7 school year, does not imply that every single school enjoys this ratio.  It is widely accepted that many schools have a higher ratio in the same way as there are schools which enjoy a lower ratio.  The Deputy will also be aware there are guidelines on maximum class size which are designed to ensure that schools do not have excessively large class sizes.  Schools are required to organise classes in compliance with these guidelines.  Where schools are unable to ensure that all classes are within the recommended <Col N="1116" /> guidelines, it is open to the managerial authorities to contact my Department on the matter.</P>
    <P>Maximum class size guidelines in the current year are as follows: 35 in the case of a single grade class group; 34 in the case of a class group with two consecutive grades; 31 in the case of a multigrade class group; 29 for all classes in schools which are designated or disadvantaged.  The maximum class size guideline for one teacher schools with more than four standards is 28.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious the Minister has had difficulties with a recent industrial dispute which, thankfully, is resolved.  It is worth reflecting on what has happened in part-time courses in the past few months in a more serious way than breathing a sigh of relief over an industrial dispute which is over.  There has been chaos in the past few weeks.  Courses have been abandoned without notice to students.  The worst example was in Tallaght where courses in information technology and computing were abandoned and students had to go elsewhere.  This occurred at a time when the Minister and the Government had invested £80 million in the longer term development of IT resources in education. On the one hand the Minister and the Government are willing to invest this money while, on the other, courses are closing.  This indicates serious defects in policy-making within the Department which cannot overcome them in a coherent manner.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department have stated that we are in an era of lifelong learning in which people cannot expect their earlier educational qualifications to suffice for the rest of their lives. This means that we must be more open to facilitating part-time courses.  The root cause of the recent difficulties goes back to the Department's approach to the funding of part-time courses.  Perhaps the Minister will assure us things will change radically but my understanding is that colleges are expected to run part-time courses on a shoestring. This was confirmed by a recent report on the regional technical college sector by the HEA. The Department does not assign any core staff to part-time course development and delivery in the regional technical colleges.  It expects these courses to be developed and delivered by people snatching an hour here and there from other activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate offered by colleges for part-time teachers is £25 per hour.  This is in sharp contrast to the equivalent rate for a core staff member which is more than £60 per hour.  With the colleges starved of resources by official funding mechanisms we have seen them resort to unacceptable practices, namely, taking on parttimers but confining them to seven hours per week to avoid contractual commitments.  We are trying to develop something on the basis of casualisation which will be an increasingly core aspect of the education system.  There is concern <Col N="1117" /> among trade unions and the public that the flexible provision of education, which can be made available through part-time courses, has not been taken on board by the Department.</P>
    <P>This report confirms the Department's approach to funding the regional technical college sector is inferior to that of the university sector. It is ironic that the university sector has one part-time course place to every five full-time places whereas the regional technical college sector has one for every two full-time places. regional technical colleges are making a greater effort to develop options yet they are penalised by a less sympathetic system.  This needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Part-time education and the development of flexible course options has always been overlooked in the education system.  This report talks about the need for full-time places.  All of the projections of the Higher Education Authority and the colleges concern the number of full-time places we will need in the years 2000, 2005 and 2010.  The reality is that we need to be more flexible than just thinking about full-time courses. Information technology is making distance learning possible.  If we wish to utilise the expensive assets the Minister is putting in place in the colleges we should use them to the maximum efficiency.  In the process we should facilitate the consumers of education.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously rethink this policy. We need better funding mechanisms, more modulisation so that courses can be taken on a part-time basis and built up over time with credits, easier movement between colleges on the basis of what has been achieved on credits and more financial support for part-time students. The Minister has committed himself to the last measure.</P>
    <P>These steps are demanded as a proper response to the challenge of lifelong learning, the utilisation of assets and equity.  The report makes clear that a high proportion of those who participate in part-time courses come from groups which traditionally do not do well in full-time education; the children of semi-skilled and intermediate skilled workers.  This is a vehicle for fairness in education as well as meeting our future needs and using our assets wisely.  The Minister should look at the deeper causes behind the problems in this sector and the industrial dispute which could resurface if this is not addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I would make the point that the Tallaght problem was brought to the <Col N="1118" /> Department's attention very late in the day.  My Department was in the position to respond quickly and comprehensively to resolve that matter for the particular college.  It was unfair that the Department and its officials were blamed for something with which they had nothing to do. When the issue arose it was dealt with effectively.</P>
      <P>I accept everything the Deputy said in relation to the value of part-time courses at third level.  It is extremely important that we continue to upskill people who are in employment and that they have the opportunity and access to courses at all levels.  I agree with the Deputy that the technological sector has been starved of funding but that is not my fault.  I inherited that problem.  The file on third level education and on the technological sector that was on my desk in July had the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; written all over it in terms of the physical accommodation needs of many regional technical colleges, including Tallaght and others.  We worked over recent months to improve the situation. I agree that we must show a determination to meet the needs of a rapidly growing knowledge based economy.</P>
      <P>In recognition of this, one of our first acts upon returning to Government in July was to make an additional £5 million capital investment, in tandem with current investment, in the creation of additional places this autumn in software courses at degree and technician level.  When announcing that initiative, I stressed that we recognised the need for further action and that a comprehensive and co-ordinated plan was required to meet the full range of emerging skills needs.</P>
      <P>Over the past four months, my Department and I have held a series of meetings with leaders in education and industry to listen to their concerns and invite their suggestions.  The Education Technology Investment Fund, which we announced last week, is the product of this process of consultation.</P>
      <P>There are three key objectives which underpin the investment fund.  First, we want to renew and modernise the infrastructure of third level institutions, particularly in the technological sector, and guarantee that they will continue to produce high quality graduates.  Second, we want to develop new areas of activities in our institutions, especially where emerging skills needs have already been identified.  Finally, we want to invest in promoting the innovation which will be so crucial to maintaining and expanding our recent growth.</P>
      <P>The investment fund will comprise £250 million to be allocated to capital programmes.  An initial £100 million will be paid into the fund in 1998 and the balance of £150 million will be paid in the following two years.  This funding will be in addition to annual capital allocations and will not replace ongoing investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the seven broad areas to which funding will be allocated, five relate to third level education. A total of £60 million will be allocated to the creation of additional places at both technician and degree level in computer software; £20 million <Col N="1119" /> will be allocated to the accommodation and equipment needs of the hotel and tourism sector; £30 million will be allocated towards a major equipment renewal programme; £15 million will be allocated towards the capital needs of promoting research and development and technology transfer; and £8O million will be allocated to develop and renew the infrastructure of the institutions in the technological sector.  This investment represents the largest ever capital investment in the sector.  The fund represents the largest ever investment in technological education since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the fund initiative represents the Government's commitment to addressing the needs of our education system, particularly the technological sector.  It clearly establishes a medium-term framework for financing the development of scientific and technological education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Specifically on the staffing issue, I wish to inform the House that officials from my Department and management from the technological <Col N="1120" /> sector have been involved in intensive ongoing discussions with the Teachers' Union of Ireland in the context of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.  The question of part-time working in the sector is being examined as part of these discussions.  As a result of recent progress at these discussions, I am happy to inform the House that the Teachers' Union of Ireland has informed its members that, as a gesture of goodwill, the recently imposed overtime ban in the technological sector has been lifted with effect from last Monday.  I am confident that, as a result of this development, part-time programmes in the sector will now be able to resume without further disruption.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Deputy may wish to know that only this evening I held discussions concerning the development of part-time programmes with one of the major providers of these programmes. I am committed to supporting the continued role and expansion of this important part of our education system.</P>

In particular I relayed to Mr. Cook Ireland's general approach in regard to the Agenda 2000 issues and he briefed me on the UK position on EMU in the light of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's recent statement on the subject to the House of Commons.</P>
      <P>Overall, I believe that our meeting and indeed Mr. Cook's visit in general have improved mutual understanding of our two countries respective positions on EU issues and have helped lay the foundation for a fruitful co-operation during next year's UK Presidency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 22, 26 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>In relation to the County Louth residents' independent High Court action against BNFL, the general terms of the Government's decision in relation to funding was communicated by letter to the residents on 22 October last.  I had a further meeting last week with the residents to discuss the nature and terms of the Government's financial assistance and other relevant issues.  We will continue our discussions on the matter later this week.  By mutual agreement with the residents, I do not believe it helpful to comment further on the details of the discussions at this stage.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recent decision of the British Government to phase out the dumping of lowlevel radioactive waste into the marine environment. While I welcomed this decision, I would have preferred that discharges from nuclear installations such as Sellafield and THORP would also have been covered by the phase out plans.</P>
      <P>Radioactive contamination of the Irish marine environment continues to occur as a consequence of the activities of these installations.  I, of course, consider that all radioactive discharges should be progressively reduced and ultimately eliminated at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>There is some evidence that Mr. Michael Meacher, MP, the UK Minister responsible for environmental policy relating to marine discharges from Sellafield, is conscious of the need to make progress on reducing nuclear discharges. He has recently acknowledged the need to commit all Governments to this aim although he qualified this commitment by stating that there was a need for any agreement &ldquo;to be tempered by what is practicable and to be consistent with the provisions of the existing agreements in this area&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to BNFL's application to the UK authorities for a variation of Sellafield's discharge authorisations, my Department has already put <Col N="1124" /> on record its preliminary concerns.  My Department has also reserved the right to make further detailed comments on the application when the UK environment agency issues its draft authorisation for public consultation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will be meeting the UK Minister for the Environment later this week to clarify his approach and to press for a complete elimination of all radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>EU Directive 97/33/EC, which deals, among other things, with interconnection of telecommunications networks, requires member states to put in place before 31 December 1997 measures to ensure facility and property sharing by organisations providing telecommunications networks and publicly available telecommunications services. Regulations to implement the directive in Ireland will be signed before that date.</P>
      <P>The directive provides that arrangements for co-location or facility sharing shall normally be a matter for commercial and technical agreement. It requires however that national regulatory authorities, that is, the Director of Telecommunications Regulation in Ireland, must have powers to intervene to resolve disputes.  Facility or property sharing arrangements may only be imposed after an appropriate period of public consultation during which all interested parties must be given an opportunity to express their views.</P>
      <P>These requirements will be reflected in the regulations to implement the directive.</P>
      <P>I fully support the principle of sharing of masts and other telecommunications infrastructure on the basis of commercial agreements in order to promote economic efficiency and minimise the adverse environmental impact of telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation in Ireland of the interconnection directive will require operators such as <Col N="1125" /> Esat Digifone and Eircell to share facilities owned by them.  I am also considering the question of bringing proposals to Government for a Bill dealing with this and related regulatory issues in the telecommunications sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to the investment proposals referred to by Deputy Bruton, I presume he is referring to the proposal by Eircell to use Garda masts and to upgrade the masts where necessary to accommodate up to four operators.  This matter has not yet been considered by the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will determine if and when proposals will be brought to Government in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Transport Acts, the question of assessing and meeting demand for public transport services by bus in the Dublin area is a matter for Bus Átha Cliath.  In responding to the requirements of the travelling public, the company must apply the overall resources available to it as cost effectively as possible, having regard to the wide range of demands made on its resources.</P>
      <P>One of the resources available to the company is the annual Exchequer subvention in respect of the socially necessary services provided by the CIÉ group which cannot be operated on a fully commercial basis.  The allocation of the subvention to the individual companies is entirely a matter for the CIÉ board, and I am advised that the following amounts were allocated to Bus Átha Cliath in the past five years:</P>

    <P>These figures do not include Bus Átha Cliath's substantial receipts from the Department of <Col N="1126" /> Social Welfare during that period in respect of the operation of the free travel scheme.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been an increasing emphasis within Bus Átha Cliath, and within CIÉ generally, on the need for a more commercial and customer-focused approach to the business of meeting public transport needs.  Further development of this approach is the appropriate strategy for companies that wish to secure their position in the increasingly competitive environment which is emerging for the delivery of public transport services.  The system of public service contracts which I intend to introduce to replace the existing CIÉ Exchequer subvention will further facilitate the evolution of an operating culture more closely focused on performance and the achievement of quality service standards.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence available to me which suggests that fares are too high or that a reduction in fares, by itself, would significantly increase use of public transport services.  If additional subvention were available, which it is not, my first priority would not be fares reductions but new and improved public transport services.</P>
    <P>Public transport in Dublin is developing within the overall framework provided by the strategy recommended in the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative (DTI), which includes a series of quality bus corridors aimed at achieving improved standards of frequency, reliability and speed in areas of high demand.  Bus Átha Cliath is pursuing the implementation of the quality bus corridor programme in conjunction with the relevant local authorities and the Dublin Transportation Office (DTO).</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 48 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultants, WS Atkins International Limited, were appointed on 15 October 1997 to carry out an independent study to assess the option of putting the Dublin light rail system underground in the city centre.  The study is planned to take six <Col N="1127" /> months and I expect to receive their report by the end of April 1998.  In line with their terms of reference the consultants have already invited written inputs to their work from interested parties.</P>
    <P>As regards the project timetable, it is reasonable to assume that if the consultancy study concluded that an on-street light rail system was the preferred option and the application for a light railway order was approved on the basis proposed by CIÉ construction could be under way early in 1999 and would take about three years to finish.  On the basis of this timetable it could be possible to complete the project by end 2001. Under EU Structural Funds regulations expenditure incurred up to end 2000 is eligible for grant assistance.  The Commission has a discretion to allow an extension, normally for a further year. Such a decision would facilitate the full draw down of EU funds in respect of the project, based on an end 2001 completion date.</P>
    <P>If the consultancy study concluded that an underground section in the city centre was the preferred option, this would necessitate a redesign of CIÉ's current proposals and would defer completion of the project beyond 2001.  The mid-term review of the Community Support Framework provides that a review of the EU funding allocated for the light rail project will take place in spring 1998 and it is anticipated that this will coincide with the completion of the underground study.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission is being kept informed of all developments in relation to the light railway project.</P>

      <P>I am aware from monitoring programmes carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland of significant annual increases since 1994 in concentrations of technetium-99 in seaweed sampled along the north-east Irish coastline.  While the RPII monitoring programmes do not show doubling of this radionuclide in seaweed sampled along the Irish coastline in the first quarter of 1997, they do show that concentrations in Irish seaweeds have increased significantly as a result of increased discharges from Sellafield.</P>
      <P>The RPII points out that the concentrations found in seaweed are many times higher than those observed in fish.  technetium-99 has been measured by the RPII in a range of fish and shellfish samples taken between 1996 and 1997.  These measurements show that the dose to seafood consumers does not give rise to concern.  Such findings, however, do not in any way affect this Government's continued opposition to any radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea caused by Sellafield.  The annual dose to typical and heavy seafood consumers from technetium-99 for 1996 was estimated at 0.07 and 0.3 microsieverts respectively.  To put this into perspective, one can compare it with a dose of 3,000 microsieverts from all sources of radioactivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also mention that at a meeting in early September of the Oslo-Paris Commission on Pollution in the North East Atlantic, the question of radioactive contamination was discussed.  As a result of the discussion, and arising from a joint Irish-Danish sponsored resolution tabled at the meeting on radioactive discharges, particularly technetium-99, the UK authorities are to report <Col N="1129" /> to the Commission in 1998 on their compliance with the obligations of the OSPAR Convention.</P>
    <P>Finally, when I meet the UK Minister for the Environment later this week I will be drawing his attention to Irish concerns about discharges of technetium-99 into the Irish Sea.</P>

A further aim of those contacts was to ensure that they were aware of the seriousness of the matter both for the Irish haulage sector and Irish trade.</P>
      <P>Prior to the dispute on Friday, 31 October the Minister wrote to the Minister for Transport, Jean-Claude Gayssot.</P>
      <P>On Monday, 3 November the Taoiseach wrote to French Prime Minister Jospin expressing his concern about the impact of the strike on Irish exports to France and other European countries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy to which Irish goods would normally transit via road to France.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday the Minister wrote to the President of the Council of Ministers, Ms Mady Delvaux-Stehres who is Minister for Transport in Luxembourg and requested her to consider convening an extraordinary Council of Ministers in view of the situation.  The Minister also spoke to Minister Delvaux on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke to Commissioner Kinnock a number of times during the dispute and I travelled to Brussels on Thursday, 5 November to bring the Government's concerns over the situation to Commissioner Kinnock's attention.  On Wednesday evening the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Jospin had a long telephone conversation about the problem.  The Prime Minister <Col N="1130" /> outlined the steps taken by the French Government to get the sides together.  The Prime Minister also stressed that he was pressing for a lasting settlement this time.</P>
    <P>During the week I kept in close contact with the Irish Road Haulage Association, IBEC, the Irish Exporters' Association and the Irish Farmers Association.  I am glad to say that the dispute was settled before the worst impacts of the strike were felt here.</P>
    <P>The Irish Embassy in Paris also stayed in close contact with senior advisers to the French Transport Minister during the dispute.</P>
    <P>Up-to-date information on roadblocks was relayed to my Department every few hours during the week and this information was shared with the Irish Road Haulage Association.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to alternative routes is as follows:</P>
    <P>Roll on-roll off traffic could only reach Spain and Portugal via ferry from the English ports of Portsmouth and Plymouth.  Gaelic Ferries, which recently inaugurated a ferry service from Ringaskiddy, County Cork, to France, diverted that ferry to Spain during the week providing an alternative route.  The Pandoro service from Rosslare to Cherbourg diverted to Holland.</P>
    <P>The normal transit route to Italy for Irish road freight is via France.  An alternative route via Belgium, Germany and Austria was available throughout the week.</P>
    <P>The payment of compensation in relation to this dispute and the November 1996 strike is a matter for the French authorities.  In relation to Irish claims for compensation arising out of the November 1996 strike, I understand that the Irish Road Haulage Association has retained a firm of UK solicitors to prepare claims.  Great care has been taken to prepare all Irish claims with the best possible documentary proof and supporting evidence and the first of these were submitted recently.  While the French track record in relation to claims from United Kingdom hauliers and hauliers from other member states is extremely poor, I am confident that Irish claims will be dealt with quickly and positively.</P>
    <P>The Minister has written to the French Transport Minister expressing appreciation for the work of the French Government in bringing about a speedy settlement to the dispute and urging that Irish hauliers' claims for compensation for both this and last year's dispute should be satisfactorily settled without delay.  She has also asked the Luxembourg Transport Minister to include the compensation issue on the agenda of the December Transport Council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>TEAM Aer Lingus is in the third year of a five year business plan designed to restore the company to viability on a phased basis.  Though trading moderately well at present, the company's finances are delicately balanced and it continues to remain dependent on the Aer Lingus group for financial support.</P>
      <P>TEAM is competing in a global market in which there is substantial overcapacity.  This has led to increasingly competitive pressures on companies engaged in the international maintenance and overhaul industry, leading towards consolidation trends in the industry worldwide.</P>
      <P>It is an objective of the current TEAM Aer Lingus five year business plan that TEAM would secure an external partner to ensure the long-term viability of the company.</P>
      <P>While I am aware that TEAM Aer Lingus has been engaged in an exploratory process of identifying possible stretegic partners, no proposals have yet been made to me in that regard.  Any such proposal will be considered by me on its merits, having regard to the interests of all parties.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by Aer Lingus that trade unions representing staff in TEAM and members of the Workers' Participation Council were briefed by the Aer Lingus group chief executive at a meeting on 31 October 1997 on the background to the exploratory discussions which had taken place with possible interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> At that meeting, it was indicated that this was the start of a consultation process with staff and their representatives and that they would be kept fully briefed in relation to the discussions now taking place.</P>
    <P>A public competition or bidding mechanism is not required in the process of identifying a suitable partner for TEAM.  When any commercial State company is engaged in such a process it is necessary, of course, that all appropriate and relevant potential partners are contacted.</P>
    <P>My Department has been assured by Aer Lingus that it is fully aware of this requirement in the present instance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 33, 46, 126 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on a previous occasion, the Government is committed to the conclusion of an Employee Share Ownership Plan in Telecom Éireann in the spirit of social partnership and consensus.</P>
      <P>The Government is prepared to make available up to 5 per cent of the company's equity from the State's shareholding in return for the verified implementation of restructuring, specified cost reduction and change within the company.  The Government is also open to practical and feasible proposals by the employees in Telecom Éireann to bring their total shareholding in the company up to 14.9 per cent in return for cash payment to the Exchequer on transfer at a fair price when it is satisfied that this will assist the future development of the company and that the conditions relating to the initial shareholding of up to 5 per cent are satisfactory.  The sale of any shareholding beyond 5 per cent to the employees will require the consent of the strategic partners.</P>
      <P>I have been having discussions with representatives of KPN-Telia &mdash; the State's strategic partner in Telecom Éireann &mdash; the company and the unions with a view to determining a framework within which the negotiations on an employee shareholding scheme can be re-started.  In particular, I have recently met the unions for a full presentation from them and their financial advisers of their case in support of an employee share ownership plan (ESOP).</P>
      <P>My Department is in the process of briefing financial consultants to provide expert advice in relation to developing an acceptable ESOP in Telecom Éireann.  A valuation of the transformation plan negotiated between the management and unions in Telecom Éireann and a valuation of the company for the purpose of determining a fair price for the shares will be among the issues being addressed by the consultants.  They have also been in contact with the financial advisers to the unions and I expect these discussions to continue.</P>
      <P>I have not set down any specific deadlines for the conclusion of an employee share ownership plan (ESOP) for Telecom Éireann.  The negotiations among the parties must be allowed to take their course but obviously I am anxious to see an early agreement.</P>

      <P>I would like to again state that the Government is committed to the provision of the core light rail network recommended in the DTI report which includes a line from Tallaght via the city centre to Dundrum and Sandyford and a line from the city centre to Ballymun.</P>
      <P>The current position, with regard to the proposed Ballymun line, is that the CIE Light Rail Project Team has identified strategic options for the route between the city centre and Ballymun. Further work to provide additional information on these options is now being carried out.</P>
      <P>Clearly the outcome of the study examining the option of underground light rail in the city centre could have implications for such a route.  Consequently, the Light Rail Project Team's efforts are being concentrated to the north of the inner city pending completion of the underground study.</P>
      <P>The Project Team hopes to be in a position to initiate the public consultation process on the options for Ballymun in late spring next year when it will be able to take account of the conclusions of the underground study.  I do not intend to take any action now which might be seen to prejudge the outcome of the underground study.</P>

      <P>The oldest type of reactors in the UK are Magnox reactors and are located mainly on the west coast of Britain.  Of the 11 Magnox power stations throughout the UK three have now been closed.  Calder Hall, now nearly 40 years old, houses the four ageing Magnox reactors on the Sellafield site.  Originally built in 1956, these reactors have exceeded their expected design life by 20 years.  They are inferior to modern reactors and cannot be adapted fully to meet modern safety standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Securing the closure and early decommissioning of the UK's Magnox facilities will <Col N="1135" /> remain a priority for this Government.  It is my intention to raise this and other issues when I meet the UK Minister for the Environment later this week.</P>

      <P>My Department published a consultation paper in May this year which outlined proposals for the implementation of the EU Electricity Directive.  The purpose of this paper was to stimulate discussion on how best to introduce a competitive framework.</P>
      <P>A wide and varied number of responses was received from industry representatives, including the ESB, prospective independent generators and environmentalists.</P>
      <P>My Department is reviewing the proposals in the paper in the light of the responses received and is meeting with a range of interested parties.</P>
      <P>When this evaluation procedure is completed, I will be making a recommendation to the Government on the most appropriate structure.  I will announce the Government's decision in due course.</P>
      <P>The next step will be to introduce legislation to meet the implementation date for Ireland, which is February 2000.  At that stage, there will be a requirement for the opening of approximately 28 per cent of the market to competition.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the ESB will be able to operate competitively in the new open market.  It is already preparing to embrace the challenges and opportunities that this will present.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the ESB will continue to have a monopoly on electricity sales to the majority of consumers who will not be eligible to buy in the competitive market.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to ensure that there will be a level playing pitch for all industry participants including ESB.  The ultimate objective must be lower electricity prices together with the maintenance, and improvement where possible, of standards of service.</P>

      <P>I have read the chief executive's comments as reported in this article.  They are his own views which he is entitled to express.</P>
      <P>The EU electricity Directive states that the establishment of the internal market in electricity is particularly important in order to increase efficiency in the production, transmission and distribution of electricity, while reinforcing security of supply and competitiveness of the European economy.

      <P>The ultimate objective must be lower prices together with the maintenance and improvement, where possible, of standards of service.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the previous Government gave approval in 1996 for price increases of 6.5 per cent over the three year period 1996 to 1998.</P>
      <P>The first increase, averaging 2 per cent, came into effect in April-May 1996 and the second phase, averaging 1.5 per cent, is effective from June-July of this year.</P>

      <P>While the majority of required licences and permits have been received, I am informed by the Irish National Petroleum Corporation (INPC) that the only outstanding issues remaining to be finalised are in connection with:</P>
      <P>(a) a bulk storage licence to be issued by Cork County Council under the Dangerous Substances (Petroleum Bulk Stores) Regulations, 1979, and</P>
      <P>(b) Written consent under the Dangerous Substances (Oil Jetties) Regulations, 1979, to be issued by the Bantry Harbour Master.</P>
      <P>These two items are interlinked, in that the issue of the written consent by the harbour master is subject to the approval of the firefighting plans by Cork County Council.</P>
      <P>As part of the consultative process, INPC held a series of meetings with local interests, and reached agreement on addressing all concerns expressed regarding the operation of the terminal. INPC has contributed to the extension of the Creamery Pier, restocking of the bay, provision of heavy transport for Whiddy Islanders and has established an environmental monitoring group with representatives of other interested parties who use the bay.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the Government as shareholder, not the individual State companies, to reserve the right of the employees to purchase shareholdings.</P>
      <P>The main focus of Government policy in relation to State companies is that where necessary to respond better to the needs of customers, liberalisation of sectors, and growing competition, or the need to enhance the competitiveness of the country, they should become more efficient and effective.  In some cases this requires major transformation and sometimes restructuring. Employee share ownership schemes can play a role in bringing about a partnership and consensus approach to such transformations.  Proposals for such schemes will continue to be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Fair price and fair value will always be part of any such proposals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> Responsibility at Government for encryption policy is currently spread between a number of different Ministers including myself.</P>
    <P>In relation to the control of exports of cryptographic products, for instance, my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has previously introduced two Statutory Instruments, namely, the European Communities (Control of Exports of Dual-Use Goods) Regulations, 1996 (S.I. 362 of 1996) and the Control of Exports Order, 1996 (S.I. 363 of 1996), which contain provisions in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the case of measures to be taken to protect the legitimate needs of lawful access to encrypted material, for the purposes of law enforcement, this falls within the area of responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>My own responsibility in this area stems from recent developments within the telecommunications sector, most notably the developments associated with the Information Society.  At the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Telecommunication Ministers on 1 December 1997, for example, the Commission will be presenting a communication on ensuring security and trust in electronic communication.  The aim of this document is to ensure that users of electronic networks in all economic sectors benefit from the opportunities of the Global Information Society and I intend liaising with my colleagues in Government to ensure that the stance I take at that meeting reflects their concerns also.</P>
    <P>In this context I also intend to initiate a discussion shortly with my Government colleagues as to where the primary responsibility in the area of encryption should be.</P>
    <P>The national approach to this issue should ensure that the development of encryption products is promoted in Ireland and that the legal framework for the use of such products supports the development of electronic commerce over the Internet subject to appropriate measures to enable access to information for law enforcement purposes.</P>

      <P>Wind energy projects supported by the EU THERMIE programme are also granted ESB electricity purchase contracts.

      <QRef>[18936/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is presented as follows in relation to each of the bodies under the aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>National Economic and Social Council: the NESC is an advisory body and does not publish a report on its own proceedings but instead publishes reports on economic and social topics from time to time.  Its accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and a summary statement is included in the Revised Estimates Volume.  The council is funded through a grant-in-aid.  No register of members' interests is maintained but council members are requested to abstain from decision-making where possible conflicts of interest might arise, that is in the placing of contracts for consultancy or research work. The National Economic and Social Council publishes its reports after their submission to Government and the reports are invariably laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and copies given to each Member of the Dáil and Seanad. Members of the public do not attend its meetings and the working papers and minutes of the meetings are maintained on a confidential basis, irrespective of the items under discussion.  There are no formal guidelines laid down which limit the areas in which the Taoiseach or Government may direct the council.  The council regulate themselves in terms of working procedures and choice of research but also comply with requests from the Taoiseach or Government for the conduct of particular research.  As indicted already, while not specified in legislation and so on, the council only publishes material after its submission to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> The Information Society Commission: In its terms of reference the Information Society Commission is obliged to produce an annual report. The commission has only been established since May this year and, therefore, an annual report is not yet due.  However, the commission is working on an interim report which will be produced before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The commission is funded through Subhead N of the Department of the Taoiseach's Vote.  The commission's accounts are kept as part of the overall accounting process of the Taoiseach's Department and as such they are open for scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>There is no official register of members' interests.  However, it is a matter of public record which organisations they represent.  Members are required to abstain from decision-making where any conflict of interest might arise.</P>
    <P>The commission meetings are for commission members only.  However there are a series of six advisory groups which meet independently and report to the commission.  These groups have a wide membership ranging across the public and private sector.  Consultation with interest groups takes place on an ongoing basis.  Members of the public are not permitted to attend.</P>
    <P>There is no mechanism to allow public inspection of commission papers or minutes.  The commission will be publishing annual reports of its activities and these will be submitted to the Taoiseach before publication.</P>
    <P>The commission was established by Government decision.  There is no procedure in place governing specific circumstances in which the Taoiseach may direct the Information Society Commission.  The commission is currently operating as a unit within the Department of the Taoiseach and it has authority to determine its working procedure and areas of research within its terms of reference.  It will also comply with requests from the Taoiseach and Government to undertake specific projects.</P>
    <P>The commission was established in the first half of this year and is still operating on an interim basis only.  No final decision has been taken in relation to its future status.</P>
    <P>Under its terms of reference, the commission is mandated to &ldquo;both develop and implement awareness programmes itself and in conjunction with relevant state agencies, Departments, and private sector groups, targeted at all sectors of the community on the benefits and opportunities of the Information Society&rdquo;.  In this context, the commission will engage in the publication of information for the public without recourse to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission: The 18th annual report of the Law Reform Commission for the year 1996 was published on 24 April 1997. The Taoiseach has no function in relation to the accounts of the commission which, by statute, are presented to the Minister for Finance.  There is no register of members' interests nor is there any provision for such.  Annual reports of the Law <Col N="1149" /> Reform Commission are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for the attendance of the public at meetings of the commission.  There is no provision for making papers of the commission available to the public other than commission publications.  The commission is statutorily independent in devising it procedures.  The statutory functions of the Taoiseach in relation to the commission are set out in the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975.  The Commission's statutory functions do not encompass the giving of advice to the public.</P>
    <P>National Economic and Social Forum: The NESF is not strictly a non-commercial State agency but may, nevertheless, be of interest to the Deputy.  The forum does not produce an annual report but prepares a number of specific reports throughout the year in line with its work programme. In accordance with its constitution and terms of reference, all of the forum's reports are submitted to the Government and laid before each House of the Oireachtas before publication. They are also widely circulated to Government Departments and agencies as well as other relevant bodies.</P>
    <P>The forum is funded through a grant-in-aid and its accounts are subject to scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In accordance with standard practice, its operating budget is shown in an appendix to the Vote.</P>
    <P>In addition to the forum's management and standing committee meetings, plenary sessions are held between five and eight times a year. These plenary sessions are held in public.  From time to time, the forum may also invite interested parties to put forward their views in informal public hearings.</P>
    <P>National Centre for Partnership: In accordance with Partnership 2000, the National Centre for Partnership was established this year and is under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.  It is intended that the centre will publish an annual report next year.  The centre is funded through the Department of the Taoiseach's Vote and, as such, the accounts will be open for scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>There is no official register of board members' interests.  The board consists of representatives of the social partners and civil servants and is independently chaired.  As its remit is derived from Partnership 2000, a shared commitment to enhance partnership in the workplace, no conflicts of interest are envisaged.  Members of the public are not allowed to attend board meetings. However, wide consultation is taking place with employers and employees and the outcomes relayed at board meetings.  There is no mechanism to allow public inspection of the centre's papers or board minutes but its annual report will contain details on its activities.  There are no procedures in place governing specific circumstances in which the Taoiseach may direct the centre.  The centre's role of fostering partnership arrangements will entail the dissemination of best practice <Col N="1150" /> and this will be done without recourse to the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>The role of the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation is to advise Government on the strategic direction of science and technology policy, embracing all aspects including scientific research, third level education, technology and R&amp;D in industry, financing of innovation, public awareness of S&amp;T, and prioritisation of State spending on S&amp;T.  Appointments to the council were made in a personal capacity and on the basis of particular expertise, including scientific disciplines which will be key to our industrial future, <Col N="1151" /> rather than as representatives of any sectoral interest.</P>
      <P>The council is not intended to supplant or cut across the work of any special expert groups in any particular area or to otherwise assume specific functions arising out of EU directives.

      <P>The Community Employment (CE) programme is targeted at a particularly severely disadvantaged group of unemployed people, i.e. those registered long-term unemployed, whose principal or only source of income is a social welfare payment.  In addition lone parents are eligible to participate in community employment and eligibility conditions for the programme are somewhat less restrictive for the disabled and for members of the travelling community.</P>
      <P>However, married unemployed people can swop their social welfare entitlement in order to qualify for participation on the programme.  In this way, a married person who meets the eligibility criteria can transfer entitlement to his or her spouse, who is unemployed but not on the live register, in order for that person to qualify for participation in CE.  Also, persons with children who are in receipt of survivor's contributory pension (SCP) or deserted wife's benefit (DWB) can apply to transfer to one parent family payment (OPFP) in order to become eligible to participate in CE.</P>
      <P>These eligibility criteria only came into effect last year following a detailed review of CE and in response to the recommendations of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment.  They were designed to target the programme at those priority groups already referred to.  I have no plans at present to widen the eligibility criteria. However, consistent with a commitment in Partnership 2000 a working group, inclusive of the social partners has been set up to consider women's access to labour market opportunities. This group is chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and I look forward to its deliberations.</P>
      <P>All unemployed people, whether on the live register or not, are eligible to participate in FÁS mainstream training/specific skills training programmes and from time to time FÁS also offer return to work courses for those who wish to return to the workforce.</P>

      <P>I am aware that concern has been expressed about pay levels in the hotel and catering sectors.  I can inform the Deputy that there are now four Joint Labour Committee's (JLCs) for the hotel and catering sectors.  The most recent JLC for workers employed in hotel establishments in the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, was established on 1 May 1997 by the Labour Court, in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 to 1990.</P>
      <P>The function of a JLC is to draw up proposals for minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for the workers covered by the JLC. When proposals submitted by a JLC to the Labour Court are accepted by the Labour Court, through the making of an Employment Regulation Order (ERO), they become statutory minimum pay and conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>To date, EROs have not been ratified by the Labour Court in respect of the Catering JLC (for the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire) or the Hotels JLC (for the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire).</P>
      <P>The extension of statutory minimum pay and conditions of employment to catering and hotel workers covered by these JLCs, will benefit workers who earn less than the statutory minimum prescribed in any new EROs.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Programme for Government contains, as a key priority, in promoting an inclusive society, the introduction of a national minimum hourly wage.  To give effect to that commitment, I have established a National Minimum Wage Commission.</P>
      <P>The commission's terms of reference require it, <i>inter alia,</i> to advise on the best way to implement the commitment having regard to the level and extent of low pay in the economy.  The commission has been asked to report by the end of 1997.</P>

      <P>I informed the House on 6 November 1997 that, following discussions between myself, my officials and Guinness Ireland Group, they notified their proposed take-over of United Beverages Holdings to the Competition Authority on 4 September 1997 seeking a certificate of clearance for the proposal <Col N="1155" /> under the Competition Acts.  The Authority has since issued a detailed statement of objections which is currently being considered by Guinness Ireland Group.</P>
      <P>The options available to me for intervening in the proposal through the Competition and Mergers Acts were:</P>
      <P>(a) To avail of the right of action under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991 which permits the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to seek an injunction or a declaration in relation to any agreement, decision, concerted practice or abuse prohibited under sections 4 or 5 of that Act;</P>
      <P>(b) to exercise powers under section 14 of the Competition Act, 1991, dealing with mergers, takeovers and monopolies, and request the Competition Authority to carry out an investigation;</P>
      <P>(c) to lodge a complaint with the Director of Competition Enforcement under section 9 of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996;</P>
      <P>(d) to request a study or analysis by the Competition Authority under section 11 of the Competition Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>Given that Guinness Ireland Group notified its proposed take-over of United Beverages Holdings to the Competition Authority seeking a certificate of clearance for the proposal under the Competition Acts, it has not been necessary for me to exercise any of these powers.</P>

    <P>The nature of the Institute's functions involve a high degree of interaction with the industry and the research community to which it provides <Col N="1159" /> advice and assistance.  The Minister does not have a direct function in relation to the day-to-day operations of the Marine Institute and does not, therefore, have a role in so far as the publication of such advice and assistance is concerned. Section 21 of the Marine Institute Act, 1991 allows the Institute to publish information arising from its activities.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Salmon Research Agency</i></P>
    <P>The Salmon Research Agency's most recent annual report and accounts were in respect of 1996 and were published in July 1997.  They are subject to scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>The agency is a company, limited by guarantee, established under the Companies Act.  As it is not a statutory body it is not subject to the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.  The agency's committee of management meetings are held in private and minutes of meetings and board papers are treated as confidential company documents.</P>
    <P>There is no procedure to specify the circumstances in which the Minister may direct this body, but the Minister has a large measure of influence over the agency, through the appointment of six members of the Committee of Management and through the provision of a substantial part of the agency's revenue through the annual Estimates process.</P>
    <P>The nature of the agency's functions involves interaction with the public and the research community. The Minister does not have a direct function in relation to the day-to-day operations of the agency and does not, therefore, have a role in so far as the publication of such advice and assistance is concerned.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Bord Iascaigh Mhara</i></P>
    <P>BIM's most recently published annual report and accounts were for the year 1995 and were published on 4 June 1997.  (The Annual Report and Accounts for 1996 will be presented to Government shortly, prior to laying before the Oireachtas).  The accounts are audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the requirements of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, designated directors of BIM, where necessary, completed the register of members interests.  Details of such entries have been forwarded to the Public Offices Commission.</P>
    <P>All activities and operations of the board are subject to scrutiny by the Oireachtas both during the course of the annual estimates debate and in the context of the proceedings of the Public Accounts Committee.  In addition, the Fisheries Act, 1952 requires the laying before the Oireachtas on an annual basis of BIM's annual report and accounts and other financial details.</P>
    <P>BIM is a body corporate and as such, operates in a similar fashion to a limited liability company. While standing orders and rules of procedure are, in general, matters for the board itself I understand <Col N="1160" /> that, in common with other non-commercial State agencies, BIM board meetings are held in private and minutes of meetings and board papers are treated as confidential company documents.</P>
    <P>The Minister exercises control over, and may issue directions as appropriate to BIM in accordance with the provisions of the Fisheries Act, 1952.  As BIM's functions involve a high degree of interaction with the public they are free to publish advice relevant to the public without recourse to me.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Central and Regional Fisheries Boards</i></P>

    <P>The activities and operations of the central and regional fisheries boards are subject to scrutiny by the Oireachtas both during the course of the annual Estimates debate and in the context of the proceedings of the Public Accounts Committee.

    <P>Under the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, the accounts of the commission are audited by an independent auditor appointed by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>A register of the interests of members of the Foyle Fisheries Commission is not available.</P>
    <P>The Foyle Fisheries Commission is subject to similar Parliamentary scrutiny as the fisheries boards, but it is accountable to Parliaments on both sides of the Border.  Consequently, the annual report and accounts are laid before Parliament in the UK and both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The FFC does not allow public access to their meetings and minutes and commission papers are not available for public inspection.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, I exercise joint control over, and may issue directions as appropriate, to the Foyle Fisheries Commission in accordance with the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, I recently announced a six-point action plan, designed to ensure that the resources of the fisheries service and of all relevant agencies are co-ordinated and deployed to best effect to deal with pollution, both by tackling its causes and by acting swiftly when it occurs.  The plan will include a mobile emergency response unit, an inland fisheries forum to ensure regular co-ordination and information exchange between all involved bodies on all water quality issues, the development of a code of practice, a review of pollution prevention and response strategies, a review of current penalties and investment in the laboratory services and equipment available to the fisheries boards.</P>
      <P>The Central Fisheries Board is currently progressing the various elements of the plan in consultation with the regional fisheries boards, and is in the process of establishing a dedicated environmental co-ordination unit to advance this strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My overall objective is to ensure that resources are effectively deployed in the crucial tasks of pollution prevention, monitoring and incident <Col N="1162" /> response.  To do this, we need a partnership approach across all the relevant agencies and sectors, to ensure that fisheries resources, and the habitats which support them, are protected and conserved; and I look forward to the co-operation of all interested groups to achieve these goals.</P>

      <P>The European Commission is not taking action in the European Court against Ireland regarding its forestry policy.</P>
      <P>However, the Commission initiated proceedings in the European Court of Justice on 5 December 1996 for alleged failure to adequately transpose the EU Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment (85/337/EEC).  This action primarily relates to one aspect of Ireland's transposition of the directive i.e. the levels at which EIA should be required for certain projects, one of which is afforestation.  Full effect has been given in Ireland to the directive since the introduction of the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 1989 and other relevant regulations.  Ireland has lodged a full defence in this case.</P>

      <P>However, the conference did produce an agenda for action on the issue and follow-up papers are also currently being prepared by UNICEF.  The Department of Foreign Affiars will examine those various documents and, in consultation with the Irish national committee for UNICEF, will consider ways in which the issues raised at that conference might be properly addressed.  In that regard, I should stress that the Department has a close working relationship with UNICEF, which is represented on the Joint Department of Foreign Affairs/NGO Standing Committee.  This committee provides a formal framework for a regular exchange of views on human rights issues between the Department and representatives of the NGO community and enables these issues to be considered in an indepth and systematic fashion.</P>

      <P>Ireland's bilateral assistance programme to the <Col N="1164" /> Occupied Territories of the West Bank and Gaza attempts to ensure the delivery of basic services to the Palestinian people as the Israeli civil authority is replaced by institutions under the Palestinian authority.  Assistance is also channelled towards building the capacity of the Palestinian authority institutions themselves.</P>
      <P>Total assistance to the Occupied Territories in 1997 will be in the region of £1 million.  This support is channelled in part through the Ministries of Health, Education and Energy.  Support is also provided through various non-governmental organisations as well as through the various United Nations organisations working on the ground in the Occupied Territories.  All aid programmes emerge from dialogue and discussion with the Palestinian authorities.</P>
      <P>The focus of Irish aid programmes in the Occupied Territories is on the basic needs of the Palestinian people.  Discussions with the Palestinian authorities have not in the past led to direct Irish aid support for the Palestinian Legislative Council, which is the parliamentary body of the Palestianian authority.</P>
      <P>The instrument for co-operation between the European Union and the Palestinian authority is the MEDA Regulation, which was adopted under Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in 1996.  Funding for indicative projects under national programmes is available via the MED Committee which, in late 1996, approved a sum of 3 million ECU to assist with the establishment of the Palestinian Legislative Council.  Further funds are made available for indicative projects for the Palestinian authority as they arise and a number of indicative projects are under discussions at present.</P>
      <P>The Irish aid programme in the Occupied Territories is kept under review.

In the case of Aer Lingus, the company was provided with an Exchequer subvention by my Department of £0.9 million in 1995 and £0.9 million in 1996 in accordance with EU Council Regulation 2408/92 in respect of the provision of air services from Dublin to the regional airports in Kerry and Galway.  An equity injection of £75 million was also paid to Aer Lingus in 1993, £50 million in 1994 and £50 million in 1995 to support a restructuring programme.  In the case of CIE, the financial assistance provided to the company, and to its subsidiary Iarnród Éireann, is detailed in the following schedule:</P>

      <Quest>if she will give details of the fare increases which have been implemented by semi-State companies providing transport services over the past five years; the basis on which fare increases are considered; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the companies being referred to by the Deputy are Aer Lingus and Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
      <P>In regard to Aer Lingus the Deputy will be aware that as part of the process of liberalisation of air transport in recent years, the role of Governments in controlling and regulating air fares has been progressively reduced.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2409/92 which came into effect on 1 January 1993, air carriers licensed in the European Economic Area (EEA) are free to set air fares and the conditions under which these fares apply in respect of carriage within the EEA in accordance with their own commercial judgment, subject to certain safeguards against excessively high areas or predatory pricing.  As Community air carriers and those from Norway and Iceland which make up the EEA are no longer required to obtain Government approval for air fares in respect of carriage within the EEA, I have no statutory function in the matter.  Fares on services between Ireland and non-EEA countries are governed by individual bilateral air agreements.  By and large, as in the case of the USA, these include liberal provisions in relation to air fares.  This means that it is only in very exceptional circumstances that the respective aviation authorities would intervene in relation to fares.  My Department has not intervened in relation to setting air fares in such markets during the period in question.</P>
      <P>As regards Córas Iompair Éireann (CIE) the last general increase in standard fares approved by the Government was in 1991.  The Government also approved an increase in certain categories of standard fares in 1994.  The detailed implementation of such increases is a day to day matter for Córas Iompair Éireann and its subsidiary companies.  I have no function in this regard.</P>
      <P>In considering whether to authorise an increase in standard fares, account is taken of the need to strike a balance between, on the one hand, restricting fares increases in order to maximise ridership and reduce congestion and on the other hand, the need for CIÉ to recover its operating costs and support its own capital investments in infrastructure development and fleet replacement. In addition, careful consideration is given to the potential adverse social effects of the proposed fare increases.</P>
      <P>CIE applied for a fares increase in 1996 and the then Minister responded that future applications for fares increases would be dealt with in the context of the system of public service contracts to be introduced in respect of socially necessary services which cannot be provided by the CIE companies on a commercial basis.  That remains the position.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that each of CIE's three subsidiary companies &mdash; Bus Atha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann &mdash; has the discretion to offer discount or promotional fares, including multiple journey tickets, in accordance with their own commerical judgment.  Neither the Government nor the Minister has any function in relation to increases in discretionary or discount fares, provided that the approved maximum standards rates are not exceeded.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92, 93, 97 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>The CIÉ light rail project team has identified strategic options for the route between the city centre and Ballymun.  Further work to provide additional information on these options is now being carried out.  The light rail project team's efforts will be concentrated to the north of the inner city pending completion of underground study.  The project team hopes to be in a position to initiate the public consultation process in late spring next year when it will be able to take account of the conclusions of the underground study.</P>
      <P>In the context of the planning and design of the Ballymun route options CIÉ are also examining a possible extension of the proposed Ballymun light rail line to the airport.</P>
      <P>Apart from an extension of the Ballymun light rail line to Dublin Airport, DTI recommended that a conventional rail link, but not necessarily a DART type system, from Dublin Airport to the Dublin-Belfast railway line be evaluated as a longer term option.  CIÉ and Aer Rianta are considering this proposal.  As part of the work being undertaken by the light rail project team and CIÉ/Aer Rianta, the inter-relationship between the light rail and heavy rail links to Dublin Airport is being considered, having regard to the DTI conclusions.</P>

    <P>In addition to having basic charges which are competitive by reference to other European airports, Aer Rianta currently operates a rolling five year traffic growth incentive scheme designed to stimulate scheduled passenger traffic at Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports.  Under this scheme, no airport charges are levied for new traffic at Shannon and Cork for the first three years, with <Col N="1173" /> a 90 per cent discount applying at Dublin.

      <P>The energy efficiency investment support scheme aims to promote investment in energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption.  From 1994 to date, over IR£7 million in grant aid has been committed under this scheme.  This represents a potential investment of IR£33 million in energy efficient technologies.  I understand that energy savings of approximately IR£8 million per annum will accrue to industry following completion of these investments.</P>
      <P>The annual self audit and statement of energy accounts scheme involves energy awareness promotion and technical advice and aims to:</P>
      <P>&mdash;encourage companies to establish an energy management structure and to undertake energy audits;</P>
      <P>&mdash;increase awareness of the importance of energy efficienty among employees and customers;</P>
      <P>&mdash;realise energy savings; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;reduce CO 2 emissions from Irish industry.</P>
      <P>A total of 43 companies have joined this scheme since 1995.  They have a combined annual energy spend of over IR£100 million.  It is estimated that the combined annual energy savings of the members will amount to approximately IR£1.8 million to the end of 1997.  A further 15 companies are expected to join the scheme before the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>The future of the energy efficiency programme in the post-1999 period is currently being considered by my Department and the Energy Advisory Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is represented on the working group established under the 1996 budget to examine <Col N="1175" /> the strategic impact of taxation on environment policy.  My Department is currently in consultation with the Department of Finance regarding tax incentives for alternative energy sources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister, I have had the opportunity to examine the strategic alliance deal between the previous Government and KPN-Telia.  Last month, I met the presidents of both KPN and Telia, for wide ranging discussions to review progress under the strategic alliance deal, including discussions concerned with advancing the proposed employee share ownership plan for Telecom Éireann employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that there is a good working relationship with the strategic partners to secure <Col N="1176" /> the best interests of the company, the customer and the taxpayer who has a major interest in the company as it prepares to face the challenges of a fully liberalised environment in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>However, I assure the House that, as the strategic alliance develops, I will fulfil my commitment to securing the best deal for the taxpayer and on a basis which is of strategic benefit to the company and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I am at present examining the question of making public the terms of the shareholders' agreement, subject only to the genuine requirements of commercial confidentiality.  The release of any elements of the deal would, of course, require the agreement of the other parties involved.  I should add that the main features of the strategic alliance deal in terms of the partners shareholding, the purchase price and strategic benefits for Telecom Éireann are already in the public domain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105, 150 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>I want to clarify that the Fianna Fáil party made no commitment before the general election to introduce a dual licensing scheme for MMDS and deflector operators.</P>
      <P>The legal power under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, to grant licences in respect of television retransmission systems, in common with the power to issue all licences for the use of the radio frequency spectrum, was transferred to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation with effect from 30 June 1997.  Any new scheme for the grant of licences to deflector operators would require the making of statutory regulations by the director and would be subject to my consent.</P>
      <P>The initiative, therefore, in relation to the introduction of a licensing scheme rests entirely with the director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the advent of digital terrestrial broadcasting, on the basis of information available to me, the advent of this technology should be very beneficial.  This is primarily because digital technology will enable the delivery of higher <Col N="1177" /> quality services using less frequency space than the current analogue system.  This freeing up of frequency space will facilitate the introduction of new television programme services and the provision of other new services.</P>
    <P>I cannot be precise about the manner and timing of the introduction of digital television broadcasting because this will be a matter for the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the terms of exclusivity offered to MMDS operators at the time of award of the licences, I would like to set out some background information.</P>
    <P>In the late 80s the Minister faced a problem of providing for the provision of nationwide retransmission of UK television in non-cabled areas which would accord with the highest technical and commercial standards.  MMDS was adopted as the only technically feasible way of providing this service.  UHF retransmission will never be able to deliver UK services to the population at large to the standards set for MMDS.</P>
    <P>In considering the MMDS solution the view was taken that the investment necessary for provision of the service would require some form of exclusive franchise to operate in favour of the licensees.  Accordingly that is the way that my predecessors proceeded with the planning for MMDS.  The invitations to apply for licences referred to &ldquo;exclusive licenses&rdquo;, and although the licences themselves are not so described, it was always understood that they were indeed exclusive.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the then Minister issued a letter to the managing director of Independent Newspapers which on the face of it gave certain assurances as to the exclusivity of any MMDS licence that might issue in which that company had a direct or indirect interest.  The assurances were to the effect that no further or other broadcast or relay within the licences area would be granted for the duration of the MMDS licences.</P>
    <P>That is the fact of the matter.  However, I have no wish to give a legal interpretation of that letter. The Deputy will be aware that the question of MMDS exclusivity was dealt with in detail in the course of the 1995 High Court action taken by South Coast Community TV and has arisen in the judicial review brought by South Coast which is currently before the High Court.  In any event as Deputy Yates is aware, matters related to the issue of licences for MMDS or any other form of radio transmission have now been transferred to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>

      <P>The reason there is no Bill regarding a Utilities Regulatory Commission on the published list of the programme of legislation is because no decision has been taken by this Government to establish such a commission.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a regulator for telecommunications has already been established. Regulation of the electricity industry is being considered in the context of the relevant EU directive which is to be implemented in Ireland in February 2000.  Ongoing negotiations on the proposed EU directive on the gas industry will have implications for regulation in that area. Likewise, the question of regulation in any of the transport areas will be examined as necessary.</P>
      <P>I am keeping the options for regulation of the various sectors under the aegis of my Department under review.  I am not yet convinced that an allembracing regulatory commission is the best solution. The alternative options of specific industry regulation or sectoral regulation need to be examined further.</P>

      <P>My Department has not undertaken studies in relation to the cost and environmental consequences of the use of varying types of energy resources in the production of electricity.  However, such issues are examined on an ongoing basis by the ESB to ensure the optimal usage of resources in the electricity production process.</P>
      <P>Taking into account such factors as fuel costs, capital costs and operation and maintenance costs, it is generally accepted that gas tends to be the cheapest fuel followed by oil and coal and then peat, wind and hydro.</P>
      <P>For generation capacity planning purposes, the ESB continuously tracks estimated electricity production costs and emission performance for new electricity generating technologies using a variety of fuels.  This enables future generation plans to be developed which have least overall system cost while complying with emission constraints.</P>

      <P>The electricity systems on both sides of the Border are interconnected via a 275/220kv double circuit line between Dundalk Station, County Louth and Tandragee Station, County Armagh.  This interconnector was out of commission for many years but has become fully operational again since March 1995 following the ceasefire in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>This interconnector was supplemented in 1991 by the construction of two 110kv standby interconnectors from Letterkenny to Strabane and Swanlinbar to Enniskillen for which EU finding under the INTERREG programme was sought and received.  These two interconnectors are used by the ESB and Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) to provide emergency back-up supply to Enniskillen and Letterkenny respectively.</P>
      <P>A recent joint ESB-NIE feasibility study on cross-Border interconnection indicated that further interconnectors are dependent on reinforcement of the networks, particularly on NIE's side of the Border.  The precise timing of this reinforcement is a matter for NIE but is unlikely to occur until after the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ESB and NIE will be undertaking further studies to determine the future optimum and complementary network investments on both sides of <Col N="1183" /> the Border to maximise the benefits of interconnection.</P>

      <P>In general, the Department has not got standard norms of gearing ratios between debt and equity for the commercial State companies, under its aegis, that have equity bases; in the case of those State companies that have no equity bases, obviously the normal commercial criterion of gearing ratio does not apply.  In those <Col N="1184" /> State companies, where it is appropriate to apply gearing ratios, the norms have to have regard to the particular circumstances of each company and the sectors in which they operate.  The Government's approach, as set out in the Action Programme for the Millennium is practical and focused at securing and maintaining the competitiveness of the State companies.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of increasing or decreasing borrowings in the State companies, the individual borrowings of each State company vary according to the particular commercial circumstances and sector in which the company is involved.  Business confidence and expectations of future profits are crucial factors in the determination of how much debt capital investors are prepared to lend.  The level of borrowings which a company can prudently sustain depends ultimately on the nature of the State company wishing to borrow the funds, and the particular industry in which it is engaged.</P>
      <P>As regards specific levels of borrowing and borrowing ceilings of the individual State companies, I refer the Deputy to the following schedule:</P>

      <P>The main element of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents are published in a booklet available from my Department. The plan is designed to provide a rapid and effective response to accidents involving the release or potential release of radioactive substances into the environment which could give rise to radiation exposure.  The national emergency <Col N="1186" /> plan outlines the measures in place to assess and mitigate the effects of nuclear accidents which occur in the UK or elsewhere and which might pose a radiological hazard to Ireland. As Minister responsible for nuclear safety matters, I am responsible for the emergency plan and for ensuring the co-ordination of the respective responses of the various Government Departments and statutory organisations, including the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII).</P>
      <P>Emergency preparedness is underpinned by a constant monitoring programme carried out by the RPII.  This programme includes measurements of radioactivity levels in air, on the ground, in live sheep, foodstuffs and in a range of samples from the seas around Ireland.  The RPII's monitoring programme enables a healthy state of readiness to be maintained so that a rapid and effective response can be provided in the event of a nuclear emergency.  The vital co-operative emergency arrangements with our EU partners are tested every six to eight weeks.  At least one of these every year includes the transfer of simulated radiological data between EU member states.  Ireland participates in all of these tests and the experiences gained to date have led to improvements in the international arrangements.</P>
      <P>In November 1996 and in April this year, the State's relevant Government Departments and statutory bodies took part in the international desktop nuclear emergency exercise, INEX 2, organised by the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  A further NEA exercise is planned for next year.  Over 30 countries, the European Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency have participated in INEX 2 to date.  In Ireland's case, the INEX 2 exercise proved to be helpful in reviewing the operation of our emergency plan.</P>
      <P>Following the INEX emergency exercises, a review of existing arrangements is currently being undertaken by my Department and the RPII and some procedural and practical improvements have been suggested.  This review, allied to the RPII's ongoing monitoring programmes, is aimed at ensuring that our emergency plan is fully equipped to provide an effective and speedy response to any nuclear accident or emergency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>The liberalisation of the telecommunications sector in Ireland is already well under way and this process will be completed on 1 January 2000 when the provision of voice telephony services will be fully liberalised.</P>
      <P>The extent of existing competition is already leading to reductions in prices for some telecommunications services, thereby improving the overall cost competitiveness of the sector.  With the increase in service-based industries, particularly information-based industries, internationally competitive Telecom charges are critical.  It is the Government's policy that Irish telecom charges should be in the top quartile of OECD indicators in terms of price competitiveness.  Continued movement towards full liberalisation in this country will result in more choice for users of telecommunications services and will mean further decreases in prices.</P>
      <P>In its preparations for full liberalisation, the board of Telecom Éireann has recognised the need to strive to continuously improve the competitiveness of telephone charges for both residential and commercial customers.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Telecom Éireann earlier this year announced an £80 million price reduction package to be phased in over 12 months.  This latest package brings to £210 million the value of price reductions introduced by the company since 1995 and demonstrates Telecom Éireann's firm commitment to continuing price reductions.  There have already been substantial reductions in international charges and the company has indicated its intention, as part of the package, to reduce substantially domestic trunk call charges.  I fully support the reduction of charges.</P>

    <P>The minimum obligatory reductions set out in the price cap order will result in substantial real price decreases for Telecom Éireann customers.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, on or after 16 December 1998, two years from the making of the price cap order, I may direct the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to review the order and, in such circumstances, the director may modify the terms of the order.  From December 2001, the question of whether further obligatory reductions in Telecom charges are warranted will be a matter for the director.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99, a European Union co-financed programme of investment in transport infrastructure and facilities, identified the importance of the development of the transport services sector.  The programme stated that if full advantage was to be obtained from improvements in transport infrastructure, transport and distribution services must develop in a manner which will optimise the use of much improved infrastructure and growing facilities.</P>
      <P>In its February 1997 strategy statement, my Department committed itself to conducting a review of the development requirements of the road haulage industry, including the potential for the application of intelligent transport systems. In June 1997 the need for a review was given added urgency by the road haulage dispute in Dublin Port which seriously disrupted transport services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department sought initital comments on the scope and content of such a review from a range of organisations on 19 June 1997.  Organisations whose views were sought included The Irish Road Haulage Association, IBEC, The Institute of Freight Forwarders, The Irish Ship <Col N="1192" /> Agents Association, The Chartered Institute of Transport, Forfás and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Most of the organisations consulted responded by mid August.  In early September a first draft of terms of reference for the review was sent to the interested organisations for consideration.</P>
    <P>The Irish Road Haulage Association submitted views on the proposed review on 2 October.  Various scheduled dates for a meeting with my Department to discuss their views were deferred at the request of the association until 5 November 1997 when initial discussions took place.</P>

      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann's subsidiary companies and unions representing workers in them have been engaged in negotiations on necessary change and restructuring for some time.  Shortly after taking office I had consultations with the interested parties and suggested a way forward for these negotiations.  I recommended that the parties should commit themselves to reaching agreement at the earliest possible date and should agree a timetable for the successful conclusion of the negotiations in each operating company within the current calendar year, with appropriate intermediate benchmarks.  Since then my Department has been monitoring the situation and, while the parties face formidable challenges, I am satisfied that some progress has already been achieved in the negotiations.  However, I would stress that the successful conclusion of these negotiations is a matter for the unions and management in the individual subsidiary companies. The negotiations have also to be seen as the first stage in a process of managing change on a partnership basis.  In the longer term management and unions must develop a common purpose approach towards the challenges facing the CIE group.</P>

      <P>Proposals which Córas Iompair Éireann and its subsidiary companies may develop from time to time to increase standard fare rates require the approval of the Government before they can be implemented.  In considering whether or not to authorise an increase in standard fares, account is taken of the need to strike a balance between, on the one hand, restricting fares increases in order to maximise ridership and reduce congestion and on the other hand, the need for the group to recover its operating costs and support it own capital investments in infrastructure development and fleet replacements.  In addition, careful consideration is given to the potential adverse social effect of the proposed fare increases.</P>
      <P>CIE applied for a fare increase in 1996 and the then Minister responded that in future applications for fares increases would be dealt with in the context of the system of public service contracts to be introduced in respect of socially necessary services which cannot be provided by the CIE companies on a commercial basis.

      <P>The Government has set out its policy for transport in its Action Programme for the Millennium.  The policy involves putting new momentum into our transport system, opening up new internationl air links, supporting the regional airports, regenerating public transport and upgrading and maintaining our road network. The three Departments which have direct responsibility for transport are now engaged in implementing this policy.  As far as my Department is concerned, the key priorities include: investment in the mainline and suburban rail network, including a link to Dublin Airport; reenergising the Dublin Light Rail project including the extension to Sandyford and studying the option of putting Luas underground in the city centre; regeneration of public transport especially <Col N="1196" /> in Dublin and Cork; encouraging commercial investment to accelerate improvement in national transport infrastructure; introduction of a co-ordinated and comprehensive approach to promoting access by people with disabilities to the use of public spaces and facilities, and to the whole of the transport chain; examining how low fare policies by airlines can be further developed; supporting the network of regional airports; resistance to EU plans to abolish duty-free shopping after June 1999.</P>
      <P>The EU co-financed Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99 provides a comprehensive and integrated national transport investment strategy, particularly in the areas of transport, which require a co-ordinated approach such as roads and public transport.</P>
      <P>In addition to the operational programme, other policy framework documents are published from time to time which set the parameters for the development of the different areas of transport for which my Department is responsible. Examples include my Department's statement of strategy and the Irish aviation policy document. Under the terms of the Public Service Management Act, 1997 a new statement of strategy must be published by my Department before 1 March 1998.</P>
      <P>In the light of such policy statements at this juncture, it is not necessary to consider publishing either a Green Paper or White Paper on transport policy at this juncture.</P>

      <P>It is a basic principle of public procurement policy that a procedure based on competitive tendering should always be used and this <Col N="1197" /> applies to the semi-State bodies under the aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>The EU's Public Procurement Directives set out detailed rules on the purchase of goods and services.  These rules apply to the procurement processes of the semi-State bodies under the aegis of the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the directives and the purchasing arrangements adopted by individual semi-State bodies for goods and services for their operations are matters for the boards concerned.</P>
      <P>The report of the task force to review controls in the commercial State companies made a number of recommendations in relation to the procurement of goods and services.  I am currently in consultation with my colleague the Minister for Finance with a view to having these recommendations implemented as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In general, I do not meet chief executives on their own.  I have, however, met chairmen, and boards accompanied by their chief executives, on more than one occasion, in respect of each of the State bodies.  Many of these meetings discussed wide-ranging agendas.  I have given several of the companies general indications as to <Col N="1198" /> my thinking and that of the Government in relation to their businessess and sectors.</P>
      <P>It is not for me to set policy and performance targets for individual chief executives; I see this as a matter for chairmen, boards and remuneration sub-committees where these exist.</P>
      <P>I have noted that report No. 37 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, the Buckley report, recommends that boards should set out performance targets in the context of performance-related elements of remuneration packages for chief executives.  This matter will fall to be determined in the context of ongoing consideration of the general question of implementing report No. 37.  I would tend to see the recommendations in chapter 2 as a package.</P>

      <P>An Post provides counter services, including payment of bills for other organisations, in competition with other providers of similar services.</P>
      <P>From the customer's point of view, there are obvious benefits in having such facilities available, and the Code of Practice for the Delivery of Services to Customers of Commercial State Companies emphasises the importance of satisfying the customers' needs.  All the State companies under my aegis are expected to continue to address the customers' needs and I am confident that they will continue to do so.  Where this demands co-operation between companies in the interests of the customer, I would like to see that happen.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate to intervene directly in the market for the provision of such services by directing State organisations to choose An Post instead of or in addition to other providers.  State organisations should make their decisions in this area in the context of efficiency, cost effectiveness and customer convenience.</P>

      <P>The essential elements of the draft EU postal directive are: the permanent provision of a postal service of specified quality at all points in the State at affordable prices for all users to be known as the &ldquo;universal service&rdquo;; rules on the <Col N="1199" /> quality of service for both national and cross-Border mail cost accounting and terminal dues i.e. the arrangements by which postal operators compensate each other for delivery of cross-Border mail which are related to costs; the designation of a national regulatory authority in each member state, legally separate from and operationally independent of my Department; a requirement that all postal operators who provide the universal service should undertake to handle all items of letter mail costing up to a maximum of five times the basic tariff and weighing up to a maximum of 350 grammes.  Any mail outside these parameters will be liberalised when the directive comes into force.</P>
      <P>The draft directive also provides that the Council and the European Paraliment will decide, not later than January 2000, on further gradual and controlled liberisation of the postal sector on the basis of proposals to be made by the Commission before the end of 1998.  These will follow a review of the sector which the Commission will undertake, this further liberalisation to take effect from 2003.</P>

      <P>The report of the Oil Reserves Advisory Group was submitted to my Department in July, 1996.  The group was established in February 1996 as provided for in the regulations which established the National Oil Reserves Agency.  The function of the group as set out in the regulations is to keep the activities of NORA under review.</P>
      <P>The report of the group highlighted some areas where stockholding could be improved.  In broad terms the report coincides with my views on the issues raised.</P>
      <P>The main recommendation of the group was for the agency to increase strategic oil stocks within Ireland thereby reducing reliance on stocks abroad.  In this regard, in December last year the agency purchased 57,000 tonnes of oil products for storage at Dublin and Shannon.  Ongoing discussions are taking place with oil companies regarding the availability of storage facilities for further purchases and the agency have this month arranged for an additional 8,000 tonnes to be stored in Limerick.  In addition, when regulatory issues concerning the operation of the Whiddy Island Oil Terminal are resolved, it is planned to import 135,000 tonnes of crude oil to supplement the existing stocks stored at the facility.</P>

      <P>The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995, provides a framework for third party access to the gas network of Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>
      <P>BGE has informed me that it is involved in detailed negotiations or discussions with a number of eligible customers and that the negotiations have reached an advanced stage with one particular customer.  Generally, the negotiations relate not only to the price to be charged for third party access but also to a range of operational aspects.</P>
      <P>On the latter aspects, BGE has carried out a substantial amount of work on the drafting of a code of operations and is still having consultations with interested parties.  The code will facilitate the efficient and safe management of the gas transmission network in the context of the third party access regime.  The code will be a detailed document governing the general relationship between BGE, as gas transmitter, and the various users of the third party access facility and will deal with such matters as capacity booking and gas balancing rules.  BGE has informed me that it hopes to finalise the code early next year and that in the meantime, third party access can be availed of on the basis of an interim version of the code of operations.  In this context, BGE has been flowing gas through its pipeline network in Scotland on a third party basis for over a year.</P>
      <P>In addition, BGE is discussing with BG Transco, the operator of the UK gas transmission network, arrangements for the offtake of gas from the UK terminal of the Ireland-UK gas interconnector at Moffat, Scotland.  Many of these issues involve arrangements under the UK Gas Network Code.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that BGE is making progress and that there has been no delay in drawing up the necessary and complex arrangements for the implementation of the third party access regime. My Department is monitoring the ongoing situation closely and will be prepared to intervene if necessary.</P>
      <P>Pursuant to the provisions of the 1995 Act, my Department has drafted general ministerial directives relating to standard service transmissions and standard service pricing.  The drafts are currently being examined by the Attorney General's office and the views of interested parties on the drafts will be invited as soon as possible.</P>

The energy projections envisaged an increase in CO 2 emissions by 2010 commensurate with known economic growth forecasts at that time.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for An Post to decide the position in respect of individual post offices, and I have no function in that regard.</P>
      <P>However, I understand from An Post that the postmaster at Cavangarden, known locally as Cashelard, County Donegal, resigned with effect from 29 November 1996.  Following his resignation, the post office was closed on a temporary basis to facilitate a review of the services provided in the area.  As part of that review, An Post met a deputation representative of local interests in January 1997 and their views were taken into account.  Factors such as the sparsely populated area, minimal business levels, the absence of a shop in the area and the proximity of centres of significant population all severely limited the potential of a post office in that locality.  In the circumstances An Post decided in May last to make the closure of the post office in Cavangarden, Cashelard permanent and are directing their customers to the post offices in Ballyshannon, 3.4 miles and Ballintra, 4.6 miles.</P>

      <P>I am aware that high levels of radon gas have been found in certain cave environments.  Due to the subterranean origin of radon, underground locations are particularly susceptible to high radon levels.  Because of the possibility that persons working as guides in such caves could incur relatively high radiation doses, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland have in recent years conducted a programme of monitoring in caves.</P>
      <P>The results of this programme indicate that a number of guides may be receiving high radiation doses and the institute have written to a number of cave owners advising them to introduce a programme of monitoring workers.  In addition, the institute have suggested that owners take all measures possible to reduce the exposure to workers.  These measures include increasing ventilation and limiting the time spent by guides in the caves.</P>
      <P>When assessing the risk owing to exposure to radon, it is important to stress that both the radon concentration and the duration of the exposure must be taken into account.  For members of the public making a single visit to a show cave, therefore, the radiation dose likely to be incurred is small.</P>

      <P>The relevant agencies-bodies under the aegis of the Department are the Irish Red Cross Society and Coiste an Asgard.  The information sought by the Deputy in respect of each of these bodies is as follows: The Irish Red Cross society's accounts are audited by a duly qualified auditor appointed by the Central Council of the Society.  The executive committee submits its report and accounts to the central council on an annual basis and the report and accounts for 1996 were submitted on 17 May 1997.  The books and accounts of the society are available, if required, for examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The society does not have a register of members' interests.  Non-members are not entitled to attend <Col N="1206" /> meetings of the society.  However, membership is open to all citizens.  Board papers or minutes are not normally available for public inspection, except for research purposes.  However, they are circulated to members for information.  The Irish Red Cross Society is an autonomous body with full power to control the administration of its affairs.  It is free to publish advice relevant to the public without recourse to me.</P>
      <P>Coiste an Asgard is a company limited by guarantee established under the Companies Acts. Annual accounts are lodged with the Companies Registration Office where they are available for inspection by the public.

      <P>The Minister for Finance has given his approval for payment of a national contribution in respect of agrimonetary losses to producers in the beef, milk, cereals and sugar sectors.  Under EU regulations it is necessary to obtain the prior approval of the European Commission for all schemes for agrimonetary compensation, whether funded by the EU budget or the national Exchequer.  The figure of £50 per head for eligible cattle was announced by my predecessor despite the fact that such approval had not been obtained.  The approval of the Commission has now been received for payment of compensation based on what they estimate to be actual losses to producers resulting directly from the revaluations in November 1996 and January 1997.  This will amount to approximately IR£41 per head on eligible steers, young bulls and heifers disposed of between 1 April and 10 June 1997.  A top-up of £2 per head of the special beef premium in respect of animals which qualified for the 22 month premium in 1996 has also been approved.</P>
      <P>Payments will commence when, and if, the necessary Supplementary Estimate is passed by Dáil Éireann.  It is hoped to present the Supplementary Estimate to Dáil Éireann in the very near future.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the two directives referred to have been transposed into Irish law by the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals during Transport) Orders, 1995 and 1997.  These orders require that every transporter intending to export animals to the Continent must present a route plan to a veterinary inspector from my Department which is signed and stamped by that inspector only on the basis that such a route plan complies with the provisions of the orders including those relating to rest periods.  In addition, a copy of the completed route plan must be returned to my Department within a maximum of seven days following the return of the means of transport to the State.  Arrangements in place for the shipment of livestock to Cherbourg comply with these requirements.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, veterinary inspectors from my Department occasionally travel on ships carrying livestock to the Continent and also carry out spotchecks of the relevant staging points at or near the port of destination.  The directives concerned also impose obligations on both the member states of transit and destination.</P>

      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 197, 241, 244, 260, and 261 together.</P>
      <P>The ewe premium is designed to compensate producers for the difference between the EU basic price and the average EU market price for sheepmeat.  In view of this, it is inevitable that the rate of the ewe premium will be lower in a year, such as 1997, when market prices are high, in relation to the level of premium paid in 1995, when prices were at relatively low levels.</P>
      <P>The 1997 ewe premium is currently expected to be £11.78. The premium was fixed at £20.59 and £13.99 for 1995 and 1996, respectively.  The lower premium payable in 1997 reflects the higher market prices throughout the EU and Ireland this year and, when account is taken of this, the total return from the market and premium payments was slightly higher in 1997 than in 1995.</P>
      <P>As far as hill sheep farmers are concerned, it should be noted that the EU sheepmeat regime recognises the postion of the hill sheep farmer through the payment of a supplementary rural world premium of £5.51 on eligible ewes to producers in disadvantaged areas, where all hill sheep farmers are located.  In addition, these producers also receive a headage payment of £10 per head on the first 200 ewes-hoggets under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  These supplementary payments largely compensate hill sheep farmers for the lower prices they receive from the market.</P>

      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 198, 224 and 242 together.</P>
      <P>In fulfilment of the commitment under the Partnership 2000 agreement, I made representations to the EU Commission earlier this year for the introduction of an extensification premium in the sheepmeat sector.  The Commission has not agreed to this request.  They consider that the extensification premium and the rural world premium are similar measures in that the extensification premium was introduced in the beef sector in 1992 following a cut in institutional prices and that the rural world premium was introduced to offset the negative effects of the stabiliser in the sheep sector for producers in the disadvantage areas, where extensive production systems prevail.  I will continue to press this issue with the Commission at every possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>This person's spouse has applied to join the scheme under the joint management arrangement.</P>
      <P>The person named has been asked to confirm whether he has reached 66 years of age because it is a condition of the scheme that in a joint management application, a participant or a participant's spouse on reaching their 66th birthday must apply to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for either a contributory or a non-contributory old age pension.  If such a pension is payable it must be deducted from the farm retirement pension.  In any event evidence of the application and the reply from that Department must be submitted to my Department at the relevant time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the background to the headage payments arrangements:</P>
      <P>(a) By 31 October 1996 less than 45 per cent of all headage payments had been made despite the commitments in the Charter of Farmers' Rights.</P>
      <P>(b) 1997 is the first year in which the land parcel identification system required by the EU has to be fully operational in Ireland, an obligation which did not have to be complied with in making payments in the latter part of 1996.</P>
      <P>(c) Notwithstanding this additional obligation in 1997, my Department has paid some £265 million so far in respect of the 1997 headage and premium schemes to farmers as compared to £235 million paid by the same date in respect of the corresponding 1996 schemes.</P>
      <P>(d) As of today, 50 per cent of all 1997 cattle headage and beef cow applicants and 51 per cent of all sheep headage applicants have been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e) I am providing extra resources to speed up the digitising and clearing for payment of <Col N="1220" /> area aid applications so as to allow the remaining headage payments to be speeded up over the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I am as concerned as the Deputy to see all headage payments made to eligible applicants as soon as possible and he can be assured that I am making every effort to achieve this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been numerous changes in both the administrative and policy guidelines governing REPS since its inception in June 1994.  The following are the dates and nature of the changes:</P>
      <P>1.  July, 1995 &mdash; Random Prepayment Selection of REPS applications:</P>
      <P>This measure was introduced as a result of control and audit requirements, and involves a random sample of 5 per cent of all new REPS applications and also of all annual renewal applications for a full plan check and farm visit prior to payment.</P>
      <P>2.  November 1995 &mdash; Burren NHA conditions</P>
      <P>These guidelines for the REPS farmers in the Burren Natural Heritage Area were introduced following consultations with the then Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Teagasc, farming and environmental interests.</P>
      <P>3.  January 1996 &mdash; Supplementary Measure 2 on Degraded Areas</P>
      <P>This change involved an improved range of payment and grazing options for REPS farmers who applied for this measure.  Of particular importance were the following points:</P>
      <P>&mdash; the requirement to remove all animals from the degraded commonage from 1 November to 30 April each year was made optional;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; the 30 per cent destocking limit was removed which increased the attractiveness <Col N="1224" /> of reducing flock numbers to sustainable levels;</P>
    <P>&mdash; a group incentive of 30 ECU per hectare was introduced.</P>
    <P>4.  January 1996 &mdash; Demonstration Farms</P>
    <P>A list of approved farms to be used for demonstration purposes during REPS 20 hour courses was circulated to planners and inspectors.</P>
    <P>5.  January 1996 &mdash; Second Subsequent Payments</P>
    <P>Procedures were introduced for the processing and approval of second and subsequent payments under the scheme.  These involved, <i>inter alia</i>, compliance checks for all second-subsequent applications and a comprehensive penalty system for non-compliance with REPS plans.</P>
    <P>6.  February 1996 &mdash; Controls Monitoring</P>
    <P>Improved control and monitoring of REPS applications were introduced which involved the payment of 50 per cent upfront on year 1 applications with the balance to be paid six months later. Second subsequent applications continued to be paid on the basis of one payment each year.  In addition, strict quality control requirements were introduced for REPS planning agencies.</P>
    <P>7.  May 1996 &mdash; Appeals</P>
    <P>An appeals system was introduced for farmers who had been penalised as a result of a compliance inspection.  Appeals procedures were introduced at local office level and a further avenue of appeal was introduced at head office level.</P>
    <P>8.  May 1996 &mdash; Revised REPS Specification</P>
    <P>The agri environmental specifications provide the framework within which planning agencies operate when drawing up agri environmental plans. The specifications were initially devised when the scheme was introduced in June 1994.  The following changes were introduced in the revised specifications to take account of changes approved by the European Commission and other changes deemed necessary for the improved operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Measure 1 &mdash; Waste Management, Liming and Fertilisation Plan</P>
    <P>(a) This measure, as revised, gives effect to the three year derogation on pollution control which previously had been approved by the Commission.  The revision placed an onus on planning agencies to explain to the farmer his statutory obligations as regards pollution and to satisfy himself/herself that pollution can be avoided through good management and careful use of existing facilities.  The revision also required farmers who join the scheme to have in place, by the end of Year three, sufficient waste storage to hold two thirds of the waste produced during the specified housing period provided the other one third can be applied during that period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> (b) The requirement that at least half of the slurry produced on the farm must be spread by 1 July and the remainder by 30 September each year was introduced. Additionally, slurry may be spread at all times of the year provided landspreading precautions are observed and weather conditions suitable.</P>
    <P>Measure 2 &mdash; Grassland Management</P>
    <P>Outwintering of animals was permitted at a stocking density of one livestock unit per hectare or less.  Supplementary feeding was permitted with specified conditions to minimise poaching and nutrient run-off.</P>
    <P>Measure 4 &mdash; Retention of Wildlife Habitats</P>
    <P>A rule was included that where there is evidence of the deliberate removal of habitats prior to joining the scheme then such farmers will be regarded as ineligible under REPS.</P>
    <P>Measure 11 &mdash; Keeping of Farm and Environmental records</P>
    <P>Under the revised measure farmers are required to keep records up to date and to retain these for inspection by an authorised person. Heretofore farmers were required to submit completed record sheets at the end of the recording year that is when claiming a second or subsequent payment.</P>
    <P>Supplementary Measure 2 &mdash; Degraded Areas</P>
    <P>This measure has been revised to include the amendment to the measure approved by the Commission (see point 3).</P>
    <P>Supplementary Measure 3 &mdash; Rearing of local breeds in danger of extinction</P>
    <P>This measure has been revised to include the Connemara Pony and Galway Sheep breeds which was approved by the Commission in late 1995.  The Irish Feral goat has been deleted from this measure.</P>
    <P>Supplementary Measure 4 &mdash; Long-term setaside of riparian zones</P>
    <P>The revised measure provides for the inclusion of &ldquo;other important salmonid rivers&rdquo;.  This provision was approved by the Commission in late 1995.  Planning agencies are required to establish from the fisheries boards as to which additional rivers can be included in this measure.  A further revision of this measure provides for payment of the relevant amount at the end of the recording year rather than up front as previously applied.</P>
    <P>9.  October 1996 &mdash; Revised NHA Conditions</P>
    <P>These guidelines for the REPS farmers in the Blanket Bog, Heath and Upland Grassland Natural Heritage Areas were introduced following consultations with the then Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Teagasc, farming and environmental interests.</P>
    <P>10.  February 1997 &mdash; Revised REP Scheme Document</P>
    <P>The scheme document, which sets out the detailed legal rules for the application of REPS, <Col N="1226" /> was revised in the light of experience and for the purposes of giving effect to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 746/96 on the operation of agri-environmental programmes.</P>
    <P>The principal changes in the document were as follows:</P>
    <P>(a) Payments and Penalties: A rule was introduced which required the payment of interest on moneys being sought by the Department as a result of non-compliance.</P>
    <P>(b) Transfer of Lands: Where lands included in a REPS plan are transferred by the scheme participant then a reimbursement of moneys already paid on such lands was required unless</P>
    <P>&mdash; the lands are transferred to another REPS participant;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the lands are afforested as part of an approved forestry planting programme;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the lands have been the subject of a compulsory land purchase order;</P>
    <P Just="Center">or</P>
    <P>&mdash; the lands have been farmed by a farmer who is ceasing to farm, has already completed three years in the scheme and is unable to find someone to take over the REPS obligations.</P>
    <P>(c) Abuse of Animal Remedies Act: Any farmer convicted of an offence under the Animal Remedies Act, 1993, or related orders shall be excluded from participation in REPS for a minimum of two years and will be required to refund, to the Department, moneys already paid under the scheme.</P>
    <P>(d) <i>Force Majeure:</i> If a participant farmer is unable to meet the planned undertaking for reasons beyond his-her control he-she may make a case to the Department for <i>force majeure</i> to be applied.  Following the receipt of such a case the Department shall indicate if the case for <i>force majeure</i> can be accepted.</P>
    <P>11.  April 1997 &mdash; Procedures manual</P>
    <P>As a result of audit and control requirements, a detailed manual covering administrative procedures to be followed for REPS applications was issued to relevant Department personnel.</P>
    <P>12.  April 1997 &mdash; new payment arrangements</P>
    <P>As a result of improvements in information technology, a more efficient, speedier payment system was implemented for REPS participants.</P>
    <P>13.  July 1997 &mdash; Revision of REPS plans</P>
    <P>As a result of audit and control requirements, an improved system for checking revisions of REPS plans was introduced which involved the provision of a detailed report from the planner in each case as to why the revision was necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> 14.  September 1997 &mdash; Additional Lands in REPS</P>
    <P>As a result of an amendment to the detailed rules, new procedures were introduced which enabled farmers to receive payment on additional lands included in REPS subsequent to joining the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 225, 226, 227, 234 and 262 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, my Department in conjunction with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands agreed a package of measures with the farm bodies to provide compensation for farmers who have lands designated as special ares of conservation.  Compensation will be available either through a national scheme operated through the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands or by way of an <Col N="1228" /> enhanced REP scheme subject to the agreement of the European Commission.</P>
    <P>At present my Department is in negotiation with the Commission on the proposed REPS changes to apply to commonages in SACs and overgrazed areas.  The proposals involve the justification of payment levels on a cost basis for each measure on both commonage and private land whether leased or owned.  They also include measures to ensure that designated overgrazed commonages will have environmentally sustainable stocking levels to ensure the regeneration of vegetation.  The payment package sought includes an appropriate element for destocking.</P>
    <P>The question of cross-compliance between the ewe premium sheep headage schemes and agri-environmental schemes for certain sheep producers is being considered in the context of the negotiations with the European Commission on an enhanced REPS package for the areas concerned. Those negotiations are ongoing and no decision therefore has yet been taken on the question of cross-compliance for 1998.</P>
    <P>In relation to the 89 farmers who included leased commonage in their REPS plans, the position is that over a year and a half ago my Department received a significant number of REPS applications, which included high proportions of leased commonage lands.  Some of these applications were in respect of lands which were entirely of leased commonage.</P>
    <P>In order to safeguard the financial interests of the Exchequer and the European Union these applications had to be assessed thoroughly to ensure they were genuine and complied with the terms and conditions of the REP scheme.  This involved consultation with the Attorney General's Office and the European Commission.  This process has now been completed and my Department is in the process of implementing the outcome. This will be completed as quickly as possible but will take a number of weeks as it must be done on a case by case basis.</P>

      <P>Over £57.5 million has been paid out under 1997 disadvantaged areas headage schemes to date representing just over 50 per cent of all applications received under these schemes.  The position with regard to County Mayo is that over £6 million has been paid to some 46 per cent of applicants.</P>
      <P>In view of the very severe harvest conditions which affected some parts of the country, priority was accorded to making payments under the arable aid scheme and 98 per cent of applicants under this scheme have been paid £88.7 million.</P>

      <P>The operation of the stabiliser co-efficient in the calculation mechanism of the ewe premium was part of a package agreed by the Council of Ministers which set the ewe premium quota levels in 1992.  The co-efficient of 7 per cent was a compromise figure agreed at that time.  My Department has suggested to the EU Commission on a number of occasions since then that this co-efficient should be reduced.  However, in view of the fact that this was only one element of the overall compromise, it would not be possible to secure a change in the co-efficient without some corresponding impact on the other elements of the regime.  It is important to recall, for example, that the rural world premium was introduced in 1992 to compensate for the negative effects of the stabilizer in the less favoured regions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 and 250 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the question of export refunds in the beef sector.</P>
      <P>The level of export refunds, which is the responsibiity of the European Commission, acting either on its own initiative or through the beef management committee, depends on a number of factors, such as price developments in third country markets, US dollar movements and particularly the level of applications for export licences relative to the WTO ceiling on subsidised exports. Most of the reductions in export refunds in the past year were designed to reduce applications for export licences to the level of the WTO ceiling. I have made strong representations to the Commission over the past number of months about the disproportionate effect of refund reductions on steer prices in Ireland and I am pleased that, in the case of the two most recent reductions, the Commission has applied a much smaller reduction to refunds on beef from male cattle than to refunds on beef from female cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the next six month period, the position is that the Commission proposes to extend, with effect from mid-January 1998, the special export refund system to cover male forequarter beef in addition to male hindquarter beef with a view to enabling them to target any necessary cuts in refunds more selectively on beef from female cattle.  In view of the fact that the vast bulk of our beef exports to third countries consists of <Col N="1233" /> steer beef, this approach should help to minimise the effect of any refund cuts on steer prices in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As far as a national quota for the allocation of export licences is concerned, the position is that such an approach is not legally permissible in view of ruling of the European Court of Justice in Case No. 51/87.  In any event, I believe that the approach I have outlined is more likely to protect the interests of Irish producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of finished cattle next spring will be determined by the market conditions prevailing at the time.  At present, the market prospects for the spring are reasonably favourable because of the continuing recovery in beef consumption in the EU and the decline in production arising from the implementation of the calf slaughtering measures which were adopted by the Agriculture Council in November 1996.  Nevertheless, the WTO ceiling on subsidised beef exports will continue to act as a serious constraint on the market.  In addition, the European Commission <Col N="1234" /> has indicated its intention, from the beginning of 1998, to minimise the use of intervention purchasing as a market support and to commence the disposal of intervention stocks.  In view of the many factors involved, it is not possible therefore at this stage to predict with any degree of accuracy the likely price levels six months hence.</P>

      <Quest>the number of animals applied for, to date, under the ten month special beef premium scheme; his views on the possibility of Ireland exceeding its 1997 special beef premium quota; the implications, if any, for farmers in this regard; and the advice, if any, he has for producers in this regard.</Quest>

      <P>The total number of animals recorded by my Department as being applied upon to-date in 1997 in respect of ten month special beef premium is some 734,000 head.  As the quota for 1997 is 1,002,458 quota rights, the balance remaining up to 5 December next, (when applications close for the year) is some 268,000 quota rights.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that 620,000 male calves are registered as having been born between 1 January 1997 and 5 April 1997, and thus eligible for submission for the ten month special beef premium in 1997, there is a possibility that the quota will be exceeded in 1997.  The implications are a reduction in payments to all applicants who have submitted any claims for special beef premium, both for ten and 22 month instalments, by the percentage by which the quota is exceeded. Extensification premia payments, where due, will attract a similar reduction.  In addition, balancing payments for both ten and 22 month premia may only issue after the finalisation of all 1997 ten month applications.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for me to advise producers regarding the appropriate course of action which, of course, will vary with their individual circumstances.</P>

      <P>Therefore, I have decided to establish a consultative group, comprising representatives of the various interests involved in the beef sector, to advise me on the most appropriate approach to the Commission's proposals.</P>
      <P>However, I have already indicated that I am not satisfied with the Commission's proposals, as they now stand.  Among my concerns is the fact that they do not provide full compensation for Irish beef producers.</P>

The formulation of a proposal which would allay the concerns of the Egyptian authorities necessitated a technical assessment of quarantine and slaughtering facilities in Egypt.  This was completed last week and a proposal is now being finalised by my Department in conjunction with the Irish Livestock Exporters Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The traditional price differential between cattle prices in Ireland and other member states has widened in the last 18 months because of a number of factors such as the renationalisation of the European beef market following the BSE scare of March 1996 and the disproportionate impact of cuts in export refunds on cattle prices, particularly steer prices, in Ireland.  As far as the renationalisation of the EU market is concerned, An Bord Bia is continuing to promote Irish beef as a quality product on the European market and I am hopeful that this promotion, combined with a reduction in beef production within the EU in 1998 as a result of the calf slaughtering measures, should result in increased penetration of the EU market by Irish beef exporters next year.  This should help to narrow the gap between prices in Ireland and those in other member states.</P>
      <P>With regard to export refunds, the EU Commission is proposing to introduce measures to enable them more selectively to target any necessary cuts in export refunds arising from GATT limitations on beef from female cattle and thereby protect, in so far as possible, export refunds on beef from male cattle.  In view of the fact that the vast bulk of Irish beef exports to third countries consists of beef from male animals, this approach should help to minimise the effects of cuts in export refunds on Irish cattle prices and assist in the process of convergence between Irish cattle prices and those in other European member states.</P>

      <P>My Department published <i>EMU and the euro: Ireland's National Changeover Plan</i> in May this year.  The plan states that assuming that the European Council confirms in 1998 that Ireland fulfils the necessary conditions for adoption of the euro, a currency changeover board will be established after the European Council's decision in order to oversee the detailed implementation of the changeover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April this year, the Government decided that the maximum staffing level of the board should be 20.  My Department established a euro changeover team in June, <i>inter alia,</i> to prepare <Col N="1253" /> the ground for the board.  Seven staff are on the team at present.</P>
    <P>The changeover timetable agreed by the European Council in December 1995 envisages that the changeover to the euro in member states participating in EMU will have been completed by 1 July 2002 at the latest.  The Currency Changeover Board will be dissolved on completion of the changeover in Ireland.  It is expected that the board's full complement of staff will be in place shortly after the European Council's decision, which is expected in early May 1998.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, preparation of the Irish economy, including the public administration, for the changeover is already well under way.  I am satisfied that the arrangements which have already been put in place, combined with the setting up of the Currency Changeover Board with a maximum staffing level of 20 in line with the Government decision, will be adequate to provide for a smooth and orderly changeover to the euro.</P>

      <P>The moneys paid from the Exchequer in respect of equal treatment arrears amounted to approximately £194.6 million in 1995, £57.5 million in 1996 and £10.7 million in 1997.  It is anticipated that the last, small remaining payments in respect of the equal treatment arrears will be made by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in 1998.</P>
      <P>Following a High Court decision in 1995 on the question of equal treatment, the then Government decided that, in addition to a sum of £60 million provided in the budget of 1995 towards the costs of the equal treatment arrears, there would be a disposal of assets.  This decision was taken to ensure that the remaining costs could be met in a timely way, while remaining within the budgetary targets.  It was decided to raise additional money through securitisation of part of the receipts arising from local authority mortgages. In essence, the stream of income due from housing loans which were made by the local authorities, with finance borrowed from the local loans fund, was sold for an up-front capital payment. To facilitate this arrangement, the Securitisation (Proceeds of Certain Mortgages) Act, 1995 was enacted in that year.  The National Treasury Management Agency developed and oversaw the arrangements for the securitisation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The securitisation arrangement realised payments to the Exchequer in 1995 of £139.3 million and of £49.5 million in 1996.  These moneys made <Col N="1254" /> a significant contribution to meeting the costs arising in respect of equal treatment arrears.  The balance of financial provision in respect of equal treatment payments was provided in the context of the Estimates process for the years in question.</P>
    <P>In summary, approximately £262.8 million has been provided in respect of equal treatment arrears up to the end of 1997, and the process of securitisation has yielded approximately £188.8 million towards meeting that cost, with the balance provided in the normal budgetary context.</P>

      <P>In June 1996, the Government set core staffing targets for civil servants in each Department, which were to be achieved by 1 July 1997.  Some of these targets were subsequently modified by the Government to make allowance for additional work or transfer of work from one Department to another.</P>
      <P>This Government has been continuing the same approach.  On 1 July 1997, the number of civil servants was 28,955, well within the target of 29,458.</P>
      <P>When making Civil Service appointments, Departments and offices are required to maintain overall numbers employed within these targets, except in circumstances where the Government may decide to modify them for compelling social or economic reasons, such as the extra staffing required for new prisons.</P>
      <P>In relation to the wider public service, it is Government policy to contain public service numbers.  Under this policy, the Government will agree to increases only where there is a compelling social or economic case for doing so.  The Government aims to reduce numbers where this is feasible.</P>

      <P>Agreements under the local bargaining provisions of <Col N="1257" /> the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> in respect of the groups mentioned by the Deputy tended to be very complex and to differ widely in their structure.  Among the elements which were included in different agreements were salary increases, which varied depending on an individual's length of service and in some cases were confined to serving staff and did not apply to new recruits, selective up-gradings and promotions for a limited proportion of a grade, and non-pay items such as enhanced early retirement provisions and the reckonability in future of certain payments for pension purposes.  As a result of the complexity of the settlements, it would not be possible to express, in a meaningful way, the value of the settlements in terms of the percentage payments being made to serving staff.</P>
      <P>I assume, however, that the Deputy's main concern relates to the impact on pensioners of the decision which I announced on 4 November 1997. As I explained at the time, the effect of the Government's decision is that public servants who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring deals under the PCW will benefit from those deals on a parity basis subject to a minimum increase of 3 per cent or 2 per cent in the case of any pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, pensioners will in general get the same percentage increase as applied to the salaries of staff serving in the grade and on the scale point from which the pensioners retired.  Traditional parity meant that pensioners could not benefit from some of the elements included in a number of deals, such as new allowances, personal long-service increments and higher scales which applied to limited numbers of staff. However, in order to protect those retired public servants who would have received less than 3 per cent had parity been applied in the normal way, the Government decided, as a once-off measure, that pensioners should be guaranteed a minimum increase of 3 per cent or 2 per cent in the case of any pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent.  The decision on pension increases reflected the position put forward by the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and has, I understand, been welcomed by them.</P>

      <P>The interest rate at which the Exchequer can borrow depends on market conditions on the date the borrowing takes place and on the particular borrowing instrument used.  A range of borrowing instruments are used by the Exchequer and different interest rates may apply to each instrument depending on its particular features of which the most important are the period of time for which money is borrowed and whether the interest rate is fixed or floating.  Against this background, it is not possible to quote a single interest rate at which the Exchequer can borrow funds.  However, the following are examples of current interest rates which are representative of those which the Exchequer might obtain on any borrowing at present:</P>

      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 for use in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board. The position is that it is not intended to amend the operation of the drugs refund scheme in its current form having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. <Col N="1261" /> Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.  They pay that amount to their pharmacist who claims the balance from the General Medical Services (Payments) Board thus eliminating the question of a waiting period for patients under the drugs refund scheme.</P>
    <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain specified illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a particular illness.  The illnesses covered under this scheme are: mental handicap; mental illness, (for persons under 16 only); phenylketonuria; cystic fibrosis; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; diabetes mellitis; diabetes insipidus; haemophilia; cerebral palsy; epilepsy; multiple sclerosis; muscular dystrophies; parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of on-going expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>Persons who are prescribed one or more of the medicines listed under the high tech medicinal products scheme receive these medicines having regard to the terms and conditions governing their current eligibility status i.e. persons who hold a medical card receive their high tech medication free of charge.  Persons who hold a long-term illness card are supplied with their high tech medication free of charge, where it is prescribed for the treatment of the primary condition included on the long-term illness scheme.</P>
    <P>Persons who do not qualify for either a medical card or a long-term illness card and are prescribed high tech medication, will qualify for a drug cost subsidisation scheme card.  Such persons will not, therefore, have to pay more than £32 per month to their community pharmacist.</P>

      <P>The question of the provision of escorts in certain circumstances on transport used by children and adults with disabilities to attend health funded services has been raised with my Department by statutory and voluntary service providers. Arrangements for the provision of escorts have been made in particular circumstances by the relevant service providers who continue to monitor the needs of the clients using their transport services and to endeavour to meet those needs from the resources, both new and existing, which are available to them.  When new clients are being placed in services, the transport arrangements to enable them to attend these services, including the provision of escorts where necessary, are taken into account.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, he/she may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In all circumstances I do not think that it is justifiable to extend automatic entitlement to a medical card to the group indicated in the question.</P>
      <P>Under the long-term illness scheme operated by health boards, children and adults suffering from mental handicap, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophies can obtain without charge the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition. In addition children receiving treatment for mental handicap, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus and cerebral palsy are exempt from public hospital statutory charges.</P>

      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of services, the development of day services, residential and respite care services for people with a physical and sensory disability.  The process of implementing the report is under way.  As a <Col N="1264" /> first step, the boards are in the process of putting in place co-ordinating committees to examine and prioritise the future development of services at local level.</P>
      <P>As recommended by the review group report, an additional £2.188 million was built into the health board allocations in 1997 to help put existing physical and sensory disability services, including existing respite services, on a more secure financial footing.  In addition, a further £1 million revenue was provided in 1997 for priority developments mentioned in the report, of which £176,100 was used for day activity centres and respite care.  Furthermore, I recently approved a once off grant of £600,00 towards the capital costs of Donamon Castle, County Roscommon, a centre providing residential, respite and day activity services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>My Departments' Assessment of the Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997 - 2001 which is based on information from the national intellectual disability database, provides information on the current and future needs of persons with mental handicap, including the need for respite care facilities.  That assessment identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential respite places and 1.036 new day places over the next five years.  Additional funding of £12 million was made available in 1997 to begin the process of meeting these needs.</P>
      <P>The development of respite services for people with disabilities will be a priority in 1998 and will be done in the context of additional funding available in 1998.</P>

      <P>The Adoption Act, 1991 imposed a statutory duty on health boards to carry out, as soon as practicable, assessments for foreign adoptions.

      <P>Comprehensive control procedures exist for claims under supplementary welfare allowance and have been considerably strengthened by the recent introduction of comprehensive information systems.  Reviews are carried out by health boards in the various regions, on an on-going basis and, in addition, the SWA accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>The controls are typically organised on the following basis across the health boards, although some differences may exist between boards.  At the commencement of new claims, all relevant documentation used in the assessment of the entitlement is viewed by the superintendent community welfare officer in each community care area, including proof of identity, RSI number, family composition and dates of birth, and the reasons for the claim are examined.  Subsequently all claims are reviewed on a periodic basis.</P>
      <P>Supplements are reviewed by means of documentary evidence submitted by the client to the community welfare officer and home visits are conducted as appropriate.  Further weekly reviews are carried out by each superintendent community welfare officer via payment reports received from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the SWA is a very important scheme and makes provision for people who have little or no means or are awaiting clearance in relation to other schemes. A particular benefit of the supplementary welfare scheme is its ability to relieve urgent and often exceptional need.  In this regard, the administration of the scheme depends upon the personal relationship between the community welfare officer and the client and the essential integrity and confidentiality of this relationship.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the proposed one-year full-time degree course for student nurses participating in the first general nursing registration-diploma programme which commenced in 1994 at University Hospital Galway in association with University College Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> Successful completion by the students of the three-year registration-diploma programme leads to registration as general nurses with An Bord Altranais, at which point they will become eligible for employment.  As a degree in nursing is not a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, the particular one-year degree course proposed by University College Galway would essentially be an additional course leading to an optional post-registration qualification. Students wishing to undertake the degree course would, therefore, have to meet the costs involved themselves.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the specific programme which the students entered in 1994 is currently the subject of an independent external evaluation being undertaken by a team from the School of Education and Nursing, University of Southampton, under the management of the Institute of Public Administration.  In addition, the interim report of the Commission on Nursing has identified a number of issues relating to the registration-diploma programme generally, which the Commission is expected to address in its final report.

      <P>The maternity and infant care scheme provides for a system of combined care, whereby an expectant mother is under the care of both her general practitioner and her hospital obstetrician, <Col N="1271" /> and her care is shared between the two.  In 1995, 29,922 women availed of this scheme, which is available to women throughout the country, irrespective of area of residence.</P>
      <P>In addition, in each maternity hospital and maternity unit throughout the country, the services of relevant medical and nursing personnel are available to any woman who requires maternity care.  These include obstetricians, neo natal paediatricians, midwives and other hospital personnel.</P>
      <P>In Limerick Regional Maternity Hospital, maternity care is provided through five obstetricians and nursing and midwifery personnel.  In addition, neo-natal care is provided through a consultant paediatrician and three visiting consultants.</P>
      <P>The number of births in the hospital in 1996 was 3,708 and the recommended norm for consultant staff to births is one consultant obstetrician per 750 to 1,000 births, in medium and large maternity units.  On this basis, Limerick Regional Maternity Hospital has an adequate level of consultants in obstetrics and no proposals have been submitted, to my Department, by the Mid-Western Health Board, to increase the number of obstetricians at the hospital.</P>
      <P>As regards outcomes of pregnancy, the 1996 peri-natal mortality rate at the hospital was 5.38 per 1,000 births, compared with recent annual national figures of around 9 per 1,000.  There were no maternal deaths at the hospital last year.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of a serious problem evolving in the maternity services but I will, of course, continue to keep this matter under review, in the context of the ongoing maintenance and development of the hospital system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 303 and 306 together.</P>
      <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, which serves as the national referral centre for paediatric heart disease, has experienced an increase in the number of children awaiting cardio-thoracic surgery within the last year.  This additional demand has resulted in extra pressure on the service and an increased waiting time for some patients.</P>
      <P>The increased pressure in cardiac services has been the subject of ongoing discussions between my Department and the hospital for some time. The reasons for this increased pressure have been identified as the lack of theatre space and ICU beds, shortage of ICU trained nurses and the advances in surgical and interventional techniques which have resulted in increased demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1997 my Department invited proposals from the hospital for the spending of £500,000 to be made available from the 1997 waiting list initiative to alleviate the pressures on this specialty.  Proposals submitted by the hospital were accepted by my Department and funding was provided to support them.  The hospital recently forwarded a progress report on the initiative which stated: since the appointment of a locum consultant paediatrician the hospital has experienced an increase in its cardiology out patient department's activity and in the number of echocardiograms performed.  The combination of both these factors will result in an additional 545 procedures being carried out in 1997; building works on four additional ICU beds commenced in July and it is expected that these works will be completed shortly; an additional training programme for ICU nurses commenced in September <Col N="1273" /> and six candidates have been selected for participation.</P>
    <P>A Project Team - consisting of officials from my Department and hospital representatives - is currently working on a development plan for the provision of additional theatres at the hospital.  I have asked that this work be concluded as a matter of urgency so that the hospital can proceed to the next stage of this very important development.</P>
    <P>The question of additional consultant manpower is being considered in the context of the current review of the further development of cardiac services generally.</P>
    <P>I am confident that all of these initiatives will have a positive impact on the service levels of this speciality in the near future.</P>

      <P>The present number of beds at St. Luke's and St. Anne's hospitals is as follows: St. Luke's 100; St. Anne's 59.  It should be noted that within the total number of beds at St. Anne's, there are 17 beds which are not accessible by lift and are therefore only available for patients who are mobile enough to use the stairs.</P>
      <P>My Department is presently involved in a major re-development at St. Luke's Hospital which, when completed, will see St. Luke's and St. Anne's hospitals amalgamating.  This re-development, which has the full support of all interests represented on the board of the hospitals, involves the complete upgrading of accommodation throughout the hospital and the provision of new radiotherapy equipment.  As part of the development, St. Anne's Hospital will close and with the transfer of beds from St. Anne's, a total of 144 beds will be available at the new St. Luke's Hospital including day beds and hostel places.  These beds will be situated in an environment providing all normal modern hospital facilities, e.g. piped medical gases, nurse call system, patient amenities such as radio and T.V. and easy access to all areas of the hospital. The hostel, which will have 20 beds available, will be specifically designed to support patients from outside Dublin in need of overnight accommodation while attending for therapy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The re-development is at an advanced stage and when completed will have cost approximately £20 million.  The concentration of all facilities on one site will enable patients from across the country <Col N="1274" /> to benefit from the modern radiotherapy treatment facilities being installed at St. Luke's as part of the re-development and will ensure the delivery of quality oncology services by St. Luke's as the national tertiary referral centre.</P>
    <P>The hospital have assured me that any patients who would otherwise have been treated at St. Anne's will be admitted to St. Luke's following the closure of St. Anne's.  All the arrangements necessary are being put in place to ensure continuity of care for patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Very considerable progress has been made in the implementation of the substantive recommendations of the Kilkenny <Col N="1275" /> incest investigation that relate to the health services. The central recommendation, i.e. that the Child Care Act, 1991 be implemented in full, has been achieved.  Since 1993, in the region of £40 million on an annualised basis has been invested in developing an infrastructure to support the Act.  Among the other main recommendations of the report relating to the health services and implemented to date are: the introduction of a new procedure for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between health boards and gardaí; revised internal health board procedures for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse; revised Medical Council guidelines on medical confidentiality in so far as it relates to child abuse; development of treatment services for children affected by abuse; expansion of community-based preventative and family support services, such as resource centres, homemakers, and community mothers schemes.</P>
      <P>Of the remaining substantive recommendations of the report that come within my Department's area of responsibility, the most important relate to mandatory reporting, revised child abuse guidelines, and standardised child abuse registers.</P>
      <P>As I explained to the House on 9 October last, my focus in the area of the reporting of child abuse will be to improve the reporting of abuse, rather than a narrow focus on legislative change. I therefore envisage that agreed protocols on reporting of child abuse will be put in place by professionals, who of course already have a duty of care to their clients.  I also intend to continue to progress the initiatives to strengthen arrangements for reporting child abuse and to generally promote and protect the rights of children that were announced following the consultation process on mandatory reporting held in 1996.</P>
      <P>A working group will be established to review the child abuse guidelines issued by the Department of Health in 1987 in the context of the agreed protocols for professionals already mentioned.</P>
      <P>In relation to the child abuse registers, health boards currently maintain lists of suspected and confirmed cases of child abuse in accordance with the 1987 child abuse guidelines.  Their purpose is to monitor and follow-up on reported cases of children at risk and to provide data for research and planning.  When families with children who are considered to be at risk change residence and move to another health board area, the information on the list is passed on to the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>The report of the Kilkenny incest investigation acknolwedged current practice in this regard and recommended the standardisation of child abuse registers and the introduction of certain safeguards into the system.  An examination of the current system of child abuse registers will be undertaken in the light of issues that arise in the review of the child abuse guidelines.</P>

      <P>There are a number of proposals for the refurbishment of local authority swimming pools awaiting sanction in my Department.  The proposals are at various stages of planning.  Having regard to the high <Col N="1278" /> level of demand for swimming pool proposals generally, it is not possible to say when approval for any of these proposals will issue.  The detailed information requested by the Deputy in relation to the individual projects is set out in the following schedule.</P>
      <P>There is a provision of £3.5 million in my Department's Vote for 1997 for the construction and refurbishment of swimming pools.  This funding is committed to projects under construction or fully approved and on which work will shortly commence.</P>
      <P>Each proposal for grant aid is examined with regard to need, cost, viability, construction and operational standards and availability of funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 314, 315 and 316 together.</P>
      <P>I have asked my Department to prepare a national policy position on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms.  This process will include widespread consultation with the public and the biotechnology industry in this country.</P>
      <P>The Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations, 1994 (S.I. No. 345 of 1994), for which the Environmental Protection Agency is the competent authority, define the procedures under which the use of genetically modified organisms in the State are regulated.  The Regulations transpose EU Directives 90/219/EEC (on the contained use of genetically modified microorganisms) and 90/220/EEC (on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms to the environment) into national law.</P>
      <P>In the case of proposed contained uses of genetically modified organisms in this country, prior consent under the 1994 Regulations must be sought from the EPA.  In the case of proposed deliberate releases of genetically modified organisms within the EU, prior consent under Directive 90/220/EEC must be sought from the competent authority of a member state.  A consent under the provisions of Directive 90/220/EEC applies throughout the European Union.</P>
      <P>The notification and consent requirements provided for in the 1994 regulations, for both contained use and deliberate release of genetically modified organisms, are comprehensive, and I am not aware of the existence in this country of genetically modified animals other than mice used in contained conditions in a number of universities.</P>
      <P>The suspension of work in regard to the particular aspects of genetic engineering which comes under my responsibility would not be consistent with Community legislation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 and 327 together.</P>
      <P>The adoption and implementation of a waste plan or a special waste plan by a local authority are matters for the local authority concerned under the European Communities (Waste) Regulations 1979 and the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regualtions 1982. I understand that all relevant local authorities have adopted such plans.  Information in relation to the dates of adoption is set out in the following table.  I have no function with regard to determining the validity of such plans.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Waste Management Act, 1996 provides for the revocation of the above mentioned regulations.  Waste plans and special waste plans made under the regulations will in due course be superseded by waste management plans and a national hazardous waste management plan to be made under Part II of the Act.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to disability allowance is that a person, by reason of a specified disability, is substantially handicapped in undertaking suitable employment having regard to age, experience and qualifications.  A specified disability is defined in regulations to mean an injury, disease, congenital deformity or physical or mental illness or defect which has continued or may reasonably be expected to continue for a period of a year at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being substantially handicapped would mean that the person's capacity to undertake or carry out the employment would be substantially less than that of a person without the disability in question.  In all cases an assessment is made by the Department's medical assessor of the evidence <Col N="1292" /> submitted by the person's doctor, supplemented if necessary by a separate medical examination to determine the nature and extent of the disability and its effect on the person's capacity to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 334, 337, 341 and 342 together.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputies arise from the introduction of class A PRSI for community employment workers, which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996.  Class A PRSI provides cover for the full range of benefits and pensions available under the social insurance system including, for example, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, maternity benefit, retirement pension, old age contributory pension, widow's contributory pension, treatment - dental and optical benefits and occupational injuries benefit. The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit, their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether they they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them. However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit, in accordance with Article 35(b)(1) of SI 417/94.  The purpose of this article is to ensure that where a claimant has secured entitlement to a benefit payment on the basis of his-her social insurance contributions, the cost arising from that entitlement is met by the social insurance fund.</P>
      <P>The social welfare secondary benefits of the Christmas bonus, free fuel allowance and butter vouchers are payable only with long-term social welfare payments.  Unemployment benefit claimants do not, therefore, have an entitlement to these benefits.  While I recognise the difficulties faced by CE workers who re-qualify for unemployment benefit when their period of CE finishes, I trust the Deputies will appreciate that I cannot introduce special concessionary arrangements for such people without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients.  Any such concessions would, accordingly, carry an extremely high cost and could be considered only in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 24 May 1995 and her claim was disallowed by a deciding officer <Col N="1294" /> on the grounds that she had not sustained a substantial loss of employment, which is a condition of entitlement to unemployment benefit.  She appealed against this decision and her appeal was considered by appeals officer, who upheld the original decision.  The appeals officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence. The person concerned has not submitted any new evidence or facts which would warrant a revision of the decision in her case.</P>

      <Quest>if he will review the rule whereby a person, who is aged over 22 and is in full-time study, will disqualify a pensioner parent from receipt of the free schemes when living with them, in view of the fact that it is his Department's active policy to promote second chance education by mature students.</Quest>

      <P>The free schemes of free electricity allowance, free colour television licence and free telephone rental allowance are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the condition.  In addition, widows and widowers between the age of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had entitlement to the free schemes, retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last June the qualifying conditions for the free electricity allowance and free telephone rental allowance were brought into closer alignment. Previously the free telephone rental allowance was payable if the recipient resided with dependent children aged under 18 years.  That age limit <Col N="1295" /> was extended to 22 years for children who are in full-time education.  This change put the allowance on a par with the rules applying to the free electricity allowance.</P>
    <P>My Department's back-to-education programmes provide a range of incentives to encourage persons in receipt of income supports to pursue courses of education.  The programmes include the retention of social welfare payments, the second level allowance and the third level allowance.</P>
    <P>The second and third level allowances are educational opportunities schemes which are designed to encourage unemployed people to return to full-time education in order to enhance their employment prospects.</P>
    <P>However, the question of extending the age limit for full-time students beyond the age of 22, for the purposes of retaining entitlement to the free schemes, would have cost implications which would have to be considered in the light of the resources available.</P>

      <P>The statutory agencies operating under the aegis of my Department are the Combat Poverty Agency, the Pensions Board and the National Social Service Board.  Each of these agencies is required, by law, to prepare an annual report and financial accounts for each financial year to the Minister.  The financial accounts must be certified by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
      <P>The governing legislation also requires that both the annual report and audited accounts for each agency must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the case of the Combat Poverty Agency, a report of the agency's strategic plans must also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual report and audited accounts for the financial year 1996 for both the Combat Poverty <Col N="1296" /> Agency and the Pensions Board were published in July 1997.  The annual report and financial accounts for the National Social Services Board for the financial year 1995 were published last year.</P>
    <P>Board members of the agencies concerned are fully aware of the statutory requirements relating to disclosure of interests to the board of the relevant agency.  The public does not have a right to see a register of members' interests in relation to each agency.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice of any of the agencies to allow members of the public to attend board meetings.  Board papers or minutes are not made available to members of the public.</P>
    <P>The legislation governing each agency requires them to furnish to the Minister such information relating to its activities, other than those concerning day-to-day matters, as the Minister from time to time may request.</P>
    <P>With regard to the publication of advice, the National Social Services Board, has as one of its statutory functions, the provision of information and advice on social services to members of the public.  The Pensions Board has a function to issue guidelines or guidance notes on the operation of the Pensions Act 1990.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency publishes various reports and research documents in fulfilling its remit to promote greater public understanding of the nature and extent of poverty in the State.</P>

      <P>Section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994 provides for the establishment of a record of monuments and places (RMP).  The RMP is being implemented on a county to county basis.  The programme of implementation is well advanced and it is anticipated that nationwide coverage will be achieved in 1998.  In giving effect to section 12 of the Act, comprehensive legal protection is for the first time being extended to all recorded monuments.  Inclusion in the RMP imposes a requirement on any persons carrying out works, which have the potential to impinge on a monument site, to give my Department two months notice of their intentions.</P>
      <P>The RMP for each county consists of a large set of annotated six inch Ordnance Survey constraint maps, together with an accompanying index. Some 150,000 monuments and places will eventually be recorded in his manner.  Because of the sheer physical size of the RMP the Deputy will appreciate that it would be impracticable to provide the listing sought.</P>
      <P>Copies of the RMP, as they become available, are publicly exhibited at various venues in each county, such as the local authority, Teagasc and Farm Development Service offices, and throughout the County Library Services.</P>
      <P>The National Monuments and Historic Properties Service of my Department maintains a long established system of liaison with local authorities and other State and semi-State agencies concerned with planning and development issues.  All local authorities have been advised of the implementation of the RMP and as each county record is brought into effect, further consultations are arranged on an individual basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 349, 350 and 351 together.</P>
      <P>Under the EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), member states must protect their most important natural areas by designating them as special areas of conservation (SACs).  The Directive identifies raised bogs as priority habitats and requires that they be given the highest level of protection.</P>
      <P>In the context of Partnership 2000, it was agreed that a fair and proper level of compensation shall be paid having regard to the level and extent of restrictions and all reasonable losses arising as a result of SAC designation, and to the difference between the value pre-designation for environmental purposes and subsequent value of the land consequent on designation for environmental purposes and subsequent value of the land consequent on designation as an SAC.</P>
      <P>There are some 200,000 ha of blanket bogs proposed for SAC status and the objective is to phase out turf cutting over five to ten years, although on sensitive or ecologically important areas a shorter time frame may apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Raised bogs are very much rarer both in Ireland and in Europe.  Some 8,000 ha are being <Col N="1301" /> proposed for inclusion in SACs in Ireland.  The imperative to take prompt action is very much more pressing in the case of raised bogs, therefore, and, consequently, it is intended that turf cutting should cease in these particular areas.</P>
    <P>I have established a working group consisting of representatives of my Department's national parks and wildlife service (NPWS), the farming organisations and non-farming turf cutters to consider the elements that might form part of a package under which the cessation of turf cutting might be agreed.</P>
    <P>The package of measures being considered in this context includes relocation to alternative bogs, outright purchase by the NPWS of bog plots and direct cash compensation or compensation in kind.  For some individuals, a combination of parts of various elements will be the most suitable option and my Department will be as flexible as possible in trying to meet the needs of those affected.</P>
    <P>As with all SAC restrictions, those who are not satisfied with offers of compensation for ceasing turf cutting will be able to refer the matter to independent arbitration.</P>

      <P>Following receipt of tenders by the waterways service for the preliminary investigations forming part of the environmental impact study (EIS) on this project, it was decided to carry out further design work in order to give a more accurate estimate of the physical works and costs involved before proceeding to EIS and economic analysis.  When this information is available a decision will be made concerning the next phase of the process which will encompass a detailed design.  The decision will depend on the costs identified and the availability of funding to carry out the whole project.  It would be unwise to commit the limited resources available to expensive studies unless the estimated costs of the project are such that there is a realistic chance of obtaining funding.</P>
      <P>There is no allocation for the construction of this project in the current tranche of European Regional Development Fund funding for 1994-99. Decisions on the next round have not yet been made.  It is not possible at this time to say when the scheme might go to tender or construction.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 353 and 354 together.</P>
      <P>The Garden of Remembrance is dedicated to all those who gave their lives in the cause of Irish freedom.  The garden is reserved exclusively for formal State ceremonials connected with this dedication.  It is considered that the commercial basis of the proposed art display is at variance with the ethos of the garden and the tranquil amenity of the memorial may well be diminished by the presence of such displays.</P>
      <P>I am sure that Deputies can appreciate that the Garden of Remembrance is a national monument with a singular commemorative significance and purpose - to commemorate all those who gave their lives in the cause of Irish freedom.  While it is not considered appropriate that it be used for any other purpose, I am prepared to examine the situation further with a view to arriving at a satisfactory solution.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the information requested by the Deputy is as set out in the following table.  Statistics for 1997 are not yet available but I understand that provisional figures indicate that there has been a decrease in the incidence of murder so far this year as compared to the corresponding period last year.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that some cases classed originally as murder are subsequently classified under a different heading, e.g. manslaughter, on the basis of more complete information, following direction of the law officers or as a result of court decisions.  Accordingly, it can be expected, in the light of previous experience, that a number of the cases currently classed as murder could be reclassified, at a later stage, under a different heading.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works have been requested by my Department to acquire a suitable site in Leixlip for a new Garda station.  I understand that they have identified two sites which might be suitable.  A number of approaches regarding the availability of these sites have been made to the owners and their response is awaited. It is not possible to predict at this stage if these approaches will be successful.  It has recently been learned that three further properties may be available and these will be inspected shortly.</P>
      <P>Pending the provision of a new station the existing leased accommodation occupied by the gardaí will be extended and upgraded.  Negotiations are ongoing with the owner of the premises in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the grave concern of local residents, comprising development groups and parish committees who represent parents, children and the elderly (details supplied), at the proposed erection of a 100 foot mast at the new Garda station currently under construction at Kilmacow in County Kilkenny; and if his Department will liaise with those people, who are responsible objectors and with whom there was never any consultations, in order to find a satisfactory conclusion to this development.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the local concerns in relation to the proposed Garda mast at the new Garda station in Kilmacow.  Garda technical experts have advised that the additional height requirement at Kilmacow will be necessary to ensure adequate radio coverage for a proposed new Garda digital trunked radio network and that it was because of this that the Office of Public Works was asked to make the necessary arrangements for the erection of a 100 foot mast.</P>
      <P>However, following the receipt of correspondence both in my Department and in the Office of Public Works, in which the concerns of the Kilmacow Development Group relating to the proposed mast were expressed, I asked the Garda to re-examine their requirements to see if a lower mast would be sufficient.  I am now advised by Garda management that they could live with a 50 foot mast at Kilmacow for the time-being, but that it is unlikely that a mast of this height will be sufficient to meet their longer term needs in the context of the proposed new radio network.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works was advised accordingly and I understand that it has written to the Kilmacow Residents Group and will continue to liaise with them on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that they are aware of the possibility that drugs may be moved from the Shannon estuary as far as Ballyconnell by means of cruisers, and procedures are in place to counteract such possible movement of illegal substances.</P>
      <P>Local gardaí are in continuous contact with key personnel and organisations along the route, and the gardaí are also engaged in regular patrols on an ongoing basis in these areas.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that liaison gardaí from stations along the route have been selected to liaise with householders along the shoreline and that gardaí also liaise with fishery protection officers, fishermen and persons having access to the shoreline.  Likely landing areas along the route have been identified and are being monitored with the help of community alert personnel.</P>

      <Col N="1306" /> The following specific schemes have also been put in place:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Lake Watch,</i> which operates in the vicinity of Lough Derg.  Members of the public involved in the scheme have been selected by reason of the location of their homes and their vantage points on the lake.  This has proved to be of considerable assistance to the Garda.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Shannon Watch,</i> which operates along the same lines as the one described above and covers the Shannon waterway from Shannonbridge to Rooskey.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Garda has established a study group that is looking at the feasibility of an improved police patrol arrangement on inland and coastal waters.  The study is concentrated on the three main areas: River Shannon - Shannon Erne waterway, Shannon estuary, Maritime Garda districts.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that in addition to the foregoing, anti-crime operations currently in place in the Garda western region relating to crime generally in the catchment area, also focus on Shannon crossing points.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are currently evaluating the operation of the existing rural community policing scheme and reviewing previous proposals for its extension.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise that no decisions concerning expansion of the scheme have been taken and no such decisions can be taken until proposls are received from the Garda Commissioner.  In the circumstances, any comment on my part, at this point in time, concerning expansion and development of the scheme would be pre-emptive.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out, however, that there has been some misunderstanding over the years about the objectives of the scheme.  It was never designed to close rural Garda stations.  It is actually aimed at providing a better service to the community by allowing the gardaí spend more time on active operational duties in their districts including, in particular, visits to the elderly, while at the same time providing for station opening hours which actually suit local community needs.</P>

      <P>The number of persons committed to prison for non-payment of debts in the years from 1993 to 1996 was as follows: 1993 - 234; 1994 - 240; 1995 - 220; and 1996 - 203.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that where a person is committed to prison because of failure to pay a debt that person is in fact committed for failure, through wilful default or culpable neglect, to obey an order of the court.  Before the court would make such an order, it would have to go through an extensive procedure before making an instalment order and finally a committal order sending the person to prison.  This is a mechanism for enforcing the court's instalment order.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that debtors comprise less than 0.5 per cent of the prison population on any one day.</P>
      <P>My Department is examining the question of employing options other than imprisonment in the case of fine defaulters and debtors.  It would, of course, be necessary to ensure that any alternatives to custody which might be introduced would secure compliance with court orders relating to debt.</P>

      <P>As I outlined in my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 230 of 7 October 1997, the detailed deployment of Garda personnel to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  I understand that in determining the level of resources required by each Garda division and district they take into consideration a number of factors which would affect the level of personnel required in each area.  These include crime trends, population, demographic change etc.  The Garda authorities have provided me with the information sought by the Deputy on a district basis for the three areas concerned.  These details are based on the 1991 census of population and the personnel strengths on 31-9-1997 for each of the Garda districts responsible for policing the areas in question.</P>

However, I can inform the Deputy that my Department is aware of one application in April of this year by the person concerned for a visa to visit Ireland.  Following an initial refusal, the application was reviewed at the request of the Irish referee and refused again on the basis that the supporting information was not sufficient to satisfy my Department that a visa should issue in this case.  I see no reason to alter that decision.</P>

      <P>The reply to Parliamentary Question No. 169 of 6 February 1996 referred to two members of the Garda Síochána convicted of common assault in 1991 who were allowed to continue to serve on the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in one of these cases the breach of discipline was processed in accordance with Regulation 13 of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989.  This regulation prescribes the procedure to be followed by the Garda authorities where certain breaches of discipline are admitted and the <Col N="1315" /> holding of an inquiry is, therefore, unnecessary. The penalty imposed in this case was a temporary reduction in pay.</P>
    <P>In the second case the complaint was processed under the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986.  The Garda Complaints Board referred the matter to a tribunal hearing which found the garda in breach of discipline and imposed a fine equivalent to four weeks pay.</P>

      <P>The 1996 annual reports for Bord Fáilte Éireann (BFE), CERT and Area Development Management Ltd.  (ADM) were published in September 1997, April 1997 and November 1997 respectively.  The annual accounts of these bodies which were audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General were published at the same time as their annual reports.</P>
      <P>Each of the bodies is a prescribed public body under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 and, in accordance with the Act, holders of designated directorships and of designated positions within these bodies are required to furnish statements of registrable interests to the appropriate officer in the public body and to the Public Offices Commission. While the public do not have the right to see a register of members' interests in the case of BFE, both CERT and ADM make returns of members' interests to the Companies Office where they are available for public inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual reports of BFE and CERT are submitted to Government and are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In addition, the annual reports and accounts of both bodies are subject to parliamentary scrutiny through the Public Accounts Committee.  As an independent private company, the annual report and accounts of ADM are not subject to the same scrutiny. <Col N="1325" /> In no case are members of the public allowed to attend board meetings nor are board papers and minutes available for public inspection.</P>
    <P>The bodies report directly to my Department which monitors their respective performance against policy objectives, which I set, from time to time, on behalf of the Government, including overall expenditure from the Department's Vote. However, they retain a clear operational role in relation to their various schemes and services. While the bodies are free to publish relevant to the public without recourse to me, where such information might have significant policy or operational implications, they would as a matter of course, advise me beforehand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 423, 424 and 481 together.</P>
      <P>The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968 provides for the award of grants by local authorities for the pursuit of third level studies based, <i>inter alia,</i> on compliance with means test limits that may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister for Education and Science with the consent of the Minister for Finance. The Act also provides that means shall be calculated in such manner and by reference to such matters as may be specified from time to time by the Minister for Education and Science with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The specific means test arrangements adverted to by the Deputy have been in operation since 1983 and are applied nationally.  It would not necessarily be anomalous to have different criteria applied for the purposes of assessing individuals for tax and for the purposes of allocating limited resources as fairly and equitably as possible under the schemes of students support.  For example, certain forms of income are exempt from tax to encourage particular activities.  It is also important to have regard to the fact that net income is the result of personal financial decision making.  Assessment of gross income avoids discrimination on the basis of such personal financial decisions.</P>
      <P>I recently announced that arrangements have been made to examine the question of rationalising the various student support schemes and having them administered by a single agency.  A joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has begun an examination of various options and the possible role of the Department in any new system.  Means testing arrangements, including issues such as those raised by the Deputies, will be examined as part of the group's work.</P>
      <P>In relation to the income limits for third level maintenance grants, these limits are reviewed on an annual basis and I will consider the question of an increase in the context of framing of the 1998 student support schemes.</P>

These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of all surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.  Currently, there are 103 one teacher primary schools with ten or more pupils in the country which includes the school to which the Deputy refers.  Since there are no teaching posts available to me for allocation to these schools, I am currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments to one teacher schools.</P>

      <P>Special training courses are made available to teachers who teach pupils with special educational needs and they also receive the advice and support of my Department's inspectorate and of the psychological service, and of the visiting teacher service.</P>
      <P>While the suggestions which the Deputy refers to are appreciated, it is considered that adequate arrangements are already in place in County Kildare to ensure that the work of each teacher with a responsibility for special needs is properly co-ordinated.  It is not intended, therefore, to establish a post of area special needs co-ordinator.</P>

The enrolment of the school, to which the Deputy refers, on 30 September 1996 was 214 pupils.  This enrolment warrants the staffing of a principal and six assistant teachers for the current school year, one post less than the authorised staffing at the school in the previous school year.  In addition, the school has the services of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>A minimum enrolment of 237 pupils would have been required at the school in order to allow the principal to concentrate solely on administrative duties.  I regret, therefore, that I am not in a position to review the staffing allocation of this school at present.</P>

      <P>The report of Sir Ron Dearing on the Future of Higher Education in the UK was published in July 1997.  Arising from this report, Mr. David Blunkett, the UK Secretary of State for Education and Employment announced that he planned to introduce an annual tuition fee of up to £1,000 depending on parental income, that tuition would continue to be free for students from lower income families and that maintenance grants would be replaced by student loans.  He further advised that a White Paper, which is yet to be published, will detail the new arrangements.</P>

      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year and included the allocation of 51 remedial teacher posts to primary schools with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for remedial tuition.

      <P>Prior to 1996, the student support schemes provided for the payment of grants in sterling to students who were pursuing approved courses in Northern Ireland.  In 1996 the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states.  Following discussions with the local authorities regarding the administrative arrangements which were necessary to take account of the new situation, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states including Northern Ireland would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying.  It was further agreed that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the country in which the student is pursuing his-her course.</P>

      <P>School authorities are required to supplement the capitation grant with a local contribution of £10 per school in the case of mainstream national schools while a rate of £9.50 per pupil applies in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged.  The total amount of local contributions for the 1996-97 school year was approximately £4.5 million.</P>
      <P>The State is required under the Constitution to provide for free primary education and to ensure that such education is available to children.  This is achieved through the partnership between State and local community which is expressed in the State grant combined with the local contribution. The sum required to meet the local contribution is provided from the general funds of the parish or other analogous community.</P>
      <P>Unlike primary schools, which are in the main parish schools, post-primary schools serve wide catchment areas and are not formally linked to a parish structure.  Voluntary local contributions to the funding of such schools have traditionally been less formally structured than the parish contribution.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to abolish the requirements to raise a local contribution. However, I would point out to the Deputy that the local contribution has been frozen at the rates outlined above since 1995.</P>

      <P>Since its introduction under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress (PESP) in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to schools in respect of clerical and caretaking services has been expanded in line with undertakings given in PESP.  The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment figure, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more and to all secondary schools with 200 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>I should point out that this scheme provides a grant to schools which is not directly related to any specific pay scale.  The grants are based on school enrolments and are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant.  The level and extent of service provided is a matter for local school management who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for caretaking and clerical services.  The Department of Education and Science is not the employer in these cases.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and clerical services.</P>

      <P>In order to be eligible for free transport under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, children under ten years of age must live at least two miles from and be attending their nearest national school.  The children to whom the Deputy refers reside between 1.1 and 1.9 miles from their nearest school, and are therefore ineligible for transport under the terms of the scheme.  In the circumstances, I regret that it would not be open to my Department to establish or extend a service to facilitate the children in question.</P>

      <P>Following a recent meeting between my <Col N="1350" /> colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and a deputation on behalf of the pupils from the area in question, it was decided to extend the current transport arrangement for those pupils attending post-primary schools in Athlone for a further school year until June 1999.</P>
      <P>In view of the strong representations in this case, the matter will be re-examined by my Department without prejudice to the decision to extend the service until 1999, and with due regard to the position of Ballygar as a vitally important secondary school in the area.

      <P>It is intended that all balances within the fund will be managed by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).  Any private sector donations, which are awaiting allocation, will be kept in a separate investment account and may be invested in Irish Government securities.  The rate and nature of the return on this account, which will accrue to the fund, will depend on the investment decisions taken by the NTMA in the course of exercising this function.  As such, the funds will be used to the maximum benefit possible for the objectives of the fund and of the donors.</P>
      <P>Any balances arising from moneys provided by the Exchequer to the fund will be managed by the NTMA via the cash management system which operates for the Exchequer generally.  Under this system, any balances held in departmental or other accounts are effectively pooled together and the aggregate balance is managed by the NTMA in such a fashion as to achieve the maximum overall return.</P>
      <P>The tax status of contributions to the fund has not been determined.  I would remind the Deputy, however, that the terms of the Finance Act, 1997 already provide tax relief incentives for individuals and corporations to invest in third level institutions. Under section 16 of that Act tax relief is available on donations made towards the cost of approved projects and section 25 provides for tax based reliefs for financing packages involving sale and leaseback arrangements.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there have been very significant private and corporate contributions to third-level capital projects over the last number of years and formal arrangements already exist under which financial aid is provided by my Department towards the cost of capital projects in the universities where matching funding from private sources is made available.  It is not my intention that private contributions to the fund should substitute for the very welcome private contributions made to individual institutions. Indeed, the fund may serve as a catalyst for further fundraising by institutions.</P>
