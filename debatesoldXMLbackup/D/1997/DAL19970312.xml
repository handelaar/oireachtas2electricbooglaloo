      <P>It is proposed to take No. 23&mdash; Universities Bill, 1996&mdash; Report and Final Stages and No. 24 &mdash; Litter Pollution Bill, 1996 &mdash; Report and Final Stages.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m.; the Report and Final Stages of No. 23 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Education; the Report and Final Stages of No. 24 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10.15 p.m. tonight by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment; Private Members' Business shall be No. 9&mdash; Private Educational Institutions Bill, 1997 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed) and the proceedings on the Second Stage thereof shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight; and the sitting shall not be suspended from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 March 1997.</P>

      <P>There are some five matters to put before the House.  Is the proposal for the late sitting this evening satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 23 satisfactory and agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We object strongly to the truncating and, as I said yesterday, the strangling of the Universities Bill.  A total of 142 amendments were recommitted and were to be openly debated today.  Our party wishes to object strongly to the proposal for dealing with the Bill which will effectively rule out much needed further debate on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Rourke.  I cannot understand why the Government wants to <Col N="450" /> curtail all the debates on education this week. That is extraordinary.  As education is such a fundamental matter we should have a full debate in the House about the reform that is about to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Universities Bill has been extensively debated for many months.  It was the subject of widespread consultation with outside interests and was debated in the House.  The Government has a substantial legislative programme and we are anxious to move forward with it.  It is in that light that we put forward this proposal today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I dissuade Members from debating the matter now.  This is a procedural matter and the detail must be left to the debate on the Bill.  I will hear brief comments only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider giving more time to discuss the amendments to the Bill? The nature of the outside consultation was of a kind that was extremely dubious.  The heads of the universities were called in by the officials of the Department and told that they would consult with them on a confidential basis and that they could not report back to their governing bodies. That was the only basis on which they were brought in.  It seems the Government is endeavouring to bypass the Legislature on fundamental issues that pertain to the universities and other aspects of education.  The Bill was discussed at length on Committee Stage, but there are some fundamental issues at stake in terms of State control of the universities with which we want to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no grounds for elaboration now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that we have an open debate on the Universities Bill and all education matters.  The debate is severely truncated this week.  Having debated the Bill for 20 hours in committee because the Minister had to do an about turn due to pressure from outside interests and the Opposition, it is essential that those issues be debated openly in the Chamber and sufficient time be given to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We requested that much needed extra time be given to the Second Stage debate on the Education Bill but the Taoiseach replied that the Bill would be debated in committee. However, 142 amendments to the Universities Bill were recommitted and there is not enough time for the debate on Report Stage.  Education is far too important a topic to be sidelined in this disgraceful way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Keogh for her acknowledgment that the Universities Bill has been debated openly in committee for 20 hours. The matter which is the subject of Report Stage <Col N="451" /> amendments was adverted to in detail during those 20 hours of Committee Stage proceedings. Report Stage amendments could not be introduced unless the subject matter had already been substantially debated in committee under the orders of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Sufficient time is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially, this is a rerun, in considerable measure, of matters already discussed during the 20-hour period to which Deputy Keogh referred.  This measure is reasonable because it is important, from the point of view of the universities, that the legislation should become law.  I believe the House will acknowledge that the universities are most anxious that this modernisation of legislation, which has remained substantially unaltered since 1908, should proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter must not give rise to argument or debate at this time because it is essentially procedural.  I will permit one further comment by Deputies O'Rourke and Keogh and I will then put the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach set out to be an Oireachtas reformer and he recognises the existence of select committees.  However, this matter now involves open debate in the House and gives all Members who wish to contribute the opportunity to do so on Committee Stage.  Not all Members have the opportunity to intervene in respect of detailed scrutiny on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke is surprisingly misinformed about Dáil procedures.  Any Member of the House can attend a committee. The 20 hours of debate on this measure in committee <Col N="452" /> were open to all Members.  I am surprised that the Deputy is unaware of that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Why will the Taoiseach not allow the measure to be debated in the House? Deputies cannot vote at committees of which they are not members.</P>

      <P>I believe we should be orderly when dealing with these matters.  The reason so much time was spent debating the Bill in committee was that it was fatally flawed and had to be extensively changed.  This will be the only opportunity to engage in an open debate on the Bill because on Committee Stage no one knew what was happening, least of all Government Members who failed to attend the proceedings.</P>

On a day of reality and sadness for many of our citizens, will the Taoiseach say how the decision was arrived at to refer the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions rather than to the Garda authorities?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 23, after &ldquo;1980,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;THE DUBLIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY ACT, 1994,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments concern our determination to secure university status for the Dublin Institute of Technology.  We hoped the Minister would use this opportunity to review the legislative framework currently governing the Dublin Institute of Technology.  All Members received considerable representations from students and staff of the college over a long period but on Committee Stage the Minister refused to consider accommodating the Dublin Institute of Technology within the remit of this Bill.  We were motivated by the review of the quality assurance procedures in the report on the Dublin Institute of Technology made by an international review team, which states:</P>
      <P>The review team suggests that the relevant authorities should consider whether key features of the proposed legislation [that is, the Universities Bill] should be extended to the Dublin Institute of Technology and if the legislation should be amended in the light of such analysis.</P>
      <P>No attempt has been made to implement that fundamental recommendation of the international review group which analysed the quality assurance procedures and overall operation of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>The existing Dublin Institute of Technology Act has outlived its usefulness &mdash; it is far to restrictive on the Dublin Institute of Technology's capacity to grow and develop.  It only allows for the appointment of staff subject to the approval of the Minister for Education with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance; the selection procedures for staff are determined by the Minister and the Dublin Institute of Technology; the appointment of research fellows, research assistants, etc. is subject to regulations laid down by the Minister for Education, again with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance; it can only charge fees for lectures, examinations and exhibitions subject to such conditions as may be specified by the Minister; it may only acquire land subject to the approval of the Minister, and so on.  These provisions are not applicable to the universities and we managed significantly to reform the Bill in a number of these respects; for example, a number of amendments relating to fees were accepted on Committee Stage, including amendments proposed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of our amendments will be to create a legislative framework for the Dublin Institute of Technology which would facilitate its growth and development as a university and would allow it to compete internationally with <Col N="460" /> other institutions for funding, particularly from the private sector, and to acquire additional land and property.  We know the Dublin Institute of Technology requires additional land, buildings and funding.  It has been made clear that it will not receive all the funding it requires from the State and we acknowledge the Exchequer has limitations and will not be able to fund all the development which is required at Dublin Institute of Technology.  Clearly the institution must seek private sector funding, as the existing universities are doing at present.  Most of them have secured huge private sector funding, particularly for research-based projects &mdash; over 1,000 jobs have been created in the university sector through research projects funded by the private sector alone.  Within its existing legislative framework the Dublin Institute of Technology cannot compete with the universities in securing this vitally needed additional funding.  It is a disgrace that the Minister did not use the opportunity provided by the Universities Bill to accommodate the desires and aspirations of Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>The Minister has agreed at long last that the Dublin Institute of Technology should have degree awarding powers but that announcement conflicts with the interim report of Teastas, which has mapped out a different ladder of progression. It seems to confirm the status of Dublin Institute of Technology as being essentially within the non-university sector for the foreseeable future, lumped in with the other non-university colleges, CERT, FÁS, the private colleges, etc.  The Teastas report excited considerable disquiet and upset in Dublin Institute of Technology.  It is concerned that, far from moving on to a new legislative framework, it is being ring-fenced within the Teastas framework, which is decidedly the non-university sector.</P>
    <P>The only way for Dublin Institute of Technology to move forward is to grant its wish to be given university status.  Our amendments have that purpose and we have outlined the degree to which existing legislation is too stifling to facilitate the growth of Dublin Institute of Technology. I cannot understand why the Minister did not use this Bill, which was prepared so long in advance and after receipt of so many position papers, to review the Dublin Institute of Technology's legislative framework to accommodate its needs and give it university status.  We will not have another opportunity in the context of third level education and universities to discuss the Dublin Institute of Technology issue and universities generally.  We should use this legislation to facilitate the Dublin Institute of Technology cause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>All these amendments are designed to persuade the Minister that the Dublin Institute of Technology should become a university.  We had a lengthy debate on this point on Committee Stage when it was put to the Minister that, as it stands, the Dublin Institute of Technology is totally <Col N="461" /> constrained in how it can grow, borrow money, acquire land etc.  Considerable concern was expressed both by staff and students that no one was listening to the campaign they had mounted.  It is essential for the growth of the institute that it be accorded university status.  My amendment No. 19 provides:</P>
      <P>The Government shall, no later than three years after the commencement of this Part, make an order providing that the Dublin Institute of Technology shall be a University for the purposes of this Act.</P>
      <P>This would provide a timeframe for the process because as of now the Dublin Institute of Technology sees no end to it.  We tried to get some commitment from the Minister to support the efforts of the Dublin Institute of Technology to achieve university status but she refused to give it.  That is most unfortunate and disheartening for the people campaigning for this status.  The Minister missed an opportunity and the students involved are concerned they will be left in a halfway house.  The Minister said there is a section in the Bill wherein university status can be sought. However, as Deputy Martin said, when will there be an opportunity to address this in the short to medium term?  It will not happen.  It has taken nearly five years to get the Universities Bill to this point and there will not be an opportunity for a considerable time to debate the issue.  The Minister seems to have got bogged down in the notion that the Dublin Institute of Technology was merely seeking a change of name so that it would look and sound better.  However, a great deal of change can come about as a result of it attaining university status.  Fortunately, because amendments have been made to the Bill, universities will have more autonomy than provided initially.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology seeks such autonomy.  Under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, the Minister has vast and extensive powers in regard to the Institute and to a great extent they stymie its growth and development. A degree of autonomy is sought by the institute so that it can develop.  It has problems at present with bad facilities.  Its buildings are too small, it has no sports facilities and technology is not advanced enough.  It is actively looking for a new green field site.  If it had the ability to go out and seek funding abroad, as universities have, the possibilities of growth and development would be greater.  The Institute has put forward a very compelling argument and I regret that the Minister does not want to listen to it.  Will the Minister explain why she wishes to stop the clock in regard to the Dublin Institute of Technology?  Why can she not give it the autonomy it needs to develop its courses and services for students?</P>

      <P>I support the amendments to afford university status to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  We have an opportunity to give the Dublin Institute of Technology a clear signal <Col N="462" /> from this House regarding its growth and development.  Members of Government parties have indicated to the students, their representatives and officials and the institute's academic staff that their case merited favourable consideration and that they would receive such consideration. University status would also mean a great deal to the students internationally upon graduation.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology is growing as a distinct and distinguished institution in its own right, building on the legislative base put in place in 1993.  It has made major strides with the active support of my Department which can be measured in its investment in the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I have been committed to its development and staffing and student numbers have increased substantially.  Many new courses at certificate, diploma, degree and postgraduate level have been developed.  Current funding amounts to £50 million, a massive investment and vote of confidence in the Dublin Institute of Technology.  In addition, since 1993, over £18.5 million of capital funding has been invested.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Dublin Institute of Technology on its progress since 1992 in building a single integrated institution, not an easy task but one that has been achieved.  The Dublin Institute of Technology has a vital role in higher education in providing qualifications at certificate, diploma and degree level.  The successful completion of the process for awarding degrees is another step in the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology and I put in place the formal mechanism to evaluate the institution for degree awarding powers.  My proposal to grant degree awarding powers is clearly not a reaction to pressure that has been put on me, but is the next stage in the successful process of development of that institute.</P>
      <P>Section 9 will provide a mechanism by which an institution can obtain university status.  It is the first time that a formal mechanism whereby an institution may become a university will be placed on a statutory basis.  If, in the future, moving to university status will enhance the mission of the Dublin Institute of Technology, section 9 will provide an appropriate mechanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Keogh, I will clarify the Government's approach for the overall development of the higher education sector.  Developments in higher education, particularly over the past 20 years, have been based on a differentiated system of third level education.  One part is formed by the universities and the designated institutions under the Higher Education Authority with State funding allocated by the Authority.  The other part includes the regional technical colleges and the Dublin <Col N="463" /> Institute of Technology with State funding allocated directly by the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Universities are essentially concerned with undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes together with basic and applied research.  The main work of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology is in certificate and diploma programmes with a smaller number of degree programmes and a growing involvement in regionally oriented applied research.  However, within each sector and between the two sectors, a diversity of institutions offer differing types and levels of courses. There is a necessity to maintain and build upon these courses to ensure social and economic requirements are met as planned for in the Green Paper.  The Dublin Institute of Technology can continue and grow as a technological institute rather than as a university and I consider a technological institute to be of equal standing to a university.</P>

      <P>It is not necessary for a higher education institution to be a university to attain high standards and international acclaim. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the California Institute of Technology, for example, have gained national and international acclaim without the title &ldquo;university&rdquo;; the same applies to the institutes of technology in Tokyo and Melbourne.  Future decisions on university status will not be closed off with section 9 in place.  I have great confidence in the mission of the Dublin Institute of Technology and I have placed investment in places, courses and facilities at its disposal.</P>

      <P>The Minister read a mini Second Stage speech in regard to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The last part of her speech makes very bleak reading for the community in the Dublin Institute of Technology.  It was disingenuous of her to say that under section 9 certain processes may be put in place in the future to facilitate the granting of university status to a particular institution.  It is clear Government policy, as articulated by the Minister, that the Dublin Institute of Technology will not become a university and will remain in the non-university sector. The Minister should be honest and tell the community in Dublin Institute of Technology that this is Government policy.  The Dublin Labour Deputies should tell the students and staff in the Dublin Institute of Technology that the Minister does not envisage the Dublin Institute of Technology <Col N="464" /> becoming a university and wants it to remain an institute of technology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Deputies have told the staff and students of the Dublin Institute of Technology they should not worry as the Bill facilitates the granting of university status to the institute in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>They have also told them they want the Dublin Institute of Technology to become a university and that is why it was given degree awarding powers.  The Dublin Institute of Technology has had an arrangement with Trinity College for many years whereby it can award degrees to students.  As this arrangement already exists the granting of degree awarding powers is no big deal.  The Minister made this concession in response to the very effective campaign of the students and staff of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>She was irritated that so many letters were sent to her.  She admitted as much on Committee Stage and described the letters as circulars.  I think it was Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn who took the Minister to task for her intolerance of what most of us would regard as normal democratic procedures.  Such correspondence from the public should not be considered an irritant.  The Minister said that the Dublin Institute of Technology will not become a university and it is Government policy to retain it primarily as a certificate and diploma awarding institute.  This is a short-sighted approach to the development of education.  The Dublin Institute of Technology has no difficulty in meeting the requirements of its mission statement and would have no difficulty in adapting what it has been doing so successfully over many years in a new climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are still awaiting the formulation of proper criteria by which an institute can become an institute of technology.  The Dublin Institute of Technology Act introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Seamus Brennan, set up the Dublin Institute of Technology as we know it.  The Minister said that the Waterford Institute of Technology will be set up by way of ministerial order but we do not know when this order will be introduced. All the other regional technical colleges are seeking institute of technology status. Because she was caught in a corner and was under political pressure the Minister established a steering committee to formulate the criteria by which institute of technology status could be granted to regional technical colleges.  The Minister said the Dublin Institute of Technology will remain an institute of technology and will not become a university, yet we do not know the criteria by which institute of technology status can be granted.  A number of applications for institute of technology status have been submitted and the <Col N="465" /> steering committee is dealing with this thorny political issue which the Minister created.</P>
    <P>I would prefer if the Minister was honest and made it clear to Labour Deputies that it is Government policy not to award university status to the Dublin Institute of Technology and to retain it in the non-university sector.  This confirms my original point about Teastas, that its view that the Dublin Institute of Technology should be kept in the non-university sector is holding sway.  This does not augur well for the future of the Dublin Institute of Technology. Institutions must grow and develop and we must provide the framework to enable them to do this. The legislative framework governing the Dublin Institute of Technology is much too restrictive. For example, the institute must obtain the permission of the Minister to confer honorary degrees or awards.  This is a ridiculous arrangement and the Minister should have availed of the opportunity in the Bill to review many of these issues.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology has advanced considerably over the years and will continue to develop in the future.  Deputy Keogh's amendment gives the Minister latitude by providing for a process by which the Dublin Institute of Technology could be granted university status.  I now know why no consideration was given to including the Dublin Institute of Technology in this legislation.  The clear and firm policy of the Minister and Teastas, which she created, is to retain the Dublin Institute of Technology in the non-university sector and not allow it to become a university.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her detailed reply in which she set out her thoughts on the Dublin Institute of Technology.  She made the case for the retention of the present status of the Dublin Institute of Technology and referred to the award, certificate and diploma courses which may be offered to students.  The arrangement with Trinity College whereby Dublin Institute of <Col N="466" /> Technology students can be awarded degrees is fine in so far as it goes.  However, there is a mistaken belief that the institute wants to be called the New Dublin University, a cross between Trinity College and DCU.  This is not the case; rather the Dublin Institute of Technology wants to continue its present system of education.  It is content with its name but is not content with its status and the constraints it imposes on it.</P>
      <P>This issue is all about control and keeping people in a certain box.  The Minister will be in charge of this issue.  This smacks of State control of the education system, a policy on which the Minister seems to be very keen.  This is the real reason the Minister will not encourage the granting of university status to the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>It is very unfortunate that the Minister should have described valid correspondence from students as circulars.  I received similar letters and while they contained the same wording the important point is that they were signed by different individuals.  The Minister should not denigrate people who took the time and effort to put their points of view forward.</P>

Will she clarify if acceptance of these amendments would give the Dublin Institute of Technology university status? Does she accept the case made by us that the granting of university status would open up further avenues for the Dublin Institute of Technology in terms of its ambit, growth and development and funding opportunities?  I ask the Minister to give a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer to these questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 32, after &ldquo;made&rdquo; to insert&ldquo;, after consultation with the existing governing bodies of the universities referred to in section 4,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister made much of the fact that there has been a considerable degree of consultation with interested parties and the universities.  She published the Bill, but there was a major outcry about it and we spent some 20 hours in committee essentially remarking the Bill.  My amendment would allow consultation with the governing bodies of the universities.  Section 2 of the Bill States:</P>
      <P>This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed therefor by order or orders made by the Minister under this section, either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision, and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and different Provisions of this Act.</P>
      <P>The governing bodies of the universities wish to be consulted.  My amendment is a relatively minor one, but it is important.  Universities are autonomous bodies and should maintain their autonomy in so far as it is practicable and possible to do so.  Even basic manners demand that there should be consultation with the existing governing bodies on a fundamental change that will make such a difference to the running of universities in the future.  That should be included in the Bill because it would send out a signal to the governing bodies about our approach to the universities and the governing bodies as part of the partnership in education about which we hear a great deal.  If we are to send out the right signals, it is important to ratify the process of consultation within the Bill.  It does not appear to be a major element of the Bill, but it would be significant in the message it would give.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment in the spirit of partnership that she wishes to see in education and in the spirit of accepting the consultative role of the governing body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  I am surprised that the Minister has not taken the opportunity afforded by Report Stage to concede <Col N="469" /> this amendment because, even after the passing of the Act, consultation with the governing bodies of the universities affected by it will be necessary. On Committee Stage we discussed in detail the operation of the commission that will be established in each university and which will involve the Higher Education Authority and the president of each university, in the context of appointing the new governing body that will be established when the Act is passed.  I disagree with that provision.</P>
      <P>We cannot predict with certainty what will happen in future, but I suspect that in one or two cases consultation will be necessary as the process develops.  I do not understand why the Minister will not allow this amendment, given that consultation does not impose an obligation on the Minister to accept points made during the consultation process. It would not impose obligations on the Minister in terms of having to accept the points made via the consultation process.  The amendment cannot be construed as impeding enactment or implementation of the Bill.  It makes particular sense in the case of Trinity.  The amendments relating to Trinity are an acknowledgement that it is a special case because of its history, tradition, ethos and freedom from Government intervention. Significant aspects of the Bill will not affect Trinity for at least three years, or sooner if Trinity publishes a Private Members' Bill which would harmonise its position.</P>
      <P>It may be prudent to include this amendment in the context of Trinity.  I am not sure how the fellows of Trinity will produce a Bill or what the interactions will be in terms of that process.  That cannot be predicted with certainty and that is why it makes good sense to provide for a consultative mechanism as suggested by Deputy Keogh, particularly in the two scenarios I have outlined where potentially consultation would help iron out problems experienced by institutions.  In the case of Trinity it may be necessary to have a consultative process, particularly in the context of the private Bill that will have to be produced and of deliberations that are ongoing in Trinity.</P>
      <P>We hear lectures from time to time about partnership in education, consultation and so on, but all the legislation introduced so far is the antithesis of partnership and does not provide for consultation. If the fundamental principles of the White Paper are identified as partnership, pluralism and so on, why will the Minister not accept an amendment such as this which simply calls for consultation with existing governing bodies?</P>

      <P>Section 2 is the commencement provision.  Its function is to allow for flexibility in bringing the legislation into effect and in that respect it is a standard provision.  Deputy Keogh proposes that before the Minister for Education makes an order in this House to bring provisions of the Bill into effect there must be consultation with universities.  I oppose the amendment on a number of grounds.  We have had heated debates here defending our right to make decisions.  It would be inappropriate therefore if the Oireachtas, having enacted an Act, had to depend on the outcome of consultations with bodies outside the Oireachtas before effect could be given to the will of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of a statutory open-ended requirement for consultation could delay the introduction of legislation indefinitely.  In all the contacts we had with various sections, no request was made to examine the standard provision.  At times I have been slapped over the knuckles about consultations that take place outside this House.  It would be an extraordinary turnabout to accept this amendment to the commencement provision.  In effect it would be saying that although we have passed legislation in the House we do not want it to commence until consultation has taken place.  In ensuring that universities are ready to implement the provisions of the Bill, there are informal contacts between the Minister and the universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that there will be the usual informal contacts between officials and university heads, and I take her word for that.  I suspect that is consultation by another name, but it is not being included in the Bill.  I have no difficulty with consultations.  I am glad at long last the second trade union involved with the staff have an opportunity to meet the Minister, and that meeting will take place today.  I said on Committee Stage that that trade union had not been facilitated with a meeting whereas a meeting took place with IFUT.  I presume today's meeting will be with the programme manager &mdash; that poor man is run off his feet meeting delegations and groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greater transparency in the informal contacts may be appropriate.  The informal contact process has been extremely effective because I understand <Col N="471" /> it was through informal contacts between officials and university heads that hundreds of amendments have been put forward to the Bill, leading to radical change.  I have no difficulty with further informal contacts in terms of commencement of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little puzzled by the Minister's response to the amendment.  She said that consultation is inappropriate because, having enacted a Bill, the will of the Oireachtas could be thwarted by consultation with the universities, but I question that.  The Bill states: &ldquo;This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed therefore by order or orders made by the Minister under this section&rdquo;.  There are not 1,200 universities, although, thankfully, there is a number of them.  The Minister said that informal contacts exists &mdash; presumably they are well used. Obviously there are already channels of communication, so what is the big deal about consulting with universities about commencement of the Bill?</P>
      <P>I find the Minister's refusal to accept the amendment inexplicable.  It would be wise to have a consultative process in place, not only through informal contacts but through formal channels.</P>
      <P>I assume from the Minister's reply that telephone calls will be made, people will meet informally and the Minister will be told when the Act should come into operation.  It would be more appropriate to have a formal method of consultation on the matter.  The provisions of the Act should be as transparent as possible.  To ensure a speedy enforcement of its provisions the Minister's officials will have to communicate with the universities and, as a matter of courtesy, this should be covered in the initial sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the universities did not request her to do this.  Perhaps they thought she might do it anyway.  The universities have asked me to table an amendment in this regard.  It is one of a long list of amendments they want made to the Bill.  While this is not a major part of the Bill, it is significant.  Nobody is trying to delay the commencement of the Act but if informal consultation will take place, why not provide for it in the Bill?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> This is a simple straightforward amendment. Basically, the financial year is defined as a 12 month period commencing on 1 January each year.  While funding is provided by the Government on a calendar year basis, the current financial year in all universities ends on 30 September and some universities want that date retained.  In other words, they want to continue a system that has worked effectively.  I am sure the Minister can accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>

      <P>In amendment No. 4 the Deputies have suggested the redefinition of the financial year.  This would require universities to budget for an academic rather than a calendar year.  While this would obviously be useful for the universities, it would not take account of the State's budgeting arrangements for funding the universities.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.  While I am aware of the Deputies' concerns, universities should be able to account on a calendar year basis.  It is worth nothing that section 37(2), as amended by the select committee, will ensure the Bill does not require the accounts to apply to a calendar or an academic year.  The revised provision simplifies the dates on which the accounts are to be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General and allows for flexibility if changes in procedure occur in the future.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat disappointed the Minister has not accepted the amendment.  The system has worked effectively up to now.  I am not aware of any outcry about the current arrangements.  We must always be wary of the State endeavouring to place additional administrative burdens on universities or any other institutions under its care.  The Minister's decision will result in changes to which universities will have to adapt.  It is unfortunate she did not consider the viewpoints put forward on Committee and Report Stages and accept the amendment.  We have no evidence of major financial irregularities or scandals in regard to universities or third level institutions and I am not aware of any negative comments from the Comptroller and Auditor General about the financial management of our universities.  This is another example of unwarranted interference by the State.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 23, after &ldquo;was&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;first&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 addresses a concern raised by Deputies Martin and Coughlan on Committee Stage.  It will ensure that an officer of a students' union or of a student representative body must be a registered student when first elected or appointed to the position.  The amendment addresses the concern expressed by Deputies Martin and Coughlan that students who are officers of a students union can stand for re-election or for election to other officerships of the students union and still come under the definition of &ldquo;student&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 introduces a definition for student union in the Bill.  Deputy Keogh proposed such an amendment on Committee Stage and has again proposed amendment No. 8.  I agreed on Committee Stage to consider the issue further.  The definition I propose is fairly broad because I do not want it to accidentially exclude any existing student unions or lead to excessive inflexibility in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that the Minister has responded to our concerns on Committee Stage and that she tabled an amendment to ensure that students have primacy on the student body and the governing body in terms of being re-elected. However, I do not understand why the Minister did not accept Deputy Keogh's amendment instead of tabling amendment No. 7.  This amendment defines a students' union as &ldquo;a body established to promote the general interests of students of a university and which represents students, both individually and collectively, in respect of academic, disciplinary and other matters&rdquo;. Deputy Keogh's amendment states that &ldquo; 'students' union' is a representative body, the majority of the officers of which are elected and which promotes the general interests of its members&rdquo;.  The key words are &ldquo;represents&rdquo; and &ldquo;elected&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we discussed these amendments on Committee Stage, we highlighted the fact that students' union officers are elected on a democratic mandate to carry out the wishes of its members in a given institution.  I have met the students' unions on an ongoing basis over the past two years and they are concerned about the failure to allocate money directly to them since free fees were introduced.  The governing bodies in some universities have established other bodies, <Col N="474" /> such as the student welfare services.  It could be argued that the Minister's definition could include such bodies, which are an arm of management but which do a lot of good work in looking after the general well-being of students and promoting their interests in terms of getting grants for clubs and societies.  However, they are not an elected representative body.  I am concerned, therefore, that the Minister's definition is defective. A students' union is a representative body elected by the students to act on their behalf to improve their welfare and further their interests in a given institution.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept Deputy Keogh's amendment, which is better than the Minister's amendment, and not allow party political point scoring to blur judgements.  Deputy Keogh's amendment seeks to ensure that officers are seen to be elected.  We tabled amendments on Committee Stage to ensure that only full-time elected officers should be on governing bodies.  Elections are held every year and the full-time sabbatical officer is usually elected president of the union in a presidential style campaign in the university.</P>
    <P>These campaigns are usually the begining of a fruitful political career for many young people. Many of the Minister's colleagues in her party and in Democratic Left started their political careers in universities.  We should nurture and cherish this training ground for future politicians. Members on this side of the House also know people who were elected to students' union movements.</P>
    <P>Any definition of a students' union should include the fact that it is a democratic institution elected by and representative of its members. However, this definition does not say by what means a students' union could be established.  It could be established without any mandate and devise its own functions or objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I also accept amendment No. 6.  I am delighted the Minister responded to the points made on Committee Stage because I did not think she was convinced by our arguments that students' unions should be included in the definitions.  However, the Minister's amendment is flawed.  On Committee Stage we argued that people should be elected because we want governing bodies to be as democratic, autonomous and accountable as possible.</P>
      <P>My amendment states:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;students' union&rsquo; is a representative body, the majority of the officers of which are elected and which promotes the general interests of its members as students and represents the students, in general and individually, in academic, disciplinary and other matters relating to the governance of the university;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment may be similar to the Minister's amendment, but the critical words are &ldquo;a representative <Col N="475" /> body, the majority of the officers of which are elected&rdquo;.  The Minister's amendment states: &ldquo;&lsquo;Student Union&rsquo; means a body established&rdquo;. How is this body established?  The way this amendment is worded could result in the university authority making a decision about who is represented on the students' union, which is the opposite from what is required.  I presume that is not the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>We all agree the students' union should be representative of the students and the way to achieve that is to elect officers.  I did not take a great interest in politics at university but I remember that elections were hard fought.  People may have wanted to pursue political careers in the future, but there were also people who had firm ideas about how the union should operate.</P>
    <P>These people were elected on their own manifesto and this is critical.  Just as there will be a general election in the next couple of months and people will have an opportunity to vote for the political parties and the policies which they put forward, the representative body for students must have an electoral mandate.  In other words, the students should have the ability to direct the way the union is going.  If it will promote &ldquo;the general interests of its members&rdquo;, as I state in amendment No. 8, and represent &ldquo;the students, in general and individually, in academic, disciplinary and other matters relating to the governance of the university&rdquo;, it is critical that it pursue the mandate from the students body which elect it. Although the Minister has gone some way towards recognising that there should be a definition as the students wish, the fact that there is no acknowledgement of the election of such a body is a glaring omission and the Minister's amendment is far too loose in that regard.  I rarely say I have all the answers but my amendment is desired by the students' union as it recognises the role of the union.  It would make the Bill much tighter and concise and is appropriate.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept Deputy Keogh's amendment.  I would hate to see amendment No. 7 accepted because it is a defective definition of a student union.  Will the Minister outline in her reply what bodies in particular she was anxious not to exclude?  In the opening remarks the Minister said she was anxious that no existing union or body would be excluded by any definition.  Was that a general point or can she give specific examples of existing student unions which would be excluded by Deputy Keogh's amendment?  I do not know of any student union which would be ruled out by amendment No. 8 but there may be some.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister state why that representative dimension is omitted from her amendment?  We received the Minister's amendments late last night and this morning but I would be loath to agree the passage of that amendment on first reading.  As Deputy Keogh said, it could be used in the future and university management could <Col N="476" /> establish the student unions of the future in any new universities established under section 9.  Who is to predict the future?</P>
    <P>Essentially, a student union is a body which elects its officers.  It is a representative body and it belongs to the members and nobody else.  The wording of amendment No. 8 in the name of Deputy Keogh is far superior to that of amendment No. 7 and it should be accepted in the spirit of good legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the issue further, I am satisfied that the definition I am proposing is a broad one which will not exclude accidentally any existing student unions.  In many cases across the student body &mdash; not all student unions are affiliated to a national student body &mdash; all officers are not elected by students.  Some are elected by other groups of elected people.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Martin's concern that the universities would set up their own student unions, there is nothing in the provisions of this Bill which would give them the power to do so.  I am satisfied with amendment No. 6 and that the definition which I propose with regard to amendments Nos. 7 and 8 is a broad one.  Having considered the matter, I recommend amendments Nos. 6 and 7 to the House.</P>

      <P>I challenge the Minister on what she has said.  If she looks carefully at my wording, it states that a &lsquo;students' union&rsquo; is a representative body, the majority of the officers of which are elected and this was carefully worded with the advice of the students.  I challenge the claim that it would be impossible for university management to establish a student union.  There is that possibility because the Minister's amendment is loosely framed and nobody can deny that.  The Minister's amendment does not obviate that possibility.</P>

      <P>Amendment No.13 is somewhat similar to amendment No.12.  The objective of our amendment is to ensure that any proposal to designate a constituent college as a university under this Bill would have to be laid before both Houses either in the form of an Act or an order.</P>

      <P>Essentially, amendment No.12 seeks to establish the primacy of the Oireachtas in these matters, which should be the theme throughout the Bill.

Therefore, in amendment No. 13, I propose that it would be necessary for a positive resolution to be passed by both Houses before such an incorporation can take place.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 9, the establishment of a new university can occur only after consideration of the advice of a body of experts and that of the Higher Education Authority.  A further guarantee of quality and accountability is that the order establishing a university must be made by the Government and ratified by both Houses of the Oireachtas before it becomes effective.  Deputies Martin and Coughlan tabled an amendment on Committee Stage that the officers of the existing <Col N="481" /> universities be consulted on the establishment of a new university.  They have tabled amendment No. 15 on Report Stage.  I indicated that I considered such a proposal had merit.  Therefore, I tabled amendment No. 14 which states that the Government will include such employees of existing universities as it thinks fit among the experts who will examine the case of an institution to be designated as a university under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's positive response to the amendment we tabled on Committee Stage.  Her amendment substitutes the word &ldquo;employees&rdquo; for that of "officers" and I assume this is aimed at broadening the range of people who could be selected to work with the international expert group to determine the process for any new body to become a university.  I welcome that development because the establishment of additional universities is an important and fundamental phenomenon and we must ensure that it is done correctly.  I accept that an international review body of experts is an objective way, particularly from and academic and education perspective, to lay down criteria and assess the basis on which an institution can be established as university.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless the utilisation of existing institutions here, in particular existing universities, is equally valid.  They would have considerable expertise and experience at their disposal and would be in a position to offer effective, constructive advice to such a body or to the process leading to the establishment of a new university.</P>
      <P>Obviously the international body of experts would be particularly influential in addition to An tÚdarás having a role to play.  It is important to acknowledge the expertise within existing universities and create a mechanism within this Bill to facilitate its utilisation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment and am prepared to withdraw mine in favour of hers, as it is an effective response to the issues raised on Committee Stage.</P>

It would be extraordinary if the body recommended by An tÚdarás &mdash; which shall include international educational experts &mdash; seemed to exclude those within our universities with the requisite knowledge and expertise since their inclusion would be very welcome.  The Minister has seen fit to table her amendment and insert the words &ldquo;and such employees of universities to which this Act applies as it thinks fit&rdquo; which is appropriate because different ranges of expertise exist within our universities.  It is advisable to have as wide a pool of expertise as possible available and we do have such a pool available.  I am glad that has now been acknowledged and that such people will be called upon in relation to the establishment of any additional universities.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;shall introduce a Bill to be laid before the Oireachtas to warrant the establishment of any such new university&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 9(2) reads: &ldquo;After considering the advice of the body and any recommendations of An tÚdarás, but subject to subsection (3), the Government may, by order, provide that the institution shall be a university for the purposes of this Act and, on the making of the order, it shall be established accordingly&rdquo;.  In line with amendments Nos. 12 and 13 &mdash; which dealt with the incorporation of an educational institution into a university &mdash; the Minister should introduce a Bill to warrant the establishment of any new university, as is the present practice.  I am surprised she has not tabled an amendment to the effect that an order be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Since we are doing so in the case of the incorporation of an educational institution into a university, I cannot understand why we should not do likewise in the case of the establishment of a new university.  After all, we are talking about the primacy of the Oireachtas, stipulating that the establishment of a new university should be by order or by a Bill to be laid before both Houses.</P>
      <P>The Minister agreed with that condition in relation to section 8.  I am asking her now to agree to a similar provision in relation to section 9 whose provisions relate to the establishment of additional universities.</P>

      <P>Deputies Martin and Coughlan, in amendments Nos. 16 and 17, have proposed that, instead of an order to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, a Bill would be necessary for the establishment of any new university whereas I do not consider that to be necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Martin raised the question of making an order under section 9(3). No doubt he will now noted its inclusion in that subsection.  The introduction of a Bill would impose unnecessary rigidity on the relevant procedure and I have been advised that such an approach would raise constitutional issues.  I have also been advised that to provide in legislation that the Houses of the Oireachtas would be bound by procedures in introducing future legislation would amount to improper fettering of the right of the Oireachtas to legislate as it sees fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" /> For that reason I cannot support these amendments. I reiterate that, under this section, the establishment of a new university can take place only after consideration of the advice of a body of experts and of the Higher Education Authority.  I should point out that a further guarantee of quality and accountability is encompassed in the stipulation that an order establishing any new university must be made by the Government and ratified by both Houses before becoming effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>An Act of the Oireachtas established Dublin City University and the University of Limerick.  This Bill will establish the legislative framework for seven universities.  What will be the legislative basis for the establishment of any additional universities in terms of composition, governing bodies and so on?  Essentially this is new legislation which will underpin the legislative base of seven universities, many provisions of which will be specific to each university in terms of the representation on governing bodies in particular. It does contain specific recommendations, stipulating how many graduates and representatives of outside bodies should be on the governing body of the University of Limerick or Trinity College. I assume there will be a need for similar legislative provisions in relation to any new university to be established.  Otherwise there would be a legislative vacuum.</P>
      <P>Henceforth, whenever a new university falls to be established, presumably someone would have to say that in accordance with this Bill, we should specify that its governing body will be comprised of a number of representatives from academic councils, a number from non-academic councils, representatives of graduates, the students' union and so on.  I cannot see how that can be done without this Bill, when enacted, having to be amended.  New legislation would have to be introduced to insert a new university.  Otherwise the rules, regulations, guidelines and the manner in which any new university would be structured could be at variance with the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>At the very least will the Minister acknowledge that this Bill will have to be amended in future simply to incorporate any new universities to be established under section 9?</P>

      <P>That is fair enough.  I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 5 to 27 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.  &mdash; Without prejudice to its ethos and traditions, the objects of a university shall include &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to strive for academic excellence and to advance knowledge through teaching, scholarly research and scientific investigation,</P>
      <P>(b)  to protect and promote academic freedom,</P>
      <P>(c)  to promote the right of a university to regulate its affairs in accordance with its ethos, traditions, and the principles of academic, operational and management freedom, consistent with the effective and efficient use of resources and accountability to the public,</P>
      <P>(d)  to promote learning in its student body and in society generally,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> (e)  to promote the cultural, social and economic life of society, while fostering and respecting the diversity of the university's traditions,</P>
    <P>(f)  to promote the official languages of the State, with special regard to the preservation and promotion of the Irish language and cultures.</P>
    <P>(g)  to promote the highest standards in, and quality of, teaching and research,</P>
    <P>(h)  to disseminate the outcomes of its research in the community at large,</P>
    <P>(i)  to reflect a commitment by the university to principles of equality, and</P>
    <P>(j)  to facilitate lifelong learning through the provision of adult and continuing education.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason Deputy Coughlan and I tabled this amendment, which sets out the objects and functions of the university, is that we consider we have a better formula than the Minister, a point we articulated on Committee Stage.  We considered that an object of the university should be to protect and promote academic freedom.  This is omitted from the Minister's list of objectives. Our list is more expansive.  Our amendment seeks in paragraph <i>(c)</i> to promote the right of a university to regulate its affairs in accordance with its ethos, traditions and the principles of academic, operational and management freedom, consistent with the effective and efficient use of resources and accountability to the public.  This was the wording used by the Minister in the position paper in November 1996.  It may appear in another formula in the Bill but it should be a core object.</P>
    <P>Section 12 and our amendment raise the whole issue of resources.  There is no reference in the section to sufficient resources being available to universities to achieve the objectives set out by the Minister, the principal one being paragraph (f) of the Bill which seeks: &ldquo;to educate, train and retrain higher level professional, technical and managerial personnel&rdquo;.  We have had an example in the past few weeks of how wrong the Government has been in that respect.  We have not provided the universities with the resources or the support necessary to train and educate enough young people for a number of industries, particularly in the computer science, technology, languages and engineering areas.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the dreadful skills shortage. The Government has reacted with a set of panic measures designed to provide places for thousands of students, many of whom will not graduate for three or four years.  The Minister is asking the universities to consider a number of conversion courses which may help in a stop-gap way but have serious implications for quality.  We should not be over-reliant on conversion courses to provide enough graduates for our electronics industry, the tele-marketing area and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> One of the strategic failures of this Government has been that of manpower policy and a failure to recognise that universities, regional technical colleges and PLCs have an important strategic function in terms of job creation, attracting multinationals to this country and providing the skills base to meet the labour demands of the new information society.  That has never been acknowledged by the Minister.  There has not been sufficient ongoing contact with the heads of universities and regional technical colleges on this issue. That is the reason for the panic reaction to the series of measures announced by both the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Education recently.  There is a shortage of places and resources in our universities to enable them to achieve the objective set out in section 12(f).</P>
    <P>In the past two years sufficient resources were not provided to the universities to enable them to train more graduates in the computer science, technology and engineering areas.  Tele-marketing is an area which has grown enormously.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the difficulties in trying to secure a place on a language course in university, particularly combined with an economic subject. A number of such courses are available at Trinity College, University College Dublin, University College, Cork, University of Limerick, University College, Galway and Dublin City University. Some 15 students can secure places in these elite type courses.  One may need in the region of 450-500 points to secure a place in such courses which are vital to our future industrial and economic needs.</P>
    <P>I sound a warning, by including in a Bill such as this extensive objects and functions we should acknowledge a clear obligation on the part of the State to resource universities adequately with the wherewithal to achieve these objectives.  The equipment in use in many laboratories in our universities is obsolete.  The need to update the equipment has been identified to us by many university heads as one of the crucial problems facing universities.  These are the laboratories in which the young graduates of the future are being trained to participate and compete with the best internationally in the worlds of science, technology, engineering and so on.  If the laboratories in our State universities are obsolete how can be expect our universities to attain and achieve the objectives set out in the Bill?  It is hypocritical and smacks of a certain type of approach, particularly from the Labour Party who like to put fine sounding rhetoric into legislation.  Unfortunately the follow through is weak and only lip service is paid to the rhetoric.</P>
    <P>Over the past four years the universities have been starved of recurrent capital funding to update equipment.  From 1993 to 1995 the seven universities between them received £2 million per year.  One can imagine how much equipment such money would buy and when divided among seven universities the sum is miserly.  In 1996 the universities received no allocation under that heading and this year they will receive £1 million, which <Col N="487" /> is a miserable amount also.  This illustrates the wide gap between the wonderful rhetoric in the Bill to define the objects of universities and the resources provided by the Government to achieve them.  The Government's greatest strategic failure has been to omit to identify the needs of industry and provide sufficient graduates. The economy is booming and companies are coming here but they are becoming increasingly concerned that we do not have as many trained graduates as we told them we had, hence the panic measures announced by both Ministers.  I could expand on the technological area but the Minister's lack of initiative on technology has been appalling right through the educational system, from primary and second levels right up to third level.  The lack of provision in the this area has been a major failure of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendment No. 20.  The protection and promotion of academic freedom does not figure in the Bill but it should be among the objects of the university.  Throughout the debate we have heard about the freedom and autonomy of universities.  Within the context of a university it is extremely important that there be freedom of expression and freedom to develop academic excellence.  A number of objects of a university are stated in amendment No. 20 but that one immediately strikes home and it should be acknowledged within the Bill because it is a fundamental aspect of a university.  On Committee Stage there was some discussion on the preservation and protection of academic freedom by and for the universities.  The logical conclusion of that debate is to enshrine it within the Bill.</P>
      <P>A related amendment is my amendment No. 22, which would delete the current paragraph (d) of section 12 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>To promote the extensive use of the Irish language and the cultivation and promotion of the rich and distinctive linguistic and cultural resources of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Deputy Martin's amendment No.21 is not dissimilar. As I said many times on Committee Stage, the Bill should put much more emphasis on the development of the Irish language.  The current paragraph (d) reads:</P>
      <P>to promote the official languages of the State with special regard to the preservation and promotion of the Irish language and cultures.</P>
      <P>What we need to promote is the extensive use of the Irish language but that is not occurring in our society.  Many parents have changed their attitude to Gaelscoileanna and we must all delight in and support that.  I am glad the Minister did an about-face on the recognition of the Gaelscoil in Ballybrack.</P>

      <P>It must be coming.  The universities must place more emphasis on Irish if we are serious in our intent to promote it.  I do not gain-say that a great deal is being done but in order to send the right signals, to make it an objective that we use the language in our universities and to promote its use, we must put a more definitive provision in the Bill.  The Minister's wording is aspirational but it does not put any onus on the universities as regards the objectives.  I have been consistent on this matter and I ask the Minister to take a more pro-active approach and to enshrine this within the objects of a university.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Deputy's remarks on our amendment No. 21 and her amendment No. 22, the Minister should reiterate and re-emphasise the promotion of the Irish language within the universities, as they are the role models for many of our academic attainments. Although it may be within the objects of a university, it should be copper-fastened within the body of the legislation.  In recent times the language has rightly been promoted through, for example, the funding for Telefís na Gaelige, the re-emergence of teaching children through the medium of Irish and the Gaelscoileanna movement.  We need these developments followed up through second and third level.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 20 proposes a new paragraph (b) to section 12: &ldquo;to protect and promote academic freedom&rdquo;.  That problem has been raised in all discussions on this legislation in the past few weeks and the provision should be included.  The Minister may say it is implicit within the Bill but it should be spelt out to ensure that when the legislation is interpreted it is clear that we have academic freedom.  The State should not over-emphasise its role within universities.  If we are to allow them to develop they may not always agree with what we have to say but that is for the best.  Such a provision will allow them to challenge us.  Our amendment provides a tighter definition of the objects of the university.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Director of Public Prosecutions that the amount of time required to study all the files that arrived <Col N="489" /> in his office during the past five years and produce the statistics requested by the Deputy would be very considerable and out of proportion to any benefit that might be obtained from such study.  The annual report the Director will produce from this year onwards will deal with the relevance of delay to the question of instituting criminal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the reply the Taoiseach has given to this important question.  Is he aware lapse of time has been a significant factor in contributing to decisions not to prosecute in regard to child sexual abuse cases?  Is he aware the Supreme Court has clarified the law in this regard stating that lapse of time need not be an obstacle to proceeding in child sexual abuse cases, particularly where there has been dominance of the child by the abusing adult.  Does he agree there is significant public interest, not least among the victims whose cases have not been prosecuted because of a lapse of time and that it would be timely and not out of proportion to the resources to which he refers for the victims to know whether they might have their cases reviewed now that the law on this matter has been clarified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's disappointment that it was not possible in the few days available from the time the question was put down to the requirement for me to answer it, for the information to be obtained.  To obtain it, each of the files would have had to have been examined to establish that lapse of time was a factor in non-prosecution.  However, I hope as a result of the installation of improved information technology in the Director of Public Prosecution's office, it will be possible henceforth to provide this information.  I will ask the DPP when his first annual report is produced in June not only to deal with the issue of delay in the preceding 12 months but to look over the five year period in light of the Deputy's question and deal in as much detail as he can with the issue.  The purpose of the Deputy's question will be fulfilled in substantial measure.</P>
      <P>Without being drawn into an attempt to interpret the law, and it is not my function to do so, in the case of an indictable offence, lapse of time <i>per se</i> is not an obstacle to prosecution.  In regard to offences of summary jurisdiction, lapse of time is a factor in regard to taking a prosecution.  The issue in each case is not whether the offence is indictable &mdash; the offences in this instance are indictable &mdash; and the length of time <i>per se,</i> it is simply an issue of looking at the strength of the evidence in each case.  The strength of the evidence can be somewhat affected by lapse of time but that can only be judged in each case.  There is no general bar on cases because of lapse of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the recent Supreme Court decision and I acknowledge it is an important decision in this area.  However, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, in this case the DPP <Col N="490" /> sought to prosecute and did not allow any question of lapse of time to interfere with his decision to prosecute.  The matter was brought to the court by the respective accused and it was as a result of that initiative that the judicial decision was made. Lapse of time was not an obstacle to the DPP's initial decision in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but does the Taoiseach agree there are cases where people are still waiting for the wheels of justice to turn?  This is not just a statistical matter.  It is a problem for many victims whose cases have been rejected because of the lapse of time rule which has operated in the DPP's office for a number of years. Does he agree they are waiting for the State to vindicate their rights to justice?  In the Supreme Court case to which the Taoiseach referred, the State was willing to prosecute but in previous cases where such action was taken by accused persons, the State did not go all the way.  In a very celebrated case, the previous case involving lapse of time, the accused abuser succeeded in stopping the prosecution by way of judicial review of the DPP's decision and the State did not appeal the High Court decision to the Supreme Court, thus allowing a well known accused to escape justice. Will the Taoiseach agree that this matter should be considered as soon as possible?  He suggested that we should await the annual report but people want to know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand and accept the concern of individuals who, as children, were the victims of abuse and who are very unhappy that prosecutions were not taken in their cases.  I am not a practising lawyer but my advice is that a lapse of time is not on its own an obstacle to a prosecution and never has been in the case of an indictable offence.  This also appears to have been the understanding of the DPP in the two cases to which the Deputy referred.  The DPP initiated a prosecution in both cases and it was the court which decided in one case that a prosecution might not proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that point later. The Deputy asked a number of questions and I will do my best to answer each of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All files are preserved in the Director of Public Prosecution's office and if there is a change in the legal interpretation of any matter relevant to, for example, the evidential requirements for a successful prosecution and a further judicial decision on the matter which might alter the view taken <Col N="491" /> by the DPP, the file can be reopened by the DPP. The victim is perfectly entitled to ask the DPP to look at the case again.  A person who believes a prosecution should have been taken and that the DPP might make a different decision in light of the recent court case to which the Deputy referred should contact the DPP and ask him to assess the case.</P>
    <P>I cannot say why an appeal was not lodged in the case to which the Deputy referred.  The prospect of an appeal is determined to some extent by the strength of the evidence and judgment in a particular case.  I cannot go further other than to say that the decision in each case is made on its merits.  There is no question of not appealing cases where it is considered reasonable and proper to do so.</P>
    <P>This is an important matter and the individuals and families concerned have a right to be vindicated by the legal system.  The publication by the Director of Public Prosecutions of an annual report which deals with the facts in regard to the work of his office will assist greatly in promoting a better public understanding of the very difficult and important work carried out by this office in the prosecution of offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the points made by the Taoiseach about the annual report but unfortunately it will not deal with the trauma suffered by those involved in child sexual abuse cases.  The DPP's office was set up 23 years ago and, apart from a number of minor changes, there has been no change in its functions.  There is a need to look at the workings of the office in terms of legislation and child abuse cases, particularly those involving minors.</P>
      <P>In cases where the DPP instructs the Garda that no prosecution is to be taken the parents deal only with the Garda.  This is a very impersonal way of dealing with these traumatic cases. In child sexual abuse cases it is effectively a question of one person's word against that of another, unless there is corroborative evidence.  In cases where there is no prosecution the Garda has to deal with families as best it can.  There may be valid legal reasons for not taking a prosecution but families do not understand them.  In a number of recent such cases in which I was involved, the Garda could not properly explain the reasons a prosecution was not taken.  There is a need to reconsider the communications system between victims and their families and the arms of the State which, in effect, decide their future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made a number of reasonable points.  As he said, contact is between people who allege they were victims of crime and the Garda Síochána, not the DPP's office.  The reasons for this are substantial in terms of the independence of the prosecutorial decision.  I agree that this system can be very unsatisfactory from the point of view of victims.  In cases involving complicated legal concepts in regard to the <Col N="492" /> adequacy of evidence in proving guilt beyond all reasonable doubt and the burden of proof in criminal cases, a person with no legal qualifications may find it difficult to explain these in such a way that the victim understands them not only at an intellectual level but also in a more profound way.</P>
      <P>I agree that this area needs to be discussed.  I hope that the increased co-ordination between the various legal offices of the State which will result from the work of the group chaired by the Attorney General and the discussion of the annual report of the DPP will lead to improvements in the procedures.  I cannot say at this juncture what way these improvements will occur. There is a substantial level of scrutiny of the operations of the DPP's office and there have also been considerable improvements in terms of the resources available to that office.  There is considerable appreciation in the House of the value in having an independent decision-making process in regard to prosecutions which is not influenced by transient political or other considerations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that, regardless of how one looks at this problem, figures are available for the rate of prosecutions in child abuse cases, although we did not get them today.  For example, in 1995 there were only 202 prosecutions in child sexual abuse matters.  That is a very low rate of prosecution if one considers that approximately 4,000 allegations of child sexual abuse are made to our health boards every year.  In a six month period in the Eastern Health Board area alone, 415 cases were referred to the Garda.</P>

      <P>It is important the Director of Public Prosecutions should make the judgment <Col N="493" /> independently in regard to each case.  I have already said the improvements in and clarifications of the law can be a basis for individuals to seek to review decisions not to pursue prosecutions. I invite any victims to contact the Director of Public Prosecutions if they believe a review of a decision would allow them reopen their cases.  I do not know if there is a great benefit in producing reams of statistics because they often conceal more than they reveal but it is important that the procedures in this area be humane and considerate.  The concerns expressed by Deputies O'Donnell and Dermot Ahern are relevant and I will ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to take them into account in his independent decision-making process.</P>

      <P>It was, by and large, in line with inflation rates over that period.  In regard to pricing policy, no blame attaches to the Governments of that period, with the exception of the one in 1994, because the following are the increases on the price of a pint of stout in the past six budgets: 1992 &mdash; no change; 1993 &mdash; no change; 1994 &mdash; an increase of 3p, inclusive of VAT; 1995 &mdash; no change; 1996 &mdash; no change; and 1997 &mdash; no change.</P>

      <P>The figures I have are from the consumer price index.  I will give the Deputy the figures on an annual basis to show how the price of the pint has fluctuated.  I will then answer the question in relation to Dublin versus the rest of the country.  In November 1991 a pint of Guinness cost £1.60</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 1993, the price was £1.77; in November 1995 it was £1.90 and in November 1996 the price was £1.96.  Those are average figures but I take on board Deputy Ring's point that the pub has a special role in rural Ireland.  It is a social centre, a meeting place and a venue for various activities, including clinics for Deputy Molloy, Deputy Ring and me.  There is something essentially wrong when 50 pubs in a community of 1,500 people can sell a pint 20p to 30p cheaper than pubs in the cities.  This is something on which the Government will be keeping a keen eye and for which past Governments have had a total disregard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The central function of the Western Development Commission is to promote the economic and social development of the western region. The commission will achieve this by working closely with and adding value to the State agencies and local development organisations that are already operating in the region.  The commission will also work closely with businesses and representative business organisations to create the necessary conditions for private investment and to encourage local, community and indigenous enterprise and job creation.</P>
      <P>The commission will also promote and manage a Western Investment Fund which will provide niche venture capital and equity to suitable businesses in the region which are not currently attracting funding from State or commercial agencies.  The fund will be managed on a professional and commercial basis,</P>
      <P>The Government has committed up to £25 million matching funding towards the fund over the next six years.  The commission will be charged with generating the matching private investment required and in identifying suitable projects for investment.  The fund will contribute directly to job creation in the region.</P>
      <P>The Western Development Commission has welcomed the recent announcement of the Government's new regional job policy with its new emphasis on smaller regional centres.  I have had a number of meetings with the IDA on this matter and will continue to encourage a greater focus on attracting investment in the Western region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission is arranging to meet the job creation agencies later this month to agree an <Col N="497" /> approach to achieving the objectives of its terms of reference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The IDA and the Minister announced financial incentives for building advance factories, working in partnership with local authorities and communities.  Will some of that funding go towards the aims announced by Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, in Galway last week?  As communities that take initiatives will be rewarded, can the Minister tell me what those communities should do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission will meet the State job creation agencies to ascertain their views. They will also meet the county strategy groups.  It is the intention of the commission to produce a plan for the region which will emphasise smaller regional locations.  The clearest indication of the commission's intention to look after smaller regions was the announcement that Ballaghaderreen was to be the headquarters of the commission. This town needed regeneration.  This is the first step towards that, and it is being done in partnership with the Office of Public Works and the local county council which has been the prime mover in this instance.  I pay particular tribute to the members of Roscommon County Council, across the political divide, who agreed to site this commission at the John Dillon house in Ballaghaderreen. That is a clear indication that for the future the Western Development Commission will be concerned about smaller centres.  The partnership between the Western Development Commission, local authorities, regional development agencies and the communities will help this to move forward.</P>
      <P>Already Leader groups are providing seed funds for the development of a profile for each of the towns in the western areas.  Community plans are already being drawn up.  If a town is to move forward it is important that it should have all the details properly profiled.  There will be guidance from the Western Development Commission to help with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have details of that, but the initiative came from Roscommon County Council who first got the funding from the Department of the Environment for the renewal of the house, and Roscommon County Council will be the owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not clear on the role of the Western Development Commission in helping local communities.  There are many questions the Minister did not answer.  Will priority be given to communities where, for example, IDA land is available, or does the commission propose to encourage communities to build advance factories <Col N="498" /> in partnership?  Will the Minister meet some of the communities in the western region who have drawn up plans, because they are most anxious for industries to be established in the smaller towns and villages as advocated many years ago by the western bishops and by previous Fianna Fáil Governments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire Deputy Kitt's tenacity.  He is right to want to see smaller towns looked after. It is the intention of the Western Development Commission to co-ordinate all the development plans within a county, and that would include all the smaller centres.</P>
      <P>The Government introduced a business expansion scheme as an incentive to build advance factories. To date only two, one of which is in Waterford, have been successful.  I understand that one is under way in my own constituency at present in the town of Ennis.  This opportunity is available.  I attended meetings in the west where most of the communities assured me that there is quite a lot of money on deposit in the west.  If there are vast reservoirs of funds in the west, local authorities and banks should encourage the use of business expansion schemes to build advance factories. The IDA policy is particularly advantageous at present in that grant aid for job creation in the west will be biased in favour of smaller towns, despite objections by people in Dublin.  There is a necessity for it in the west.  I also met principal officers in the IDA and encouraged them to get involved with the educational institutions with a view to establishing development parks in third level institutions on the west coast along the lines of the Plassey Development Park established in University College, Limerick.  There are regional technical colleges in Letterkenny, Sligo, Castlebar, Athlone, Limerick and Galway.  Since Limerick University was able to develop a technological park at Plassey, I do not see why other institutions, in partnership with the IDA, cannot develop similar technological parks to advance job creation in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis that communities in Blanchardstown and Clondalkin are not asked to contribute to BES funds to build advance factories and do not have to depend on funding such as the £25 million referred to by the Minister for lame duck industries and given that communities in the west cannot succeed in drawing down funding from the IDA and other development agencies, as do communities in Dublin, what will the Minister do to change the mindset of people who can play a singular role in ensuring jobs are created in the west, particularly by multinational companies?  Communities there should receive similar treatment to communities in Dublin and elsewhere which have fared extremely well in the past 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have to go very far to answer Deputy Hughes.  I have confidence in the west.  There are aggregate assets in the west that <Col N="499" /> will attract industry and of which industry can avail.  There is lack of confidence in investment. Deputy Hughes's family had confidence to invest money in the west and there was no limit to the amount they invested in creating employment. Rather than adopt a negative view, as Deputy Hughes has done, about the BES, community development schemes and profiles for the west, I would encourage people to get together locally to create jobs.  There is a local enterprise network, a partnership between the business community and the unemployed, two prime examples being Ballyshannon and Athenry where that partnership is working to create jobs.</P>
      <P>There is confidence in the west among the community and political leaders should show the same confidence.  Money is available, whether through the IDA, Forbairt, the Leader Programme or ADM, to encourage people to invest in job creation.  I want to see Westport and Kilkee prosper.  I could cite many examples in the west where there is huge investment.  The greatest example relates to planning permissions, to which I have referred previously, and in Leitrim, which was supposed to be the county with the lowest job creation, there was an increase of 30 per cent last year.  There is confidence in the west.  Deputy Hughes should realise Mayo has an opportunity to invest and that opportunity should be taken.</P>

      <P>To put the Deputy's question in context, it is interesting to remind him that in 1987 when the Fianna Fáil Party came back to Government after a period in Opposition, Telecom Éireann employed 15,080 people and in 1994, by the time it had brought its third Government in a row crashing down around its ears, Telecom Éireann employed 12,818 people, a reduction of 2,262 under the tutelage, if that is the correct word, of, at various times, Deputy Seamus Brennan, Deputy Raphael Burke and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.

      <P>Telecom Éireann has had a policy for many years of reducing operating costs, including staff costs, and the company has operated <Col N="501" /> early retirement and voluntary severance schemes in recent years.  The latest such scheme represents a continuation of that policy.  The level of reduction in job numbers and how and when they will be achieved is a matter for the company. The drive towards greater efficiency in the company has taken on added urgency in recent years due to rapid developments in technology and the advent of full open competition in the telecommunications market on 1 January 2000.  The transformation of the company, which is already under way, must be accelerated if it is to survive and prosper in the new competitive environment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should have patience. She dribbled a bibful last weekend.  The company must continually improve its customer focus, service quality and cost profile.  It has set an objective of reducing pay costs by one third or £110 million in the coming four years.</P>
      <P>In January 1997, Telecom Éireann sought my approval for the introduction of a general, company-wide early retirement-voluntary severance scheme over a two year period from March 1997 to March 1999 and I gave approval last month. The schemes were launched by Telecom Éireann on 3 March.  Telecom Éireann must improve efficiency and productivity.  A scheme of this kind would be required whether or not the company entered into a strategic alliance deal.  I am not aware of any other severance scheme under consideration in the company.  It will be a matter for the company to assess in due course the impact of the current schemes on its cost reduction targets.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the consultants who are running the competition for the new station expect to advertise it before the end of this month.  As the Deputy is aware, this is a priority project for the Government.</P>
      <P>The project is included in the economic infrastructure operational programme with an EU grant of £21 million available.  The schedule for drawing down funds under this programme requires that actual expenditure be completed by the end of the year 2000.  The main constraint in complying with this deadline is the uncertainty surrounding the timescale involved in securing planning and environmental licences for the construction of the station.  The Commission can extend the deadline to 2001 and I am satisfied the station can be constructed in time to meet this deadline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that at a meeting I had with the EU Commissioner for Regional Policy, Monika Wulf Mathies, on 13 February last, the availability of EU finance for the project was confirmed. I will demonstrate to the Commission, with the support of independent advice, that the station can be completed by end 2001.

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;voice telephony services&rdquo; is narrowly defined in EU law.  Within that definition, the Government has decided, and the EU Commission has agreed, that the effective date for liberalisation in Ireland is 1 January 2000.  I am not taking any measures to change this but I would like to see the groundwork done within the period available to ensure that competition is effective on that date.  Telecommunications services other than voice telephony have been and are being gradually liberalised in advance of that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should also note that the strategic alliance for Telecom Éireann was agreed against <Col N="506" /> the background of this derogation and the liberalisation programme in general.  No useful purpose would be served by shifting the goalposts at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to an earlier supplementary question I was pleased to hear the Minister extrol the economic benefits of competition.  It is surprising, therefore, that the Government seeks its derogation by not allowing competition in voice telephony services to the year 2000.  Does the Minister accept that cable companies are seen as natural competitors to monopoly telecommunications companies in the deregulated marketplace? What are the Minister's views on the future of Cablelink and the possibility of selling it to an investor who would upgrade it as a telecommunications competitor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Cable has a role to play and legislative measures are being put in place to effect the liberalisation of cable television networks, satellite services and third party infrastructures for the provision of telecommunications.  Much work is being done to liberalise these areas.</P>
      <P>The second part of the Deputy's question depends on what the market throws up.  If any offers are made, they will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with estimates that excess costs in Telecom Éireann will reach £100 million per annum, which is a telecommunications tax payable by telephone consumers? Does the Minister recognise the urgent need to introduce keener competition at an earlier date so that the economy will benefit from it? Is the Minister aware that CableTel, which has begun operations in the six counties, is offering local calls at 2p for an unlimited time?  By delaying competition, we are denying telephone users the opportunity to avail of cheap telephone services, which are essential for business development and to compete with world markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy is an ardent defender of competition but he should bear in mind that we have a legitimate interest in ensuring that Telecom Éireann remains the provider of choice of telephone and connected services to the majority of people.  The period of derogation, which is only until 1 January 2000, was calculated to allow Telecom Éireann time to implement the changes necessary prior to liberalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's estimate of the extra cost to the economy.  There is always an extra cost in any economy where there is a monopoly provider of services.  However, some weeks ago I signed a price capping order for Telecom Éireann which required it to reduce its prices by 35 per cent over a defined period.  Some time after that I was delighted to be `gazumped' by Telecom Éireann which told me it would reduce rates more rapidly.  Liberalisation will not take place in voice telephony until the beginning of the year 2000.  However, the process of liberalisation <Col N="507" /> is already well under way in many other areas, which are just as important for the competitiveness of the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the British Government got £200 million from CableTel for a 15 year licence, which compares to the miserable sum we received for selling 35 per cent of Telecom Éireann.  The telecommunications system in the Six Counties will be improved at no cost to the Exchequer because of private investment.  Industry and telephone users will benefit from the huge reduction in telephone charges.  The rate of decrease in telephone charges here is not keeping pace with that worldwide; our charges are outrageously out of line. The Government's insistence on slowing down the introduction of competition is costing the tax-payers an estimated £100 million extra per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputies Molloy and Brennan insist on persisting with this nonsensical allegation about the strategic alliance for Telecom Éireann.  The two Deputies are aware that the full return in exchange for the 20 per cent share in Telecom Éireann will not be known until we have had a valuation of the company at the end of approximately three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the return at that stage will be considerably in excess of the figures the Deputies mentioned.</P>
      <P>I also remind Deputy Molloy that, in the context of liberalising the market, we will also licence other operators coming into it and a choice will have to be made between getting a large amount of revenue from a licence or allowing the benefit to go to the consumers.  So far this Government has made a choice in favour of the consumers.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>if he will allocate a special sum of £5 million to upgrade the Limerick-Sligo railway line in 1997; the date on which this will be done; the nature of the works to be executed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7118/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions on the upgrading of individual railway lines are matters for the board and management of CIE and Iarnród Éireann.  I have no statutory function in the matter.  The Exchequer provides substantial financial support to CIE and to the railway in particular.  The 1997 Exchequer subvention for CIE is £105 million, an increase of £5 million on the 1996 figure. Approximately £90 million will be allocated this year towards the cost of maintaining rail infrastructure and supporting rail services which are not fully commercially viable.  Apart from the substantial support for the rail network provided through the Exchequer subvention to CIE, there are no other funds available to me for rail investment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware there is an ongoing programme of mainline rail investment which is supported by EU funds and CIE resources, including the Exchequer subvention.  Proposals for EU assisted investment must in each case be accompanied by rigorous investment appraisal and cost-benefit evaluation.  Investments from CIE resources must meet the investment appraisal criteria laid down by the Department of Finance, as well as CIE internal evaluation criteria.</P>
      <P>The current mainline rail investment programme which is supported by EU funds and CIE resources, is included in the Community Support Framework 1995-99 which was largely shaped when the Deputy's party was last in Government. I have already publicly complemented my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, on his involvement in that.</P>
      <P>Even under the extensive investment programme now under way, there is a limit to the resources available for rail investment.  It is therefore necessary to prioritise investment projects on the basis of demand levels and expected economic return.  It will not always be possible to upgrade every railway line to the standard of the main inter-city routes, still less to reopen sections of line which have been closed for many years. Having said that, there are no proposals for closure of any railway lines.</P>

      <P>I am exceedingly disappointed with the Minister's response.  I am sure he agrees that as CIE and its subsidiary companies report to him, policy must be agreed by the Minister, his Department and, ultimately, the Government.  In many cases their operations are subject to ministerial agreement and licence.  In view of the fact that the Government states clearly that there is tremendous economic buoyancy and there is <Col N="509" /> plenty of cash around at present, I ask that the Minister make a special sum of £5 million available for upgrading a line linking two important cities, Limerick and Sligo.  Galway is to the west of that line and it could also be linked to it.  Will the Minister reconsider the situation and persuade his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to make that £5 million available for upgrading this line as a special gesture to western regionalisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more than £5 million in the subvention for CIE this year which was never made available by any Minister for Finance who was a colleague of Deputy Treacy.  As I said, this is an operational matter for the railway company. It is not subject to my agreement, it is not operated under any licence which I issue, nor was it ever operated under any licence which any of my predecessors issued.  It is entirely an operational matter for the company.</P>
      <P>In fact, I could go further and state it is a requirement of EU legislation that railways should be managed independently of Ministers or Departments and that has been the case for some time.  It was the case when Deputies Séamus Brennan, Cowen and Geoghegan-Quinn were Ministers for Transport.</P>
      <P>It would be enormously helpful to the case the Deputy is making, with which I have a great deal of sympathy, if we could be shown that there are viable and real proposals for a demand for the use of the service which would at least cover the operating costs.  Deputies in the area concerned would be well advised to prospect for business in that way.  CIE is making a considerable marketing effort for the service but if business does not come forward which can pay rates which will cover the operating costs, the situation is hardly likely to improve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept everything the Minister said.  Does he agree CIE is manipulating the situation to suit itself in view of the fact that there is no subsidy for the transport of freight by CIE but there is a public service contract which allows it to subsidise passengers on particular lines?  As a result, CIE and Iarnród Éireann are operating trains on the subsidised lines to the detriment of the freight lines which get no subsidy and must operate on commercial criteria.  There is a minimum requirement of 50 miles per hour for trains travelling on these lines to make them commercially viable and, consequently, it is impossible, due to this manipulation, for lines such as Limerick-Sligo to avail of the same equality of opportunity or investment as other lines.  Will the Minister intervene to ensure there is no further distortion in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Deputy on the compendious nature of his knowledge about the operations of CIE.  He has set out the situation fairly in a kind of thumbnail sketch.  The only point where I disagree with him is that it constitutes <Col N="510" /> manipulation.  It does not.  It is common sense.</P>

      <P>I take it from what the Minister said he is satisfied that CIE continues on this operation of lucrative lines to the detriment of the western region, in other words, if it can survive, well and good.  However, he seems to be saying that he has no interest in supporting a proper regional transport infrastructure, which is so vital to my area.  Will he ensure that CIE invests in this line and gives it the same priority as other lines?</P>

      <P>The Deputy may not take it that my view is the one which he ascribed to me in the first place.  That is certainly not my view.  I am not happy with the current situation of CIE.  I will encourage the company and all the people who work in it to continue to make efforts to reduce their cost base and make the company more cost effective so that we can develop the contribution which the railways make to the national transport scene and growth generally.  I ask Deputies opposite to join me in encouraging everybody in CIE to work that way because there is far more at stake here in what is facing the company than the simple short-term questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Transport Acts, the board of Córas Iompair Éireann may dispose, whether absolutely or by way of lease for a term of years or for any lesser period, of property which in its opinion is not required for the discharge of its duties.  I have no function in relation to individual property disposals by the CIE <Col N="511" /> board, whether at Horgan's Quay, Cork, or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I have been advised &mdash; in fact I know this to be the case &mdash; that the Horgan's Quay site is still in use by Iarnród Éireann on an operational basis. The site, which comprises approximately three acres with a possible option on a further two acres, is part of the CIE group's total property at Kent Station, Cork, amounting to about 30 acres. I understand that the question of its future is currently under review as part of a comprehensive examination by the CIE Group of its operational and other commercial requirements at Kent Station.  In this context, representatives of CIE have had discussions with Cork Corporation as to how redevelopment of the larger station area may best contribute to meeting public transport needs in Cork city.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that over the past year or so, a number of inquiries have been received by CIE in connection with the future development of the site.  The parties in question have been advised that, on completion of the comprehensive review to which I already referred, CIE will be in a position to address the inquires on a substantive basis.</P>

      <P>Is it not ironic that the Minister is saying he has no role in the disposal of the site at Horgan's Quay given the precedent set by his former colleague?  How can the Minister say there is an ongoing review at present when the board of CIE decided to sell this property to create 800 jobs within the Cork area?  That deal was scuppered by the Minister's predecessor as a result of allegations which were totally unfounded.  Why would CIE conduct a review on a property which it had decided to sell and on which planning permission has been granted for the development of a high technology park?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no irony in explaining the present position to the Deputy.  It is a matter for CIE to manage the property in its possession and to decide whether its property is required for operational purposes.  It is examining this specific property to which the Deputy referred in the context of its operational needs.  In fact, there are several scenarios in which CIE could use that property to better advantage than that for which it is being used currently for its operational needs. I will not go into those scenarios because it is not my decision; it is a matter entirely for the board of CIE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the site could be utilised better, given that weeds now grow over a ten foot wall there.  The Minister said that representatives of CIE were engaged in negotiations with Cork Corporation.  I understand part of those negotiations pertains to the widening of the road.  Will the Minister agree that is unusual, given that Cork Corporation in granting planning <Col N="512" /> permission for this site indicated it was satisfied there would be a two way lane system, that the tunnel to come on stream would take the excess traffic, that the four way lane system proposed could not be sustained in the city and an agreement was reached to widen the road by reducing the size of the very large footpath?  Given that a total of 37 real jobs were created in Cork last year, would it not make economic sense that this site, which was agreed should be sold on as an industrial entity in which 800 jobs could be created, should be sold?  The Minister has an interest in this and he should tell the board to stick by its original decision and sell the land to ensure there will be real economic investment and real jobs in the heart of Cork city.</P>

Is he also saying that the legacy he will leave to Cork relative to this site is that the widening of the road there is more important than the creation of 800 jobs?  I put him on notice that Members on this side of the House consider the provision of badly needed high tech jobs in Cork is far more important than the widening of the road, particularly when Cork Corporation and the previous board of CIE agreed that two lanes were sufficient in that area and that the site should be used for industrial purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 17, 21 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>Renewable energy currently accounts for 2 per cent of Ireland's total primary energy requirement and almost 6 per cent of installed electricity generation capacity.  As a result of my initiatives to date, renewables are likely to account for approximately 10 per cent of the installed electricity capacity by the year 2000.  The development of renewable energy is a cornerstone of the Government's overall energy policy.  The use of renewables enables us to progress economically without adverse effect on the environment and also strengthens our security of energy supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1995 I announced the winners of the first Alternative Energy Requirement Competition, AER 1, which was developed by my Department in conjunction with ESB to secure up to an additional 75 megawatts of electricity generation capacity from alternative sources.  The response to the competition was such that a total of 34 contracts for a total additional electricity generation capacity of 111 megawatts were offered, as follows: wind &mdash; ten projects (73 megawatts); hydro &mdash; ten projects (4 megawatts);-landfill <Col N="514" /> gas and waste &mdash; six projects (12 megawatts) and combined heat and power &mdash; eight projects (22 megawatts).</P>
    <P>All AER 1 projects must be ready to sell electricity by 31 December 1997.  Projects are at different stages of development with 22 of the 34 projects having secured planning permission to date.  This represents a total additional capacity of 67 megawatts.  Of the 34 contracts offered, 13 power purchase agreements, amounting to 35 megawatts, have been signed to date by developers. My Department monitors the progress of all the AER1 projects.  From the latest information available to me, I estimate that the eventual outcome of AER 1 will be quite close to the original target of 75 megawatts.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will by now be aware, I announced the result of the AER II competition in late February.  This initiative will increase the installed electricity generation capacity from renewables by a further 30 megawatts.  In April 1996 I launched a new long-term renewable energy strategy.  Under the strategy I have set targets for the development of renewables in Ireland up to the year 2010.</P>
    <P>As part of this I will in the coming weeks launch the AER III competition which will seek to secure an additional 100 megawatts from renewables by the end of 1999, made up of 90 megawatts from wind, 7 megawatts from biomass or waste and 3 megawatts from hydro.  It is also my intention to organise a competition at the same time for the construction of Ireland's first wave energy to electricity pilot plant, to be built also by the end of 1999.  Subject to EU approval, European Regional Development Fund funding of 9.3 million ECU, approximately £6.9 million, is available to support successful AER III projects. My strategy also sets annual targets of 30 megawatts for wind and 1 megawatt for hydro for the period 2000 to 2010.  Specific targets for biomass-waste and landfill gas will be decided at a future date.</P>
    <P>The European Union recognises the need to support the greater penetration of renewable energies into the energy market.  The optimum exploitation of renewables can only be achieved within the framework of a co-ordinated support strategy.  For this reason, and considering the important role renewable energy will play in meeting future Irish and EU energy needs, the development of an EU strategy for renewables was highlighted as an energy priority of Ireland's Presidency of the EU.</P>
    <P>As a result of this prioritisation, and following pressure from me, the Commission presented a Green Paper on an EU Strategy for Renewable Energy to the Council of Ministers meeting which I chaired on 3 December last.  Because of the importance I attach to renewables, the Irish Presidency held an open debate on the topic at Council. The Commission's Green Paper was generally welcomed by Ministers who recognised that renewables have a role to play in enhancing <Col N="515" /> security of energy supply and in addressing the environmental impact of energy production.</P>
    <P>The strategy must be capable of facilitating the successful exploitation of the European renewable resource and of supporting the development of a strong, self-sustaining and competitive renewable energy industry and technology manufacturing base.  Only in this way can it make a positive contribution to job creation and economic development.  I expect the strategy and a detailed action plan to be finalised by the middle of 1997.</P>
    <P>The ALTENER 1 programme was introduced by the Commission in 1993 to facilitate the greater use of renewables.  Ireland is committed to supporting the objectives of ALTENER which are: doubling the use of renewable energy sources from 4 per cent of total energy consumption in 1991 to 8 per cent by 2005, trebling the production of electricity from renewables by 2005, and securing a bio-fuels market share of 5 per cent of the total motor vehicle usage by 2005. Pending the introduction of ALTENER II, on which much progress was made during the Irish EU Energy Presidency, ALTENER 1 is continuing.</P>
    <P>In addition to ALTENER, the Commission funds research on renewable energy technologies under the JOULE programme and technical demonstrations of innovative systems under the THERMIE programme.  The THERMIE programme has, to date, created a significant energy impact in Ireland and for this reason I have made a special provision in my renewable energy strategy which guarantees electricity market access for THERMIE supported renewable energy projects.</P>
    <P>At present in Ireland there are nine THERMIE supported renewable energy projects being developed.  These amount to an additional capacity of 16.9 megawatts.  My strategy has enabled these projects to succeed and entitles them to contract for the sale of electricity for a period of 15 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related to wind energy.  The Minister of State is aware that the first wind farm was opened in October 1992 at Bellacorick, County Mayo.  It had an installed capacity of 6.45 megawatts and 21 turbines producing 300 kilowatts and one producing 450 kilowatts.  I want to establish the progress made in the interim.  How many wind turbines are in existence and how many of these are producing power for the electricity network?  What is the installed operational capacity as distinct from references to applications, plans and future expectations, hopes and aspirations?  What has happened from October 1992 to date?  What is the installed additional wind energy capacity?  What type and size machines are in use, how many turbines are in existence and what volume of electricity are they generating?  Is there a fixed formula in respect of <Col N="516" /> payment for electricity sold by wind energy operators into the ESB system?</P>

      <P>I should have prefaced my response to the Deputy's question by giving credit to Deputy Noel Treacy who organised the AER 1 competition.  No action was taken in the period following the initiation of that competition by the various Ministers in power.  I understand Deputy Molloy did not open the Bellacorick wind farm and I will answer his question in any way I wish. He will not dictate to me the way I answer questions. The Bellacorick wind farm was opened by the then Minister, Padraig Flynn, shortly after Deputy Molloy's hasty removal from office. There is a photograph in my office of Mr. Flynn opening the wind farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In the photograph, Mr. Flynn's arms are raised to the heavens and he could be mistaken for a wind turbine because he is so tall.</P>
      <P>I have provided details about the number of wind farms that have secured planning permission and power contracts.  These will now come onstream and we expect the original target of 75 megawatts to be reached during the competition from three sources, mainly wind.  Some of the other farms are in operation and all of the landfill gas sites are in operation.  These are currently producing electricity which is being transferred to the grid.  Two further wind farms will be opened in County Donegal next month.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State gave an extraordinary answer and made reference to points and matters which I did not raise.  I am merely trying to establish the number of wind turbines put into operation since the opening of the wind farm at Bellacorick in 1992.  I made no reference to the person responsible for opening that farm and I do not know why the Minister of State referred to that matter.  How many wind farms and turbines have been put into operation since 1992, what is the installed capacity and how many units of electricity are being produced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I will provide that detailed information if the Deputy is genuinely interested in it. The necessary licences have been granted in respect of 41 megawatts of wind capacity.  Part of that capacity will come into operation in the immediate future and some of it is already in operation.  The producers of that wind energy have obtained power purchase agreements to sell the electricity produced to the ESB.  That is the information sought by the Deputy.  If he desires information about the number of wind turbines, I will provide it and inform him when the wind will commence turning the blades.</P>

      <P>That information is not relevant to any real issue.  The real issue involves the amount of electricity being generated from renewables under the AER 1 competition which was organised by the then Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy.  Out of intended production of 73 megawatts, one project responsible for 7.5 megawatts was refused planning permission.  I expect another project will be withdrawn.  However, we will come close to achieving the intended target.</P>

      <P>Deputy Timmins tabled Question No. 30 which specifically asks the number of commercial and experimental wind farms currently in operation.  Why will the Minister of State not provide that information?  What are his future plans for this area?  Has energy produced by wind farms been found to be more economical than that produced by other sources such as oil, coal and other solid fuels?  If it is competitive, what are the projections for its future use?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>As already stated, we are in the process of implementing AER 1 while AER 11 is currently proceeding.  I will announce the third competition in approximately two weeks which will take account of 30 further megawatts of wind energy per annum up to the year 2010.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period between now and 1999, it will amount to an additional 90 megawatts of wind.  That is the proposal for wind energy during that particular period.</P>
      <P>The costings of wind and other alternative energies are determined by the competition. Under the AER 1 competition, the capped price was 4p per unit.  Under AER 11, this has been reduced by competition to 3.2p per unit.  Given improvements in technology and resultant reductions in costs, I expect that the actual cost of electricity units produced under AER 111 will be further reduced.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State referred to the first AER competition in respect of 73 megawatts of wind energy alone.  The majority of awards under that competition went to British firms.  He also mentioned his predecessor who had, prior to leaving office, included in that programme 15 megawatts for waste biomass.  The Minister of State reversed this decision and transferred the additional capacity to wind farms.  He promised that interested parties in County Monaghan would be brought into the reckoning in respect of the 30 megawatts he announced on 27 February but they were again ignored.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be obliged to answer questions either before a committee of the House or at another forum.  I intend to pursue this matter at EU level because it involves European money and Exchequer funding.  During the last competition there were leaks from the Department on a daily basis and everyone knew who would win.  It is a disgrace that the development in agriculture of primary producers in County Monaghan will be completely restricted in the future through neglect.  The Minister of State referred to wind and everyone in his Department is full of wind and hot air.</P>
      <P>I ask the new Minister to have the decency to consult the files and see what County Monaghan people were promised and badly need.  The project has been sited in Dublin where planning permission will not be obtained before 1999.  Those involved in the project in County Monaghan have a site and a company in place and the corporation tax has been reduced, at a manufacturing rate, from 40 to 10 per cent to facilitate development.</P>

I would question whether they are all alternative energy sources, for example, incineration.  Will the Minister consider allowing a similar debate in this House, during Government time, to the one he referred to in the course of our EU Presidency on renewable energy since <Col N="521" /> this subject warrants much longer debate than can be allowed at present?</P>
      <P>Has any consideration been given to allowing the sale of wind-generated electricity to other consumers, apart from the alternative energy policy requirement, as is the practice in other countries outside the AER projects?  Furthermore, will the Minister be dependent on Danish, British and other operators to provide wind energy, or will he explore the full potential for financing, developing, manufacturing and managing such energy as the Danes have done much to the benefit of their economy and environment?</P>

      <P>On the matter of green electricity being available to others rather than through the ESB, we are at present advancing proposals, under AER III, for people to have direct access to green electricity, the mechanics of which are quite complex, involving a fee to be paid to the ESB for the use of its lines and so on.

It is important that we show the importance of our language to the country in view of our distinct identity and unique culture.  Given the investment in education there is no reason we should not put more emphasis on the utilisation of the language at all levels, particularly at third level.  It is incumbent on us when discussing third level education to give a clear signal that we want more commitment to the language.  The huge investment in the language over the years has not resulted in a greater use of the national language. It is important that universities are given a signal that they have a clear role to play in the Irish language and all its ancillary activities.</P>

      <P>Section 12 sets out the objects of the universities. This is a broad statement of what the universities are established to do.  I have outlined at length at the select committee how our universities, as one of the two major components of our higher education system, are central to the aspiration of people for higher education and personal development and provide an opportunity for life long learning and growth.</P>
      <P>For society universities contribute to the generation of critical thinking and analysis which is essential in any modern mature democracy.  For our economy, universities provide a resource of skill, enterprise and innovation.  I referred earlier to funding for the third level sector.  In 1987 the grant provided to the universities was £92.3 million and in 1996 the grant was £156.1 million.  This was an extraordinary growth in investment, numbers, places and success.</P>
      <P>All aspects of university find expression in the objects provided in the Bill.  Amendment No.20, proposed by Deputies Martin and Coughlan, would involve the deletion of the section as it now reads and its replacement with the revised section.  I have already opposed the amendment as many of the objects are similar to those in the Bill; those that are not I cannot agree to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the issues raised by the Deputies is that universities should have as an object the promotion of academic freedom.  I support the concept of a university as an autonomous academic community.  Section 13(3), as amended in select committee, addresses this issue in a direct and effective way.  The amended section also provides that a university has the right to regulate its affairs in accordance with its independent ethos and traditions and traditional principles of academic freedom in a manner which has regard to equality, the effective and efficient use of resources and its accountability obligations.  Each of the universities, from the oldest to the newest, will be able to fulfil these objectives and obligations to secure their academic freedom.  Furthermore, the amended subsection underpins this affirmation by providing that if there is to be an interpretation of a provision in the Bill &mdash; an issue which was the subject of discussion yesterday <Col N="525" /> with one of the groups that voiced concerns &mdash; the interpretation that promotes the ethos, traditions of the universities and the principles of academic freedom shall be preferred over an interpretation that does not.  I am satisfied we can underpin the tradition of academic freedom and protect it in the amended section.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the important object of economic development should be given prominence rather than be incorporated with social and cultural life as proposed by the Deputies.  They will note paragraph (e) as amended by the select committee.  I received representations from some universities that the reference to innovation and job creation policies and objectives were excessively detailed and instrumentalist.  The select committee agreed to delete this reference and to amend the object further to include both economic and social development.</P>
    <P>Tá sé an-tábhactach dom go mbeadh sé mar cospóir do gach ollscoil an Gaelige a chur chun cinn.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil sé seo á dhéanamh ag ollscoileanna éagsúla cheana féin ach anois beidh sé mar príomh-chospóir acu uilig é seo a dhéanamh.  Ní churfaidh faoi bhráid na Dála Bille ar bith a léirigh chospóir mar seo do na hollscoilleanna. Tá mé sásta go bhfuil an Bille mar atá sé fiúntach agus éifeachtach faoi cheist na Gaelige.</P>
    <P>I consider the promotion of the Irish language by the universities to be a central, worthwhile and necessary part of their mission and the Bill as it now stands imposes on them a statutory obligation to promote and preserve it.  This is the first time such a statutory requirement will be imposed on the universities generally and it will, I believe, give a significant impetus to this important area of university activities.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree to amendment No. 27, proposed by Deputy Keogh.  Under the Bill as drafted universities can already provide courses through Irish if they so wish and I greatly favour their doing so.  If it is Deputy Keogh's intention somehow to force the universities to do so I would be concerned that this would amount to intrusion in academic affairs and a limitation on their academic freedom.  I would not like to be accused of such intrusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response to the amendments.  Much thought went into what the objects of a university should be and anything which improves what is already in the Bill should be welcomed by the Minister.  I cannot understand why the provision to protect and promote academic freedom cannot be accommodated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Irish language I am surprised to hear the Minister infer we would be putting an imposition on the universities by accepting amendment No. 27 in my name, which states that they may provide courses to degree level through the medium of Irish.  It is in keeping with the language of that section that the universities &ldquo;may&rdquo; provide courses so that is a reasonable approach. We are trying to give the universities an active <Col N="526" /> role which will enhance what they are already doing.  If we include among the functions of a university that it may offer courses to degree level through the medium of Irish, we say something positive about the role of Irish at third level.  This is needed and would be welcome.  It sends out the signal that we are serious about the teaching and use of Irish and we want it used at the highest level of education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed this at length on Committee Stage and today.  In including a provision in legislation the Minister says she does not want to be seen to have a heavy hand, yet in other areas of the Bill she puts in the boot. It is easy to fit an answer to the relevant problem in the legislation.  There should be a re-affirmation of Irish in the Bill.  Our amendment is not over-prescriptive and it should be reconsidered, especially given who we are.  We should ensure that the Bill does what we want it to do.  A problem we have always had is that we might discuss ideas in the House and include them in legislation but when they are implemented other people do not necessarily take the same interpretation as us. That is why we want to reaffirm the position.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply contained a rather feeble attempt to deal with the resources issue.  Europe has helped fund much that happened over the last ten to 15 years and we will have greater difficulty obtaining European funding of further education after 1999.  Is anyone, either within the Department or in Government, addressing that problem?</P>
      <P>Our amendments on the Irish language are more specific than the provisions in the Bill.  The Constitution gives primacy to Irish as the first official language of the State and I make no apologies for asking our universities to provide specifically for its development.  The Minister said it was already catered for by making it an object of a university to promote the Irish language but that is a rather general principle and one could argue what constitutes promotion.  Our amendment seeks to oblige universities: first, to promote Irish as a language of general communication within a university; second, to facilitate its use as a medium of instruction &mdash; some are doing so but some future universities may be better at doing it than others, and the degree of emphasis may vary; and third, to provide for the cultivation of the Irish language and its associated literary and cultural traditions as subjects of teaching and research.  Those are comprehensive aims which clearly set out the functions and objects of a university in terms of Irish, the first official language of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish language community is still a minority. It has rights which should be protected and safeguarded in a Bill such as this.  The national universities should have a role in the protection and safeguarding of those rights.  It is in that context that we table this amendment.  We did not <Col N="527" /> think it up off the top of our heads &mdash; we met senior people involved in the teaching of Irish in our universities and in Irish language life generally. They suggested amendments of this type and they have great validity.  That is why we are pursuing them with such tenacity on Report Stage. We often pay lip service to the Irish language. Our amendment is more specific and better than the wording in the Bill, although the Minister takes a different view.  Likewise, it is important to marry the language to the distinctive culture and traditions associated with it.  The language in the Bill is somewhat vague.  It provides that universities must promote &ldquo;the official languages of the State".</P>
    <P>Universities will have an obligation to promote the English and Irish languages because both are official languages of the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill then refers to "Irish cultures" without defining them.  The wording is loose and vague and is open to interpretation.  We put down an amendment dealing with the Irish language which is an improvement on the wording in the Bill and I am disappointed we have not got a response from the Minister.  The amendment would not shock the State or the universities themselves and there would not be many objections as it is not intrusive. To argue that the Minister will not put this in because she does not want to be too prescriptive is a nonsense because the entire Bill is about putting down a framework within which universities will work.  We are putting in a provision in regard to the Irish language and it is not overly onerous on universities to perform the functions and objectives outlined in that amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 12, line 3, after "other interests" to insert &ldquo;and community organisations&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section of the Bill deals with the functions of a university.  Section 13(1)(c) states that a university "may establish by incorporation in the State or elsewhere, or participate in the establishment of, such trading, research or other corporations as it thinks fit...&rdquo; while section 13(1)(d) states a university "may collaborate with educational, business, professional, trade union, Irish language, cultural, artistic, community and other interests both inside and outside the State, to further the objects of the university&rdquo;.  If this was <Col N="528" /> accepted on Committee Stage, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 26 states that a university &ldquo;may collaborate with alumni or other interests and associations both inside and outside the State to further the objects of the university&rdquo;.  The Minister has a related amendment which says a university may collaborate with associations representing graduates of the university.  I am happy with that and I am glad the Minister brought forward an amendment to meet the concerns articulated by alumni and graduates who feel they have a contribution to make to university life.  During discussions on this Bill, we had meetings with convocations etc. It is appropriate that we should recognise others outside of those groups defined in the Bill originally as having a legitimate interest and as having the capacity to make a legitimate and constructive contribution to university life.  I am happy that requests on both fronts have been met by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's amendment No. 25 as it is similar to Deputy Martin's amendment. What is the Minister's response to amendment No. 28?  Convocations were concerned there would be a desire to have people from the locality involved in a university.</P>

      <P>Deputies Martin and Coughlan proposed that a university should be in a position to collaborate with community organisations as proposed in amendment No. 24.  They will note that section 13(2)(d), as amended on Committee Stage, already provides for this.  They proposed an amendment on Committee Stage which would allow a university to collaborate with graduates in furthering its objects and have proposed it again in amendment No. 26.  I indicated at the time that I considered this to be a very positive suggestion.  Therefore, I propose amendment No. 25 where a university may collaborate with associations representing graduates of the university inside and outside the State.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keogh referred to amendment No. 28. I do not agree with the inclusion of a requirement that a university shall have and support a branch of convocation as proposed.  A university may well do this where it is relevant &mdash; it is covered in the previous section &mdash; but to impose a statutory requirement to this effect would be an excessive degree of prescriptiveness.  The approach adopted in my amendment is better and I have no doubt it will achieve much the same end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with that reply but convocations may not be.  There is a feeling abroad that one or two university heads are not too pushed about having a branch of convocation imposed on them.  Is that why Deputy Keogh's amendment is not being accepted?  Convocation has been constructive in terms of this Bill and universities overall.  It is a pity that it is not recognised in some form.  Perhaps the Minister will introduce an amendment when the Bill reaches <Col N="529" /> the Seanad to the effect that it would be desirable for universities to have a branch of convocation. This would not be an obligation on universities but it would be a clear indication from the Legislature that we regard the role of convocations as being positive and constructive as it has been in the past.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(c) academic freedom and its obligations in relation to public accountability and scrutiny.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments propose to insert in the Bill a clear legislative commitment to academic freedom within universities.  Amendment No. 30 states:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) In the performance of its functions, a university shall act at all times to maintain the academic freedom of its members.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 104 is more specific and states:</P>
      <P>In page 22, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Employees and officers of a university shall not be disadvantaged, or subjected to less favourable treatment, for opinions or findings advanced during the course of their teaching or research or as a result of any other activities relevant to academic expression either inside or outside the university.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of academic freedom is the essence of the Bill.  The Bill, as drafted, was injurious to the concept of academic freedom and undermined academic freedom within universities given the proposed degree of State intervention, the power of the Higher Education Authority etc. <Col N="530" /> The Minister did not accept our Committee Stage amendments.  I am surprised she does not want to insert in the Bill a clear commitment that academic staff will not be in any way disadvantaged or discriminated against because of views they may advance as a result of research.  We want to create a climate where people will not feel inhibited by those in authority and will not be afraid that anything they do in a university context will be used against them subsequently.</P>
    <P>During my two years as Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Education I have been disappointed by the degree to which many people in education do not state their views publicly because they are afraid they will be punished in some way by the Minister or Department.  For example, they are afraid they will not be given favourable consideration in terms of grant assistance etc.  This may be an unreal fear but nevertheless it exists.  Many principals have given me information but have asked me not to mention the name of the school as they do not want to get on the wrong side of the Department.  When the free fees initiative was announced a few brave academics stated their views publicly.  However, others played it cute and did not express publicly their view that it was an appalling decision and wrong for universities. It is healthy in a democracy for people to address issues head on.  Professor Mitchell and others are to be congratulated on advancing cogent arguments at that time.  We need to encourage this sort of attitude.  It is important to provide in legislation that people who stand up to the Oireachtas or Government will not be penalised for so doing. Amendment No. 104 provides for this in unambiguous terms, while amendments Nos. 29 and 30 propose the insertion of the term &ldquo;academic freedom&rdquo; in section 13 which deals with the functions of universities.  It is the purpose of universities to pursue and promote academic freedom and I commend the amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms. Keogh Ms. Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms. Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with the issue of academic freedom in the context of section 12 which deals with the objects of universities.  It is vital to underline the importance of academic freedom. It is essential for people in democratic societies to have freedom of thought and expression and for universities to have the freedom to challenge decisions without fear or favour.  This commitment must be specifically enshrined in the Bill. Academics are in a unique position in that they can step back from society and look at it in an objective way.  The ability of universities to challenge us and to ask us to review decisions can only be healthy in a democratic society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that those in education are not afraid to express their views publicly because they are scared of the Minister or Department.  This issue has nothing to do with the Minister; rather it has to do with the fundamental right of people within universities to express ideas which may be unpopular at the time.  They are in a position to analyse what is happening in society and must be able to challenge decisions.  It is essential <Col N="531" /> adequately to protect this right and to provide specifically for it in legislation.  It was unwise of the Minister not to include this concept in section 12.  However, she has another opportunity to underline the importance of academic freedom and I hope she accepts the amendments.</P>

      <P>Section 13(3), as amended by the select committee, strikes a balance between the status of a university as an autonomous academic community and its obligations to society.  It confirms that a university has a right to regulate its affairs in accordance with its independent ethos and traditions and the traditional principles of academic freedom in a manner which has regard to equality, the effective and efficient use of resources and its accountability obligations. Furthermore, the amended subsection underpins this affirmation by providing that should an issue arise as to the interpretation of a provision then an interpretation which would promote the ethos and traditions of the universities and the principles of academic freedom shall be preferred over an interpretation that would not.  I agree with the general thrust of amendment No. 29 which addresses the issue of institutional autonomy and academic freedom.  The revised section 13(3) provides for this and its wording will be more effective than the wording proposed by Deputies Martin and Coughlan even though we appear to be addressing the same issue.</P>
      <P>I smiled when Deputy Martin said some people were afraid to express their opinions publicly. There is another side to the coin. Many people have told me they agree with what I am doing but cannot say so publicly until it is achieved.  There is a tradition whereby people on one side bully those who oppose their view.  I hope the amended section 13(3) will allow everyone to express their views publicly, regardless of whether one agrees with them.  I paid two visits to the universities and invited them to challenge me at this time of great reform.  I have referred on more than one occasion to Newman's ideal of a university, a subject I studied in school books rather than in university. I strongly support the rights of academics to challenge those of us who are legislating for the common good in a way that ensures debate is not stifled and concerns are expressed.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 104, which states that employees shall not be disadvantaged as a result of their teaching, research or other activities relevant to academic expression, the revised section 12(3) will provide sufficient reassurance in that regard.  The discussion on Committee Stage was also useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 30, which proposes that a university shall act at all times to support the academic freedom of its members, I wholeheartedly support the view that academics should have the right to freedom of expression. The way the Deputies are approaching the issue, however, is unnecessarily detailed and has been <Col N="532" /> interpreted by some as being offensive.  The revised section 13(3), which is a positive statement of the position, will provide sufficient reassurance.  It will now be specifically articulated in legislation that a university shall be entitled to regulate its own affairs in accordance with its independent ethos and the traditional principles of academic freedom.  Furthermore, in interpreting the legislation, a construction that would promote the ethos and those traditions will be preferred to one that does not.  Defining academic freedom to any greater degree would not be helpful and might limit the understanding of academic freedom, rather than protect it.  We shall not choose one aspect of academic freedom over another.</P>
    <P>I indicated to the select committee that to go as far as the Deputies are proposing could be misinterpreted by the universities and the wider community. There is an implication that universities would prevent freedom of expression and that has the potential for causing unnecessary offence. Universities are not currently acting in a way that limits academic freedom, rather they continue to promote it.  The amendment proposed by the Deputies could signal an expectation that universities will not continue to act in this way.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was published a number of organisations and trade unions, including the Irish Federation of University Teachers, proposed an amendment to protect academic freedom along the lines now proposed by the Deputies.  I welcome the fact that the select committee listened to the concerns of IFUT, and those of the other associations representing universities.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her lengthy reply.  I am not particularly concerned if I caused offence to any person or persons in the universities in pursuit of academic freedom.  The amendments are not designed to cause offence and if that happened, it was not communicated to me by anyone in the university sector.  The Minister's argument is that the proposals in the various amendments accepted on Committee Stage are sufficient.  I do not understand the reason amendment No. 104 cannot be accepted.  It is not contrary to anything currently contained in the Bill.  It is required.  The Bill will bring together seven institutions from different backgrounds and traditions.  Given that we are effectively putting together legislation for seven institutions in a common legislative framework, there is a need for such a specific amendment.  Having met the heads, I am aware they are anxious to promote academic freedom, but none of us know what the future holds.  In passing legislation we should be conscious of the way it may be interpreted in the future.  That is the reason I am pressing the amendment.</P>

The effect of Deputy Keogh's amendment would be that the performance of the functions of a university would be consistent with the charter, statutes or regulations of a university.  This would necessarily be the case for all of the universities as the Universities Act will not be in conflict with the charter, statutes or regulations of a university after these have been appropriately updated.  I do not consider the amendment would serve any useful purpose.  Therefore, I cannot support it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 15, to delete &ldquo;at least one but not more than&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would allow the appointment of three permanent or full-time employees who are not members of the academic staff of the university to be elected by the non-academic staff.  It would ensure sufficient representation from this section on the governing body.  We tabled this amendment <Col N="534" /> because of the danger that when a minimum is specified that is what is adhered to.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 34 states:</P>
    <P>In page 13, line 19, to delete &ldquo;two or more than&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are anxious that it would be clear in the Bill that three students would be elected to the governing body of a university.  In the Bill not more than two are specified.  Again, there is a danger that only two would be appointed.</P>
    <P>The language in subsection (4) where it refers to student unions or other student representative bodies is very similar to the language used in amendment No. 8, defining a student union, which was tabled by Deputy Keogh and opposed by the Minister.  The Minister may come back to it when the Bill goes to the Seanad because the amendment passed this morning is defective.  This section of the Bill clearly provides for the inclusion of other student representative bodies as well as student unions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the giving of statutory recognition of students' rights to be on a governing body. They have served on governing bodies on an ongoing basis, but that has not been statutorily based and was dependent on the will of the Minister of the day.  In recent years in UCC there was some tardiness in making appointments when, two years ago, the president of the student union had to wait six months to be appointed to the governing body.  Some people thought the delay was because he was of the wrong sex.  I am not sure gender was the issue.  It is welcome that we now have statutory recognition of elected full-time student union leaders on governing bodies. In many universities this has been the norm for as long as I can remember and, generally speaking, student leaders play a constructive role, providing an independent voice on the governing body and representing the largest consumer, the student body.  Increasingly students require and are entitled to a say in the decisions taken within universities.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would examine deferral fees and late application fees for exams in UCD. In response to student union representations the college seemed to indicate it is not a function of the college to be accountable to the students.  The language may have been unfortunate.  I understand what the university may have meant. However, there is some onus on them to give students the fullest information possible and to explain why fees are so high in respect of repeat examination fees, late application fees, etc.  The student union body sought an explanation for this but did not get a breakdown of the costings.  It is because of situations like this that we need the maximum degree of representation on governing bodies and other structures within the universities so that students' interests can be fully articulated and complete answers given to them on issues of concern to them.</P>

      <P>There could be a problem regarding the appointment of young people to governing bodies.  In the event of a change in the composition of a governing body it may be necessary to refer to the legislation and, where initially three students had been appointed to the body, this number might be reduced.  This is the case in the context of Léargas where the Minister has decided to reduce the number of student representatives from two to one.  It would be more specific to provide that not more than three should be appointed, and it would avoid problems in the event of a changeover.</P>
      <P>The Minister says she wants to have gender equity on governing bodies.  Appointing the maximum number of student representatives would make it more likely that such a balance would be achieved.  Will the Minister reconsider the amendments put forward?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things we are trying to achieve is that governing bodies would be much more representative than at first envisaged. Including employees who are not members of the academic staff but who are elected by the non-academic staff is a good development.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment because if it is provided that at least one person be appointed to a board there may be a temptation to limit it to one.  It would be helpful to be more specific.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 34 relates to subsection (4) and provides that no fewer than three students of the university who are elected officers of the student union or other representative body in the university recognised by the governing authority should be appointed.  We have moved away from the &ldquo;grace and favour&rdquo; element of allowing people to serve and we are proposing that elected officers should have the right to serve.</P>
      <P>To satisfy the needs of students and ensure adequate representation at all times, we should specify that three students should be elected.  Will the Minister agree there is a conflict between the wording of subsection (4) and amendment No. 7 which she put forward earlier relating to students' unions?  Perhaps she will reconsider that matter. As can be seen from this section, the amendment put forward by the Minister was too loose and, therefore, flawed.  That matter should be re-examined, if not now perhaps in the other House. I support the amendments which would provide for better representation on the governing body of non-academic staff and students.</P>

      <P>Deputies Martin and Coughlan propose in amendment No. 32 that there be no range in the possible number of members of non-academic staff on the governing authority. The provision as amended by the select committee, for between one and three people, allows a university more choice.  Similarly, Deputies Martin and Coughlan propose in amendment No. 34 that there be no range in the possible number of students on the governing authority.  The Bill, as amended, provides for between three and four <Col N="536" /> students, including one postgraduate student.  The Bill, as drafted, provided that there should be at least three students on the governing body.</P>
      <P>The provisions allow each university to have a governing authority which best suits its interests within a broad policy framework.  They give flexibility to the governing authorities to change their structures from the term of one governing authority to the next to adapt to changing needs of the university and society.  I am glad of the warm welcome for placing on a statutory basis the number of students who shall be on the governing bodies.  In accordance with tradition, the Minister has provided, by way of ministerial nominees, that students will have a voice.  They will no longer be allowed serve by grace or favour; it will be their right.</P>

There is a danger that two students as opposed to three would be on the governing body.  We should make it clear there should be three students on the body.  I intend to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 18, after &ldquo;staff&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;who shall be elected for the purposes specified in this section&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 33 is accommodated in the amended section dealing with elections &mdash; we were anxious that staff would be elected.  In amendment 35 we propose: &ldquo;In page 13, line 22, after &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;two of whom shall be the two most senior officers elected to the students' union of the relevant university and one who shall be elected for the purposes specified in this section by the postgraduate students of the university&rdquo;.  It is specifically provided that postgraduate students will be elected.  The Bill, as amended in Committee, refers to not less than two or more than three students of the university who are elected officers.  In students' union elections each year, the main election is for the president and vice-president of the union.  Sometimes students contest the election as a team, but it should be specifically provided that the senior <Col N="537" /> officer of the students' union, elected by all the students, be on the governing body.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the power struggles that took place in my college days, and it is possible that the elected president or vice-president would be overturned by the committee after the elections or during the year.  The majority of the students' union could say the president should not be on the governing body, that the internal relations officer or some other officer should be on it. Students elect a president to lead the union and the candidate for presidency of a union has a clear programme of objectives for the student body which he or she wishes to achieve during the term of office.  The logical follow-on is that person must be on the governing body to pursue that programme, which was voted for by the general electorate of students.</P>
    <P>Under the present wording it is possible, and very probable in some cases, that a mid-year <i>coup d'état</i> could take place among student union bodies which would result in the president or vice-president, the two senior elected people, being displaced.  Very often the intensity in terms of elections for the presidency or vice-presidency does not pertain to other officerships of a lesser status.  In amendment No. 35 we propose the two most senior officers be elected.  The Bill accommodates postgraduate students and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 45 relates to the election of graduates to a university governing body.  As it is worded the Bill states: &ldquo;four graduates of the university, elected by such graduates and, in the case of a constituent university, graduates for the purposes of this subsection includes persons on whom a degree of the National University of Ireland was conferred as a result of their studies at the corresponding constituent college or Recognised College&rdquo;.  We propose to insert after the word &ldquo;College&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and the said graduate members shall be elected by the electoral system of proportional representation by the graduates of the university&rdquo;.   We should maintain the <i>status quo.</i> Members are currently elected by proportional representation.  Members of the Labour Party were aghast at proposals to change the proportional representation electoral system and saw it as a Fianna Fáil attempt to secure power, but their attitude has changed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, believes the single seat constituency with proportional representation is a better option and I agree.</P>

      <P>I accept the thrust of the Deputies' concerns relating to the election of staff and student representatives in amendments Nos. 33, 35, 45, 66 and 67 as proposed.  The Bill now provides for this.  We had an interesting discussion on the matter on Committee Stage. Academic staff, other than professors and associated professors, and non academic staff members on the governing authority will be elected from among the permanent full-time staff.  Professors and associated professors will also elect their representatives.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the most senior officers should be elected.  This would be unnecessarily restrictive on students and universities.  We can trust the good sense of both to work out at local level an appropriate solution to meet their circumstances. Deputy Martin's experience in Cork has stimulated the discussion.  I have appointed to this position education officers, who are not the most senior officers.  The students union has informed me that the current education officer is more than competent at representing his union's view on behalf of students.  Irrespective of <i>coups d'etat</i> and so on, these matters should be resolved at local level.  It might prepare some people for an active life in this House.</P>

Subsection (6) excludes employees or students from the categories outlined.  It states:</P>
      <P>Except in the case of a person appointed under subsection (4) where the governing authority has waived the restriction otherwise imposed by this subsection, a member referred to in subsection (3) or (4) shall not be an employee or a student of the university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsections (3) and (4) deal with representatives of employers, trade unions, agriculture, fisheries, community organisations, the professions and business and industry.  We should allow the bodies concerned to nominate the people they deem to be the best to represent them, regardless of whether they are employees of a university.  Subsection (3)(b) deals with nominees of regional education boards.  If regional education boards are established, which we hope they are not, and they nominate a student or an employee of a university, the governing body may not accept it. They should not be prevented from nominating people of calibre who could be effective in representing their interests on a governing body.

      <P>One of my aims in putting forward revised governing structures is to widen the representational base of governing authorities. Unless the provisions ensure this, the Bill might not widen the representative base but merely result in governing authorities including more members of the university community.  For that reason, I do not agree with the deletion of subsection (6), as proposed by the Deputies in amendments Nos. 36 and 65.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (6), as amended by the select committee, each university can decide, if it so wishes, that graduates and co-optees representing, among others, artistic and cultural interests may be drawn from the academic staff, non-academic staff or student body.  It is important, in the interests of governing bodies, that the backgrounds of their members are diverse and that there should be checks imposed on the likely tendency towards inclusion of members of the university community.  We are looking for a balance and in order to achieve it, it is reasonable that, in the interests of diversity, the representatives of the wider community, the education boards or ministerial nominees should not be employees of the university or students.  I spell that out because it is one of the policy differences.</P>

      <P>I was not being facetious earlier when we discussed the students' union.  There are tremendous power struggles in students' unions.  During our time at university we had to deal with Democratic Left, or the Workers Party as it was then called, because it had infiltrated almost every students' union in the country.  Some of its practices were not totally democratic and it would not have been beyond it or other parties to oust a president of a students' union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section excludes the possibility of an employee of a university, who may not be on the governing body because he is not a member of <Col N="541" /> the academic staff, being nominated because of other activities outside the university.  We should be flexible in such situations.  Accepting our amendment will not endanger the Minister's objectives of widening the representational base of governing authorities.  We have no difficulty with people from other sectors being appointed to governing bodies in accordance with their wishes.  However, the Minister seemed to indicate this Bill may not result in the widening of the representational base of governing bodies.</P>

      <P>In page 13, line 29, to delete &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That subsection deals with the number of persons chosen by a committee of the governing authority comprising the chief officer and two other members from the nominations made by such organisations and we suggest that the number be &ldquo;two&rdquo; and not &ldquo;four&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 38 states:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 31, after &ldquo;members&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;one of whom shall be drawn from the academic staff and the other a student, these members having been duly elected under the terms of the relevant subsections of section 15 of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 40 states:</P>
      <P>In page 13, lines 35 to 37, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;of&rdquo; in line 35 down to and including line 37.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lines referred to in amendment No. 40 are &ldquo;of whom at least one shall be chosen from those nominated by organisations representative of business or industry&rdquo;.  We do not see why the Bill should specify that, of all the groups, particular preference should be given to business and industry. If we list the range of groups entitled to make nominations, we should leave it at that.  In the Bill we are directing that at least one shall be chosen from those nominated by organisations representative of business or industry.  That gives primacy to business or industry over agriculture, fisheries, community organisations, the professions, etc. The lines of demarcation between all of these areas have become much more blurred in modern <Col N="542" /> society than heretofore.  Perhaps it is unnecessary to use those words in this subsection.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that agricultural interests would play a more important role than business or industry in some universities.  Agriculture is a business but the language of the Bill suggests that agriculture is not a business and business or industry is a separate category.  At UCC, for example, where food research is particularly important and the food department constitutes an extremely important niche in the university, there is huge collaboration with the food industry in general and it seems there is no need for this specific reference in the Bill.  It should be a fairly general reference.  There should be a list of organisations and it should be left up to the universities to select the required number of people.  As the Bill stands, just one person could be chosen.</P>

      <P>I do not agree there should be a limit of two in the number of wider community representatives on a governing authority as proposed by Deputies Martin and Coughlan in amendment No. 37.  Representatives from business, agriculture and fisheries organisations can have an important input into universities.</P>
      <P>Likewise, I do not support the suggestion of Deputies Martin and Coughlan in amendment No. 40 to delete the requirement that at least one of the wider community representatives be nominated by an organisation representing business or industry.  The present provision is in keeping with the recommendations of the Moriarty task force report on the implementation of the Culliton report.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the governing authority sub-committee, which will select the wider community members, should be so restrictively defined as Deputies Martin and Coughlan have proposed in amendment No. 38.  This is a level of detail which I hope to avoid.  The governing authority should be able to select the members of the sub-committee in any way it considers fit.</P>

      <P>If we were to tease out the matter of setting up sub-committees again, which, unfortunately, is not possible, I would have a few reservations with regard to the governing authority choosing these people.  That said, it could happen that a certain number of people would select the organisations which would be represented. They may have a propensity to appoint members of certain professions or trade unions which might not encompass what the governing body might wish to include.  A university may have an attachment to certain professions or provide different academic studies conducive to the area in which it is situated.  Specifying the inclusion of a member of the academic staff on the governing body would be appropriate to ensure that the degrees and studies being introduced would be reflected in the professions represented on it.  County Donegal is noted for its fisheries development, but the requirements of the fisheries industry was not addressed in legislation <Col N="543" /> dealing with the regional technical college. No member of the fish processors organisation or fisheries organisation was included on its board and the members of it were not particularly interested in fisheries development, which I consider is very important in that area.  The appointment of a member of the academic staff to the sub-committee of the governing authority would ensure greater liaison between the industry and the professions one is trying to provide for within the university.  That is what we are trying to provide for in universities by ensuring those interests will be represented on the governing bodies.  That is why I support amendment No. 38.</P>
      <P>As students have an input into the development of colleges, they too should be involved in the sub-committee.  Will the Minister reconsider this matter?  She will probably say we are being over-prescriptive again.  However, the inclusion of a member of the academic staff and a student on the sub-committee would ensure that the governing body would be representative of the organisations referred to in subsection (3)(a).</P>

      <P>Subsection (3)(a) states that on the governing authority there shall be at least one but not more than four persons chosen by a committee of the governing authority.

We celebrate the role of the students and they should be included in these type of processes. The committee will choose at least one from among nominations by organisations representative of employers, trade unions, agriculture, fisheries, community organisations, professions or business and industry as the governing authority considers appropriate.  If the committee of the governing authority were to choose only one nomination, would it have to be from business and industry?  If so, that is unnecessarily restrictive.  Why should there be that qualification? The Minister said she does not want to be too prescriptive, but that is very prescriptive.  She is saying that if only one nomination is chosen it should be from business and industry and not from the arts, other cultural areas or community organisations.  This subsection is potentially very prescriptive and tightly drawn.  A broader wording of it, which would allow universities to select people from outside interests, would be far better, as many of the lines of demarcation are blurred.</P>

      <P>This provision is in keeping with the recommendations of the Moriarty task force report on the implementation of the Culliton report that there should be much closer links between the universities and the business community. Subsection (7) provides that the possibility of only one nomination applies to Maynooth and Trinity College only.  The other universities will have a greater number.  This is <Col N="544" /> about balance, the need for the governing bodies of the universities to be in partnership with their community and the need to weave into this the recommendation of the Moriarty task force report on the implementation of the Culliton report that where there is the minimum nomination of one it would be in those universities.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be pernickety, but the wording of subsection (3)(a) is confusing. There should be proper definitions.  The subsection could be improved.  Agriculture is a business and an industry.  If the word &ldquo;industry&rdquo; were inserted in the subsection, it would cover agriculture, fisheries, the arts and other sectors.  The words &ldquo;business and industry&rdquo; would be adequate.  We have witnessed the growth of adult and continuing education, and the role of universities in that regard.  Adult and continuing education is potentially one of the most important agents for social reform and for increasing participation rates in education not only among the adult community, but following adult participation down the line among children.  There is a view that community organisations are the Cinderella of the grouping in the subsection.  As colleges develop in areas of considerable unemployment and disadvantage &mdash; the north side of Cork is one such area and Tallaght is another &mdash; it would not harm the universities if a representative of the area partnerships outlined in the PESP or the community groups in those areas was on their governing bodies.  The perspective of those community groups needs to be articulated.  One of the great difficulties faced by mature students, to which the universities are trying to respond, is ensuring that adult education is part of the ethos of universities.  Timetabling poses the greatest difficulty for mature students, particularly women returning to education and often governing authorities are not as conscious of that as they should be.  If people from that community of interests were members of a governing body, there would be a greater possibility of those difficulties being more effectively articulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That subsection could be tidied up.  I accept that business and industry could mean almost anything, given the changes in modern technology. There is no need to identify fisheries, agriculture, trade unions and employers in the subsection.  Presumably business and industry covers those groups.  I am interested in the community organisations.  There was a tradition of prejudice towards the appointment of a member of a community association to a governing body. There is a strong and compelling case for the appointment of a community representative to university authorities, particularly in areas where State agencies are combining and trying to co-ordinate efforts to combat social disadvantage and high unemployment.  Universities, along with the vocational education committees and other bodies in this area, will be obliged to play a collaborative role in trying to help people escape the poverty trap and other situations.  Education, <Col N="545" /> particularly adult education, is the best way to achieve this.  Perhaps something can be done, between now and the next Stage of the Bill in the Seanad, to strengthen the community role.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 13, lines 34 and 35, after &ldquo;industry&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and organisations representative of Irish language and/or Gaeltacht organisations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the provisions relating to the Irish language.  To date, my entreaties have fallen on deaf ears.  I regret this because the intention throughout was to ensure the strengthening of the Bill's provisions in respect of the Irish language.  I am concerned because, as they stand, the provisions are too vague and not adequately pro-active.  The thrust of the other amendments is similar but amendment No. 39 proposes to insert the phrase &ldquo;and organisations representative of Irish language and/or Gaeltacht organisations&rdquo; after &ldquo;industry&rdquo; on page 13 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There has been a lengthy discussion on what is or is not appropriate, who should be nominated and whether there should be more than one nominee from those who represent business or industry.  When discussing the Irish language and the fact that representatives of the language should be appointed to the governing authorities, it is essential that we consider who will be specifically responsible for the interests of the language. If the Bill contains a degree of commitment towards the promotion of the language within our universities it would be appropriate to appoint to the governing authorities people with a specific interest and expertise in Irish.  The Minister stated that she does not wish to be too prescriptive, however, in many instances, she is being exactly that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the promotion of the Irish language, a very specific skill and expertise is required which will not be obtained by plucking an individual from one of the organisations referred to in subsection (3)(a).  What we need are people who understand this matter, have the vision to ensure that universities actively promote the language, understand their responsibilities and are accountable to their own organisations in respect of their commitment to the language.  It would be extremely beneficial for the universities to have such people involved at that level.  The role of the language at third level would be enhanced and there would be a degree of visible commitment in appointing individuals with that type of expertise.</P>

      <P>I support amendment No. 39 which involves the insertion of &ldquo;and organisations representative of Irish language and/or Gaeltacht organisations&rdquo; into page 13 of the Bill.  It is particularly appropriate in Gaeltacht areas, particularly in the context of UCG, that such a provision be put in place to provide the option to select a person representative of the Irish language and/or Gaeltacht organisations.</P>
      <P>There have been considerable representations to regional boards from groups in the gaeltachtaí and the view has emerged from the gaeltachtaí that their specific interests are not often recognised by the Department or other institutions. Since its inception and establishment, Údarás na Gaeltachta has been very effective in promoting the development of the gaeltachtaí.  In one sense, it has been an industrial promotion body for Gaeltacht areas.  Údarás na Gaeltacht has experience of industry, business and the promotion of gaeltachtaí in a wide range of areas such as cultural, commercial and industrial development and agriculture and fisheries.  It makes sense, particularly in Gaeltacht areas, to foster collaboration. The gaeltachtaí should also collaborate with universities and have a real input in terms of their own regeneration.  The universities have a role to play in that regard.</P>
      <P>UCG and UCC are located in gaeltachtaí and the latter has extensive connections with the Choirca Dhuibhne Gaeltacht.  UCC has a permanent residence in Dún Caomháin where I spent many nights as a student.  I have many enjoyable memories of it.</P>

      <P>Choirce Dhuibhne is inseparable from the development and provision of the Irish language in UCC and the college has adopted that dialect.  However, my point is that a link exists and representatives from the gaeltachtaí of Cúl Aodh, Baile Mhúirne and Choirca Dhuibhne could play an important role or have some input in UCC.  Deputy Keogh is endeavouring to include such organisation as one of a range of groups from which people could be selected to serve on the governing authorities.  It does not place an obligation on universities; it merely inserts after the word &ldquo;industry&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and organisations representative of Irish language and/or Gaeltacht organisations&rdquo;.   It allows somebody to be chosen from organisations representing the Irish language, such as An tÚdurás or other Gaeltacht organisations but An tÚdurás is the first to spring to mind.  That is all Deputy Keogh's amendment seeks to do without undermining the Minister's objectives in this section.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Keogh's amendment, that organisations representative of Irish language and/or Gaeltacht organisations should be included in section 15(3)(a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> However, I accept such bodies would have a valuable contribution to make to universities, including one at governing body level.  Section 15(3)(a) is aimed primarily at the social partners, cultural and other interests being specifically catered for in section 15(4)(a) under which the Deputy's objectives can be adequately met whenever a university considers that appropriate.  This decision should be left to universities in accordance with local circumstances.  My aim in the provisions and composition of governing bodies is to strike a balance in ensuring that certain key stakeholders are involved on all governing bodies with a sufficient measure of flexibility and autonomy for universities.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of Deputy Keogh's amendment No. 41 would have the effect of requiring that Trinity College have at least two members drawn from this category.  Given Deputy Keogh's opposition to the provisions of this Bill, stipulating any outside representation on the board of that college appears to demonstrate a curious contradiction in her approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Keogh's amendment is accepted we can ensure Trinity College is imprinted indelibly on the Minister's subconscious even though it does not fall within the immediate remit of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 39 does not place an obligation on the universities to choose a representative from a Gaeltacht organisation.  It is left to the committee of the governing body established to choose a representative from the list of all those organisations which will include Irish language or Gaeltacht organisations.  Deputy Keogh's laudable objective is to enhance the status of the Irish language and the Minister should seek to accommodate her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, throughout Committee and Report Stages, the Minister has shown <Col N="548" /> an unwillingness to be generous in providing for the Irish language.  If we are serious about an ability to educate young people at third level, through the medium of the Irish language, we must include people with a vision of the language. It will be of particular relevance to some universities because of their location.  If we continue as we are, Irish language education will stop at second level.  The number of students educated through the medium of Irish at third level is minimal, bearing in mind the numbers being educated through that medium at primary and secondary level.  Who will provide the necessary impetus for the language?  Is it to be left solely to those within universities who have a grá for or vision of the language, who wish to see it developed but who have no other demands on their time and attention? Having people to nurture the language, ensuring a place for it at third level, would have a vital, fundamental effect on its teaching at third level.</P>
      <P>To a certain extent we have acknowledged that already universities show a certain commitment to the Irish language but it must be taken more seriously, which would have a knock-on effect throughout society.  As a nation we continue to pay lip service to the language.  The manner in which it is referred to throughout this Bill is minimalist and I regret that because such vague language is not particularly helpful.  We should do something very definite, appropriate to its development instead of leaving it to the goodwill of those with an interest who might lobby on its behalf.  We need to involve people as part of the movement, as part of the overall expression of its development.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider my amendment. Its acceptance is crucial to the development of the Irish language, particularly within Gaeltacht communities.</P>

Many of them have outlined their experience to me and the reason I am contributing to the debate is to ensure action is taken on their behalf and on behalf of the other students in the advanced college of technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputies raised this matter on the Order of Business last week all they got was stone faced silence from smug Ministers.  I referred to the commitment in the programme, A Government of Renewal, to bring forward legislation to regulate private education to ensure proper educational <Col N="553" /> standards, consumer protection and employee rights.  Like many other commitments in that programme, this commitment is not worth the paper it is written on.  I am convinced the Minister was not even aware of this commitment when I referred to it last week.

      <P>It is a terrible pity the Labour Party has not changed its tune.  I wish the Deputies opposite realised they are in Government and have responsibilities.  I am referring to the programme, A Government of Renewal, which was put together by Deputy Broughan's party, Democratic Left and Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>The owners of the advanced college of technology have behaved in a scandalous manner and I want them pursued vigorously.  It is clear from the lack of action to date and the tone of the Minister's comments last night that there is a bias against private colleges.  This is probably for ideological reasons.  I have spoken to students and their families who had to borrow up to £5,000 to further their education.  I am not talking about an elite group; I am talking about 500 students.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have given a serious response to the genuine comments of Members on this side of the House instead of making nonsensical remarks and referring to the White Paper on education, the NCEA, Teastas and a series of programmes and procedures.</P>

      <P>I am talking about students with real problems who are studying computer programming, film, journalism and graphics.  All they want is an opportunity to finish their courses in this college or, if this is not possible, in another college such as Griffith College.  The Minister's response was disgraceful in that it referred to the Government's great plans in terms of the White Paper on Education, the NCEA and other proposals but did not deal with the real issues involved in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the Minister should underwrite the examinership of the college.  She attacked the Bill and compared it to other legislation. Fianna Fáil has always acknowledged that some of its Private Members' legislation is not perfect but I assure the Minister this Bill is very focused.  It proposes that the Minister should make provision for the regulation of private educational institutions, a licence should be required <Col N="554" /> for the operation of a private college and financial security should be provided for the owners. It also proposes the introduction of powers of inspection, an effective monitoring system and a financial bonding system and makes provision for a private students' protection fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not regulated the private colleges sector.  On that basis alone, she is responsible and must be held accountable.  Students have borrowed large sums to further their education so that they can secure jobs.  Some students have already lined up jobs with potential employers.  Instead of attacking the Fianna Fáil Bill the Minister should give answers to the issues of concern to these 500 students who find themselves in a very difficult position.  Time is running out and if the Minister does not take immediate action and underwrite the examinership of this college many of these students will end up on the dole.  If this happens the Minister will be responsible. I condemn the Minister for her nonsensical approach to the Bill and ask her to make a genuine response to the needs of these students.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who have been put in a disastrous position by the owners of the college.  The steps the Minister is taking will help secure their futures and set out parameters for the regulation of private education.</P>
      <P>Before becoming a Member of this House I worked as a teacher and saw at first hand the stress imposed on students by the examination process.  After the enormous stress of the leaving certificate, many students did not want to go through that struggle again.  People who qualify for college, however, usually find that in addition to embarking on an interesting educational course and achieving their qualifications, they have an opportunity to avail of all the facilities college offers.</P>
      <P>An important point the Opposition has ignored is that these students were in the middle of an academic year.  Most colleges are currently processing applications for the 1997-8 academic year, but these students have been left high and dry in the middle of a term.  It is the Government's task to address that problem.  Obviously, it will be difficult at this stage to arrange transfers to other centres of education.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out yesterday, an application to have an examiner appointed to the ATC is currently before the courts.  An examinership is clearly the appropriate legal response to this problem, but speed is of the essence. Those involved should proceed with urgency to ensure the students can return to their studies as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the reason for these last minute tears over another collapse in this sector? The Minister has taken steps, through the NCEA, the NCVA and Teastas to put in place a national certification programme.  She is the first Minister to do so.  She also indicated in the White Paper and in the proposed education Bill how a widespread system of regulation might be introduced. Under the Finance Acts of 1995 and 1996, basic controls were introduced to regulate the third level private education sector.  The Minister deserves much credit for the progress she has made in that area and for providing a basic framework.</P>
      <P>I welcome the publication last January of the first Teastas report which recommended a universal set of national qualification standards across the third level sector.  The formulation of minimum standards to be applied across the board is crucial if the private sector is to develop in the future.  Some Deputies made the point in yesterday's debate that the private sector will expand because the State sector does not have the capacity to meet the demand.  Most teachers know the majority of students want to go on to third level education, either in the public or private sector.  Despite the additional third level places provided by the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, in the public sector, this demand for private sector third level places is a reality.  It is important that the private sector is not seen as a yellow pack alternative to publicly funded education.  That can be assured through rigorous and transparent enforcement of academic standards along the lines upon which the Minister has now embarked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Opposition for providing us with an opportunity to discuss the regulation of private education.  I compliment Deputy Martin on bringing forward the Bill, which is opportune.  I am aware of the difficulties involved in bringing forward a Bill to regulate private education. It is no mean achievement to produce a Bill of such complexity and bring it before the House.  Unfortunately, many of the difficulties in private education are not addressed in the Bill, which contains a number of fundamental flaws. For that reason, the Government cannot accept the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am extremely sad for the 500 students who attended the Advanced College of Technology which has closed in mid-term.  That is a tremendous blow to them and I understand also the difficulty it poses for their parents.  Many parents have made sacrifices to send their children to this college.  The fees were not cheap and, having put two children through third level education, I realise how expensive that can be.  I can understand the tremendous difficulties those parents face.  Even if they have all the money in the world and can afford to lose that amount of money, the blow to the students and to their parents of being cut off in midstream is enormous.  The realisation that their college has gone up in smoke and that the work they have put in up to now may well be wasted is a terrible experience for any young person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> I am confident the combination of court action and the action being taken by the Minister for Education will result in something being done. This has been referred to the examiner and the courts.  Initially the courts have 21 days to come to a decision, and that can be extended.  Because the students have referred it to the courts, we have to await the outcome.  That is generally a swift operation and I hope within a relatively short time we will know how things are to proceed.</P>
    <P>The broader issue of private educational institutions has to be looked at.  We have had private institutions in this State for decades, and we have failed to live up to our responsibility as legislators not only to provide regulation in the academic sense in those colleges but also to provide basic consumer protection for the young people and their parents who use those institutions.</P>
    <P>Not too long ago a private company operating in Cork Airport ran a training course for pilots. The students, mainly young men, paid enormous fees to train and expected they would come through and get good jobs as pilots.  Regrettably that company folded up.  Deputy Coughlan will recall that happened while Fianna Fáil was in Government and, to the best of my recollection, no rescue package was put together.  At that stage the signals should have been heeded.  It involves the same principle.  A private training course was set up.  Students paid their money into it, and the company running the course went bust.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why it was in the programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I have no difficulty with that.  It is in the programme for Government.  It should be regulated.  In fairness, that programme has been in operation just over two years.  I hope most, if not all, of the material in the programme for Government will be covered.  However, there are some items that may not be covered.  The Education Bill currently under discussion is a major work, and I am confident it will be completed.  I am confident also, having taken part in the debate initiated by Fianna Fáil, this process of regulating the private colleges can be more quickly progressed.  Parents who have a child or children in second level education are aware of the opportunities and the courses in colleges and universities and want to do the best they can for their children.  If their child's expectations are not fulfilled when the leaving certificate results come out and the various offers are made by the universities and colleges, parents may turn to a college about which they have seen a glossy brochure without being too aware whether it is a private college.  Often they pay out money without being sure of the outcome because they want what is best for their children.  In most cases what they get is worthwhile but in some cases it is not.  I can think of courses for which students pay substantial sums of money to become, for example, trainee nurses. <Col N="559" /> They feel if they do a pre-nursing course they are almost certain to be accepted in one of the nursing colleges, but that is not the case and, unfortunately, some naive parents pay out money which may be wasted.</P>
      <P>We have the opportunity now, and there is an onus on us, to produce legislation to regularise colleges.  We must control private education not just by introducing a bonding system as suggested in the Bill, but also by regulating for the academic standards of those colleges.  It is crucial that the consumer should get what he or she wants and that there should be protection and standards relating to it.  How many of those private colleges have courses where the degrees are awarded not by Irish universities but by British universities? Why do they bypass the fine universities we have here and go to universities outside the State?  Is that necessary, and should it be allowed?</P>

The Minister will be aware of the concerns of those people because I contacted her about constituents of mine who were enrolled in the college that collapsed. We must be careful not to allow businessmen to view the provision of a service as vital as education as though it were an investment, as in the case of a shop, and to collapse the business because of incompetence or lack of funds.</P>
      <P>We must address this tragedy &mdash; I am sure the Minister intends to do so &mdash; to ensure it does not happen in the future.  Constituents of mine attended the Advanced Technology College and many attend for example, the Portobello College and the massive complex on the south Circular Road, Griffith College.  I am not suggesting those colleges are vulnerable, but they are private and in light of what happened with the Advanced Technology College, the same could happen with them.  As a State, we have no influence over the financial arrangements made by those colleges.</P>

Regulation is essential if students at these colleges are to be guaranteed proper education provision, academic continuity and financial security in the event of the colleges encountering financial difficulties.  Unfortunately, in drafting this Bill Fianna Fáil saw fit to concentrate solely on the financial aspects, presumably mindful of the recent difficulties encountered by the students attending the Advanced Technology College. There are pitfalls involved in drafting legislation, as Fianna Fáil did on this occasion, with one eye on the latest headlines or, as is reflected in this Private Members' Bill, in an attempt to grab headlines.</P>

We are not simply dealing with providers of goods and services whose customers can be protected by a simple bond, as in the case of a person who books a flight to Tenerife.  In this context, the White Paper on Education recognises clearly the complexities involved.  It proposes controlled regulations which would guarantee the academic integrity and quality of courses and qualifications offered, which is of vital importance.  There is no point in private colleges mushrooming numerically, sucking in more and more students unless the students have adequate recognised certificates or degrees on leaving the college.  The White Paper recognised the importance of prescribing institutional norms in regard to, for instance, staff qualifications, support services, teaching and research balance, entry standards and the balance of course provision.  It pointed out that it is important to protect the financial investment of students and their parents.</P>
      <P>Those three planks must underpin legislation governing private colleges.  The Fianna Fáil Bill, unfortunately, relies on only one plank, completely ignoring educational standards.  The Bill stipulates that the Minister shall refuse a licence to a private college if she is not satisfied that &ldquo;the financial, business and organisational resources of the person and any financial arrangements made by him, or to be made by him, are adequate for discharging the actual and potential obligations in respect of the activities in which he is engaged&rdquo;. It is important that private colleges should be solvent and able to offer security to students, but it is equally important, and perhaps more so, that they should offer a proper academic service and that students graduating from such colleges should not find themselves at an educational disadvantage when entering the labour market.</P>
      <P>There is nothing as dishonest as offering young people, who failed in their first choice of institution, seductive courses with glossy brochures, extracting their funds and even if the institution is financially sound, at the end of their course presenting them with a certificate or document which is surpassed by those of students from colleges with recognised teaching standards, degree courses and certificates.  Those students leave college in the full expectation that they have achieved their ultimate goal, a proper education, but are disappointed when they seek a job in the competitive market to find that their qualification is not up to standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Private colleges are plugging a gap which the State is unable to fill.  The demand for third level courses, particularly in technical fields, is growing rapidly and many students find their only option is to go to the UK or to attend a private college. The private college sector is market-led and those scrambling to enter the market range from excellent institutions with high academic standards to fly-by-night enterprises which see an opportunity for the quick buck.  In the absence of proper regulation, <Col N="562" /> the worst colleges will be weeded out only by a natural process of attrition, leaving their students high and dry not only academically but financially.  Although a number of private commercial colleges have been designated under the National Council for Education Awards Act, 1979, many others have chosen to have their courses validated by educational agencies outside the State.  There are no arrangements to ensure consistency and rigour in appraising the quality of such courses.</P>
    <P>The first step towards proper regulation has been undertaken with the establishment of Teastas, the National Certification Authority. There is a commitment in the White Paper to provide appropriate legislative underpinning for the procedures to be implemented by Teastas.  In regard to financial bonding and consumer protection, I understand the Department has already entered discussions with Teastas in this regard and the more reputable private colleges have given considerable thought to this matter.  The framework set out in the White Paper, once implemented, will provide comprehensive safeguards for students and their parents, which is their entitlement.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this important Bill.  Last night the Minister criticised it trenchantly and said it is flawed, simplistic, inadequate and no more than a knee jerk reaction to the current crisis.  That is rich coming from a Minister who this evening guillotined a Bill to which 315 amendments were tabled on Committee Stage and more than 140 on Report Stage.  She should at least admit that a Bill going through the House has the potential of being amended substantially if it is flawed.  The Minister should accept the Bill represents a genuine attempt to deal with the collapse of the Advanced Technology College.  She has refused to take the initiative on the matter and has not introduced legislative proposals or indicated a willingness to amend the Bill introduced by Fianna Fáil.  Her bland promises to examine the position are not sufficient because she has not indicated when we can expect action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The collapse of the Advanced Technology College left some 500 students stranded in the middle of courses for which they and their parents had paid sizeable sums of money.  In some cases parents borrowed substantial sums of money to enable their children take the courses.  I met the group representing the students, parents and staff of the college.  I do not believe the Minister has done likewise.  It is important she meets that group.  The students are devastated by what has happened.  I spoke to an extremely distressed mother whose son is only three months away <Col N="563" /> from achieving his City &amp; Guilds qualification for which he had worked long and hard.  What will he do now?  Is he likely to achieve any benefit from his years of study?  The Minister should take account of the awful trauma experienced by these young people.  They do not believe she cares.</P>
    <P>The collapse of the college has also created considerable uncertainty for students in other private educational institutions.  There has been major growth in this sector of the education system in recent years.  Those institutions bridge a gap, particularly in the technology field, and new language colleges, which are an important source of foreign earnings, are developing every year. There has been an enormous increase in the number of students taking courses at privately owned colleges and they are entitled to some type of guarantee that they can complete their courses. It is remarkable that a young person going on a continental holiday is entitled to the protection of a bonding system, but the same person attending a course at a private educational institution is not.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a great advocate of State control and interference.  She brought the Universities Bill before the House which, in its original form, sought to effect drastic reductions in the autonomy traditionally enjoyed by the universities. The object was to increase ministerial and State control and this also applies to the Education Bill which she introduced recently.  A new network of regional education boards is to be created, a totally unnecessary layer of bureaucracy for which there is no demand from any section of the education system.  That Bill will also undermine the pluralist nature of the system. It attacks the power of patrons to maintain the traditional ethos of their schools and gives the Minister for Education unprecedented control over the running of all schools.</P>
    <P>As the Minister obviously believes in State control and interference, it is remarkable that she has shown such little appetite for State involvement in the collapse of the Advanced Technology College. Nobody is asking her to take over the institution or to involve her Department in the running of that college or any other private education establishment.  She is simply being asked to put in place an appropriate regulatory framework for private colleges.</P>
    <P>There is a world of difference between the travel trade and education.  Nonetheless, if it were possible for the then Government to put in place a bonding system for holidaymakers, surely it should be possible for the Minister for Education to devise a similar system for educational institutions. The bonding system for the travel trade has worked well and something similar is required in the education field, even if the needs are not the same.</P>
    <P>We know from students that getting their money back is not their primary concern.  They want a chance to complete their courses in the same establishment or somewhere similar and to go on to secure the relevant qualification.  Surely <Col N="564" /> a bonding system could be designed to satisfy those requirements.  It is unique that 85 per cent of students who qualify from the Advanced Technology College get jobs immediately after qualifying. That should be admired.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister would signal more clearly whether the creation of a system is really her objective.  If so, she should indicate when we might reasonably expect the system to be put in place.  It is a sham to claim the framework for it is set out in the White Paper because obviously it was not examined properly.  I hope my ears were deceiving me when I heard Deputy Byrne say he had some advance knowledge of difficulties in the Advanced Technology College.  If that is the case and he brought it to the Minister's attention she is culpable in this matter and must find a solution for the students.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure supporting the Bill.  While it might be a reaction to what has happened, is it not better to have reaction and legislation rather than inaction?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers who support this legislation, I met parents of the students in my clinic in the Port View Hotel, Marine Road, Dun Laoghaire, last Saturday week.  Since then I have received calls in my constituency from Blackrock and Ballybrack.  I met the students outside the House when they stormed, in a quiet and civilised manner, the barricades of hope which are alleged to exist in here, but that hope evaporated like a puff of smoke.</P>
      <P>It is tragic that the Minister will not meet the Merrion Square 500.  It is understandable why young people have such a poor perception of Leinster House and politicians.  When the students ask me what I can do to resolve the matter, I have to tell them that in Opposition I can do little more than highlight the position.  That is what we are doing this evening and what we have done during the past few weeks.  I explain to them that we are engaging in a futile and rhetorical exercise and that the Opposition cannot deliver on this matter.  The only people who can deliver are those in power, the Fine Gael Party, Democratic Left, and the Labour Party.  It was nauseating to listen to Deputy Eric Byrne.  I thought Democratic Left represented the worker, the disenfranchised, people below the poverty line and those in situations similar to that experienced by the students at the Advanced Technology College.</P>
      <P>An opportunity arises with every disaster and the same applies to the collapse of the Advanced Technology College, the closure of which has been a nightmare for students and their parents. As examination time approaches, hundreds of students find themselves high and dry, unsure of what the future holds and whether they will be able to complete their courses.  Thousands of pounds in fees have gone down the drain.  The owners of the college have behaved in a reckless, cavalier fashion, perpetrating a serious deception on the students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> There is a tradition in this House that Members from the same constituency, regardless of political parties, do not criticise their opposition.  I do not want to fall into that trap.  The Minister is being less than considerate to these students.  She is a modern day Marie Antoinette who told the students not to bother her and that if there was no bread, they should eat cake.  The Minister has shown that she is out of touch and that she lacks sensitivity.  She has displayed an arrogance, which I did not think existed, by refusing to meet the students.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has always claimed to be a keen advocate of social consensus, which means a willingness to meet those in difficulty or those with proposals, whether trade unionists, employers or interest groups.  Fianna Fáil has always agreed to meet groups under the social consensus banner, even in the most difficult times.  However, the Minister is showing no respect for this custom.  She has rejected all calls in the House to meet the students, their parents or any representative of the 500 students.  We are not only talking about 500 students but about 500 families &mdash; fathers, mothers and guardians who have contributed to the fees.  It is little wonder the profession of politics is held in low regard by young people.  Hundreds of young men and women have been tossed out of their classrooms and on to the streets through no fault of their own.  Yet the Minister, who is supposed to be in charge of education, has taken no interest in their plight.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has offered to help the Minister for Education with this Private Members' Bill which charts a way forward.  We do not suggest that the Bill has all the answers but it is a ray of hope in a dark situation.  However, the Minister has once again refused to acknowledge that there is a problem.</P>
    <P>We must use this opportunity to put a bonding system in place for private colleges.  At present, there is a growing and thriving private education sector which has developed a niche and is providing a good quality of education.  The principal of the colleges mentioned by Deputy Eric Byrne is a man of the highest integrity.  I have no doubts about the financial basis upon which those colleges operate.  They give a high standard of education and to include them in this debate is dangerous and unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The growth in the private sector must be regulated and that is what this Bill seeks to do.  There is a necessity to bond private colleges.  Bonding is a common feature of most other sectors.  If, for example, those students were holiday makers and the travel company to which they had paid money went broke, they would be refunded.  People who invested money with a stockbroker would be compensated or if a lawyer ran away with their money, they would be refunded.  Even the investment intermediary business has professional indemnity insurance regulations.  The education sector must move with the times.  Bonding or professional <Col N="566" /> indemnity insurance must become the norm.</P>
    <P>The private education sector has been to the forefront in fighting for regulations.  After the collapse of Newman College, a group of private colleges recognised the need for regulations and put proposals to the Minister, which however, have not surfaced since.  They remain somewhere in the bowels of the Department of Education and the Minister attaches no priority to them.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to finally recognise her role and duty in this matter.  She has an obligation to ensure that the academic careers of these students are salvaged.  She should ensure that an examinership is viable and recognise that the private college sector is here to stay and must be regulated.</P>
    <P>I am a long serving Member of this House and it is unprecedented that no one has met the parents and guardians of this group of young men and women.  Is it too much to ask that someone meets three or four representatives of these 500 students even if it is to tell them that the Minister can do nothing about it and that the Government is helpless to resolve the plight of the college authorities?  It would be good manners to do this, so I strongly urge the Minister to meet them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the efforts by Fianna Fáil's education spokesman, which have been supported by the Progressive Democrats, to find a solution to this serious problem.  Unfortunately, however, this effort is being met with the type of stonewall politics which I thought were anathema to the Labour Party, whatever about Fine Gael and Democratic Left.  I thought it was a conscientious, democratic party which understood the people's needs.  We are expected to believe that we are riding the Celtic tiger and that the economy has never been better.  However, the Government must tackle the social deprivation, into which these students have fallen, with the strongest possible will.</P>

      <P>I commend my colleague, Deputy Martin, for introducing this legislation although I am disappointed at the reaction from some members of the Government.  It is unfair and untrue to say this is political expediency or a knee-jerk reaction to the problem.  Over the past two years we have had lessons from the Minister for Education on what she has done for education.  We received another nauseating history lesson on her never ending record of what she has done for education but nothing has been done about this specific matter for the 500 students, their parents and the teachers of the Advanced Technology College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this Private Members' Bill <Col N="567" /> shows our concerns in regard to the regulation of private education.  I take umbrage with the Minister who said yesterday that the Bill was too simplistic.  She felt the issues were complex and the framing of appropriate legislation would have to take into consideration constitutional provisions, such as the right to carry on business in a private and commercial capacity, the rights of consumers to protection and the rights of students to quality education.  Nobody on this side of the House has a problem with that.  The Minister feels that the Bill is flawed and ignores many of the issues outlined but claims that the Government, through the programme for Government and the commitment in the White Paper on Education, is committed to moving forward on these fronts.  That might be so but by accepting this Bill we could continue pursuing these goals.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that &ldquo;the complexity of the issues and the risk of getting it wrong if we rush to legislate is borne out by the Bill in which there is serious confusion as to the intended target of its provisions.&rdquo; I would have to agree with the spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats about the House having only two more hours to discuss the Education Bill.  The Minister stated that she introduced the first Education Bill since 1908.  That is true but she must accept hundreds of amendments to the Government's fatally flawed Universities Bill, 1996 and I feel that will be repeated with the Education Bill, which is also fatally flawed.  I cannot see why she cannot be big enough to accept the basis and principles of this Bill and then work with us on Committee Stage to tease out her concerns.</P>
    <P>With the great swell of desire to be involved in third level, further and post leaving certificate education, there is a problem in that there are not enough places.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, is present because he would appreciate the problems which arose in Northern Ireland.  Many colleges and universities were built there and they now rely on southern students to fill the places.  That may be the case here in a couple of years and I cannot see why we do not allow the private institutions to deal with this overflow.</P>
    <P>If students must pay fees there should be a bonding system, although I know there are tax incentives for some.  I agree that validation is necessary.  Students of the private institutions should have the ability to progress to other third level colleges, such as the Dublin Institute of Technology or universities, and transfer from a certificate course to a diploma course and on to degree and masters courses, etc.  This Bill does not provide for that.  It deals specifically with the financial problems and bonding, but we should also provide for validation and allow for progression.</P>
    <P>The spokesperson for Democratic Left said that many of these private third level institutions were fly by night colleges.  I do not know the specifics <Col N="568" /> with regard to the Advanced Technology College but I know of the great reputation of many of the private colleges and that the Advanced Technology College was validated by City and Guilds.  Only for City and Guilds, a highly commendable validating organisation which is recognised by the Department of Education, many of the craft courses, in particular those relating to tourism, catering, word processing, shorthand typing, etc., would not have been validated.</P>
    <P>Many of the 500 students of the Advanced Technology College are not from Dublin.  A few people rang me from County Donegal because they were very concerned about what would happen to these students whose examinations are only three months away.  It is a very serious situation. For this House to leave 500 young people high and dry this year is really a terrible crime, regardless of one's political persuasion.  About £150,000 would be needed to get over this crisis. The students should be allowed to complete their studies and there would be more time to allow them to transfer to other colleges or universities. People have paid fees in good faith and they are in a quandary.  I am sure the Minister realises it is difficult enough to prepare for examinations as Easter approaches but it is frightening that one will not receive proper instruction to prepare for the examinations.  The sum of £150,000 is not a great deal of money as a proportion of the Education budget to overcome this crisis and allow these young people to finish their year of study.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of other colleges which collapsed. It is incumbent on us to ensure that this does not happen again.  One of the criticisms over the years has been that we allow things to happen, get over one crisis and forget it because there is another crisis on the horizon and we have not really addressed the first.  It is important that we introduce regulations and a system of bonding and that the Department of Education assume the role of inspectorate.  The courses must be validated.</P>
    <P>It has been said that some of the courses are not recognised by the NCEA/NCVA, City and Guilds or some of the other validating bodies and I would have serious concerns about that.  Many universities and third level institutions also provide courses which are not validated.  It is important that young people and parents ensure that the courses they choose are validated.</P>
    <P>The points system is very difficult on students, particularly when they must cram before the leaving certificate.  If a student is very young, a private college can be of benefit in that it helps them mature and develop.  It is important that people are aware of what they may face, but that does not get away from the fact that there is a crisis. There are 500 young people in limbo.  Will the Minister reconsider, meet the parents and students and work with them to ensure the matter is rectified?  Will she accept this legislation even if she must amend it and allow progress with a further education Bill so that we can ensure that <Col N="569" /> private third level institutions are bonded and that we will not have to come back here to deal with a similar crisis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on this Bill Opposition members made it clear the main impetus for it is the financial difficulties experienced by the Advanced Technology College.  Like my colleague, the Minister for Education, and Deputies on all sides of this House, I sympathise with students and parents involved.  However, even the Opposition recognised this Bill will have no effect on the plight of the students of that college. There are statutory mechanisms for companies experiencing financial difficulties and these mechanisms are being availed of by the students in question.</P>
      <P>The present position in the Advanced Technology College is that the question of appointing an interim examiner will be considered by the High Court tomorrow, followed by a full hearing of the petition for an examiner on 21 March next. If appointed, the examiner will have an opportunity to put together a rescue package which would in turn be adjudicated upon by its creditors, shareholders and the court.  The examiner will also be required to form a view as to the manner in which the company conducted its affairs and on whether any question of negligent trading arises.  Therefore, the statutory procedures for private commercial colleges facing financial difficulties are already being availed of.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan accused the Minister of not developing a positive strategy to deal with private colleges.  That is not true.  The Government is committed to developing an appropriate regulatory framework for private colleges, as set out in the programme, A Government of Renewal. Much of the work done in developing this framework was outlined earlier.  It includes the designation of a number of private colleges under the National Council for Educational Awards Act, 1979; the work of the National Council for Vocational Awards in developing a comprehensive national certification and assessment system for a wide range of vocational programmes; the work on the development of a national qualifications framework being progressed by Teastas, the Irish National Certification Authority, the first report of Teastas published in January 1997 is currently under detailed consideration; and the formulation and publication of codes of standards to which institutions must adhere to be eligible for tax relief.</P>
      <P>Our approach to the question of regulating private colleges is clearly set out in the White Paper, Charting Our Education Future, which outlines how new control procedures will be put in place in private commercial colleges offering third level programmes which seek State certification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan suggested that consumer protection was not an issue that arises in this Bill. Consumer protection should be an issue in the <Col N="570" /> regulation of private commercial colleges.  The approach being adopted by this side of the House is a dual one which will ensure the quality of provision in private colleges seeking State certification and provide for adequate consumer protection. While important in itself, it is not enough to require the protection of students' financial investment.  Students' investment is not just a financial one but one of time invested <i>en route</i> to a desired qualification.  The Higher Education Colleges Association which represents private colleges recognises that proper academic bonding would reduce the cost of financial bonding.  We need to ensure the quality of courses and facilities on offer and the provision of appropriately qualified professional, technical and support staff.  This is a complex task and cannot be addressed adequately in this Bill which is confused in the intended targets of its provision and over simplistic in so far as it attempts to apply a framework designed for one industry to education providers, without recognising the additional needs of students.  There is an overriding importance of ensuring that the final framework introduced is cost effective and affordable.</P>
    <P>There are no quick fix solutions and it is opportunistic of the Opposition to pretend this Bill represents a comprehensive response to students' concerns.  Only by working in co-operation with the private colleges to establish a system of approval for institutions seeking State certification, including issues in relation to financial and academic bonding, can genuine protection for students be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the tone and content of the Government's response to this private Members' Bill and to the plight of the 500 students who attended the Advanced Technology College.  This Bill is not opportunistic and I resent the use of that term.  We have tried to use all the mechanisms available in this House to raise the issue of the plight of those students.  We have endeavoured to persuade and force the Government to act in this case.  It is a scandal and somewhat unbelievable that a Government would be so heartless in addressing the plight of those students.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister for Education tried to give the impression she had met the students, but when pressed by Deputy Lenihan as to whether she had met the group delegated by the student, parent and staff body she had to admit she had not.  When we raised this issue last week on a number of occasions on the Order of Business we saw the spectacle of the Tánaiste gesticulating to the Minister for Education about meeting the students, but she nodded her head firmly to indicate no.  That is the reality of the Government's response to these students.  We pointed out, and the Minister acknowledged as much yesterday, that these students are not rich.  Many of them have endured considerable financial hardship to secure their college places and are doing part-time work to pay for their fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> This Bill is intended to realise a Government objective in its programme, A Government of Renewal, that legislation on the protection of consumer rights would be forthcoming, particularly in regard to the rights of students and staff of third level private colleges.  That commitment was given by the Government more than two and a half years ago and has not been implemented. Yesterday evening the Minister gave us a rehash of the provisions in the third level sector and what Teastas and the NCEA are doing.  It was a boring and repetitive speech that gave us information we already had.</P>
    <P>The core issue in this Bill is the financial bonding of third level institutions.  The Minister tried to use a legal argument to attack the Bill, but Deputy Lenihan's response immediately following her speech put paid to that tactic.  He demonstrated the Bill is legally sound, has good precedents and is one the Government could accept. Its core principle is that those who pay for a service provided by an institution should have some guarantees and some structures should be put in place whereby, if the provider of a service is no longer in business a fund will guarantee the ongoing provision of that service.  The Bill aims to ensure a protection fund and bonding arrangement will be put in place for third level private colleges whereby, if a college collapses the students concerned could complete their courses. That is the fundamental issue.  The fundamental objective of most students of the Advanced Technology College is to complete their course.  That is all they want.  The staff are willing to help the students and facilitate that process.</P>
    <P>The students have petitioned the High and Supreme Courts to seek the appointment of an examiner to the college.  The Minister referred to this matter yesterday as if it could be resolved by that process.  The difficulty will be that the examiner will require money to enable him or her to maintain the college as a going concern and allow students complete their courses.  That is the issue and the Government should provide that money. In tandem with this legislation, it should create a new situation in terms of private third level colleges where licences must be issued and financial bonding put in place.  In the aftermath of the enactment of the legislation and the securing of bonding arrangements, the Government will have a strong argument for not creating any further precedents in the context of bailing people out.</P>
    <P>I understand that a sum of £150,000 could make the difference in enabling these 500 students to complete their courses.  Past Governments spent millions of pounds bailing out banks and large insurance corporations.  Why is this Administration so reluctant to allow 500 students to complete their courses?  Surely the Government can display some humanity in this situation. The Government has a moral obligation because it has been negligent in not regulating this sector. It has not put in place regulations to ensure financial <Col N="572" /> bonding arrangements in private third level colleges.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>The State has a certain moral obligation to come to the assistance of the students in question, given that the majority of them attended the Advanced Technology College because of the insufficient number of places available in the State's third level colleges, particularly in the specialist areas of cinematography, film, etc.  The demand for places in such areas is enormous and the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design is not able to accommodate the numbers who apply for cinematography courses.  The number of places on offer is small.  Therefore, students are obliged to attend private third level colleges and educational institutions in the United Kingdom. Approximately 6,000 to 7,000 Irish students are attending universities in the UK because they cannot obtain places in Irish universities or regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>Many of the students who attended the ATC would dearly love to attend a State college.  They were prevented from doing so because of the combination of an insufficiency of places and the demographic structure which caused an increase in those attending post-primary education and impacted on the numbers applying for third level courses.  We must understand the motivation which encouraged students to attend this college. I believe the Government is of the view that the sons and daughters of well heeled, middle class, wealthy people attended this college and it is their tough luck that it collapsed because they can afford the expense involved.  Perhaps that is not the view of Deputy Currie's party but I suspect it is the view of the Labour Party.  Essentially, we are being told &ldquo;let them eat cake, they can look after themselves&rdquo;.  That is not the case.</P>
    <P>I met the group concerned and communicated with a number of students.  It is very traumatic for young people to be within an agonising three months of reaching the end of their degree, diploma or certificate courses and, because of the collapse of the company running the college, they are not now in a position to complete those courses.  More alarming is the fact that they are not in a position to receive certification, which is essential as a passport to the employment market and the workplace.</P>
    <P>My only concern in this debate is that the Oireachtas be seen to make a simple humanitarian response to the plight of the students who attended this college.  If our sons and daughters were involved, we would all want action to be taken.  That is the yardstick by which this matter should be measured.  We should endeavour to understand the human emotions involved and not allow a situation to develop where these students will be obliged to attend another college next year and pay a further £4,000 or £5,000 in fees.</P>
    <P>The Government had numerous warning signs about the collapse of the Advanced Technology College.  Other institutions have collapsed such as Newman College, Act and an American-owned college in County Cork involved in training airline <Col N="573" /> pilots where students lost thousands of pounds.  There are precedents and there is a clear argument that negligence occurred in terms of providing a legislative framework to ensure financial bonding.</P>
    <P>Earlier I referred to the lack of places in third level colleges and many of those on offer in the Advanced Technology College involved students studying computer science.  Last week, the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Education, Deputies Richard Bruton and Bhreathnach, announced a series of panic measures to bring additional graduates on stream as quickly as possible.  Approximately 500 graduates with primary degrees have been placed on one-year conversion courses to study computer science. Some of the heads of the universities have indicated they are unhappy about certain aspects of this process, particularly in respect of quality, etc.</P>
    <P>Students studying computer science in the Advanced Technology College would have dearly loved to secure a place on a computer science course in any of the universities or regional technical colleges but they could not because the places were not made available during the past two to three years.  That represents scandalous neglect and was a strategic mistake.  The Oireachtas should take some action in respect of these students.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 5, to delete &ldquo;from a public place&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason I have tabled this amendment is that the definition of &ldquo;litter&rdquo; is too restrictive.  Litter is litter and the concept is clearly understood.  We should not seek to define litter in terms of the location from which it is visible.  It could lead to long and expensive legal battles if litter, as identified by a litter warden, was contested and became the subject of a conviction and a fine on the basis that it was visible from a public place. For those reasons I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The implication is that a public or private place is equally defaced by litter.  Under the Constitution it is important to recognise there are rights in respect of private and public property in relation to litter.  I do not understand why we should discriminate between private and public property.  Given the merits of the case the courts will decide.  The legislation should not be restrictive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how these amendments would work.  Their effect would be to impose an obligation on a person not to deposit litter anywhere either in a public or private place.  This includes private places visible or not from public places.  The amendments are not necessary to add weight to the obligation imposed under the section.  I see no merit in local authorities being charged with responsibility under this Bill for private places which cannot be seen from public places and to take enforcement action for offences committed on private property which is not visible from a public place. There is no role for local authorities in this matter. I want local authorities to concentrate on public places and to deal with litter on private property only to the extent that it is visible from a public place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposed to accepting these amendments as they make for what would be unenforceable law.  I hope the Deputy will accept what I have said.  If the Bill imposes a duty on local authorities to prevent and control litter, this duty must be capable of being discharged in an effective manner. <Col N="578" /> I regret I cannot accept these amendments but I hope I will be in a position to accept some of the other amendments tabled.  If a person is seen dumping rubbish in a place which might not be visible from a public place, that person can be prosecuted in the normal way if it is reported to the local authority.  I think that is a more effective and efficient way to deal with this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to withdraw my amendment.  However, in light of the Minister's statement that a local authority can take action if litter is seen to be dumped in a private place or one which is not visible, I will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>How can a local authority take action if private property is being littered?  I know one case where there is deliberate littering for vindictive reasons.  I am anxious because that avenue does not appear to be open to the victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy Sargent's point, if someone is seen littering and it is reported to a local authority the matter can be followed up.  I know of instances where that has happened.  We must ensure the Bill is operable and can be enforced.  I believe my approach is the most reasonable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 11, after &ldquo;land&rdquo; where it firstly occurs &ldquo;to provide such litter receptacles to&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment applies to property which is divided into multiple flats or apartments.  I seek to put the responsibility on the tenant as well as the landlord to comply with the requirements of the Bill and not to litter the area.  The insertion of this provision would make it the responsibility of the owner to provide the facilities I mentioned to keep the publicly visible lands or property free of litter, and it would be the responsibility of the occupier of the house to make sure these facilities are properly utilised.  It is a measure to provide joint responsibility and it arises from experience in my area.  Landlords or their managers tend to visit their property once a week but unless we put an obligation on the tenants who reside there on a daily basis to keep their property litter free, the objectives of this Bill will not be met.  In my city a good deal of littering takes place in areas of high-density flat development.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill puts an obligation on both the occupier and the owner.  I cannot accept this amendment because I understand it to mean that the owner of a house let in flats would be required to provide litter receptacles inside the curtilage of the house property.  Presumably such receptacles would be for use by the tenants of the flats in the house, because the general public has no right of access to the gardens of houses let in flats for the purposes of disposing of litter.  This being so, I cannot see the sense of the amendment and do not think it appropriate to include such provision here.  It would also have the effect of diluting the obligation on the landlord to ensure the area surrounding the house is kept free of litter.  Simply providing litter bins will not fulfil this obligation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In keeping with the overall thrust and spirit of the Bill I tabled another amendment which would require local authorities to provide a sufficiency of litter bins strategically placed, <Col N="580" /> because if the Bill is to be successful that will have to happen.  It will be inconsistent if the Minister is prepared to accept that amendment, which applies to local authorities, but not this amendment, which applies to landlords and the shared obligation between landlord and tenant.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 43, after &ldquo;litter&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including the provision and maintenance, in public places and adjacent to public roads, of litter receptacles of such type and quantity as the local authority considers necessary to prevent the creation of litter&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is put forward in response to the points raised by Deputy Quill during Committee Stage.  In effect, it achieves the same purpose as is intended in her amendment No. 9.  Local authorities will be under a legal obligation to provide and maintain litter receptacles to prevent the creation of litter.  I ask the Deputy to agree to my amendment, which has been drafted in response to the concern she raised, and to withdraw the amendment in her name.  As with a previous amendment, there is a difficulty with the words &ldquo;shall be required&rdquo;&mdash; as the question again arises, by whom?  My amendment places a duty on local authorities to provide a sufficiency of litter bins.  It does not matter whether it is expressed as a separate subsection but it is being inserted into subsection (2)(c) on the advice of the draftsman.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 6, to delete &ldquo;management&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;eradication&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was unavoidable to repeat this amendment given the frequency of use of the word &ldquo;management&rdquo; in the Bill.  The case for changing the word &ldquo;management&rdquo; to eradication&rdquo; is twofold.  First, I use the word so that the intention of the Bill is clearly understood.  Litter is unacceptable and <Col N="581" /> need not be a feature of society.  The cost of eradicating litter in Ireland is equal to the cost of providing a 50 metre swimming pool, which many people were keen to pursue and promote when Michelle Smith returned triumphant from Atlanta.  However, the money was not available.</P>
    <P>Second, we should set ourselves an attainable objective.  It might sound idealistic but we should not be satisfied with a halfway house.  Talk of a litter management plan is very much accepting that litter is a problem that will always be with us and that we will merely tinker with it.  For that reason I urge that serious consideration be given to saying we want to eradicate litter and express that as often as we talk about a plan for such eradication.  If we fall short, then we have to manage what is left, but ultimately it should be our objective to eradicate the problem, not simply to manage it.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the Deputy's reasons for putting forward these amendments to insert the word &ldquo;eradication&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;management&rdquo;, we should stick with the word &ldquo;management&rdquo;. We are at one as regards the purpose of this Bill and its importance.  I reflected on the point raised by the Deputy on Committee Stage when he felt it was important to let it be known by the language we used that we are not satisfied with litter blighting our environment.  I agree we should not be satisfied but it is inevitable that litter will always have to be managed and controlled, much as I wish to see it eradicated.</P>
      <P>Litter will always be created and there will be a need for street cleansing services.  Places kept free of litter simply do not happen.  They are free of litter because they are cleaned regularly and this has a knock on effect in that a place which is kept clean is less likely to be littered.  Deputies may have been struck by the cleanliness of public places they have visited but they will find they are cleaned regularly.  This is part of a management programme which, apart from cleansing and control of litter, includes the vital aspect of prevention.</P>
      <P>Eradication does not embrace prevention in its remit and litter prevention is a vital component of tackling the problem.  I prefer the title &ldquo;management&rdquo; for the reasons I have outlined and it is also linked closely in some respects with the provisions of the Waste Management Act, 1996. I hope the Deputy does not wish to retitle this Act.</P>

      <P>The debate on the Waste Management Act took place the summer before last and I raised this point with many other Deputies. However, it needs to be stressed.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's point on the prevention of <Col N="582" /> litter and I would be happy if &ldquo;prevention&rdquo; could be included also but I do not expect her to agree to that.  Current practices need to be tightened up.  Traders in urban areas who put out their bins at a much earlier time than required by the cleansing department, for instance, inadvertently create litter.  There is a need to be more courageous about what is done to eradicate litter.</P>
      <P>As I said on Second Stage, this problem is more than a visual blight and an economic deterrent to tourism, etc.  It also causes the deaths of animals and birds.  In particular, marine animals are frequently found during <i>post-mortems</i> to have ingested items of litter covered under this Bill. The message needs to be clearer to the public that this is not just a cosmetic exercise.  I hope this can be brought to bear in the enforcement of the Bill.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister was well disposed to my views and those of other Deputies in regard to publishing an annual progress report on waste management plans prepared by a local authority.  This would require extra work as it would not simply be sufficient to publish a plan and then revisit it three years later.  If we are serious about improving the way in which we deal with litter, want to learn from mistakes, and celebrate achievements, an annual progress review of these plans would mean we would be more likely to seriously tackle the problem of litter.

      <P>Amendment No. 15 has been tabled as an alternative to Deputy Sargent's amendment No. 14 and is a response to the points made by Deputies on Committee Stage during the debate on Deputy Quill's amendment.  It was agreed on Committee Stage that a formal review of litter management plans every 12 months was inappropriate and that a provision should be included in the Bill under which local authorities would be required to prepare annual reports for their councils on their litter prevention and control activities during the previous year.</P>

    <P>I hope Deputies will agree that my amendment No. 15, which inserts two new subsections in section 10, addresses the need for annual reports <Col N="583" /> to be submitted to the elected members.

This will give the elected members an opportunity to assess the council's programmes and any shortcomings.

      <Col N="584" />&ldquo;(iv) the facilities at which waste may be deposited by members of the public for recovery or disposal within the meaning of the Waste Management Act, 1966,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment meets the points made by Deputy Sargent on Committee Stage.  He referred to a possible overlap between the Bill and the Waste Management Act.  Any measures enforced to promote reuse and recycling should be cross-referenced in a litter management plan even though they may be covered in waste management plans as both of these activities are complementary to litter prevention and control.  My amendment requires local authorities to include in their litter management plans details of all waste facilities at which waste may be disposed of and where all waste recycling facilities are located in their functional areas.</P>
    <P>I have used the word &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;recycling&rdquo; used by Deputy Sargent in his amendment as it is the term used in the Waste Management Act and includes recycling as well as reuse.  It also covers a much broader canvas.  I intend to bring the necessity to include details of recovery facilities in waste management plans to the attention of local authorities in the guidelines to be issued by my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking on board the sentiments expressed by me but I am not sure the amendment covers all the aspects proposed in my amendment.  I accept her explanation for the use of the term &ldquo;recovery&rdquo;. However, dog faeces, which is an increasing problem, could not be regarded as litter in the same way as an empty crisps bag.  I said there should be specific reference to this issue in the Bill.  Some local authorities have dealt with this problem on their own initiative but other authorities prefer to ignore it.  Some authorities state the problem has increased because of the reduction in rainfall which gets rid of the faeces.  However, these authorities are deluding themselves if they regard rainfall as an aspect of litter management, whatever about litter eradication.  Has the Minister taken this problem into account?  It is of concern from a human health point of view.  Will local authorities be required in the guidelines to make this a specific aspect of their litter management plans?</P>
      <P>Deputies may see an overlap between the Waste Management Act and this Bill but in many cases the problem of waste is not properly dealt with at local level.  In some cases the issue is regarded as the responsibility of another local authority while in other cases the Department of the Environment makes a momentous announcement from time to time.  For example, the proposed installation of an incinerator in Fingal was like a bolt out of the blue to the local authority.</P>

      <Col N="585" /> Many local authorities regard this Bill as the only measure to which they can develop a response as the wider problem of waste is either being ignored or dealt with by another local authority. There is room for much improvement in this area.  This legislation will give local authorities an opportunity to give serious consideration to the installation of recycling, recovery and reuse facilities in an effort to reduce waste.  For this reason, waste management plans are very important.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy this matter will be covered in the guidelines to be issued by the Department.  The Department will seek to raise public awareness of the problem of dog faeces and the law relating to it after the enactment of the Bill.  I am opposed to amendment No. 18 because it is inappropriate to deal with such a matter so prescriptively in primary legislation.  As far as I am aware, few local authorities provide receptacles for the deposit of dog faeces, and I am unsure what is envisaged to be included by way of guidelines for something that is not provided generally.  These matters should be dealt with in an outline way in a litter management plan and followed up by local authorities providing their own guidelines and information for the public on how dog faeces can be removed and disposed of in a suitably sanitary manner.  That would be the best approach.  I assure the Deputy this matter will be dealt with, but including it in the Bill is not the appropriate way.  I am conscious of the problems the Deputy raised.</P>

      <P>At a public meeting in Skerries last week, one of the many areas in my constituency which is greatly concerned, on health and other grounds, about the problem of dog faeces, several suggestions were made to deal with the problem.  They included the erection of signs reminding dog owners of their responsibilities; obliging dog food companies to provide &ldquo;pooper scoopers&rdquo; or similar facilities; properly informing school children about the dangers of dog faeces and instructing dog wardens to carry out surprise inspections of certain areas from time to time. Many other suggestions were put forward.  The Minister of State said the problem will be dealt with, but I would prefer to hear her say the guidelines exist in draft form.  Local authorities will not do anything about this problem until the legislation is published.  They are being excused inaction because the legislation has not yet been enacted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was drafted to meet the points raised by Deputy Dempsey on Committee Stage that people putting forward useful suggestions should be involved as much as possible in the preparation of litter management plans.  This amendment will achieve the objective of Deputy Dempsey's amendment.  It will give a local authority an option of inviting some of those groups who have made written submissions to make oral presentations of their ideas, or to discuss their proposals further with the local authority.  I would like to see these consultations taking place at the formative stage of litter management plans so that the views of local interests feed into the preparatory process as early as possible.  I expect local authorities will be anxious to engage in discussions with business and voluntary groups on the state of cleanliness and how it can be improved.  This is happening to a much greater extent now.  I am aware, for example, that Meath County Council decided last year to hold a public consultation meeting with all the tidy towns groups in the county to exchange views on how matters might be improved in terms of the council's programmes being better tailored to meet local requirements.  This type of consultation may be robust at times from a council perspective, but it is healthy and useful.  It forms partnerships which combine to make progress, with everyone pulling together rather than against each other. We need more of this type of consultation. Amendment No. 26 is a consequential drafting amendment to No. 25.  I propose, therefore, that the amendments in my name be accepted and ask <Col N="587" /> that amendment No. 27 in the name of Deputy Dempsey be withdrawn.</P>

At that stage the members' attention is focused on the work in hand which is undertaken in co-operation with the many voluntary groups in the community helping to implement this legislation.  I am disappointed the Minister of State's amendment is not a little stronger in regard to these groups, but I hope the local authorities will accept its spirit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's point. This section was amended on Committee Stage to allow local authorities to specify the time period within which a promoter can make representations to a local authority on the terms of a notice the local authority proposes to serve on the promoter for a major event.  Different events have different requirements.  It may be appropriate to allow for a longer consultation period in the case of major events that would be known about well in advance.  For example, the holding of a sale or a major concert would be known about well in advance and there would be much detailed planning to be undertaken by the promoters. Fourteen days for the submission of a response to a local authority might well be too short a period.  Equally, a period of 14 days for consultation might be too long in another instance if the event were mounted on a shorter timescale.  It is better to allow the local authority to specify the time period for submissions when they inform the promoter or organiser of the special measures they seek.  It allows for more flexibility and for the fact that some of these events are very varied.</P>

      <P>Section 21 allows local authorities to make by-laws prohibiting or regulating the distribution of advertising material, but within those by-laws election literature is exempted.  I put down an amendment on Committee Stage to the effect that all political material should be <Col N="589" /> exempted.  I argued for my amendment and withdrew it on Committee Stage on the understanding that the Minister would take the spirit of what I said on board and introduce his own amendment. I regret that has not happened and I want to put my dissatisfaction on record.</P>
      <P>In my amendment I recommended that all political material should be exempted in the same manner as material relating to elections.  While I realise that litter prevention is of paramount importance, I also believe that the right to freedom of expression is of fundamental importance in any democracy.  What I asked for was that the by-law which exempts election literature should apply equally to all literature dealing with legitimate political activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment brings us back to the argument on Committee Stage which seemed to be gaining acceptance by the Minister in that it was not fair to exempt established political parties in the course of a general election from the terms of a by-law that a local authority might make and at the same time allow the local authority to be quite restrictive about aspirant political activity or political activity that was not of a party-political nature but which was motivated by the best of intentions and was to be carried out responsibly.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister given full consideration to the cut-off point proposed in the Bill?  Reflecting on various legal actions which have taken place on the constitutionality of having one set of rules for established political parties and another set for political activity which is not in the mainstream brings up questions of constitutionality and fairness for all citizens.  Has full consideration been given to that point?  I presume it is not the Minister's intention to provide the subject for a lengthy court action based on the constitutionality of a by-law which would unfairly restrict access to freedom of speech by one group or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that there is no question of preventing free speech or of allowing certain political parties to distribute leaflets and preventing others from doing so.  The by-law provision shall not apply to the distribution of advertising material for specific political purposes at the various elections and referenda outlined in the Bill.  That will apply to anybody who wants to stand in an election or say anything in relation to a referendum.  There is no question of any constitutional factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to be clear about setting boundaries in relation to this issue of flyers, because they are a great nuisance.  The matter was considered very seriously after the discussion on Committee Stage, but I cannot accept this amendment because it is too vague and too open.  It would provide an easy way out of complying with the requirements of a by-law made by a local authority. Any issue, local or national, nearly always has a political dimension, and to describe something <Col N="590" /> as being of a political nature is far too wide. Politics covers everything.  We could end up having by-laws without any impact.  Flyers are a nuisance. Putting advertising material on car windscreens creates an enormous problem of litter, as does the distribution of advertising material in the streets.  I have decided not to ban outright distribution in the streets but to make a provision that will allow a local authority to make a by-law to prohibit or regulate the distribution of advertising material to the public.</P>
    <P>A by-law cannot do anything to regulate or prohibit the delivery of advertising material to one's home or office or any place that has an address.  Nor can a by-law prohibit the distribution of materials relating to an election or referendum, and that political activity is not interfered with.  If a local authority chooses to make a by-law under this provision, it does so where it deems it is necessary for the purpose of preventing the creation of litter.  The making of a by-law is a function of politicians.  I suggest that this is a reasonable approach.</P>
    <P>A by-law might be made not to prohibit the distribution of material in the street, but it might regulate the distribution by laying down certain conditions for those distributing advertising material.  The capacity to make a by-law is to deal with litter and we have to accept that a council will not lightly move to make a by-law to prohibit or regulate the distribution of advertising material unless it is faced with a problem relating to the creation of litter.  There is flexibility.  A local authority can determine to bring in a by-law that is suitable for local conditions.  I assure the Deputy that democracy is safe.</P>

I hope the Minister is capable of recognising and admitting that all political dialogue is not confined to the duration of an election campaign, that there is good and legitimate political dialogue on the streets that can be carried on at any given time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the primary law, electoral matters are exempt from the requirements of by-laws.  I proposed that all political material dealing with legitimate political discussion, dialogue and exercise would be given the same exemption as is given to material dealing with elections.  This will be a very poor Bill if the request which I and Deputy Dempsey made on Committee Stage is not met. The Minister, Deputy Howlin, promised that between Committee and Report Stages he would consider this matter fully and take on board the concerns expressed by us about a clear distinction <Col N="591" /> between material of a commercial nature and that of a political nature.</P>

      <P>I could not help but smile when the Minister said that democracy is safe.  Under this legislation it seems the <i>status quo</i> is safe, but that is a subject for another debate.  The Minister said that local authority members will make the decision, and that in itself tells a story.  The people who are successful politicians will make the decision, and it is natural that the decision reached will be in the interests of self-preservation. We have a responsibility to differentiate between commercial and political activity, difficult as that may be, and I am disappointed we have not met that challenge.</P>

      <P>There was no breach of good faith.  This matter was considered fully, as the Minister stated he would undertake to do.  The formula of words was assessed and it was felt this was the best approach.  We must recognise that local authorities have a role to play in this regard. By-laws that are so open and broad as defined by Deputy Quill would have no impact and would do what the Deputy said I am doing, maintain the <i>status quo</i> with people allowed to distribute leaflets as they wish.  The Bill will ensure that local authorities can put controls on the distribution of leaflets in the street.</P>
      <P>I take issue with Deputy Sargent about elected members of local authorities.  They are elected by the public to represent them, and the idea that they are &ldquo;successful&rdquo;, as if that was a pejorative word, is unacceptable.  It is extraordinary that we are arguing that a Minister should determine what local councillors should decide in terms of enacting by-laws in their own streets.  That would not be a good approach.</P>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Quill's concern about this matter, but it has been considered very carefully and the approach adopted protects the public good in terms of the right to have information relating to general, local elections and so on.  We must, however, set down the boundaries.  &ldquo;Legitimate political purposes&rdquo; could mean anything. Who would define &ldquo;legitimate political purposes&rdquo;? We must ensure that a local authority which wishes to bring in a by-law will be enabled to do so under this Bill.  The local authority must protect the public good in terms of public political activity while at the same time dealing with this problem.  People can always distribute material through letter boxes.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 37, after &ldquo;£1,500&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and such community service to eradicate litter as may be decided at the discretion of the Court.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was the source of an interesting debate on Committee Stage.  It proposes that in <Col N="592" /> addition to imposing a penalty of £1,500, a court would have discretion to impose a community service order.  In the case of a very wealthy person the amount of money involved may not be a huge burden and the court should have the option to make a community service order.  It transpired from the Minister's reply that the amendment goes beyond the bounds of the Department of the Environment.  Legal advice from the Department of Justice dictates that under current laws a community service order may be handed down only as an alternative to a custodial sentence.</P>
    <P>If a person was sent to jail for littering there would be an outcry from various people who have commented on prison overcrowding.  It would be much better for society if, for instance, a person found throwing a shopping trolley into a river was required to clean up the river.  Under the law as it stands, however, that would have to be an alternative to a jail sentence, and that is not acceptable to Members of this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the committee in general agreed that the Department of Justice should be asked to amend legislation so that this anomaly could be addressed.  A letter was written to the Minister for Justice on 27 February, following Committee Stage, seeking such a change in legislation and I understand no reply has been received.  Will the Minister say whether the Department of Justice has been in contact with the Department of the Environment, whether the amendment will be made and when we can expect such a welcome change in legislation to provide for community service as a sanction under this legislation?</P>

      <P>This is a good amendment in principle.  I did not realise that a community service order could be handed down only as an alternative to a jail sentence.  I presume the Minister will say that she cannot accept the amendment because the Department of Justice has not made the necessary changes, but that Department should consider the matter.  If that change were made, there would probably be a blanket change throughout existing legislation to provide that a community service order could be imposed as an alternative to a fine.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment, but I understand why it is not possible to take it on board in the context of this Bill.  The principle of the amendment ought to be taken on board by the Government.  I can think of no offence more appropriate to community service orders than breaches of litter legislation or environmental legislation generally.  Under this legislation one can relate the penalty to the crime.  If people throw litter on the street or persist in allowing litter to accumulate outside their premises, they should pay their debt to society by doing community service.  This is ideal legislation in which to apply the principle of a community service order.  While I understand the Minister of State's <Col N="593" /> dilemma, this excellent idea should be taken on board.</P>

If we accepted the amendment the Bill would have to be amended to include imprisonment as a sanction or the legislation on community service would have to be radically amended and the principle on which it is based fundamentally altered. However, I accept it is worth exploring this avenue, but it is not appropriate to do so under this legislation.  I do not believe anybody wants imprisonment included as a sanction for littering.</P>

      <P>The Deputy raised this matter on Committee Stage.  My Department is fully committed to the implementation of Government policy on the provision of bilingual services.  The amendment would impose a legal obligation on the Minister to draft all guidelines and criteria issued to local authorities in both languages.  This goes way beyond well established practice on the manner in which guidelines and circulars are issued to local authorities by my Department.  I do not see the need for such an absolute requirement. I ask the Deputy, therefore, to withdraw his amendment.</P>
      <P>However, I would be happy to include the use of Irish terms, such as &ldquo;bruscar&rdquo;, in guidelines issued to local authorities.  I am anxious to enforce the Bill to get across the message on litter. It is one thing introducing a Bill, but it is another to ensure its provisions are enforced.

      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 23, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>30.&mdash;The purposes for which regulations under sections 28 and 29 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, may be made shall include the purposes of preventing, minimising or controlling litter under this Act.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert a new section in the Bill to create a clear cross-linkage with sections 28 and 29 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, in relation to the powers under the Act which allow the Minister for the Environment to make regulations relating to the imposition of charges on plastic bags or the establishment of a deposit and refund scheme.  This approach is proposed as an alternative to Deputy Dempsey's amendment which is not necessary.  This matter has been looked at closely by my Department since the matter was discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I would like the plague of plastic bags, which is the cause of much litter, eliminated.  Both Deputy Quill and Deputy Dempsey felt that provisions to deal with plastic bags and deposit and refund schemes should be built into this Bill, notwithstanding the fact that the Waste Management Act, 1996, already contains more than adequate powers for the Minister for the Environment to introduce a host of measures to reduce production and to promote the recovery of waste. Specifically, section 29 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, enables the Minister for the Environment to make regulations in relation to or for the purpose of recovery of waste.  Such regulation may include provisions for the imposition of producer responsibility obligations on producers of products.</P>
      <P>Section 29 (4)(b) specifically enables the Minister for the Environment to make regulations requiring a producer, distributor or retailer to operate a deposit and refund scheme.  Section 29(4) enables the Minister to make regulations requiring that any used product, packaging or other waste, including waste which is subject to a deposit and refund scheme, shall be recovered and recycled in a specified manner.  Section 29(4)(j) allows the Minister to make regulations requiring the owner or manager of a supermarket, service station or other sales outlet to impose a charge on customers for any bag or container packaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of these powers to make regulations addresses the specific measures proposed by Deputy Dempsey's amendment.  These powers are already enacted.  Worthy as the principle of the amendment is, we do not need it.  I am also advised that Deputy Dempsey's amendment gives rise to technical legal problems on the basis that if one enactment provides the Minister with powers <Col N="596" /> to make regulations for certain matters, it is inappropriate to include similar powers in another Bill to do the same thing.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes to clarify that the powers to make regulations under sections 28 and 29 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, shall include the purposes of preventing, minimising or controlling litter under this Bill.  This will allow any regulations to be introduced under those provisions in the Waste Management Act, 1996, either to prevent or limit waste or to prevent and control litter.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 39 was tabled because it is easier to prevent litter than to clean it up.  Economic measures are recognised as the most effective way forward.  If the Minister can assure us that the purpose of her amendment is the same as Deputy Dempsey's amendment, particularly in relation to the plague of plastic bags, I will withdraw it.</P>
      <P>If one asks for a newspaper in many new convenience stores, it will be put in a plastic bag.  The Department should consider asking shopowners to display a sign stating that their shops are environmentally friendly.  I saw a sign in a small newsagents recently which read: &ldquo;I do not give plastic bags unless I am asked for them&rdquo;.  This man is saving money but he is also environmentally friendly.  Perhaps this would stop many new convenience stores, such as Spar and Centra, putting everything in plastic bags.  I ask the Minister to consider introducing environmentally friendly standards in retail units which would also save them money.</P>

      <P>It is frustrating to hear about the Minister's powers given that they have not been enforced.  The Waste Management Act, 1996, gives copious powers to the Minister to introduce regulations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dempsey's amendment refers to &ldquo;the introduction of a `refund on return' deposit on glass bottles and jars, cans and other containers&rdquo;. We discussed these issues during the debate on the Waste Management Act, 1996, but nothing has yet been done.  I presume this is a frustrated attempt to enforce the regulations.  There is a litter problem because of the huge increase in disposable packaging and the lack of financial incentives for people to recycle it.  Young people used to be enthusiastic about collecting bottles and jars.  Cans are now collected by schools to raise funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to enforce the regulations under the Waste Management Act, 1996.  Many large shops argue that they are in competition with each other.  If one corner shop, for example, gives a plastic bag to a customer who is satisfied with the service, another shop will also decide to give out plastic bags.  The Minister will say this can be dealt with by regulations, but why is that not happening?  I hope we do not have to depend on the voluntary code which, as Senator Quinn <Col N="597" /> knows, has not worked.  This amendment would not be required if the regulations were enforced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inconceivable that a Litter Bill should not contain any reference to plastic bags, which are a major part of the litter problem.  I am grateful that there is now a clear linkage between the Waste Management Act, 1996, and this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that the regulations relating to the control, limitation and minimisation of plastic bags and other waste under the Waste Management Act, 1996, are enforced at the same time as this Bill becomes law.  If that does not happen, this legislation will not meet its overall objectives.</P>
      <P>We know from past experience that if incentives are put in place there will be a good response.  Where primary schools introduce schemes to recycle cans and there is some incentives at the end of term, pupils respond well.  We must use a variety of approaches by way of incentives and penalties.  My amendment with regard to plastic bags reflected my belief that there should be a charge.  They are all matters which can and I hope will be addressed in the context of regulations under the Waste Management Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>That is my last word on the Litter Pollution Bill.  I hope the two Acts, which are complementary and reinforce their common aim, will be enforced.</P>

      <P>I am glad we were able to deal with this particular issue.  It is important that there is a linkage between the two Bills.  The Waste Management Act was enacted in 1996 and we are tackling waste issues.  The Minister published the draft waste management packaging regulations three weeks ago.  These regulations impose obligations on all business which supply packaging or packaged goods to take measures to deal with packaging waste.  If the voluntary, industry-led schemes do not work, the Minister has made it clear that he will proceed further on the matter but it is important that we first see the progress made by these schemes.  Progress has been made, both in relation to the enactment of the Act and the regulations following from it.</P>
      <P>On the question of litter, the amendment proposed by Deputy Dempsey has been accommodated in this mechanism which ties it in with the Waste Management Act, 1996.  Everybody appreciates that it allows for a streamlined approach whereas duplication could cause problems.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and I thank the <Col N="599" /> Minister for coming in to respond.  The purpose of my being here this evening is to appeal strongly to the Minister to sanction the long-standing application on behalf of these two junior schools at the North Monastery, Cork, for a shared home/school community liaison teacher.  I do so for a number of reason, the first of which is that the school in question has met all the necessary requirements in respect of eligibility for that particular post.  All neighbouring schools without exception on that side of Cork city already have in place this particular type of teacher provision.  Girls who go to the convent school down the road have a home-school-community liaison teacher while their brothers who go to the North Monastery and who come from the same home and community circumstances have no such provision.  That is grossly unfair.  It cannot be condoned and continued.  Not alone do all the primary schools on that side of the city have this kind of teacher but all the second level schools have such a teacher too so there is clearly an anomaly which must be addressed.  It is a grave injustice that little boys attending that school do not have the same kind of educational benefit which their sisters and brothers have in every other school on that side of the city and it must be remedied.</P>
      <P>The North Monastery in Cork is a proud school with a great tradition of education and learning. Its past pupils include people like former Taoiseach Jack Lynch, the late Chris Curran who died this year, Eddie Golding and a host of successful people in industry, business and politics.  The intelligence of the young people in that area has not diminished since those glorious days, but the economic circumstances of a large number of families have changed dramatically because of long-term unemployment.  That is why these schools needs that type of teacher.</P>
      <P>Unless young people get adequate and proper education and training their chances of getting a good job and getting on the ladder of life are vastly diminished.  Unless we intervene and target proper programmes of education and training at areas of long-term unemployment, young people will continue to be disadvantaged for the remainder of their lives.  In light of the circumstances I described, will the Minister give this matter her attention and sanction this shared post between two primary schools, the last remaining schools in that part of Cork city which do not have a home-school-community liaison teacher.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a request for the allocation of a home-school community liaison co-ordinator to be shared between Mhuire Fatima junior and senior schools.  At present I am not allocating additional co-ordinator posts to the home-school community liaison scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is one of a number of initiatives aimed at addressing the problems of under-achievement and marginalisation of young <Col N="600" /> people, as well as poor participation in education in areas of socio-economic disadvantage, a fact much appreciated by the Deputy.  Its focus is to support schools in establishing contact with parents and encouraging them to become involved in their children's education.</P>
    <P>The scheme was originally established in 1990 as a three year pilot project.  However, shortly after my appointment as Minister for Education I put it on a formal footing within the education system.  I have also undertaken its significant expansion as evidenced by the fact that the number of home-school co-ordinators appointed has increased from 30 to 105 during my time as Minister.</P>
    <P>A total of 177 primary schools involving some 51,000 pupils are covered by the scheme.  It has been targeted at schools designated as disadvantaged. Factors taken into account in the selection process include the comparative degree of deprivation among schools and the extent to which liaison type initiatives are already being undertaken in the area.</P>
    <P>The scheme operates under the direction of a national co-ordinator.  A national steering committee oversees its operation and advises me on the overall direction of the scheme.  It is also being evaluated on an ongoing basis by the education research centre.</P>
    <P>The scheme operates within the wider context of the disadvantaged areas scheme which currently embraces a total of 320 primary schools with 81,000 pupils.  Both Mhuire Fatima Schools junior and senior are already included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and share the services of an ex-quota concessionary teacher post.  The schools in question also receive a special allocation of capitation funding at a rate of £75 per pupil.  I am satisfied that the scheme has proved to be a very successful initiative.  I am sure neither the Deputy nor any other Member present would question that.  It is to the forefront in helping combat the problems of under achievement and marginalisation that may reflect the background and expectation of some young people in disadvantaged areas.  My commitment to the scheme is reflected in the White Paper, Charting our Education Future, which provides for all schools to develop a home-school links policy as part of their school plan.</P>
    <P>This year I adopted a particular focus on educational disadvantage and sought to target significant resources on selected urban and rural schools as part of an initiative aimed at breaking the cycle of disadvantage, which we should never accept as permanent.  The Breaking the Cycle initiative is based on the outcome of detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the education research centre.  Under the initiative 33 urban schools and 123 rural schools identified as suffering particular acute levels of disadvantage have been selected for a special package of supports. Each of those schools is preparing a five year development plan aimed at addressing their current <Col N="601" /> problems, while bearing in mind that they are part of the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  The progress of the initiative will be closely monitored to assess its effectiveness as a model of response to problems of serious educational disadvantage in some of our schools.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied my commitment to address the problem of educational disadvantage and to strengthen home-school links is clearly illustrated in the range of practical measures which I have put in place in this area.  It is my intention to continue this process as resources permit.</P>
    <P>I assure the House, and the Deputy in particular, that the needs of both Mhuire Fatima schools will be given every consideration in the context of any further development of services which may be undertaken under the home-school-community liaison scheme or the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leat as ucht teacht isteach tráthnóna agus éisteacht le achainní láidir go ndéanfá rud éigin d'oibritheoirí atá ligthe chun siúil ag monarcha Farah i nGaillimh.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for replying to this matter. It is amazing that some people seem to count more than others.  When staff were laid off in Dublin companies not so long ago high profile Ministers were involved, task forces were established and great efforts were made to provide alternative employment for those workers.</P>
      <P>Recently workers in the Farah plant in Galway in which there was a fire some months ago were informed their employment would cease from 25 March.  Many of those employees, who have worked for a long time in the clothing industry, face a bleak future.  When Digital closed a number of years ago a task force was set up and every effort was made to attract an alternative suitable enterprise.  That effort met with great success and the Minister visited the constituency recently to make a new announcement.  When Packard closed there was a great public outcry, the closure generated great public interest and urgent action was taken.</P>
      <P>This decision will involve the loss of 70 jobs in Galway and skills built up over a lifetime will be redundant.  There is an urgent need to provide alternative employment and training for those people.  There is no point telling us that many jobs are being created in Galway because most of them are in high tech industries.  The reality is that without radical retraining many of the employees who will be laid off will not find their way into those new industries.  Many of them need to find employment in a similar industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farah is the last significant manufacturing facility on the west side of Galway.  I hope the Minister will set up a special task force to oversee the work of providing training for the employees of Farah to ensure they do not become another statistic on the live register of long-term unemployed <Col N="602" /> and that he will charge the task force with finding suitable employment for them.</P>
    <P>Losing a job is traumatic.  It does not make any difference that 70 as opposed to 300 or 400 jobs will be lost in this plant.  The experience of losing their jobs was as traumatic for those 70 people as it was for employees in the other places to which I referred.</P>
    <P>As stated earlier, unlike other recent redundancies, there is a further difficulty in this case where, because of changing skill levels and new technology, those being laid off are particularly vulnerable when it comes to obtaining alternative employment.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the same priority and intensity of effort &mdash; establishment of task forces, provision of alternative sites, etc. &mdash; be given to providing alternative employment for the former employees of Farah as was invested in the more high profile instances of job losses which occurred in recent years.</P>
    <P>Tá mé buíoch don Aire as ucht teacht isteach tráthnóna.  Ba faillí uafásach é dá bhfágfaí na daoine seo gan jabanna sa bhfadtéarma agus muna ndéantaí iarracht speisialta go mór mór nuair a chuirtear san áireamh an seans mór atá ann go mbeidh sé thar a bheith deacair ag go leor de na fostaithe seo fostaíocht eile a fháil gan iarracht mhór Rialtais.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for raising this matter.  I share his disappointment at the decision by the Farah management in the US to cease operations at the Galway plant following the recent fire at the premises.  However, as the Deputy points out in his motion, it is now necessary to concentrate our efforts on ensuring that alternative training and employment is provided for the workers who have been made redundant.</P>
      <P>When I was in Galway on 3 March last, I availed of the opportunity to meet a delegation from SIPTU about the consequences of the Farah closure.  I understand the concerns of the redundant Farah workers about their prospects for alternative employment.  I assured the delegation that the State agencies will provide every assistance possible in both retraining and securing new employment.  I am satisfied, following my meeting with SIPTU and my discussions with the State agencies, that the needs of the ex-Farah employees are being taken on board by the relevant bodies and are being addressed in a very serious way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the particular circumstances of the Farah workers, I have asked FÁS to respond urgently to the needs of the workforce in order to equip them with the skills to be able to avail of new work opportunities.  In this regard, FÁS met with worker representatives on 6 March to discuss their training requirements.  I understand FÁS is currently in the process of interviewing the ex-workers individually to establish their training needs.  When this process is completed, suitable training courses aimed at assisting the <Col N="603" /> workers to find alternative employment will be arranged.</P>
    <P>On the question of a replacement operation, I assure the Deputy that all the State agencies will strenuously pursue their efforts to seek an alternative project for the area.  The industrial development agencies have been and will continue to promote the Galway region as an attractive location for further industrial development. IDA (Ireland), in particular, has had marked success in attracting industrial opportunities to the Galway area during the past number of years and is confident that this success will continue in 1997 and beyond.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the figure for manufacturing employment in overseas companies in the Galway area has increased by approximately 1,400 since 1994.  This strong performance is matched by that among indigenous companies in the region.  It is heartening that there is a strong industrial base.  The Deputy will also be aware that when I visited Galway on 3 March, I announced details of a 1,000 job expansion at the Boston Scientific Corporation.  This, coupled with five other recent project announcements which will create almost 500 jobs, is further welcome news for the Galway area.</P>
    <P>Given the improving employment situation in Galway, the recent announcements of future job opportunities and the ongoing efforts of the State agencies on behalf of the ex-Farah employees, I believe a special task force is not required to oversee this process.  I assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep in close contact with the State agencies regarding developments in this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to deal with this matter.  I welcome the intervention of the Labour Court in this dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions I addressed the Minister in respect of other disputes.  The TEAM Aer Lingus dispute demonstrates the Government's <i>laissez faire</i> attitude towards industrial relations.  For too long the Government has stood aside and abandoned TEAM Aer Lingus and its workforce.  It is incredible that the Government did not appoint a Minister with responsibility for industrial relations.  In most instances when disputes arise Ministers go into hiding.  It is clear that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment should have been actively involved in directing the Labour Court to intervene much earlier in the dispute and bringing management and SIPTU together to agree a settlement.  There is too much <Col N="604" /> at stake and the Government cannot and should not remain aloof.</P>
    <P>Crucial contracts for a number of key airlines will be jeopardised if this strike proceeds.  The financial implications for TEAM, with an annual turnover of £70 million per year, are horrendous. The Labour Court should deal not only with the outstanding issues relating to productivity pay, shared work zones, etc. but also with the overall industrial relations climate which is obviously in need of a complete overhaul.  The central issue involved in this dispute is that of productivity pay which was referred to the Labour Court by SIPTU in November 1995.  There has been much shadow boxing and cat and mouse games have been played by both sides in the interim.  Much valuable time has been wasted.  A Labour Court meeting involving both sides should have taken place some time ago and the outstanding issues should have been dealt with head on.  There are 80 aircraft maintenance assistants involved out of a workforce of 1,500.  I am concerned that a comprehensive agreement be reached before the dispute spills over to include the remainder of that workforce.</P>
    <P>TEAM Aer Lingus has had an unhappy industrial relations history.  The time has come to place relations between management and workers on a sound footing.  The key element for the Labour Court is to establish trust between both sides.  I hope it will now address the broader issues of industrial relations procedures at TEAM and that a just and fair agreement, which will be honoured by management and union alike, will be reached. Customer confidence in TEAM must be restored. If the threat of repeated industrial disruption hangs over the company, its present and potential customers will look elsewhere in what is a very competitive market.</P>
    <P>TEAM management and its workforce will have to work in a spirit of solidarity using modern industrial relations practices to establish lasting viability and growth.  In the long-term, this will restore the company to a healthy and profitable position.  This is what everyone wants to help achieve for the company.  However, I regret that, in the course of this and other disputes, the Government has shown little initiative and interest and has allowed matters to drift.  In these circumstances, tensions worsen and poor relations between management and workers fester. This is not good enough with so many valuable jobs at stake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Kitt on this issue. Today I tabled three parliamentary questions on the situation at Aer Lingus/TEAM Aer Lingus. Like Deputy Kitt, I am concerned about industrial relations in the company during the past number of years.  The Government was to have put in place a mechanism to deal with industrial issues of this kind but I understand little progress has been made.  I believe the Government should take proactive measures to address the industrial relations issue involving the national airline and <Col N="605" /> TEAM Aer Lingus.  It must ensure the necessary success and growth of both companies in the future.</P>
      <P>Everyone is familiar with the difficulties which prevail in TEAM Aer Lingus.  These have been present for quite some time and warrant special attention.  I have no doubt that a mechanism can be found to properly address these problems.  I welcome the Labour Court intervention and I hope it proves positive and successful.  There is a clear commitment from the workforce of TEAM Aer Lingus.  I hope the Minister will avail of this opportunity to ensure that its industrial relations difficulties are successfully and expeditiously resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share Deputy Tom Kitt's contention that Ministers should become actively involved, thus politicising disputes.  I do not accept that is the correct thing for them to do nor do I believe they should direct the Labour Court to engage in certain actions.  We have tried, well-tested machinery for dealing with labour disputes established by the Deputy's party leader when in this Department.  That system is a good one, the principle on which it is based being that expertise is required to assist parties in resolving disputes which reside properly in the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  If every time a dispute arose ministerial intervention were sought to by-pass the proper approach put in place by the Oireachtas we would undermine that machinery.</P>
      <P>I do not consider Deputy Tom Kitt is right in his approach to issues in dispute.  We must deal with them in the proper manner provided by the Oireachtas; this is not a new policy on my part but one that has been well tried and tested.</P>
      <P>Of course I share both Deputies' concerns about the damage this dispute could do to TEAM Aer Lingus and the international reputation on which the success of its operations depend.  It is regrettable that recent talks between the company and SIPTU failed to resolve the dispute.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputies will know, earlier today the Labour Court requested SIPTU to defer the proposed industrial action and advised that it would facilitate the parties in an early hearing of the dispute.  As a result of this initiative by the Labour Court, SIPTU has deferred the proposed industrial action.  I take this opportunity to welcome this development, as industrial action is not in the interests of the company, its workforce or its customers.  I trust an acceptable resolution to this dispute can be reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter to warn the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that a very serious public health crisis looms because of inadequate facilities to dispose of specified risk material.  From answers furnished to parliamentary questions I have tabled it transpires there have been scores of positive samples of meat and bonemeal found in animal feed.  In response to the glaring inadequacies of the steps the Minister took he introduced new regulations to separate the rendering of specified risk material, such as spinal cords and eyes.  The Minister's knee-jerk reaction to a crisis of his making has resulted in there now being one plant licensed to render specified risk material and most of it must be exported for incineration.</P>
      <P>Butchers who operate their own abattoirs and farmers with fallen animals are being quoted ruinous prices to have carcases taken away.  I understand approximately 200,000 cattle die annually in farmers' yards.  Heretofore farmers telephoned a knacker or kennels to take them away but that is no longer allowed.  It appears the Minister is devising the regulations as he progresses without giving any thought to the repercussions.</P>
      <P>Many butchers and farmers have been in touch with me and with many of my colleagues within the past week informing us that they have no intention of taking cattle as far as County Cavan. Anybody would readily understand farmers would experience enormous difficulty in travelling such a distance with a single animal.</P>
      <P>Monery by-products in County Cavan is the only licensed plant quoting a charge of £400 per tonne to render and destroy specified risk material; remarkably, the corresponding charge in Northern Ireland is £65 per tonne.</P>
      <P>The worrying aspect of all of this is that there are already documented incidents of animals being dumped on the roadside, in forests and on beaches, presenting a potentially very serious public health hazard, leading to additional problems of vermin and environmental pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is imperative that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry establishes a viable rendering regime.  The grants he announced for the upgrading of rendering plants today will do nothing to alleviate what is an increasingly urgent public health issue.  Even as we speak animals are rotting on the roadside and in ditches because of his knee-jerk reaction.  The mess in which we now <Col N="607" /> find ourselves has arisen through the Minister having allowed his public relations agenda to drive what has proven to be an incompetent attempt at crisis management.</P>
    <P>Additional plants for the rendering of SRM must be licensed immediately.  Most importantly, the Minister must relent and publish the two Cabinet reports prepared on the disposal of slaughterhouse waste.  It is disgraceful and I am suspicious of his refusal to publish them, particularly since he promised they would provide a basis for the sustainable disposal of slaughterhouse waste.  What is contained in those reports of which he is so politically afraid?  Where is his openness, transparency and honesty?  I call on the Minister to publish these reports immediately and to licence additional plants for the rendering of SRM.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hugh Byrne for raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>On 21 February 1997, an order signed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry came into effect which made the collection and isolation of specified risk material, i.e., mainly the skulls and spinal cords of sheep and cattle, mandatory.  On that date a rendering company, Monery, in County Cavan, became the sole dedicated plant for rendering specified risk material into meat and bonemeal to be stored for later disposal. All other rendering plants were decontaminated and since 21 February 1996 cannot deal with specified risk material.  The order was predicated on the best available scientific advice, on the need to protect the meat and bonemeal industry from possible foreign trade restrictions and to maintain its commercial viability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from certain reports that there were some teething problems with the operation <Col N="608" /> of the order but that the majority of meat plants since 21 February have been sending their specified risk material to Cavan for rendering without any difficulty.  I do not agree there has been any collapse in the rendering system as the eight plants dealing with non-specified risk material are trading and accepting offal at the normal commercial rates from meat plants and have reported no difficulties in recent weeks.  There have been some indications that the removal of the specified risk material from meat and bonemeal has hardened the price on certain markets for their product. In addition a certain foreign market inaccessible to Irish rendering companies since June 1996 may be about to reopen because of the prudent decision on the removal of specified risk material.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that the introduction of the specified risk material order on 21 February changed the position for collectors of fallen animals.  After some initial confusion, Monery agreed to accept fallen animals at the very attractive rate of £30 per tonne, i.e., £15 per cow and £5 per sheep and are looking at ways of reducing transportation costs for those hauliers delivering fallen animals to Monery.  It has been said that opening a second dedicated specified risk material plant would ease the position.  This possibility in the future has not been discounted but there is no evidence to suggest a second plant would dramatically reduce costs.  The single dedicated plant seems more than adequate to cope with demand and the volume of specified risk material.</P>
    <P>I do not accept there has been any &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; in the rendering industry either in terms of cost effectiveness, intake of raw material or the ability to sell meat and bonemeal.  The decisions taken are in the best interests of the livestock industry, the rendering industry and ultimately of the farming sector.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 March 1997.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should know I do not have an expert report on television deflector systems.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communication (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the Government has engaged in a multi-faceted campaign to minimise the risk posed by Sellafield.  This involves recourse to diplomatic contacts, bilateral discussions with the UK authorities and raising our concerns in international fora.</P>
      <P>Recently the Government's concerns have focused on the proposed Nirex radioactive waste facility and the consultation process relating to additional information which has recently come to light.  On 7 March, last Friday, the Government's observations in this consultation process were forwarded to the UK authorities.  Additionally, I held a press conference in London on Monday of this week, to highlight our concerns and objections to the Nirex proposal.</P>
      <P>Another issue which is current is the application by BNFL to the UK environment agency for an increase in the Sellafield site's discharge authorisation limits.  The Government's concerns have already been outlined to the environment agency.  I have reserved the right to comment further when the draft authorisations have issued.</P>
      <P>My Department and the RPII is also preparing a submission to the UK Environment agency on BNFL's application to operate a mixed oxide fuel plant at Sellafield.  This plant would manufacture MOX fuel from uranium and plutonium oxides recovered from the reprocessing of spent fuel. The consultation process will be completed in early April.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the findings of studies commissioned by the UK Nuclear Free Local Authorities on the possible risks associated with the safety of the storage of highly active liquid nuclear waste in 21 tanks at the Sellafield complex. I have written to the Minister for the Environment and asked him to encourage the establishment of a positive relationship between Irish local authorities and UK Nuclear Free Local Authorities.  I understand the question of financial support for the proposed studies was considered at a recent meeting of the general Council of County Councils and that they have now appointed an informal working group to consider the matter.</P>
      <P>The UK regulatory authorities have themselves expressed dissatisfaction at the safety aspects of long-term storage of high level radioactive waste in liquid form.  My Department has asked the UK authorities to speed up the process of vitrification in the interests of nuclear safety and radiation protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of access to data on the probability of an accident involving these tanks, it is difficult to determine the likelihood of such an <Col N="612" /> occurrence.  The advice which I have received from the radiological protection institute indicates that the studies undertaken to date focus on the consequences, rather than the likelihood, of an accident involving a radioactive release from the storage tanks.  The findings from these studies have indicated that depending on the wind direction and other relevant factors there could be serious implications for Ireland.  I have therefore requested the UK authorities to provide the information that we require to adequately assess the full extent of the risk to Ireland.</P>
    <P>As to the information required, I believe there would be a significant benefit if the UK authorities were to release the probability risk assessments studies which have been carried out in relation to the high level liquid storage tanks at Sellafield.  Probability risk assessment is a methodology to measure the proneness to severe accidents of nuclear plants by examining, in minute detail, the design of each plant; in this way operators and regulators attempt to forestall a severe accident.</P>
    <P>While a programme of vitrification is taking place at the plant which would convert the waste to a solid glass form, it is not expected to be completed for about ten years.  In the meantime, I consider that there would be significant advantages in releasing the probability risk assessments studies for examination by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland so that the risks from these tanks can be more fully evaluated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, is the legislative basis for the licensing of scheduled bus services. <Col N="613" /> The Department, in considering applications for scheduled passenger service licences under the 1932 Act, is obliged to have regard in the public interest to authorised bus services operating on or in the neighbourhood of the route in question. In general, it is only possible to license one operator to provide a particular service over a specific route.</P>
      <P>However, it is possible to adopt a more flexible attitude in the case of passenger services in niche markets, such as the tourist sector.  The regulation of tourism services does not involve the same strategic concerns raised by the licensing of mainstream scheduled bus services.  These city tours do not fulfil any significant public transport function, but are primarily meeting a tourist demand for discretionary leisure activities.  Consequently, I consider that the public interest is best served by allowing competition in respect of such services. For this reason, all applications for road passenger licences from suitably-qualified transport operators in respect of city tour services are approved, subject to the production by the bus operator concerned of relevant insurance and safety certificates in respect of the vehicle(s) which will be used to provide the services in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The EU Transport Council in June 1996 approved a mandate for the Commission to enter into negotiations with the US on the possibility of concluding an agreement on an EU-US common aviation area.</P>
      <P>The mandate does not yet allow for negotiations on traffic rights.  The first round of negotiations took place in Washington on 30 and 31 October 1996 and a second round is scheduled to take place in Brussels next month.  The talks taking place are concentrating on regulatory issues such as competition rules, ownership and control, code sharing, leasing etc. which might form part of an eventual EU-US aviation agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While these discussions are ongoing the mandate specifically provides that member states <Col N="614" /> shall not be limited in their ability to open or pursue bilateral negotiations and conclude agreements with the US.  That having been said there are no plans at present for Ireland to seek discussions with the US with a view to revising the terms of the Ireland-US bilateral air services agreement.</P>
    <P>The Ireland-US bilateral air services agreement provides <i>inter alia</i> that all airlines wishing to operate direct air services between the US and Dublin must provide at least an equivalent level of services between the US and Shannon.  All airlines operating services between the US and Ireland are required to notify their schedules in advance to my Department.  These schedules are examined to ensure compliance with the terms of the bilateral agreement.  Furthermore I receive monthly reports from Aer Rianta of transatlantic movements at both Shannon and Dublin which again are examined by my Department.</P>
    <P>The current Shannon stop requirement has been consistently cited by US airlines as one of the barriers to providing new direct scheduled services to Ireland, particularly given the opportunities for US airlines to start new services to say UK and other European cities.  I suppose that I must conclude that they are other problematic issues also.</P>
    <P>It is entirely legitimate for our Government to wish to ensure that Shannon Airport and the region it serves participate appropriately in the growth in trans-Atlantic traffic which we all wish to see, particularly in view of the fact that a majority of passengers arriving in Ireland from the US continue to wish to disembark at Shannon.</P>

    <P>Although there has been no formally notifiable incidents in 1997 I have been made aware of a number of on-site incidents through the informal notification procedure described above.  These incidents, when investigated, were of no radiological significance to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Generally, the notification arrangements have been working satisfactorily since 1986 although I would like to see the scope of formally notifiable incidents extended to include incidents not involving a release of radioactivity.</P>
    <P>Last month I met the British Ambassador in my office and I conveyed to her the Government's concerns relating to the recent reports of incidents at the Sellafield complex, the possibility of an accident involving the high level waste storage tanks at Sellafield and our objections to the proposed construction of a nuclear waste repository by Nirex near Sellafield.  The Ambassador assured me that she would convey our concerns directly to the British authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the day-to-day operations of the Aer Lingus group are the responsibility of the board and management of the group.  However, my Department maintains close contact with Aer Lingus in order to ensure that the Department is kept informed of the commercial progress of the group.  From time to time, the Aer Lingus group formally requests the approval of the shareholder to significant capital investments and other major business initiatives. There are no such formal requests currently under consideration by my Department.</P>
      <P>The last such request was in connection with the acquisition of a fifth airbus A330 which I approved on 10 December 1996.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House last month, Aer Lingus has only recently emerged from a financial crisis which, if it had not been satisfactorily addressed, would have led to the demise of the airline.  A restructuring programme covering the period 1993-95, supported by Government equity of £175 million, was implemented which was designed to save the company in the short-term and to alter its commercial outlook in the longer term.</P>
      <P>Successful implementation of the restructuring programme required radical changes in Aer Lingus.  Substantial cost savings were achieved and changes in work practices and employment were implemented.</P>
      <P>The achievement of the objectives of the restructuring programme resulted in the Aer Lingus group returning an operating profit of nearly £50 million, and a net profit in excess of £15 million, in the year ended 31 December 1995. I am aware that the Aer Lingus group performed satisfactorily in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> The coming years will be a testing period for the Aer Lingus group.  The position of the Government, and the European Commission, is that further State aid for Aer Lingus is ruled out. The strongest possible commercial focus within the Aer Lingus group is, therefore, essential. While progress has been made, there is a risk that, unless the commercial imperative continues to be accepted throughout the whole group, it will be unable to control its cost base sufficiently and adapt its commercial strategies so as to withstand increasing competitive pressures, particularly when compounded by the next cyclical downturn in the aviation industry.</P>
    <P>I cannot stress enough, not withstanding the recent performance of the group, that the only guarantee for maintaining a financially sound group is to adopt to market realities.</P>
    <P>In my Department's second statement of strategy, which was launched earlier today, two key strategies have been identified against the backdrop of the many challenges facing the group as we approach the 21st century.</P>
    <P>The board of the Aer Lingus group is being mandated to continue to operate in accordance with strict commercial criteria and to ensure that, within a three to five year timescale, the operational resources employed by the group and the commercial results achieved, including the return to the shareholder, are such that they benchmark favourably with any comparable private sector airlines against which they compete.</P>
    <P>The board is being mandated to explore the possibilities of entering into a major strategic alliance, with or without the transfer of equity, and to submit proposals to the shareholder by the end of 1997.  The Government, as shareholder, will seriously consider any such proposals on their merits.</P>

      <P>As I informed the House on 5 March last, I am waiting a formal application from CIE for a light railway order for the Tallaght-Dundrum line in accordance with the provisions of the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996. I indicated to the House last December that the statutory public inquiry into CIE's application would probably be held in the first half of 1997. This was in the expectation that an application would be received in February.  At this stage the earliest a public inquiry is likely to take place is summer 1997. On this basis, I expect that the construction phase, which will take about three years, will get under way early in 1998.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House on 12 February last, a consortium of independent consultants has been appointed with responsibility for the design and the running of the peat station competion.  The appointment of the consultants was made in order to give assurance to prospective bidders that the competition would take place on a fair and impartial basis where, in addition to being the purchaser of electricity from the new station, the ESB would also be a bidder in the competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is in favour of the establishment of an independent European nuclear energy inspection force which would cover all aspects of safety related to nuclear plants.  Previous efforts by other administrations to establish such an inspectorate did not succeed, primarily because a considerable number of member states were opposed to the idea.  Changes to the Euratom Treaty require unanimity.</P>
      <P>Some nuclear member states strongly insist that a European Union inspection force to inspect the safety of plants on their territory is an unacceptable undermining of national sovereignty. Their view is that they have their own nuclear licensing, inspection and regulatory bodies which insist on the highest standards of safety. While safety-conscious nuclear operators should have nothing to fear from an independent inspection of their operations, unfortunately, there is nothing to indicate that a fresh attempt to establish an inspectorate would be any more successful than previous attempts.</P>
      <P>However, significant progress was made last year under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency with the coming into force of the Nuclear Safety convention.  Under Article 20 of the Convention there is provision for Peer Review.  Under this process, each State will be able to review the legislative and regulatory framework that governs the safety of nuclear installations of other contracting parties, which includes all member states of the EU.  It also provides for a review of the operational and safety procedures for nuclear installations and emergency preparedness.</P>
      <P>I assure the House I will continue to do my utmost to ensure that only the highest safety standards in the nuclear industry prevail and that they are stringently observed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of my Department is to actively encourage and welcome new services on all routes to and from Ireland.</P>
      <P>In relation to access from Europe, all European Economic Area airlines are free to operate on any international route within the EEA without any restrictions on frequency, or capacity, provided slots are available at airports.</P>
      <P>In relation to access to the regional airports as the Deputy is aware, these are owned and operated by private undertakings.  The development plans, traffic potential and viability of these airports are therefore primarily matters for the individual airport companies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that to improve access to the regions from abroad through the network of air services operating to and from Dublin, my Department has introduced a programme of essential air services in accordance with EU Council Regulation 2408/92.  This programme, which covers services between four regional airports &mdash; Kerry, Galway, Sligo and Donegal &mdash; and Dublin, is designed to guarantee a minimum level of air services to the regions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that, to assist the regional airport companies in marketing and promoting their airports, marketing grants were paid by my Department to the six regional airports during 1993 and 1995.  Furthermore, arising from financial and other difficulties being experienced by most of Ireland's privately owned regional airports, a review of policy relating to these airports was carried out by my Department in 1996.  As a result of this the Government approved a strictly time limited scheme of Exchequer grants totalling £2.35 million over the four years 1996 to 1999 for the six regional airports to assist the airport companies in marketing and promoting their airports.</P>
      <P>In relation to access to and from our main markets i.e. UK, mainland Europe and the US, a very liberal regulatory framework is in place. However, the question of whether any airline wishes to exercise traffic rights available to them is entirely a matter for the airline on the basis of its own commercial judgment.  As mentioned earlier, EEA airlines are free to operate on any international route within the EEA.</P>
      <P>Outside the EEA access is governed by the relevant bilateral air agreement.  A liberal policy is generally adopted by my Department in regard to traffic rights granted under these agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to access from the US; under existing <Col N="621" /> policy enshrined in the Ireland-US air agreement, there are no restrictions on US airlines operating services, either scheduled or charter, from any point in the US to Shannon.  In addition, US airlines may operate any number of direct non-stop charter services from any point in the US to Knock Airport.  Similarly Irish airlines can operate an unlimited number of charter services to Shannon and Knock from any US point and unlimited scheduled services to Shannon from four US points i.e. New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, a steering group comprising officials of my Department and the Department of Tourism and Trade and representatives from Aer Rianta and Bord Fáilte was set up in December, 1995 &mdash;by my predecessor and by my colleague Deputy Enda Kenny, Minister for Tourism and Trade &mdash; to look at the issue of US-Ireland access.  I outlined the work of this group and the main conclusions of their report in my answer to the House on 5 December, 1996. The steering group will continue to monitor the US-Ireland access issue and advise Ministers accordingly.</P>

      <P>The most significant initiative taken by my Department was the broadening out of the social partnership process to include the National Womens Council, who played a significant role in the negotiation of Partnership 2000. In the appointment of members to the National Economic and Social Council in 1995, the 40 per cent gender balance was observed.</P>
      <P>The promotion of gender equality is one of the objectives in Subprogramme 2 of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-99.  Area Development Management (ADM) Ltd., is an independent intermediary company established by the European Commission and the Irish Government to implement the Subprogramme.</P>
      <P>Women benefit directly or indirectly under all measures in the Subprogramme.  Some 71 independent local development groups &mdash; 38 partnerships and 33 community groups &mdash; nationally are supported under the Operational Programme based on ADM's assessment of their integrated local development action plans.  Women are a key target group.  In 1995 more than half of the beneficiaries under the Programme were women. Some 7,500 women benefited under ESF measures and over 1,000 benefited under European Regional Development Fund measures.  In addition, at a central level, ADM carried out a consultation study in 1995 which included people from a range of partnerships.  This resulted in a report published in 1996 entitled &mdash; Towards Gender Equality in Integrated Local Development. The cost was £11,407.  In 1996 ADM contracted the Community Action Network to create awareness of gender equality in partnerships and community groups at a cost of £30,000.</P>
      <P>In respect of initiatives taken directly by my Department, the Government's Famine Commemoration Committee made a grant payment in 1995 of £15,000 available to the Irish women's archive to assist with their exhibition on Women, Famine and Emigration.</P>
      <P>The budget for my Department in each of the years 1995 and 1996 was £151,240,000¹ and £19,834,000 respectively.  The amount of the budget, exclusive of direct staffing and overhead costs, in each of the years was £147,102,000¹ and £15,285,000 respectively.</P>
      <P>1 The significantly higher figure in respect of the 1995 budget contains an allocation of £137,600,000 for the Community Employment Programme which was co-founded by this Department in 1995.  The Programme was taken over by the Department of Enterprise and Employment in 1996.</P>

      <Quest>the initiatives, if any, taken by his Department in 1995 and 1996 which were targeted at women; the budget allocated to each initiative; the actual amount spent on each; the budget for his Department in each of the years 1995 and 1996; and the amount of that budget exclusive of direct staffing and overhead costs.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs and the office of the Tánaiste are committed to a policy of equal opportunity and fully endorse and implement the guidelines for equality of opportunity drawn up for the Civil Service.  The principles and practices of equality of opportunity are applied in relation to recruitment, assignment, promotion, training and all other conditions of service for officers in both organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also a fundamental principle of the Irish aid programme that sustainable development is only possible with the active involvement and participation of both women and men on a basis of full equality.  Accordingly, gender issues are systemically included in all stages of aid projects <Col N="628" /> including project identification, appraisal, implementation, review and evaluation.</P>
    <P>Even through there are no specific budgets allocated for women's affairs in the Votes for the Department of Foreign Affairs or the office of the Tánaiste, all decisions made or policies-programmes drawn up and implemented by both organisations take appropriate account of gender considerations.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women contained two recommendations of relevance to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  These refer to the gender balance of nominations to State boards and the use of non-sexist application forms and correspondence.  Nominations made by me to State boards under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the office of the Tánaiste take into account the commission's recommendations and the relevant Government decisions on gender balance.</P>
    <P>As regards the use of non-sexist forms, the various forms in use in the Department of Foreign Affairs were already in line with the commission's recommendation.  It has been standard procedure in this Department to follow non-sexist practices in correspondence since the publication in 1985 of the Government's White Paper on the Public Service entitled &ldquo;Serving the Country Better&rdquo;. This is in keeping with recent Government decisions on the use of gender neutral language in Bills and Statutory Instruments.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that while the office of the Tánaiste has had no initiatives targeted solely and specifically at women, in developing new initiatives the office takes account of the roleimpact on women &mdash; for example in establishing the National Economic and Social Forum which comes under the aegis of the office, not alone are women's groups directly represented but women make up 51 per cent of members.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister of State at the office of the Tánaiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, is currently chairing a working group on violence against women and it is hoped that the report of the group will be submitted to Government within the next month.  The costs associated with the working group are being met from within the office's resources.</P>
    <P>As no staff are specifically involved in gender proofing, there is no formal training provided in this area.  However, the Department and office provide funds to a number of officers who are studying personnel management courses which include gender and equality issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of EU Directives 91/680/EEC, agreed as part of the tax measures establishing the EU Single Market, authorise the continuation, until 30 June 1999, of duty free shopping facilities for intra-Community travellers.  In the absence of a proposal from the Commission and an agreement at Council, duty free sales for intra-Community travellers will cease on 30 June 1999.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to terminate duty free or tax free sales for travellers to non-EU destinations in 1999.  That portion of the duty free business will remain and, for certain airports, particularly Shannon Airport, the non-EU travellers are a very important source of revenue. Other State airports also handle traffic to and from non-EU locations.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the original date on which it was proposed that duty free for intra-Community travellers be abolished was 31 December 1992, but the extension &mdash; to 30 June 1999 &mdash; was granted to allow operators, including Aer Rianta, time to diversify their business.  I know that Aer Rianta has taken many steps to diversify their activities, including the operation of duty free shops in, for example, Russia and in the Middle and Far East.</P>
      <P>While the concerns of those engaged in the duty free business are appreciated, I hope any adverse employment implications may be kept to the minimum.</P>

      <P>The human resources development services side of the centre for management, organisation and development within my Department is involved in facilitating a women managers' network.  The network runs training events and seminars on issues of concern to women at middle and senior levels in the Civil Service such as managing job-sharing, assertiveness, making links with other women's networks, influencing skills, equality and the Strategic Management Initiative and gender and power in organisations.  These events address women managers' training demands as articulated by the members and attract new members to each event.  In 1997, the network, which has been in existence for a number of years, will continue to develop its role in the facilitation of the development and training of women managers in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Because this network is one of a series facilitated by the centre for management, organisation and development, there is no specific budget allocated to it.  While the amount of money spent on the network is relatively modest it has proven to be a most effective forum in which issues of specific concern to women in the Civil Service are promoted and addressed.  There is a continuing and increasing interest in the work of the network and my Department will continue to actively participate in its activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department previously participated in an initiative organised by An Post, under the European Social Fund Project, NOW, when, in 1994, 11 officials from my Department attended a workshop, the purpose of which was to provide participants with an opportunity to discover how equality supports best management practice, to develop their views on the issues of equality and <Col N="631" /> to develop an action plan to bring back to their parent Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Recommendation 6.5.2 refers to support for women's groups in rural areas.  The Minister for Agriculture Food and Forestry has the lead role in relation to rural development, including rural women's development issues.</P>
      <P>The health services have a responsibility in so far as the Commission recommends the provision of multi-functional centres in the context of the development of community care as a means of supporting rural women's groups.</P>
      <P>The health centre plays a key role in the delivery of primary and community health care in rural and urban areas.  These centres are multi-functional, including facilitating voluntary groups to meet or provide services.</P>
      <P>The health strategy document, Shaping a Healthier Future, recognises the crucial role of health centres in the provision of preventive and other services in the community and indicates that more health centres will be provided and existing centres will be improved.</P>
      <P>In 1995 the Department requested and received from each board a prioritised list of health centres for development over a three year period.  Following on from this initiative, health centre projects are being developed in each of the health board areas taking into account service requirements in each area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware, the report The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly is the cornerstone of policy for the elderly.  The principal recommendations of the report were to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home with the support of the community care services where necessary and, when this was no longer possible, to ensure that they had access to the best possible medical and long-term care. Considerable progress has been made in the implementation of the recommendations of the report.</P>
      <P>In addition, a review of the implementation of recommendations contained in The Years Ahead report has been carried out on behalf of the National Council for the Elderly by and independent research team and is due to be presented to the council very shortly.  It is expected that the report will be published and this will give a thorough insight into the position in relation to implementation of the various recommendations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The nominating bodies to each board under the aegis of my Department together with the number of seats to which each of these bodies nominate is set out in the table following.</P>
      <P>When making nominations to boards under the aegis of my Department all nominating authorities are expected to have due regard to the Government decisions of March 1993 and March 1995 regarding the achievement of a gender balance in the membership of the boards of State bodies.  This decision stipulates that there should be a minimum of 40 per cent of both men and women among the members appointed as ministerial representatives.  However, other bodies who nominate members to state boards under the aegis of my Department, while not strictly subject to this decision, are asked to comply with it where possible taking into account the need to ensure that they have the necessary range of skills among their members to function effectively at all times.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): All decisions taken in my Department are examined having regard to their potential impact on the health of women.  In order to ensure that the health services are sensitive and responsive to the health needs of women, I am currently preparing a plan for women's health which is the culmination of a detailed process of consultation with women nationally about their health needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I initiated this process in June 1995 when I launched a discussion document, Developing a Policy for Women's Health.  This document provided a detailed analysis of most of the health issues of concern to Irish women, identified the scope for preventing premature mortality and increasing health and social gain and suggested priorities to be addressed in a plan for women's health.  Following the publication of this document <Col N="637" /> my Department, in association with the health boards and the National Women's Council, undertook an extensive process of consultation with women at national, regional and local level.  The overall thrust of the consultative process was positive.  Women welcomed the opportunity to give their views on health issues.  On the whole, women were appreciative of existing health services, while at the same time identifying areas requiring improvement.</P>
    <P>The plan for women's health, which is currently being finalised in the Department, will respond to the issues raised during the consultative process and will build on the analysis of the discussion document.  It will ensure that health policy and services are more sensitive to women's concerns in the future.  The experience gained from the preparation of Developing a Policy for Women's Health, the subsequent consultative process and the formulation of a plan for women's health provided invaluable training for the staff involved in the Department.  It is anticipated that the plan for women's health will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> In June 1995, I launched a discussion document Developing a Policy for Women's Health which provided a detailed analysis of most of the health issues of concern to Irish women, identified the scope for preventing premature mortality and increasing health and social gain and suggested priorities to be addressed in a plan for women's health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the publication of this document a process of consultation began at national level, with a conference on women's health in June 1995.  Consultation at regional and local level was organised by the health boards, each of which appointed a women's health co-ordinator.  The process was greatly strengthened by the involvement of the National Women's Council which agreed to be a partner with the Department of Health and the health boards in organising the consultation process.  This partnership stimulated an extensive and innovative process of consultation with women.  The council, with funding from the Department of Health, appointed a co-ordinator to liaise with the statutory side in structuring the consultation.  In each health board region the council appointed &ldquo;counterparts&rdquo; to work closely with health boards in organising the consultative process.  Each health board in turn appointed a women's health co-ordinator to carry the consultation forward. <Col N="638" /> Consultation with women on health issues took many forms.  Conferences, workshops, exhibitions and seminars were held on the full range of topics in the discussion document or on specific topics. Written submissions were also invited from a large number of organisations with an interest in women's health.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the period of consultation, a report on the organisation and outcome of the process was prepared in each health board in consultation with representatives of the National Women's Council.  A national seminar was held in March 1996 to reflect on the outcome of the consultative process and identify priorities to be addressed in the plan for women's health.  The plan for women's health, which is currently being finalised in the Department, will respond to the issues raised during the consultative process and will build on the analysis of the discussion document. It is anticipated that the plan for women's health will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give a detailed breakdown of the cost of the women's health initiative.  The costs involved were met from within the allocation to the health services which in 1995 was £2 billion and in 1996 was £2.2 billion.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The North-Eastern Health Board has adopted a policy to develop ENT services within the region and is currently in discussion with my Department with a view to introducing a range of regional specialist services on a phased basis over the coming years.  The board's proposals will be considered within my Department in the context of competing demands and priorities for acute hospital services.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the board has contracted inpatient ENT services from Northern Ireland for the Cavan-Monaghan area and consultants from Northern Ireland provide out-patient services and day procedures at both Cavan and Monaghan hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will wish to know that under the waiting list initiative my Department approved an allocation of £45,360 in 1995 and £58,920 in 1996 in respect of additional ENT procedures at Cavan-Monaghan hospital.  As a result of the moneys allocated under the initiative, the average waiting time for surgery at Cavan-Monaghan hospital has been reduced to six months.  This represents significant progress in the reduction of waiting lists and demonstrates the Government's concern to ensure that the necessary resources <Col N="639" /> are provided to improve waiting times for treatment.</P>

    <P>Under the 1996 waiting list initiative, which was specifically designed to reduce waiting times in a number of target specialties, the Western Health Board received £531,000 which enabled it to carry out an additional 847 orthopaedic and 805 ophthalmic procedures.  This brought the total of procedures carried out in these specialties last year to 1,061 and 1,403 respectively.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the inclusion of an orthopaedic unit in Phase 2 of Mayo General Hospital, which will consist of extensive theatre and inpatient facilities, will enable the hospital to perform 1,000 operations and to assess 1,400 new patients annually at out-patient clinics.  This will have a significant impact in further reducing the waiting times for patients.</P>

      <P>I am very aware of the need to <Col N="640" /> educate and encourage all young people to adopt an all round healthy lifestyle and I acknowledge that there are particular issues which are relevant to third level students.</P>
      <P>In response to these particular needs the Health Promotion Unit of my Department has put in place a number of initiatives targeting young people.  Some of these initiatives such as the drug misuse mass media campaign launched in June 1996 target all young people including third level students with a message aimed at reminding and alerting them to the dangers of drug misuse.</P>
      <P>Other initiatives in place specifically target third level students.  These include the convenience advertising programme which involves placing AIDS and sexual health awareness messages in the washroom/toilet areas of the majority of third level colleges.  This programme is a very effective medium for targeting messages at a specific group of young people.</P>
      <P>In addition, a health promoting college initiative commenced as a pilot project in Mary Immaculate College, Limerick in 1996.  This project is considering how a third level college can introduce and implement health promotion principles and practices.  I hope that the pilot project results at the end of a three year period, will guide such initiatives in other third level institutions in the future.</P>
      <P>The Health Promotion Unit publishes a wide range of literature and posters on health promotion issues including drugs, AIDS, and sexual health.  These materials are made available to all third level institutions and are widely used during &ldquo;freshers' weeks&rdquo;, &ldquo;health weeks&rdquo;, and in student health centres.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a health promotion strategy was launched in 1995.  To support this strategy a national consultative committee on health promotion was established.  One of the main areas which the consultative committee sought to address was the health of young people. A report assessing current provision and future needs and priorities for young people's health has been produced and its recommendations will provide a framework for future health promotion measures addressing the needs of all young people including third levels students.  The Deputy may be assured that my Department will continue to examine how it can best facilitate the developement of the health and well-being of the student population.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain illness to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a particular illness.  This scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of on-going expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses maybe reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibiliity for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.  I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions.  My Department has replied to this effect to the North-Western Health Board.</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1977, does not prescribe which organisations should have right of nomination.  Traditionally, nominations have been requested from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the National Women's Council of Ireland.  The question of nominating members to the board of the Employment Equality Agency has not arisen during the lifetime of this Government.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1977, provides that the board of the Employment Equality Agency shall consist of a chairman and ten ordianry members.  Of the ordinary members, two are to represent workers' interests, two are to represent employers' interests, three are to be representative of women's organisations, with the remaining three nominated by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, which came into force on 11 October 1996, does not require of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform that she or he would seek nominations to the Legal Aid Board from any organisation or body.  When a new board is being appointed, however, the Minister may consult with bodies such as the Bar Council, the Incorporated Law Society, the Departments of Finance and Social Welfare, and officials from my own Department and from the trade unions representing the staff of the board.</P>
      <P>The Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, provides that of the 13 members of the board, two shall be barristers, two shall be solicitors and two shall be members of the staff of the board.  The Act also provides that not less than five shall be men and not less than five shall be women.</P>

      <P>One of the main functions of my Department is to progress equality legislation and equality of opportunity among the sexes in employment and elsewhere.  While the legislation applies equally to men and women the provisions therein are of particular benefit to women. Accordingly, the gender proofing of such activities forms an integral part of the work of my Department.  Policy proposals submitted to my Department from other Government Departments and those for submission to Government are also examined in my Department in the context of gender proofing.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have developed expertise in the area of gender proofing primarily through attendance at specialist conferences, seminars and other functions which focus on equality issues, and through the on-the-job experience of dealing with equality issues on a day-to-day basis.  This expertise is further reinforced by access to reports and other documents outlining practices of equality proofing and mainstreaming in other areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because equality issues impact throughout my Department generally, I propose to approach the reply by identifying initiatives, policies and legislation within the various sections of my Department which are of particular interest to women.</P>
      <P>In 1995 a sum of £100,000 was allocated for the UN Fourth World Conference on Women.  A sum of £87,000 was expended on the preparation for, and attendance at, the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.  In 1996 a further £20,000 was allocated of which £10,000 was expended.</P>
      <P>A number of women's organisations received allocations from this subhead to attend the conference and there were a number of regional and one national seminar organised by the National Women's Council of Ireland to which women's interest groups were invited, which were funded by my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department grant-aids the National Women's Council of Ireland.  In 1995 the budget allocation amounted to £200,000 of which the council received £147,895 which included a payment of £7,895 for an information project on divorce. In 1996 the council was allocated and received £170,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also organised the Action for Equality Awards Scheme.  The first scheme which <Col N="646" /> was held in 1994-95, was co-sponsored by RTE and An Post and was aimed at achieving equality in two categories, gender and disability.  Five of the awards were made in the gender category and each of the finalists received £1,000 with winners in each category receiving £5,000.  All the finalists received trophies which were specially commissioned for the awards scheme.</P>
    <P>The amount allocated for the scheme in 1995 was £35,000.  However, my Department's total financial input was £38,347.41.  This figure included expenditure on preparation work in advance of the second scheme.</P>
    <P>In the second awards scheme which was held in 1995-96 the awards were available for initiatives in the workplace and in all other areas.  The grounds covered were expanded from gender and disability to include all the grounds in the proposed employment equality and equal status legislation.  This scheme was co-sponsored by RTE.  As in the first scheme, ten finalists were selected and each received both a trophy and a monetary prize.  A number of the applications received were for gender based initiatives and three of the projects made it to the final stages. My Department's allocation was £35,000 for 1996 with expenditure amounting to £35,080.</P>
    <P>The removal of obstacles to women's entry to the workforce is an essential element in the equality process and the absence of suitable childminding facilities has been identified as one of these obstacles.  Support towards the capital funding of childcare projects has been provided each year since 1994 to assist in the development of community based childcare facilities in designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The scheme is intended to assist in the initiation of projects for the establishment, on a pilot basis, of childcare measures utilising the skills of trained local people, to enable local residents to undertake education, training, re-training and employment opportunities which they would otherwise be unable to do.</P>
    <P>It is a condition of the scheme that grants are confined to groups in disadvantaged areas.  For this purpose, it has been agreed that these be defined as those areas in which there are area based partnerships-local community groups currently in receipt of funds from the global grant for local development.</P>
    <P>The scheme is being administered, on behalf of my Department, by Area Development Management Ltd., which is an independent company designated by the Government and the European Commission to support integrated local economic and social development in co-operation with relevant Area Partnership Companies established by the Government in designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>In my Department's Estimates for 1995, £1,000,000 was provided for child care and £800,000 was expended.  Some £800,000 was provided in the 1996 estimates and £800,000 was expended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> The primary focus of the Employment Equality Section of my Department is the development of policies and legislation which seek to further the aims of equality of opportunity among the sexes in employment and, to that extent, all activities are targeted at women.</P>
    <P>The Maternity Protection Act, 1994, which commenced in January 1995, and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995 both afford specific support to mothers who take time off work due to maternity commitments about the time of the birth or adoption of their children.  Legislation to provide for parental leave of three months for both parents on the birth of a child is currently being prepared following the adoption, with my support, of an EU Directive on the issue at the Social Affairs Council which I attended in Luxembourg on 3 June 1996.  The Employment Equality Bill, 1996 also contains provisions which would be of particular interest to women.</P>
    <P>The Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, which came into force on 11 October 1996, provides that of the 13 members appointed to the Legal Aid Board not less than five shall be women and not less than five shall be men.  The legal services provided for under the Act are available equally to men and to women and are availed of by significant numbers of women.</P>
    <P>While the following legislation applies equally to men and women the overall provisions of the legislation are of particular benefit to women.</P>
    <P>The Family Law Act, 1995</P>
    <P>Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1995</P>
    <P>Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995</P>
    <P>Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995</P>

    <P>Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996</P>
    <P>Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, 1996</P>
    <P>My Department's total net estimate for 1995 was £12,299,000 and for 1996 was £11,768,000.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Family Mediation Service is to enable couples whose marriages have broken down, to resolve, through mediation, their marital disputes without having to resort to adjudication through the courts.  The principle underlying mediation is that couples take responsibility for resolving their own disputes as opposed to decisions being made for them by a third party.  The Family Mediation Service offers couples whose marriages have broken down an opportunity to negotiate a separation agreement with the assistance of a neutral trained mediator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> Such ageements include arrangements for custody of and access to children, property distribution, maintenance etc.  The service is provided free of charge.</P>
    <P>The Family Mediation Service is staffed by a service co-ordinator, two area co-ordinators, two part-time mediators, and three clerical staff.  Procedures have been put in train to recruit additional part-time mediators.  The vacancies have been advertised in the media and selection interviews will take place within a few weeks.</P>
    <P>The current waiting period in the Dublin office is ten months and there are 174 couples awaiting appointment, while the waiting period in the Limerick office is six to eight weeks and there are five couples awaiting appointment.</P>

      <P>My Department adheres fully to Government policy on gender equality.  All the policies and schemes of my Department are gender-neutral. Any legislation proposed by my Department has been gender proofed in accordance with Government policy.  I personally am very conscious of the need to achieve a gender balance on boards under the aegis of my Department when selecting individuals for appointment. I have made considerable progress in this respect <Col N="652" /> since my appointment as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Gender proofing is an integral part of the decision making processes in my Department. This equality ethos percolates through all the courses provided centrally for civil servants, including those serving in my Department.  I am satisfied that my officials are sufficiently aware of the importance of gender equality and, as such, have not felt it necessary thus far to seek out specialist training in the area of gender proofing.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my reply to Question No. 76 that my Department adheres fully to Government policy in relation to gender proofing and that I have been very conscious of the need to achieve gender balance on boards under the aegis of my Department.  Specific initiatives which I have taken in this regard include the insertion in the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, [Section 7.1 (a)] of a requirement that where the membership of the RTE Authority is seven, not less than three shall be men and not less than three shall be women. Where the membership is eight or nine, not less than four shall be men and not less than four shall be women.  Likewise, a provision is contained in the Heritage Act, 1995 (paragraph 2(1) of the Schedule to the Act), which states that of the members of the Heritage Council not fewer than seven shall be men and not fewer than seven shall be women.  In addition, the Cultural Institutions Bill, 1997, which is presently before the House, contains a broadly similar provision in regard to the National Library and National Museum.</P>
      <P>With regard to specific financial initiatives to benefit women the position is that the broad range of assistance provided by my Department is for the benefit of women and men equally.  I should mention, however, that my Department provided specific grants of £100,000 and £15,000 in 1995 and 1996 respectively to the Irish Women's Archive and Resource Centre.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>While it is recognised that a general house improvement grant scheme would help to promote the conservation and improvement of the housing stock, particular account must be taken of the cost of the previous scheme.  The Government's priorities in the housing area, as set out in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> are to expand the local authority and other social housing programmes and to upgrade deficient local authority dwellings. As the available resources will, accordingly, be concentrated on these programmes, there are no proposals at this stage to introduce a generally applicable house improvement grant scheme.</P>
      <P>There are, however, a number of targeted schemes available to assist necessary house improvment works in appropriate circumstances, e.g., disabled persons's grants, essential repairs grants, the task force on special housing aid for the elderly and the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>While no specific gender proofing training is provided in my Department, I am satisfied that, in the development of policies, programmes and decisions, proper account is taken of their impact on women and of the Government's general policy objectives in the matter.</P>
      <P>Expenditure by my Department relates mainly to the provision by local authorities of various economic, social and environmental infrastructure programmes, and is not, therefore, aimed specifically at either women or men.  Many of the recent iniatives, such as those related to social housing, would, of course, have a direct and positive impact on the lives of many women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department actively promotes women's equality issues in the broader local authority context. <Col N="659" /> An Equality Working Group, comprising representatives from the Department and the City and County Managers, was established in 1995 to review equality matters in local authorities, and continues to meet regularly.  Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change also addresses the position of women in local authorities, and sets out a strategy for dealing with gender imbalance in relation to appointments and promotion.</P>
    <P>Details of my Department's budget for 1995 and 1996, including its staffing and overhead costs, are published in the Revised Estimates for Public Services, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The work of the examinations branch of my Department is a yearly cycle which rises to a peak in the summer months.  The peak period is from the start of the certificate examinations in June to the issue of the junior certificate results in mid-September. The resources employed in managing this pattern comprise a core permanent staffing complement augmented by temporary employees and overtime working.</P>
      <P>Industrial action is being taken by members of the Public Service Executive Union in my Department.

Under the current pilot phase of the teacher counsellor scheme, 27 teacher counsellor posts have been allocated to selected schools in the North inner city and Clondalkin areas of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The role of the teacher counsellor is two-fold: to co-ordinate a whole-school approach to devising and implementing good practice and strategies that will help to prevent the occurrence of disruptive behaviour, and to teach and counsel small groups and individuals who exhibit persistent behavioural difficulties in the classroom.</P>
      <P>The operation of the scheme is being closely monitored by my Department's inspectorate.  The question of any further expansion of the scheme will be considered following a detailed review of the pilot phase and having regard to resource availability.</P>

      <P>However, while disruptive behaviour in the classroom may be a symptom of the problems to which the Deputy refers, it is not the function of the teacher counsellor to become directly involved in addressing such matters where they relate to a pupil's home situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>The principle of gender equality underpins all the initiatives undertaken by the Department of Education.  Equality was one of the basic principles underpinning the White Paper, &ldquo;Charting Our Education Future&rdquo;, and statutory underpinning is given to this principle in the Universities Bill, 1996, the Education Bill, 1997 and other legislation in place in the education area.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department to promote gender equity in education and to eliminate sexism and sex-stereotyping.  A working group in my Department monitors and co-ordinates activities relating to the equality of opportunity for girls and boys.  Equality issues in the areas of curriculum, in-career development, employment, administration, inspection and management are monitored regularly and improvements will continue to be made on an ongoing basis in all areas of the education system.</P>
      <P>All curricula, textbooks and examination papers are gender proofed, and research into gender issues has been undertaken by the Department, some third level institutions and the Economic and Social Research Institute.</P>
      <P>All institutions participating in ESF aided programmes are encouraged to pay particular attention to equal opportunities in the planning of courses and the recruitment of trainees and to the need to expose both sexes to a broader range of occupational experiences than those traditionally offered.  The criteria for admission of students to programmes are applied equally to both sexes.</P>
      <P>As part of the strategic management initiative's increased focus on training, a wide range of training courses, including equality training courses, are available to officials in my Department.</P>
      <P>Equality modules are featured in pre-service training programmes for staff in schools and colleges. All inservice courses funded by the Department are required to contain a gender equality module.  Twenty-one primary teachers have been trained as trainers in gender equality issues and an information pack containing guidelines for teachers on the promotion of equal opportunities was circulated to all primary schools in 1994.  In addition, to assist persons organising summer courses in organising effective gender equality inputs, regional seminars are organised in advance of the summer programme to explore appropriate in-service strategies.  The seminars are led by expert trainers in the area of gender equality.  Finally, a number of third level institutions currently offer courses in women's studies.</P>
      <P>While all initiatives taken in my Department are targeted equally at women and men, a number of specific projects have been undertaken to improve the level of gender equality in the education system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has for many years made special arrangements in the certificate examination for candidates who would have difficulty in communicating what they know to an examiner because of physical and sensory disabilities, including visual and hearing impairments, or because of a specific learning difficulty.</P>
      <P>The special arrangements are intended to remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate's performance and thus enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment.  They are also intended to ensure that, whilst giving candidates every opportunity to demonstrate their level of attainment, the special arrangements will not give the candidate an unfair advantage over other candidates in the same examination.</P>
      <P>In the case of the candidates referred to by the Deputy, the position is that their school applied for special examinations arrangements on the grounds that they are affected by a specific learning difficulty.  The applications, together with supporting documentation, were considered by a Department psychologist.  The psychologist expressed the opinion, based on all the evidence presented, that the learning difficulties of the candidates arose from their level of general ability and were not due to specific difficulties in reading or in writing.  It was concluded, in the circumstances, that the candidates were not eligible for special arrangements in the examinations.</P>
      <P>This decision was conveyed to the candidates' school on 6 November 1996.  The school appealed, by letter dated 11 December 1996, to the special arrangements appeals committee, renewing their application for a person to read the questions to the candidates and for the use by the candidates of a tape recorder to record their answers.</P>
      <P>The special arrangements appeals committee is an independent body of five persons, consisting of two officers of my Department and three members from outside my Department, including the chairperson.  After reviewing all the evidence, the committee concluded that the candidates are not eligible for special arrangements in the examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that a recent psychological report, where available, is requested by my Department as part of the application process for special arrangements based on the existence of a specific learning difficulty.  Since a detailed report from a clinical psychologist was submitted in support of <Col N="669" /> each application, in relation to assessments carried out in January 1995, it was decided that there was no need to carry out a further assessment.</P>
    <P>I should further add that the school has been assured that every possible effort will be made to mark the candidates' work reliably in accordance with the marking scheme and to ensure that they are given full credit for all work done.  The school has also been informed, in this connection, that the examiners to whom the candidates' scripts are assigned for correction will be informed of the school's concern regarding the readability of their work and will be instructed, if they have difficulty in reading the scripts, to send them to an examiner who is more experienced in marking work which is difficult to read because of misspellings, bad handwriting, poor grammar, etc.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127, 128 and 129 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very conscious of all gender related issues <Col N="677" /> in my Department and of the need to continue to implement all aspects of Government policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>All proposals which I submit to Government for consideration include an assessment of their impact on women and all senior management in my Department have been made aware of Government policy on gender related issues in the context of the policies, programmes and decisions implemented by them.</P>
    <P>All policies, programmes and decisions pertaining to An Garda Síochána are, for example, specifically proofed to assess their impact on women.  At a detailed training level, training staff at the Garda College gender proof their material and continually revise and update this aspect of <Col N="678" /> training.  The most recent update has reflected the proceedings of an EU-funded training seminar under the &ldquo;New Opportunities for Women&rdquo; initiative.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of the gender balancing of boards under the aegis of my Department, my own nominations account for most of the board members involved.  In this regard, I am committed to complying, where possible, with the policy standard of a minimum of 40 per cent of both men and women among the members.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the members nominated by other authorities or bodies is set out in the following table.  Gender balance from organisations outside the aegis of my Department is more difficult to achieve and the need for specific expertise is often an influencing factor.</P>

      <P>The establishment of local offices for the probation and welfare service is in keeping with my Department's policy as set down in the policy document &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo; which was published in June 1994.  It is also in keeping with my Department's probation and welfare service's strategic management initiative which aims to improve customer service by developing a number of local offices.  The service has 23 offices nationwide and a list of locations follows.  New offices and a day centre for the probation and welfare service are under construction in North Clondalkin, Dublin.  It is intended to provide local offices in Ballyfermot, Coolock, Swords, north and south inner city at some future stage.  No premises have been indentified at this stage.</P>
      <P>The normal procedures for the acquisition of Government offices are followed in the case of offices for the probation and welfare service.  The new premises at Finglas, Dublin 11, was assigned to my Department by the Office of Public Works. Permission was granted on 26 July 1994, by Dublin Corporation Planning Department for a change of use of the premises from recreational use to Government offices to which the public will have access.  My Department's probation and welfare service considers the premises to be suited to their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The premises caters for clients from Finglas, Ballymun and immediate surrounding areas.  It also provides space for group meetings and activities. Clients of the service will visit the office as required and officers based there will also visit clients in their homes.  It is difficult to give precise <Col N="681" /> figures regarding attendance at this stage since the office is only open a short while.  However, based on the experience of other local offices an average of ten to 12 persons on supervision attend each day by appointment.  Other callers to the office include the clients' partners, parents, solicitors or community groups attending meetings or seeking advice.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some local residents have concerns about the new premises.  I assure the Deputy that every effort has been made to ensure that this new accommodation will be properly managed by the probation and welfare service personnel and every effort will be made to ensure that it will not have any negative impact on local business or residents in the surrounding areas.  I understand that probation and welfare service management has already been in discussion with some local interests to reassure them in this matter. My Department's probation and welfare service has operated very successfully in other suburban areas, developing good links with the local communities.  However, if there are any concerns regarding the operation of the new offices in Finglas, my Department's officials will investigate them.</P>

      <P>In addition to the scheme of grants to <Col N="682" /> voluntary organisations, under which once-off grants may be made to assist voluntary and community organisations working with disadvantaged groups or in disadvantaged areas, my Department has also established a separate fund for the development of information services.  This fund was established primarily to enable the Department to explore innovative and more effective methods of providing information on social welfare issues.  These include, for example, a number of joint information initiatives aimed at improving access to information for people with disabilities, for lone parents and unemployed people wishing to avail of the various back-to-work or education initiatives.</P>
      <P>In certain circumstances, grants from this fund can be made towards the cost of administering welfare rights and information services provided by non-statutory organisations.  In the past, the main recipients have been the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, both of which operate welfare rights services as a support for their local centres for the unemployed.  Other organisations benefiting have been Coolock Community Law Centre and the National Adult Literacy Agency.</P>
      <P>This fund is normally used to enable nationally based organisations to provide training and supports for information centres at local level and there is generally no provision for directly funding locally based community groups who wish to establish information services on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the National Social Service Board was transferred to my Department in 1995. Proposals for improving and further resourcing independent information services are currently being examined in the context of a three-year strategic plan drawn up by the board which aims to achieve major improvements in network of locally based information centres over this period. These centres offer a broad range of information, guidance and advice on the full range of social service issues, including information on employment and training options for unemployed people.</P>

      <P>All initiatives undertaken by my Department are gender-proofed as a matter of course in line with my Department's high level goal, as provided for in the strategic management initiative, of providing services in an efficient, effective, <Col N="684" /> non-discriminatory and caring manner which are responsive to the needs of all our customers.  In doing this, account is taken of gender research that is generally available such as the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  My Department was represented on the monitoring committee set up to oversee the implementation of the Commission's recommendations and on the interdepartmental group representative of those Departments into whose remit the bulk of the Commission's recommendations fall.</P>
      <P>Decisions on entitlement to social welfare benefits are made by statutorily appointed deciding officers in accordance with the provisions of relevant legislation.</P>
      <P>My Department is also very conscious of its obligations in the area of gender-sensitive training and the training programmes of the Department's staff development unit take into account a wide range of equality issues and needs.  Customer service training for our frontline staff focuses on the need for equality of treatment and service to all our customers in a dignified and sensitive manner.  In addition, presentations on the need to manage staff on the basis of equality of treatment and opportunity are given as an integral part of our management training programme.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in recent years in implementing equal treatment for men and women in the social welfare code and I am glad to report that this year's Social Welfare Bill will complete a programme of equal treatment which will ensure that all of the social assistance and insurance schemes operated by my Department are available equally to men and women.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill, 1997, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a new widower's non-contributory pension, which will be available to widowers on the same basis as currently applies to women, and for the amendment of the more restrictive conditions which apply to the benefits available for both widows and widowers under the occupational injuries benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>The Bill also includes a number of other measures which will be of particular benefit to women.  These include the introduction of new <i>pro rata</i> contributory pensions, which will benefit many women with sporadic employment records. The introduction of provisions to enable adult dependant's allowances to be retained in part when the spouse of a social welfare recipient takes up employment is another measure which will be of particular benefit to women who have found themselves trapped in a cycle of unemployment caused by the current arrangements.  The Bill also provides for the extension of maternity benefit to self-employed women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming into office, this Government has paid in full the arrears of equal treatment payments owing to 70,000 married women and amounting to almost £300 million.  In addition, a new one-parent family payment was introducted in January 1997 as a replacement for the lone parent's <Col N="685" /> allowance, deserted wife's benefit, deserted wives allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance. This new payment covers men and women equally, irrespective of whether they are married, separated, widowed or divorced or what their reasons are for becoming lone parents.  A notable feature of this measure is that the requirement to prove desertion has been removed from the social welfare code, thus eliminating a requirement which was particularly difficult and degrading for many women.</P>

      <P>It has been a central objective of mine since becoming Minister for Social Welfare to remove all traces of inequality as between men and women from the social welfare system.  To this end, a number of major steps have been taken: The arrears of equal treatment payments owing to 70,000 married women, amounting to almost £300 million, have been paid; a new one-parent family payment was introduced in January 1997 and has replaced lone parent's allowance, deserted wife's benefit, deserted wives allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance.  This new payment covers men and women equally, irrespective of whether they are married, separated, widowed or divorced or what their reasons are for becoming lone parents.  A notable feature of this measure is that the requirement to prove desertion has been removed from the social welfare code, thus eliminating a requirement which was particularly difficult and degrading for many women; the Social Welfare Bill, 1997 which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a new widower's non-contributory pension, which will be available to widowers on the same basis as currently applies to women, and for the amendment of the more restrictive conditions which apply to the benefits available for both widows and widowers under the occupational injuries benefit scheme.</P>

    <P>The Bill also includes a number of other measures which will be of particular benefit to women.  These include the introduction of new <i>pro rata</i> contributory pensions, which will benefit many women with sporadic employment records. The introduction of provisions to enable adult dependant's allowances to be retained in part when the spouse of a social welfare recipient takes up employment is another measure which will be of particular benefit to women who have found themselves trapped in a cycle of unemployment caused by the current arrangements.  The <Col N="686" /> Bill is also providing for the extension of maternity benefit to self-employed women.</P>
    <P>The effect of the measures I have outlined will be to complete a programme of equal treatment which ensures that all of the social assistance and insurance schemes operated by my Department are available equally to men and women.</P>
    <P>The cost of all these initiatives is about £587 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I might mention also that, as part of my Department's Community Development Programme, the scheme of grants to locally-based women's groups provides grants to groups involved in programmes of self-help and personal development designed to tackle poverty and disadvantage. The funding is intended to help with the costs of projects such as those which encourage self-help and personal development for women working in the home, develop parenting skills, encourage the active participation of women in their community and help address social problems such as stress and isolation. Approximately 750 groups were grant-aided in 1995 at a cost of £900,000.  In 1996, 790 groups were grant-aided at a cost of £1,155,000.</P>
    <P>A number of established women's groups also receive core funding from my Department to enable them to benefit from the security of continuity of funding over a three-year period and to enable them to further develop and enhance their services.  In 1995, 22 such groups were funded at a cost of £199,000 and in 1996, 23 groups were funded at a cost of £209,000.</P>
    <P>My Department also provided funding of £84,000 in 1996 for four women's networks who, in turn, resource and support women's groups in their areas through information and advice, joint training, sharing of experience and considering the policy issues arising from their work.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Partnership 2000 agreement recently negotiated provided that a working party including relevant Departments and the social partners will be established to examine the question of equal access by women to labour market opportunities including training, education and employment programmes.  Partnership 2000 recognises that women should not be penalised with regard to the availability of employment supports, including training and that they should have equal access to all labour market opportunities.  I will be consulting shortly with the various groups with a view to having this working group set up as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Total social welfare expenditure in 1995, including expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund, amounted to some £4,199 million while the figure for 1996 was £4,377 million.  Staffing and overhead costs in 1995 and 1996 amounted to £132 million and £134 million respectively.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has the lead responsibility for the formulation of national policy on tourism and trade matters.  Its key objectives and strategies aim at helping Ireland's exporters and tourism operators to enhance their foreign earnings capabilities and to strengthen themselves in the marketplace at home and abroad. As such, the focus is on developing business activity and is, therefore, gender neutral.  No particular initiative required to be targeted at women as a result.</P>
      <P>Information on my Department's budgets for 1995 and 1996 is available in the &ldquo;Revised Estimates for Public Services&rdquo; for each of these years. Internally, my Department operates a policy of equal opportunity in respect of all aspects of personnel procedure including appointments, promotions, training and development.  Officials develop their expertise in this area through external networking and on-the-job training.</P>

      <P>I am concerned to ensure that the policies and programmes operated by and under the aegis of my Department are equally open to all who qualify, regardless of gender.  Equality of opportunity is a fundamental imperative of my Department's strategy for promoting employment.</P>
      <P>All new proposals from my Department which are submitted by me to Government for approval include a gender impact statement.  Observations from other Ministers, including the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, are also fully taken into account in the development of new proposals.</P>
      <P>No specific training is given in my Department in respect of gender proofing <i>per se</i> but I am satisfied that due account is paid to the likely impact on women of various proposals arising.  It is no more than I would expect and demand of an equal opportunity organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be particularly interested to learn that FÁS is currently operating a pilot gender-proofing project part-funded by Employment &mdash; NOW, which aims at piloting and implementing a gender proofing system linked into the quality mark.  FÁS is collaborating with the Irish Quality Association in developing an equality dimension for inclusion in the Irish business excellence model.  Quality audits have been undertaken.  Two locations are piloting the initiative <Col N="691" /> both of which already have been awarded the quality mark.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's programme, set out in <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, the first priority in labour market policy is given to the long-term unemployed.  To facilitate women in benefiting fully from these programmes I have ensured that the main labour market programmes, community employment and the jobs initiative, can also be accessed by adult dependents of the long-term unemployed and that persons in receipt of one parent allowance may also qualify for assistance through Job-Start and Work-Place.</P>
      <P>In general the enterprise strategy of my Department and its agencies is focused on companies rather than individuals.  However, in the normal course of their business the industrial development agencies seek to ensure that any individual programmes are equally accessible to male and female applicants.  For instance within Forbairt initiatives have recently been taken to ensure that the Techstart-Techman and Applied Research Grant scheme are made more accessible to women.</P>
      <P>Since 1990 FÁS has had in place an annual Action Programme for Women &mdash; Woman in Focus.  This programme has the following objectives: to promote actively the breaking down of traditional patterns of occupational segregation by encouraging increased female participation in sectors of the labour market traditionally dominated by men; to promote actively the participation of women at all levels in growing, future-oriented sectors of the labour market including technical and managerial occupations in order to achieve better use of human resources, and to promote actively the upgrading of existing skills levels among women.</P>
      <P>The approach adopted in this programme is a target-based one which has focused on programmes where women have traditionally been under represented.  Each year targets have been set on an incremental basis in order to achieve an increased level of women's participation.  This programme has been successful and 43 per cent of participants on FÁS programmes in 1996 were women.  The equivalent figure for 1990 was 32 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The focus of this annual programme has been to ensure that women's participation in FÁS programmes is mainstreamed.  In 1995, £125.351 million <Col N="692" /> direct expenditure was spent on women and in 1996 the equivalent figure was £150.293 million.</P>
    <P>In addition, in 1996 FÁS operated two NOW projects &mdash; aimed at women &mdash; and funding for these projects was to the sum of £139,555. EMPLOYMENT &mdash; NOW; New Opportunities for Women, is a European Union programme administered by my Department.  Its aims are to help reduce unemployment among women and improve the position of those already in the workforce through the promotion of equal opportunities strategies.  Following a public call for project proposals in 1995, 39 pilot projects have been funded, to run up to the end of 1997.  The total EU budget for the period is £6.5 million approximately and with matching funding at 25 per cent the total value of the programme is £8.7 million.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise boards are encouraged to develop initiatives, in the context of their enterprise plans, which contribute to greater involvement of women in enterprise.  Examples of support for women's enterprises are contained in the report of City and County Enterprise Board Activities, 1993-95, which I launched yesterday. The position in relation to 1996 will be addressed in a further report.</P>
    <P>In light of the foregoing the Deputy will appreciate that there is no specific budget for initiatives targeted at women as the intention is that women should have equal access to funding.</P>
    <P>Full details of my Department's expenditure for the years 1995 and 1996, including staffing and ovehead costs, may be found in the Book of Estimates for each year which is, of course, available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>Both Forbairt and IDA Ireland, the principal industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department, have been extensively promoting the factory in Ballyjamesduff since it became vacant in May 1991 when Alfa Elastics ceased its operations there.  To enhance its appeal, IDA Ireland, which owns the facility, has even offered it at substantially more attractive rates than the agency's norm for such a building. I have now been advised that discussions are ongoing between Forbairt and a potential client for the factory.  Forbairt is optimistic of a positive outcome to these discussions.  However, the <Col N="693" /> Deputy will appreciate that the current negotiations are confidential and I am thus precluded from disclosing any details at this stage but I would hope an announcement will be made in the manner shortly.</P>
      <P>As regards employment in Ballyjamesduff generally, the good news from Cavan County Enterprise Board is that, since its establishment in 1993, the board has approved 13 projects in the town and surrounding area.  An amount of £141,198 has been approved in grants for these projects; £54,416 of this has already been drawn down.  The projects are projected to result in 39 full-time and three part-time jobs of which 22 full-time and one part-time are already in place.</P>

      <P>As a result of technical problems which arose with the Companies Registration Office's computer system, a limited number of the CRO's services were unavailable since Monday, 24 February.  The most significant of these was the registration of new companies.  When the problem occurred, the Companies Registration Office undertook immediate and urgent remedial works to correct it.  However, the work involved was complex, and took some time.  I am happy to advise that the problem has been rectified, and a normal service has been restored.  Work has commenced on clearing the documents which have built up in the company incorporation area.  This should be completed in a week or so.</P>

      <P>In the announcement in April 1995 that the Government had decided in principle to locate the Dublin Science and Technology Park at the Citywest Business Campus on the Naas Road, the Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology indicated the Government's belief that the considerable investment that had already taken place and the <Col N="694" /> high quality design concept involved at that location provided an ideal opportunity to develop a science park, as recommended in the McKenna report, in a timely and cost effective manner.</P>
      <P>In the event, discussions on the detailed feasibility study to be carried out between Citywest and an expert group comprised of the development agencies, my Department and the universities have proved very difficult, particularly in relation to the amount of funding being sought by the universities.  The universities have now embarked on their own feasibility study and the Minister has invited them to further discussions when the conclusions of that study are available.</P>
      <P>A number of prestigious companies have been attracted to the park including Xilinx, GEA-Tuchenhagen, Saturn Solutions and Viking Components. The choice of Citywest as a location by these companies is itself a vindication of its selection as the site for the Dublin science park, as they are precisely the type of companies that the science park concept is designed to attract.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile a separate proposal for an innovation centre is being considered from the south Dublin chamber of commerce and the Tallaght Regional Technical College with the assistance of Forbairt.</P>

      <P>My Department received bids from seven tenderers for the administration of the Leader II national networking arrangements in Ireland; the tenders were received in my Department on or before Friday, 20 September 1996; three tenders were dated 20 September 1996, two tenders were dated September 1996 and one tender was dated 19 September 1996; while the tender selected was not the lowest tender received it was the lowest priced of the three tender bids considered most suitable in terms of price, three tenders received were lower than the selected tender.</P>
      <P>The procedure followed in the tendering process was in accordance with the EU rules governing the award of public service contracts and involved a thorough process of evaluation including submission for approval by the Government Contracts Committee.  The successful tender was selected as it was considered to be the most economically advantageous bid having regard to the service to be provided.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of the tender the contract is awarded initially for a period of one year.  The contract may be renewed at that stage or a further competition may be held.  The tender cost accepted for the first year is £280,441 including VAT.</P>
      <P>A partner in the company of the successful tenderer has been a State employee on full-time secondment from the company, for the last four years.  In accordance with the requirements of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 a full declaration of his interests was made.  The person involved is employed in another Department and as he had no involvement in the tendering or selection procedure I am satisfied that there is no conflict of interest.</P>

      <Quest>if he will provide a report on the mechanisms used for gender proofing the Operational Programmes under the Community Support Framework in respect of programmes for rural development; the way in which this gender proofing is working; and the way in which it has made a difference to rural development programmes.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6944/97]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry (OPARDF) contains a number of actions to be carried out to ensure implementation of the Government's specific commitment in the Community Support Framework aimed at the elimination of any possible discrimination against women and at achievement of full equality <Col N="696" /> between men and women.  The actions involve: collection of all data where appropriate, on a gender basis; facility for the social partners to report on any instances of indirect discrimination in the eligibility criteria of schemes operated; greater action by Teagasc in promoting participation by women in all of their courses and continued aid to the National Co-op for Farm Relief services to help further develop its services, including the provision of home relief-childcare facilities where potential for this is identified.</P>
      <P>Progress made in all of these areas is reported on to the monitoring committee of the OPARDF which meets twice yearly.  Most of the schemes being implemented under the OP are demand led and equally open to men and women.  However, as regards the first action above, the reports naturally show a low level of female participation in the main capital investment schemes because of the historical fact that the transfer of land through inheritance is mainly to men.  An equally important aspect of course, is the fact that many farms are run on a partnership basis and involve a high level of participation and decision-making by women.</P>
      <P>As regards the second action, the social partners were specifically asked to address this issue in 1996 and reported no discrimination.</P>
      <P>In relation to the third action, it has been acknowledged that Teagasc has made substantial progress in promoting equal opportunities for women in their training programmes.  This has been achieved by holding courses specifically for rural women on rural enterprise opportunities and community leadership.  Twenty-one of these type of courses were held for 472 women in 1996. In addition, a further 48 courses covering 1,104 women on other topics requested by women were held in 1996.  Teagasc is also involved in a corporate gender proofing programme to promote the greater participation by women in the organisation as a whole.</P>
      <P>On the fourth action above, a pilot programme is under way as regards the provisions of home relief-children facilities but it is too soon to say whether this type of project has long-term viability.</P>
      <P>Finally, under the OPARDF, an independent analysis and evaluation unit was set up in 1995 to evaluate the OP.  Their work programme for January-June 1997 includes the carrying out of a study to assess the progress achieved under the the OP to date in relation to equal opportunities may be required in relation to any recent developments in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Operating Rules which have been introduced under the operational programme for the implementation of the Leader II programme require approved groups to take account of equality of opportunity in assessing applications for aid and these rules direct groups not to grant aid a project whose promoter operates or is considered likely to operate after the project is completed a policy of discrimination against persons <Col N="697" /> on grounds of gender etc., even if no complaint is made about the discrimination.  Boards of Leader groups are required to have a target of at least 40 per cent female directors over the life of the programme.</P>
    <P>I understand that these arrangements are working well.  The independent mid-term review report found that at present 21 per cent of directors of Leader II boards are women; this is likely to increase as arrangements for rotation of board members takes effect.  Of the private individuals who have benefited from Leader II funding, it was found that approximately 37 per cent are female and 15 per cent are joint beneficiaries.</P>

      <Col N="698" /> The details requested in respect of the other boards are as follows: Section 7 (b) of the First Schedule of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988 provides that five of the ten ordinary members of the Teagasc Authority shall be persons nominated for appointment &ldquo;by such organisations as the Minister may determine that are representative of persons engaged in agriculture or the promotion or development of the agricultural industry; and the Minister may appoint as members of Teagasc one or more persons nominated under this subparagraph by such an organisation as aforesaid or one or more persons nominated by a group, designated by the Minister, of such organisations as aforesaid&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For this purpose, the following organisations were designated by ministerial order of 30 June 1988: Irish Farmers' Association; Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association; Macra na Feirme; Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, and a group of 12 Teagasc trade unions-staff associations.</P>
    <P>The An Bord Bia (Amendment) Act, 1996, provides that one of the ordinary members is appointed on the nomination of an organisation which the Minister considers to be representative of consumers.</P>
    <P>The nominating bodies for the first members of the National Milk Agency were:</P>
    <P>(a)  Irish Farmers' Association, 4 members¹;</P>
    <P>(b)  Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, 1 member¹;</P>
    <P>(c)  Consumers' Association of Ireland, 1 member;</P>

    <P>(e)  National Milk Traders' Association, 1 member;</P>
    <P>(f)  National Dairies' Association, 4 members.</P>
    <P>¹ These are producer representatives who were nominated by the farm organisations to get the Agency started.  In future, the producer representatives will be elected by the registered producers themselves, while the nomination system will remain for the others.</P>
    <P>Section 7(1) of the Schedule to the Act provides that of the Authority: two shall be stewards of the Irish Turf Club nominated for appointment thereto by the stewards of that body; one shall be a steward of the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee nominated for appointment thereto by the stewards of that body; two shall be representative of authorised racecourses nominated for appointment thereto by such persons as the Minister considers to be representative of authorised racecourses; one shall be representative of horse breeders nominated for appointment thereto by such persons as the Minister considers to be representative of horse breeders; one shall be representative of horse owners nominated for appointment thereto by such persons as the Minister considers to be representative of horse owners; one shall be representative of horse trainers nominated for appointment thereto by such <Col N="699" /> persons as the Minister considers to be representative of horse trainers; one shall be representative of authorised bookmakers nominated for appointment thereto by such persons as the Minister considers to be representative of authorised bookmakers; one shall be representative of persons employed in the horseracing industry nominated for appointment thereto by such persons as the Minister considers to be representative of such persons; one shall be representative of racegoers nominated for appointment thereto by such persons as the Minister considers to be representative of racegoers; one shall be representative of national hunt interests nominated for appointment thereto by the Racing Regulatory Body.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (3) (a) of the schedule provides that in subparagraph (1) (c) to (j) the person appointed by the Minister in each case to be a member of the Authority shall be chosen by the Minister from a panel of at least three persons, containing as far as is practicable at least one male and one female nomination, submitted to the Minister by the representative interests concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (3) (b) provides that the representative interests concerned shall, when submitting nominations to the Minister under subparagraph (1) (a) to (j) create an equitable balance in those nominations from the interests which they represent.</P>

As part of my submission to the Commission I raised the question of the payment of an extensification premium on sheep. The Commission did not accept my proposal on the basis that sheep production was deemed to be an extensive farming system and that such a premium would be extremely costly.  However, <Col N="702" /> under the REPS programme there are very generous levels of aid available to producers wishing to reduce their flock size.  I will continue to pursue this issue.</P>

      <P>EU legislation requires that the label on compound feedingstuffs shows all the ingredients in descending order by weight.  As an option, compounders may declare categories of ingredients in descending order by weight.  As an option, compounders adopted the latter approach.</P>
      <P>Some feed compounders have already taken steps to list ingredients by weight and others have indicated their intention to do so in the near future.  I am most anxious that this should become the norm as soon as possible.  To this end the Government has undertaken in Partnership 2000 to seek that licensed compounders should declare ingredients in descending order and if necessary will seek changes in EU legislation to bring this about.  The timing of this will depend on ongoing developments.</P>

      <Quest>the improvements, if any, which were made during 1996 in the payment schedules and quality of service laid down in the Farmers' Charter of Rights; and the improvements, if any, he will deliver in 1997.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I took up office over two years ago a priority was to improve the quality of service provided by my Department.  The charter of rights launched four months later was a clear expression of my commitment to that goal.  Since <Col N="703" /> the launch of the charter, farmers have a commitment in relation to the level of service they can expect from the Department, including the timely delivery of payments.</P>
      <P>As regards the payment schedules in respect of the various schemes administered by the Department, the targets for 1996 were by and large met. Payments under the 1996 schemes commenced on time and by the end of the year over £900 million in direct payment had been made.  This was an increase of some 20 per cent on the 1995 figures which were also a record.  However, in relation to some schemes, arable aid and compensatory headage payments in particular, all the payment deadlines could not be met in 1996.  The delays incurred in 1996 arose from two exceptional factors.  Firstly, as a result of industrial action in the Department earlier in 1996, the commencement of processing of area aid applications was delayed by a number of weeks.  Secondly, as part of the integrated administration and control system which is required by the EU in relation to all CAP compensatory and headage payments, Ireland was required to develop a new land parcel identification system (LPIS) in 1996.  Given the increased level of checks and controls associated with the LPIS, it was inevitable that some delay in making payment, when measured against the 1995 performance, would arise.</P>
      <P>I am confident that my Department can meet the various payment targets set out in the farmers' charter under the 1997 schemes, thereby improving on the 1996 performance.</P>
      <P>As part of my Department's ongoing strategy, set out in the charter, to ensure that farmers are fully aware of their entitlements and to improve the quality of services to them, I have recently launched a new explanatory guide to ewe premium and suckler cow quotas.  I am also introducing, with effect from 1997, a new service for producers wishing to trade quota rights.  The new service, which is being provided free by my Department, will facilitate the mutual exchange of information between producers who wish to trade quota rights by making it easier for farmers who have quota to sell or lease to find a buyer or lessee.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made on improving facilities in our offices to provide confidential consultations for farmers and better accommodation for staff.  Work commenced late last year on a £4 million extension and refurbishment to our offices in Castlebar and new local offices are being built in a number of counties.  I was also pleased to announce earlier this year the placing of the contract for the construction of new decentralised offices for the Department at Johnstown Castle, County Wexford.  In addition an improved telephone system is being installed in local offices which will allow easier and cheaper access by farmers to all the Department's services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitment to establish an appeals unit was met on target and I am pleased to say that <Col N="704" /> this is working well.  The review group to monitor the implementation of the charter has been established and is meeting quarterly.  The farm organisations are represented on this group and I believe that this provides a very useful forum to monitor progress on all commitments given in the charter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite aware of the potential of pursuing a policy of alignment of the transport, energy and communications infrastructures between Ireland and the North.  Accordingly, I can assure the Deputy that very serious consideration has been given to, and will continue to be given to, the pursuit of such a policy.  In particular, I should mention that the current development plans for each jurisdiction have paid close attention to the opportunities for expanding collaboration, in a range of areas, including the development of infrastructure networks in transport, energy and communications, in the context of European funding.  Both the National Development Plan 1994-99 for Ireland and the Structural Funds Plan 1994-99 for Northern Ireland contain a common chapter setting out the rationale for closer economic co-operation; reviewing the progress which has already been made, and examining the scope for developing collaboration further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the current Joint INTERREG Programme for Northern Ireland and Ireland, which provides for an EU backed investment programme, over the period 1994-99 includes provisions for the development of the transport, energy and communications sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The objective of <Col N="705" /> the INTERREG Programme is the promotion, creation and development of networks of cross border co-operation and, where relevant, the linking of these networks to wider community networks, in the context of the completion of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>In relation to the final part of the Deputy's question, I would point out that, while, as yet, I have not had any official talks with the Northern Ireland authorities, there are ongoing and well established contacts between my Department, and State companies for which I have responsibilty, and their Northern Ireland counterparts, about issues of mutal interest in the energy, transport and communications areas.</P>

      <P>Performance in 1997 will be crucial in determining whether TEAM will achieve the objectives of the five year plan and, in this regard, it will be a matter for TEAM and Aer Lingus group management to assess the continuing adequacy of the plan in the light of developments impacting on profitability.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question relates to the question of the payment of subsistence allowance to members of the Permanent Defence Force personnel involved with the BSE-related operations in Border areas. The provisions governing the payment of subsistence allowance to Defence Forces personnel are provided for in Defence Force Regulations. Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, the payment of allowances comes within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association and may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the association.  The question of the payment of allowances to personnel involved with the BSE-related operations in Border areas has been raised by the association under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme and is under active consideration at present.  Under the terms of the scheme, as agreed with the association, discussions on claims which are being processed are confidential.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

      <P>The Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990 provided for the establishment of an independent and effective system of representation for the Defence Forces. Under this Act, remuneration and certain other conditions of service come within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association.  Under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force, which was established in agreement with the association, claims relating to the above matters may be processed.  I am satisfied that the scheme is working well.  Currently a number of issues relating to pay and conditions of service are being satisfactorily processed under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>In October 1996 I announced that women would be eligible to enlist in the Naval Service for the first time.  Women are now eligible to join all areas of the Permanent Defence Force on an equal basis with men.  It is not possible to give a costing for this initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Estimate for the years 1995 and 1996 was £373.662 million and £385.4 million respectively.  Personnel costs, inclusive of civil servants, civilian employees, members of the Defence Forces and the Reserve, accounted for approximately 80 per cent of the allocation in each year.  There is no formal proofing of programmes <Col N="711" /> or decisions to assess their impact on women.  However the recently published strategy statement states that the policy of the Department of Defence is that in the management of its human resources it will accord all staff equality of opportunity and treatment.</P>

    <P>1.  The above appointments are formally made by the Minister for the Marine, on foot of nominations made by the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>2.  Elections of employee directors will take place in Cork, Dublin and Dún Laoghaire within the next year, to appoint 2 employee directors at each of the ports.</P>
    <P>In the case of nominations to the boards of port companies, the attention of the local authorities concerned was drawn to Government policy on the appointment of women to the boards of State bodies.  Similar action will be taken in advance of the next nominations by local authorities to harbour authorities.</P>
    <P>Two of the five directors of Arramara Teo are appointed by Nutra Sweet Kelco Company.  In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that a proportion of the places on Regional Fisheries Boards and Trout and Coarse Fisheries Development Societies are filled by election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 188 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> Deputies will be aware that I recently introduced legislation to enable the Commissioners of Irish Lights to continue to provide radio-based aids to marine navigation which the Supreme Court found to be <i>ultra vires</i> the powers of the commissioners under the 1894 Merchant Shipping Act.  The Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill, 1997 was passed by the Dáil on 18 February and is currently before the Seanad.  I have explained to both Houses that the need to urgently introduce this Bill arose following a letter which I received from the chairman of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  The chairman informed me that the Commissioners had received legal advice that each commissioner was potentially liable for any claims or expenses arising out of the non-statutory illegal operation of radio aids to navigation and that they had no option, therefore, but to notify mariners of the termination of such aids as and from 28 February unless the required legislation was passed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> I met with the commissioners on 6 February and they subsequently agreed to defer the closure of radio aids on foot of an assurance from me that I would introduce the necessary legislation as quickly as possible.  I should mention that there was never any question of the commissioners discontinuing other types of aids to navigation, such as lighthouses, as these were not affected by the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>While I have had no further discussions with the commissioners since the meeting on 6 February, Department officials are in regular contact with the commissioners who have been made aware of my decision to establish a public forum in relation to the Loran C project and that, following the outcome of the current Supreme Court case and the public forum, they may not proceed with the erection of a Loran C mast without undertaking a renewed and appropriate planning application procedure.</P>
    <P>The present position is that all navigational aids in place are fully operational.</P>
