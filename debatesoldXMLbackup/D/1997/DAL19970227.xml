      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to introduce legislation dealing with the reform and restructuring of the national training authority, FÁS, later this year and, if so, will it also cover other State agencies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the High Court decision yesterday in the Gilligan case, will the Government avail of the opportunity in the Finance Bill to close off any loopholes so that the entire proceeds of crime can be seized and the Criminal Assets Bureau can conduct its work efficiently?  I understand the difficulty arises in relation to section 194 of the Income Tax Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the advanced technology college in Merrion Square is in examinership, will the Taoiseach outline the position in regard to the legislation to regulate private <Col N="1110" /> education to ensure proper educational standards, consumer protection and employee rights referred to in page 29 of the programme, A Government of Renewal?  When will the legislation be ready?  What steps does the Minister for Education intend to take to ensure that the students concerned are able to complete their courses and have their consumer rights protected?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Pending the reform of the Income Tax Act, 1967, following yesterday's High Court judgment, will the Taoiseach assure the House that the proceeds of crime legislation which relates to the status of the assets as opposed to the status of the accused will be enforced vigorously by the Criminal Assets Bureau during the hiatus which will inevitably develop?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach on Tuesday if his Government intended to issue a stamp to commemorate the death of St. Colmcille.  He said he would reply to me the following day.  The reply I received from his office stated, &ldquo;I have no plans to commemorate the 1400th anniversary of St. Colmcille&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government will make time available for the House to discuss the local government planning and development regulations?  This was raised with the Whip last night who conceded that we could discuss it on a date in March.  I am anxious that it be discussed before 21 sitting days elapse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach voice his concern to the Minister for Justice about the fact that it took 24 hours for the State Pathologist to arrive at the scene of two murders in Cork and Kerry in recent months?  Is he concerned about the added agony this causes families?  Is it possible, in the light of this experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In view of the huge allocation which this House passed for Teilifís na Gaeilge, can the Government do anything to try to get over those technical difficulties?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but perhaps his office could communicate with me on it later.  Two separate Bills have been promised &mdash; the Teastas legislation is quite separate to the legislation which was promised to regulate private third level colleges. When does the Government intend to introduce legislation to deal specifically with the protection of the consumer rights of students attending private third level colleges?  That has nothing to do with the legislation on Teastas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues here.  The first is certification that the courses are genuine, which is important consumer protection in itself and is provided for in the Teastas mechanism. There is also the question of bonding, as is the case with, for example, travel companies which get into difficulty.  That separate matter is also being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Equal Status Bill will, for the first time, give protection against discrimination outside the context of employment.  It deals with discrimination on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, colour, nationality, national or ethnic origin and membership of the travelling community, and gives those who are discriminated against a statutory means of redress.  It has a comprehensive scope covering provision of personal property and services, disposal of land and accommodation, education, partnerships and registered clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> I am pleased and honoured to introduce this important measure.  As Deputies may recall, in 1992 I had the privilege of moving the Second Stage of my party's Equal Status Bill.  Today's Bill parallels and complements the Employment Equality Bill which prohibits discrimination on similar grounds in the workplace.  This is a far-reaching and significant Bill which has the potential to improve the lives of many people.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about equality and rights.  It is based on the principle that everyone has an equal right to participate in our society.  Nobody should be denied access to services, facilities or amenities simply because of their skin colour, disability or membership of the travelling community.  Everyone, male or female, white or black, young or old, with or without a disability, should be seen as being of equal worth and entitlement.  Each person should be treated on his or her own merits and not on the basis of a prejudice or stereotype. We are all entitled not to be the victims of unjust discrimination.</P>
    <P>The primary reason for introducing this Bill is to provide protection against discrimination for those who have up to now had no statutory means of redress.  We cannot afford to be complacent about the degree of equality and tolerance in our community.  It cannot be denied that, for too many people, discrimination has been, and continues to be, an unpalatable reality.  Fr. Micheál MacGréil's recent book <i>Prejudice in Ireland Revisited</i> records a growing level of social prejudice against travellers, together with marked prejudice against and intolerance of certain religious groups, homosexuals and persons with certain disabilities, among others.  Such negative and hostile attitudes can and do manifest themselves in various forms of discrimination.  I have received numerous letters describing the stress, embarrassment, frustration and sense of injustice experienced by victims of discrimination.  There is currently no legal redress for the woman who cannot become a member of a local golf club simply because she is a woman, the person who is refused entry to a pub because he or she uses a wheelchair or the black person who is not given a flat simply because of his or her skin colour. Such people want more than sympathy; they want the protection of the law.</P>
    <P>In the absence of such legislation, we are unable to ratify the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. This convention has now been ratified by 155 countries, including all of our EU partners.  The enactment of the Equal Status Bill is also necessary to enable us lift a reservation on the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  Legislation on the lines of this Bill is, in various forms, commonplace elsewhere in the EU and in many other democracies.</P>
    <P>There is now widespread acceptance of the principle of equal status legislation.  The enactment of an Equal Status Bill has been a fundamental element of the programmes of successive <Col N="1118" /> Governments.  It has been endorsed by the social partners in both the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and Partnership 2000.  Recommendations relating to anti-discrimination legislation were contained in the Reports of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, the Task Force on the Travelling Community and the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, while anti-discrimination legislation of this type is new to Ireland, it has existed in many other countries for years.  In preparing this Bill, I and my officials have drawn on the provisions of other countries, particularly the common law jurisdictions such as the UK, Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Examination and comparison of the legislation of other countries and detailed discussion with those involved in the implementation of such legislation has been an important aspect of the Bill's development.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that when similar legislation was introduced in other countries there were fears of damage to business or fraudulent claims, similar to those which have been expressed about the present Bill.  Such fears were not realised, and anti-discrimination legislation works well and is accepted as a normal feature of life in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the Bill has also involved wide-ranging consultations with interested parties. From the outset I have taken the view that the views and proposals of all interested parties should be sought.  In 1993 I circulated a consultative document to over 80 persons and groups.  In the period since then I have had discussions with, and received submissions from, numerous interest groups.  Some groups have had discussions on a number of occasions with officials of my Department.  The groups which have made representations about this legislation have been extremely diverse.  I have heard the views of those representative of vintners, traveller interests, retailers, the insurance industry, gays and lesbians, people with disabilities, racial minorities, property owners and those pressing for greater equality for women in golf, among many others. All submissions received have been carefully examined in the preparation of the legislation.  I am also prepared to consider amendments put forward by Deputies which might be an improvement on what is currently in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before I go into the provisions of the Bill, I would like to make some general points about what it does and does not do.  There has been much apprehension and considerable misunderstanding about the effect of the Bill on publicans and other commercial interests.  I want to make it clear that the Bill will outlaw discrimination on specified grounds only.  It will not require traders to give open access to their premises.  It will not prevent business people, in the ordinary day to day running of their business, from refusing service to someone because of misbehaviour, security concerns, inappropriate dress and so on.  It will <Col N="1119" /> not give any protection whatsoever to troublemakers or anti-social elements.</P>
    <P>In response to the concerns expressed by publicans and other traders, I invited proposals for safeguards to be included in the Bill which would meet such concerns.  A number of such proposals were made and, having carefully considered them, I have included important safeguards in the Bill which will meet these concerns without in any way diluting the Bill's basic objectives.  While I will cover these at a later stage, I would draw Deputies' attention in particular to sections 16 and 55 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part I is essentially concerned with defining terms used in the Bill.  Deputies may wish to note the broad definition of disability in section 2.  There is also a comprehensive definition of &ldquo;services&rdquo;, which includes services and facilities of any nature, including access to and use of any place, banking or insurance services, facilities for entertainment, recreation or refreshment, cultural activities, transport or travel and professional or trade services. It does not include services provided under a contract of service, services which are not generally available to the public or services covered by the Employment Equality Bill.</P>
    <P>The key element of this part is section 3, which sets out what is meant by discrimination.  Discrimination occurs where, on discriminatory grounds that existed, exist, are believed to exist or are considered likely to come into existence, a person is treated less favourably than another person is, has been, or would be treated.  It also occurs where an organisation &mdash; a gay and lesbian society, for example &mdash; is treated less favourably because of the nature of its membership, or where a person is treated less favourably because of his or her association with a person or organisation to whom the discriminatory grounds apply. A further form of discrimination occurs where a requirement to comply with a condition has a disproportionately adverse effect on a particular category of person and this requirement cannot be justified as being reasonable in all the circumstances of the case.  This form of discrimination is commonly known as &ldquo;indirect discrimination&rdquo; although the term does not appear in the current Bill.</P>
    <P>The discriminatory grounds are gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race &mdash; covering race, colour, nationality or national or ethnic origin &mdash; and membership of the travelling community.  Victimisation of people because of their involvement in proceedings under this Bill is also treated as a discriminatory ground.  I cannot emphasise too strongly that the Bill deals with discrimination on these grounds alone and does not affect differences of treatment based on other grounds.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that, in some limited circumstances, it would be impractical or extremely difficult to meet the needs of persons with a disability. For this reason the concept of &ldquo;undue difficulty&rdquo;<Col N="1120" /> is introduced in section 4.  Members will note that, in general, the Bill exempts different treatment of a person with a disability where the needs of such a person could not be met without undue difficulty.  Whether undue difficulty arises will depend on a number of factors, including whether catering for a person with a disability would entail difficulty, disruption or cost which is excessive by reference to the benefits accruing to all concerned. As Deputies will be aware, I recently put forward an amendment to the Employment Equality Bill to provide for the concept of reasonable accommodation and I will consider making a similar amendment to this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with discrimination in particular areas.  Discrimination in the provision of personal property and services is prohibited under section 5.  It will be noted that discrimination in this area includes the refusal of access to a person with a disability who has the accompanying assistance of a wheelchair, guide-dog or person.  There are a number of exceptions for difference of treatment in certain circumstances in particular areas, such as insurance, sporting events and entertainment. Among these exclusions are one-time dispositions other than in the course of a business or trade &mdash; for example, a private sale of a car.  Reasonable differences of treatment in the area of insurance and finance based on actuarial or similar data are exempt.  Examples of this would be the different treatment of persons under 25 in relation to motor insurance and the different treatment of persons on age grounds in relation to life assurance. Differences of treatment of persons on the grounds of gender, age, disability, nationality or national origin are permissible in respect of sporting facilities and events.  Thus, for example, the Bill recognises and allows for different events such as women's or men's football teams, under-21 football teams or games for people with a disability. As these examples show, the various exceptions reflect what most people would regard as acceptable and necessary differences of treatment. Different treatment of a person with a disability is not regarded as discrimination where undue difficulty arises, or where the disability is such that it reasonably jeopardises that person's ability to comply with relevant conditions.</P>
    <P>Discrimination in land dispositions and provision of accommodation is also prohibited, subject again to a number of exclusions.  Among the exemptions are disposals by will or gift, small premises where the accommodation provider continues to live on the premises, accomodation intended for use by persons of one gender, refuges and nursing homes, and different treatment of persons with a disability where undue difficulty arises.</P>
    <P>Educational establishments may not discriminate against students in matters such as admission or access to courses.  A number of exemptions are provided for, the main one being to allow for single gender schools.</P>
    <P>Section 8 prohibits discrimination of firms of <Col N="1121" /> partners, etc., in relation to the admission of partners or members, the status of partners or members and expulsion or other sanctions.  It will be permissible to refuse admission as a partner or member to a person with a disability where undue difficulty arises.  Also exempted is the imposition of reasonable terms or conditions on persons whose age or disability restricts their capacity to function as a partner or member or necessitates special arrangements.  Deputies may wish to note that the section on partnerships has been included &mdash; in so far as gender and marital status is concerned &mdash; on foot of an EU Directive, the full title of which I will not recite, but which is commonly referred to as the Directive on Self-Employed Activity 86/613/EEC.  Similar provisions are to be found in anti-discrimination legislation in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>The approach taken in regard to discriminating clubs differs from that taken in other areas.  The unjustified exclusion of women from equal participation in golf clubs and similar sporting or recreational clubs was highlighted by the Second Commission on the Status of Women, which recommended legislative measures to deal with this.  I have no doubt that this is an issue on which many women, and indeed men, feel very strongly. While the number of discriminating clubs may be decreasing, unequal treatment continues to exist and I do not believe equality in this area will be achieved by education and persuasion alone.  The Bill does not prohibit discrimination by clubs against members or potential members.  Rather it seeks to discourage such discrimination by allowing a complainant to apply for a determination from the District Court that a registered club &mdash; one which can sell intoxicating liquor &mdash; is a discriminating club.  If the club is determined by the District Court to be a discriminating club, it would not be entitled to renew its certificate of registration, and would not be entitled to public funds or to the use of publicly owned recreational facilities until it had rectified the situation. However, I will provide a six months' lead-in time for this section, I hope clubs will put their houses in order voluntarily and that this section will not have to be used.</P>
    <P>A number of exemptions are provided in section 10 in relation to registered clubs.  Clubs are not regarded as discriminating merely because they cater for persons of a particular religion, age, nationality or ethnic origin.  It is also permissible for a club to provide separate, but equivalent, facilities for particular age groups or different sexes in certain circumstances.  Relevant and reasonably justifiable differences of treatment in relation to sporting facilities or events based on gender, age, disability, nationality or national origin are permissible.  Certain positive action measures designed to promote greater equality are also exempted.  In section 12, sexual harassment or harassment based on any of the discriminatory grounds is prohibited in the areas covered by the Bill.  A person in authority in an educational establishment, an organisation or <Col N="1122" /> club or a partnership, a person providing services or accommodation or disposing of personal property or land may not sexually harass or harass a student, member, customer etc.  Furthermore, a person who is responsible for the operation of an education establishment or a place at which goods, services or accommodation facilities are offered to the public may not allow a student, customer etc., to suffer sexual harassment or harassment there.  I intend to give further consideration to the provisions on sexual harassment to provide for consistency with the corresponding provisions in the Employment Equality Bill.</P>
    <P>Sexual harassment is defined as an unwelcome act of physical intimacy, an unwelcome request for sexual favours or an unwelcome act or conduct with sexual connotations.  Harassment is defined as an offensive, humiliating or intimidating act or conduct based on any of the discriminatory grounds.  Section 13 prohibits any form of advertising which indicates an intention to discriminate, to sexually harass or to harass. Deputies will note the comprehensive definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; which includes every form of advertisement, whether in a newspaper or any other publication, on television or radio or by display of a notice or other means.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned some of the specific exemptions which apply to particular areas. There are also some exemptions of general application in sections 15 and 17.  For example, actions which are required to be done by or under statute, court order or EU law are exempt, as are bona fide positive action measures.  A reasonable preferntial charge for persons together with their children, married couples, persons in a specific age group or persons with a disability is permissible. Treating a person who has a disability differently to prevent that person causing harm is acceptable, as is differential treatment in the exercise of clinical judgment.</P>
    <P>Section 16 contains some important safeguards. The safeguard in subsection (1) makes it clear that a service provider or similar person is not required to serve a customer if the service provider has reasonable grounds other than discriminatory grounds for the belief that provision of the service would create a substantial risk of criminal or disorderly conduct or behaviour or cause damage to property.  Subsection (2) also provides that action taken in good faith for the sole purpose of complying with the Licensing Acts is not discrimination. These safeguards are intended to meet the legitimate concerns of vintners and other traders, without interfering with the Bill's central thrust of outlawing discrimination.</P>
    <P>I regard sections 18 to 20 as a particularly important aspect of the Bill.  They make special provisions for the needs of persons with a disability in the area of transport accessibility and convenience in using public streets and pavements. They provide for regulations requiring that buses and trains, and bus and train stations, be readily accessible to persons with disabilities. In addition, road authorities must provide kerb <Col N="1123" /> ramps or similar features when constructing or altering public paths.  The Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities laid particular emphasis on the rights of persons with a disability to the same freedom that enables able-bodied people to get out and about.  The inclusion of these provisions recognises the importance of transport and ease of mobility in the lives of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the enforcement provisions under Part III.  Claims of discrimination or harassment may be referred to the Director of Equality Investigations, an independent official operating under the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  The Director of Equality Investigations, assisted by his or her staff, will have the power to investigate, mediate or make decisions on such claims.  This office will provide a simple, inexpensive and speedy means of redress for victims of discrimination.  I have already said the decision on whether a club is a discriminating club is a matter for the District Court and I would emphasise that the Director of Equality Investigations will have no function in the matter of discriminating clubs.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides that claims referred to the Director of Equality Investigations will, in general, be treated as if they were claims of discrimination under Part V of the Employment Equality Bill.  Part V of that Bill deals with enforcement, including the referral of claims to the Director of Equality Investigations, procedures to be followed in investigating claims, mediation, decisions of the director and enforcement of decisions.  It provides that the Director of Equality Investigations may award compensation or order that the respondent take a specified course of action.</P>
    <P>It should be noted, however, that unlike employment cases, the maximum amount of compensation that may be awarded in equal status cases will be £5,000, the limit for a civil case in contract in the District Court.  A further difference between the two Bills is that a claim of discrimination under this Bill must be preceded by an initial notification to the respondent within two months of the alleged act of discrimination. The Director of Equality Investigations may dismiss a complaint if the complainant does not have sufficient interest in the claim or the claim has been made in bad faith, or is frivolous, vexatious or trivial.  A decision of the Director of Equality Investigations may be appealed to the Circuit Court within 42 days.</P>
    <P>The Equality Authority will have power under section 22 to refer certain cases to the director. Such cases could involve discrimination against a group of persons or a situation where the person concerned is not in a position to bring a case.  The Authority may also refer cases involving prohibited advertising, procurement of discrimination or failure to provide kerb ramps or to comply with regulations on transport accessibility. <Col N="1124" /> It will also have the power to seek injunctions.</P>
    <P>Part IV provides for a restructured Equality Authority, with an extended remit covering both employment and non-employment areas.  The Equality Authority, currently known as the Employment Equality Agency but renamed under the Employment Equality Bill, will have a new composition to reflect its altered mandate.  It will have 12 members, including a chairperson, of which at least five will be women and atleast five men.  Of the ordinary members, two will be nominated by employer organisations and two by employee organisations.  The remainder of the ordinary members, who I will appoint, will be persons with knowledge or experience of matters relevant to the functions of the Authority.</P>
    <P>The general functions of the Authority, as outlined in section 35, include: working towards the elimination of discrimination; promotion of equality of opportunity in matters relating to this Bill or the Employment Equality Bill; and review, and proposals for amendment, of the Equal Status Bill, the Employment Equality Bill and the equal treatment aspects of the Pensions Act, 1990.  The Authority is also given specific functions under various provisions of both Bills.</P>
    <P>The Authority is given a number of instruments with which to pursue its functions.  It may undertake research and information activities and charge for these.  It may also conduct investigations. If, arising from an investigation, the Authority finds a person is discriminating or is otherwise in breach of either the Employment Equality Bill or the Equal Status Bill, it may serve a non-discrimination notice requiring the person to take remedial action.  The High Court or the Circuit Court may, on the motion of the Authority, grant an injunction for failure to comply with a non-discrimination notice.</P>
    <P>Another important feature of the Authority's remit is that it may give assistance in cases under both Bills where an important matter of principle is involved or where it would not be reasonable to expect the person concerned to present the case adequately without assistance.  It should be noted that assistance may be given by the Authority not only in relation to references to the Director of Equality Investigations, the Labour Court or the District Court, as the case may be, but in relation to any proceedings arising from such references. Also noteworthy is the Authority's power to prepare codes of practice aimed at the elimination of discrimination or the promotion of equality.  Following my approval, such codes are admissible as evidence in a court.</P>
    <P>Part V contains various general provisions.  I draw attention to section 55, which provides that parties to an investigation by the Director of Equality Investigations, witnesses before the Director or the Authority, or persons required to supply information to the director or Authority will have the same immunities and privileges as a witness before the High Court.  This section will allay concerns that a person involved in proceedings <Col N="1125" /> under this legislation might find themselves sued for defamation.  Section 57 is also important as it will establish an amalgamated redress mechanism for the Employment Equality Bill and this Bill.  It provides for the establishment of the office of Director of Equality Investigations under the aegis of the Department of Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Today's Bill is part of a wide-ranging programme of measures aimed at the promotion of greater equality and the full participation of all groups in economic, social and cultural life.  It is a fundamental element of my Department's programme, and together with the companion Employment Equality Bill will give Ireland a comprehensive anti-discrimination code.  It is a measure which has been a long time in gestation. This Bill breaks new ground and covers a variety of categories and range of areas.  Its preparation has necessarily been a complex and difficult task.</P>
    <P>The equal status legislation will have a profound impact on society.  I would hope not to see a multitude of cases under this legislation, but hope the existence of such legislation will inhibit would-be discriminators and reduce the incidence of discrimination.  While I recognise that legislation alone cannot change attitudes, I hope that in time discrimination against persons simply because of factors such as their race, sexual orientation, disability or gender would become socially, as well as legally, unacceptable.  The activities of the Equality Authority in its expanded role will contribute also to this outcome. The Equal Status Bill is a significant step towards a society of greater equality, mutual respect and tolerance.  I look forward to an interesting and constructive debate on this important legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the Minister's recent announcement that he will retire from the Dáil at the forthcoming election.  None of us has any guarantee of being returned for a further term.  That is in the gift of the electorate, which has demonstrated its volatility over the years.  However, the Minister would have every reason to assume that this volatility would not have affected him.  His decision arose from calm deliberation, from which he concluded that he had reached the age of retirement from the Dáil and his talents will be very usefully employed elsewhere.  Since entering this House I have found the Minister to be a gentleman in every sense of the word and most of his recent work has been on what many regard as the most basic rights of citizens.  Therefore, it is fitting that this Bill will probably be the last one he brings before the House.  I hope his life after politics is a fruitful and happy one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is to be welcomed and Fianna Fáil will not oppose it on Second Stage.  It has been introduced some weeks before it was intended, which is probably an indication that the life of this Dáil is rapidly coming to an end.  That speedy arrival means that I and other Deputies have not had <Col N="1126" /> time to examine its details but the Minister has suggested he will take that into consideration.  I have seen enough of the Bill to convince me that it covers a wide range of matters.  It is a further stage in a process of development that has been ongoing for many years and I am glad that Fianna Fáil has produced a great deal of the legislation dealing with this area.</P>
    <P>Shortcomings in law are recognised in time and with experience.  The present measure will also need amendment in the future as further types of discrimination emerge.  In the meantime, we will offer opinions on how the Bill could be improved and no doubt the Minister will accept them in the spirit in which they are offered.</P>
    <P>Since the disabled comprise probably the most vulnerable group in our society, I begin by referring to those sections of the Bill which deal with that area.  Section 5 (2) deals with the unreasonable refusal to admit disabled persons together with the accompanying assistance of a person, animal, wheelchair or other apparatus necessary to alleviate the effects of the disability.  This refusal is described as constituting discrimination. However, subsection (3) (h) describes one of the exemptions as refering to sporting events and entertainment.  I hope this subsection will not be used as justification by some promoters of sport or other entertainments for excluding people in wheelchairs, for example.  We should have long since reached the stage where places such as football grounds or theatres can be reasonably expected to have wheelchair facilities.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if the subsection means active participation in the sport or entertainment, the exemption would be reasonable.  The wording should clearly state this if it is the case.</P>
    <P>Section 18 deals with accessibility to public transport for disabled persons.  It gives the Minister power, with the agreement of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, to make regulations requiring that road or rail passenger vehicles that are to be put into use for the first time should be equipped so that disabled persons can use those vehicles.  There should be no undue delay by the Minister in having the appropriate regulations drawn up.  The obvious difficulty with buses is that it would be unreasonable to expect all of them to be so equipped, but there should be no such difficulty with trains.</P>
    <P>Section 19 is similar to the previous section except that it refers to bus and train stations. There is no excuse for any such place to be without the necessary facilities and this is all the more true in that these centres are usually in the care of bodies that receive massive public funding subventions.</P>
    <P>Section 20 places an obligation on road authorities to provide or ensure the provisions of sloped areas, ramps, dish kerbs, etc., at appropriate places such as pedestrian crossings or intersections used by pedestrains so that the mobility of disabled persons can be facilitated.  Any visitor from outer space who read these words would probably nod in approval of this assurance that <Col N="1127" /> disabled people are to enjoy the same safe and unhindered progress the rest of society takes for granted.  The snag is that there are countless crossings where an Olympic sprinter would risk life and limb trying to get to the other side.  That is the kind of equal status that no disabled person would regard as an advantage.  The Minister is not responsible for that state of affairs as it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  It highlights the fact that in this era of ever-increasing motor transport, the pedestrian has joined the list of endangered species and should be protected against discrimination.</P>
    <P>I spoke on the Labour Party's Private Member's Equal Status Bill on 25 March 1992 and referred to discrimination against disabled persons in the matter of access to buildings.  I mentioned the failure to provide these people with appropriate facilities that would enable them to use the services provided in public service buildings such as banks, building societies, hotels, etc.  I pointed out in that debate that a former Minister for the Environment, Deputy O'Hanlon, had brought in building regulations due to come into force in June 1992.  Those proposed regulations dealt comprehensively with the matters I referred to but only related to new buildings, and many existing buildings leave a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>I then told the House that a newspaper reporter in my home town had accompanied two people in wheelchairs on a tour of public buildings. The results in some cases were appalling. The worst offenders were some of the main banks where the person in the wheelchair could not reach the cash dispensing machines and did not have easy access to the building.  Even if he was carried in, he could not reach a counter to transact his business in private.  These buildings were owned by wealthy institutions.  Four years later, some banks have improved their facilities but others do not have wheelchair access and I doubt any of them have a portion of their counters low enough for people in wheelchairs to transact their business properly.  It is a disgrace that wealthy institutions treat the disabled in such a manner. It would be interesting if a detailed national survey of banks was carried out to establish the position generally.</P>
    <P>Regarding the disabled, I draw the Minister's attention to section 32 which gives the equality Authority the power to appoint advisory committees as it thinks fit to advise it on matters relating to its functions.  In view of the points I made earlier and the special vulnerability of such people, I urge the Minister to insert a requirement that a committee should be constituted to deal specifically with the disabled.  Its membership should include representatives of the various groups which deal with different disabilities, physical, psychiatric and others.</P>
    <P>Another matter has concerned me for some time, particularly in the last week, and section 5 (3) (e) makes it particularly relevant.  It states that <Col N="1128" /> insurance companies are exempt from what constitutes discrimination in respect of:</P>
    <P>differences in the treatment of persons in relation to annuities, pensions, insurance policies or any other matters related to the assessment of risk where the treatment&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) is effected by reference to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  actuarial or statistical data obtained from a source on which it is reasonable to rely, or</P>
    <P>(II)  other relevant underwriting or commercial factors,</P>
    <P>This point relates to discrimination by insurance companies against persons who have had genetic tests which indicate there is a predisposition to certain diseases.  The discrimination would amount to either excluding the person from insurance or loading the premium to such an extent that it would be unaffordable in many cases.  I describe it as an uninsurable underclass.</P>
    <P>Community rating similar to that demanded in health insurance is required.  It must be remembered that the fact that genetic tests indicate a certain predisposition does not mean a person will inevitably suffer a particular disease.  It would not surprise me if genetic science would also make it appear that a person is liable to become a criminal as a result of a gene which he or she has in common with an offending ancestor and that such a person should not, therefore, be trusted by potential employers.  George Orwell's most horrendous nightmares could become a reality unless we as legislators are determined to prevent it.</P>
    <P>On 19 February I said &mdash; and I questioned the Minister on the matter &mdash; that genetic engineering is much further advanced than the public realises.  Huge ethical questions will arise as a result of scientific advancements about which we know little.  It is even more eerie that such scientific research is ongoing in Britain apparently without the knowledge of the British Government, or at least it is not being discussed in the House of Commons.  We have a right to know what research is being carried out, particularly in relation to our genetic make-up.  As a result of leaked information from the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, it is possible that we will be able to reproduce humans who paid to have their bodies put into deep freeze.  It is only the method of freezing which is now critical, according to geneticist, Dr. Patrick Dixon.</P>
    <P>The Edinburgh scientists produced what is apparently an exact copy of an adult sheep by taking chromosomal material from the nucleus of one cell and placing it in an unfertilised egg from which the original nuclear chromosomes were removed.  In effect, this means that scientific research in this area is at such an advanced stage that it is time for a major discussion on the subject in terms of the current position and where we want to go.</P>
    <P>On 19 February the Minister stated that the <Col N="1129" /> current Bill deals effectively with the problem of discrimination in a number of groups.  He said that what has already happened in Britain and the United States would be outlawed in Ireland. However, the subsection I mentioned appears to contradict that assertion.  What is described as &ldquo;actuarial or statistical data obtained from a source on which it is reasonable to rely&rdquo; has been commonly used for many years by insurance companies in determining what customers they will insure or what loading they will apply to their premia.  The information is complied from such apparently offhand questions as at what age one's parents died and from what they died.  The development of modern tests will render this type of questioning unnecessary and, if last week's revelations in Britain are anything to go by, these questions will be replaced by mandatory disclosure of the results of any genetic tests which have been carried out.  The next obvious step is a requirement for tests to be carried out in all cases.</P>
    <P>The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> quoted a spokesperson for the Irish Insurance Federation as saying that while the insurance industry has no plans at present to follow its UK counterparts, it could not rule out the possibility that companies in the future would seek details of any genetic tests subscribers had undergone.  The same report stated that there are already fears in the UK, following last week's ruling by the British Association of Insurers, that some subscribers who are currently healthy could face major premium increases or even a refusal of cover based on the results of such tests.  These are what I describe as the horrendous implications of what is happening and the Bill does not include anything sufficiently strong to cover them.</P>
    <P>As a member of the medical profession, I point out to the insurance industry that genetic testing should not be regarded as a method of excluding what they would regard as bad risks but as something which would persuade the recipients of tests of the wisdom of leading a more healthy lifestyle. What will be the attitude of British insurers who operate in Ireland?  Will they apply the same sanctions here as in Britain?  The Minister would be well advised not to rely on the wording on which he appears to rely to deal with this matter. Unless the Minister indicates that he does not intend to do so, I shall seek legal advice on the type of amendment necessary to insert a specific prohibition on the use of such genetic tests for the reasons I outlined.  I have no difficulty with a company requiring a potential subscriber to undergo tests to determine his or her current state of health.  However, the idea of obliging a subscriber to disclose information about what may or may not happen in the future is most objectionable.  The Bill should leave no doubt that such practices will not be tolerated in Ireland.  In New York, California and 11 other US states there is a prohibition on the Statute Book. They do not rely on wording which could be regarded as vague or imprecise.  The argument against prohibition is influenced by a desire <Col N="1130" /> among insurers to push their massive profits even higher.  They have sufficient methods of maintaining their profits at a reasonable level without resorting to this type of callous discrimination.</P>
    <P>A Government source was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying the Bill switches the onus to the insurance provider who has to justify discrimination with facts and figures.  It may be possible to justify it with facts but not by quoting figures for the reasons I have given.  It is well known that one can prove almost anything one wishes by a selective use of statistics.  About 15 or 16 years ago some statistician revealed that, from an insurance point of view, women drivers were a much safer bet than men.  The result was cheaper premiums for the ladies.  Hibernian Insurance has informed us that, having looked at its statistics again, it has decided that the men are not so bad after all.  Consequently, it will no longer charge men more.  I trust this means its male customers will be notified of a drop in their premiums or could it be that women will have theirs increased? As the saying goes, &ldquo;watch this space&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was mooted last year most of the publicity concentrated on how it would deal with the refusal by many hotels and publicans to serve members of the travelling community.  It was assumed by some that a proprietor would not be allowed to refuse admission without having the wisdom of a Supreme Court judge at his or her fingertips.  Bearing in mind that the Bill had not been published the alarm signals were almost horrific.  A spokesperson for the Small Firms Association said that it would sound the deathknell for many small businesses.  Happily, it appears the Bill has dealt with this matter satisfactorily as it has been welcomed by the Irish Traveller Movement and other concerned groups.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that cannot be solved by legislation which cannot be as precise as one would wish.  A judgment as to whether a person was deliberately engaged in discrimination would involve trying to read that person's mind at the time.  The Bill, therefore, can only include words such as &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; or &ldquo;in good faith&rdquo;.  In a perfect society legislation would not be necessary. We can only hope that, just as smoking in public places is now generally frowned upon, unreasonable treatment of any minority group will eventually be a matter for automatic disapproval by any observers who happen to be present.</P>
    <P>Ever since the days of the caveman up to comparatively recent times the greatest measure of discrimination was dealt to women.  In some parts of the world this has not changed in the slightest. Even in what we regard as the western world it is hard to believe that it was only in the recent past that the Suffragettes won for women something as basic as the right to vote.  Down through the centuries too many men regarded their womenfolk as being intellectually inferior and their sole role in society was confined to rearing children, feeding and caring for their husbands and a variety of menial tasks, usually in the domestic area.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, as late as the 1940s and 1950s, only <Col N="1131" /> the privileged few young women had the benefit of the kind of education we have today.  Even for those who had the means to pursue a secondary education, it was widely assumed that young ladies were not endowed with the standard of intelligence that would absorb a subject such as honours mathematics or science but there was a revolution of which anyone with a drop of Fianna Fáil blood can feel justifiably proud.  The floodgates of education were thrown open and every child was given the right to a secondary education regardless of means.  It was soon demonstrated that there existed in the inner cities and rural Ireland a wealth of talent in boys and girls alike of which any nation would be proud.</P>
    <P>The importance of this example of Fianna Fáil vision was eloquently stressed by none other than the Taoiseach as recently as 19 January in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  His words are worth repeating:</P>
    <P>One of the most important decisions taken this century in Ireland was the introduction of free second level education in the 1960s.  That decision opened up higher education and job opportunities to thousands of people who are now the most productive members of the present day Irish workforce.  Those of them who have emigrated have won a well positioned worldwide audience for Ireland that we would not have had without them.  None of this would have happened but for the original decision to extend second level education back in the 1960s.  This shows how important it is to think in a long-term sense.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was right in more than one sense. That decision went a long way towards ending the type of discrimination which deprived a huge section of our citizens of their rightful place in the process of education.  It also encouraged women to compete on a level playing pitch with men.  We have only to look around us today to see how well they have succeeded in every profession that we would care to mention, including politics.</P>
    <P>In spite of this there are still pockets of male chauvinism.  This is reflected in the parts of the Bill that deal with gender equality.  I am confident that those pockets of resistance will soon surrender and hope that the Bill will hasten that day. When total liberation is achieved I hope women will not object if some men feel the urge to describe them as the fair sex and occasionally behave towards them with a little old fashioned chivalry.  I hope well placed courtesy will always have a place in society, not alone between men and women but also between men.</P>
    <P>I cannot help commenting on a matter which has often puzzled me.  Article 12 of the Constitution includes the words, &ldquo;every citizen who has reached his 35th year of age is eligible for election to the office of President&rdquo;.  Every subsequent reference to the President makes it clear that Éamon de Valera and his legal draftsmen never thought for one moment that this high office might one <Col N="1132" /> day be offered to a woman.  I am glad no one had the temerity to mount a constitutional challenge to the incumbency of the present distinguished holder of the office but on the occasion of the next referendum we should avail of the opportunity to finally acknowledge that a women is entitled to be a citizen or even President.</P>
    <P>My party has long since abandoned chauvinism but I was surprised to find that as recently as 1990 the Labour Party still insisted on holding on to some of the remnants of that discarded philosophy. In its Private Members'.  Equal Status Bill of that year the section dealing with discrimination in education repeatedly described students as being of the male gender.  Those offending words are not in this Bill.  What happened in the interim?  The Labour Party has enjoyed the privilege of serving a two year apprenticeship under the guidance of Fianna Fáil in Government and it would have picked up the occasional spark of wisdom.</P>
    <P>Sections 9, 10 and 11 deal with registered clubs which may or may not be quilty of discrimination against a member or applicant for membership. Section 11 deals with sanctions that may be imposed if a club is found to be discriminating. There are three possible sanctions, including no grant or loan of public funds shall be made to the club, it shall not be provided with the use of publicly owned facilities intended for recreation and a certificate of registration permitting the sale of intoxicating drink will not be granted or renewed. What would be the position if the offending club was the recipient of substantial grants or loans from public funds?  Should there not be a determination to recover those funds, especially if it persists in offending?</P>
    <P>The enforcement of the law enshrined in this Bill is all important.  The role of the Director of Investigations and his or her staff is vital.  I hope every effort will be made to ensure their work is facilitated in every way, including appropriate staffing and financial support.  The wording of section 21 (2) (a) is one example of what might be described as unhelpful.  The subsection states that no investigation of a claim by the director shall be made unless the complainant has, within two months after the prohibited conduct is alleged to have occurred, notified the respondent in writing of the nature of the allegation.  I have been reminded that especially in the case of any large licensed premises or entertainment complex, particularly in the large cities, the proprietor or staff acting for the proprietor could have had occasion to refuse admission or to eject scores, if not hundreds, of persons from the premises in a period of two months or in a week.  I am told such proprietors might find it difficult to recall, with any degree of accuracy, any incidents notified to them two months after they allegedly occurred. The Minister might reconsider this section to see if it may be more feasible to reduce the two months to a more reasonable period.  Otherwise the director or investigating staff might find their job more difficult than it should be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> This Bill is welcome.  I congratulate the Minister and his staff for their work on it.  It is much easier for me in Opposition to pick flaws in a Bill than it is to draft one.  However, I hope the Minister will agree that it should not be too difficult to address most of the reservations I made.  On further reflection and study of the Bill I may table amendments at a later Stage incorporating the proposals recently posted to us by the National Women's Council of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>On this historic day I pay tribute to the work of the Minister.  We wondered if he would retire at the next election.  I am surprised age is one of the reasons he gave for his decision. Undoubtedly he has been a hard working and assiduous Minister and has put a great deal of work into his portfolio in the past number of years in bringing difficult legislation through the House.  I have always found him to be the most courteous and gentlemanly of men.  The age of chivalry should not be dead.  Courtesy between women and men, women and women and men and men is extremely important.  In this House I have always found him, as I have found most of my male and female colleagues, to be unfailingly courteous.</P>
      <P>On the divorce legislation and referendum, although we disagreed on the method employed by the Minister our objective was the same as his. He sought to get consensus on the issue and to avoid conflict.  That was one of the reasons people decided on balance that divorce should be allowed in this jurisdiction.  It is ironic that legislation is coming to be used only now in practical terms.  People whose marriages have irretrievably broken down and who wish to form new relationships and regularise ones in which they are in can now avail of it.  In that context I pay tribute to the work of the Minister.  I have not always agreed with the method or detail of what he has sought to achieve, but overall we have often found ourselves on the same side, even if our approach was slightly different.  I hope he accepts that what we are all trying to do is to ensure we have the best legislation possible.  In debating this and other legislation I try to be as constructive as possible.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister the very best in his retirement. I do not believe he will be by the fireside wearing his slippers.  I am sure he will be very active in whatever he chooses to do.  I wish him and his family every success and happiness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fitting this is perhaps the last legislation with which he will deal.  This is a landmark Bill. It is regrettable there is a need for it, but undoubtedly there is in our society.  It was interesting to hear the Minister refer to Fr. McGréil's recent book <i>Prejudice in Ireland Revisited</i>.  I referred to it a few months ago during Question Time in respect of questions taken by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and there was some discussion on its findings.  It was very disturbing to discover there is a growing level of prejudice and intolerance in Ireland, <Col N="1134" /> particularly against the travelling people.  Many people were surprised at that and might consider there is no real need for this legislation, that it is required only to ratify or lift the reservation on the UN Convention on the elimination of forms of discrimination against women and so on and that it is a technical requirement to enable us to comply with our international obligations.  That is not the reality.  It is that in our small society there is intolerance and discrimination.  We want that eliminated.  The only form of intolerance I want to see in our society is intolerance of intolerance so that it might be viewed in a positive rather than in the most negative sense in which it must be seen today.</P>
    <P>The Bill is commendable in what it sets out to achieve and it appears to be good in theory, but will it have the desired effect in practice? We need to debate it thoroughly on Committee Stage.  It is important to ensure that, when enacted, it will work.  There is no point in passing flawed legislation. The Bill has many exceptions and qualifications and, like the Employment Equality Bill, it lacks the simplicity and clarity necessary for the average person to understand it.  It is difficult to get to the heart of the matter or to understand certain provisions of the Bill.  Perhaps such confusion arises from the Government's desire to have this Bill passed before the general election. I know it is the Minister's earnest wish, with which I sympathise, to have it on the Statute Book but in this rush perhaps we are allowing some elements to fall between the cracks.  It would appear that some of their implications have not been given sufficient thought.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McDaid that more time would have been useful to allow us examine the provisions of the Bill in greater depth.  I am aware that various groups such as the National Women's Council, those involved in the equality campaign and others have called for more time to examine its provisions in detail.  While acknowledging that the Minister adopted a generous attitude on Committee Stage of the Employment Equality Bill I hope he will be as generous in his response to this one.</P>
    <P>While voicing some constructive criticism of its provisions I shall be supporting the Bill and will not oppose it on Second Stage.  My only desire is to improve its provisions to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the difficulty and confusion people may experience in perusing the provisions of this Bill, in particular section 16(1) to which I shall refer in a different context.  It is interesting to note there that the words &ldquo;for greater certainty&rdquo; are followed by a 14-line sentence. I taught English for a brief period some time ago and if a pupil had presented a paragraph of 14 lines I would have wondered if he had been reading James Joyce and would write something akin to <i>Finnegan's Wake</i>.  In the interests of clarity the draftsman should re-examine the Bill and clarify its provisions, particularly for lay people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> Acknowledging that great difficulty will always be experienced in drafting legislation in this area I question whether, in the welter of theoretical detail contained in this Bill, the opportunity to take greater practical steps has been overlooked. One such step relates to local authorities' development plans, in the preparation of which they are statutorily obliged to take certain matters into account.  If it were mandatory for them to have regard to people with physical disabilities it would be a massive step in placing this issue centre stage in every day life.  It would mean also that anybody seeking permission to construct or refurbish a place or building used by the public would have to demonstrate they had provided for the needs of those with physical disabilities. While not critical of what has been done already in this area, we need to change our perception that, in providing access for people with physical disabilities, we are being somewhat progressive; rather it should be regarded as part and parcel of every day life.  Just as we gender-proof other issues we should disability-proof and, in this respect, the onus should be placed on local authorities to be more active.  While they have come a long way, if we really want to integrate people with a disability in society we must give that aspect due attention.</P>
    <P>To cite a personal example, my own father is confined to a wheelchair.  I know that manoeuvring him in and out of places is a nightmare.  I shall refer to footpaths later but my heart goes out to anybody with a disability, particularly if in a wheelchair, because it is extremely difficult to get around this city.  Hopefully some of the provisions of this Bill Will make life easier for such people.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill which makes me somewhat uneasy is the manner in which so many different groups and problems are thrown together in an attempt to apply the same solution to all.  Ironically, in a Bill which claims to promote equality, it has the unintended side effect of branding women, people with disabilities, travellers and others as being in some way different from the remainder of society.  They are an intrinsic part of our society, which is why we do not want to discriminate against them.  In that respect we need to give particular attention to the words used.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not be at all surprised to learn that I have a problem with the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo;, a subject to which I referred in some depth on the Employment Equality Bill.  In our Committee Stage discussions of the Bill I said a medical definition should not be used for people who are not ill.  I will be tabling an amendment on this point.  Another curious aspect of the definition is that it excludes something contained in the Employment Equality Bill, the reference to disability which previously existed, that might exist in the future or which is imputed to a person. Perhaps that could be tidied up in this Bill. In the case of the Employment Equality Bill the Minister reassured Members that the Disability <Col N="1136" /> Federation of Ireland was happy with his proposals.</P>
    <P>While I am sure the Minister received a copy, I should like to refer to a press release dated 13 February 1997 from the disability rights officer of the Union of Students in Ireland which stated:</P>
    <P>The Union of Students in Ireland (USI) today expressed its outrage at the definition of disability outlined in the Equal Status Bill launched last Saturday.  In December 1996 we saw the launch of the &ldquo;Strategy for Equality&rdquo; report carried out by the Commission for People with Disabilities.  This report announced a number of progressive measures for people with disabilities in Ireland. However, USI feels that the Minister has reversed the positive outlook for people with disabilities by the language he has used to define &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in the Bill.  Words such as &ldquo;malfunction&rdquo;, &ldquo;malformation&rdquo; and &ldquo;disturbed&rdquo; conjure up a medieval image of people with disabilities.  USI calls for these definitions to be deleted and for a proper consultative process to take place in order to define &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in a modern light.</P>
    <P>I am not critical of the Minister <i>vis-á-vis</i> consultation because he did consult widely throughout his preparation of this Bill but some groups concerned with disabilities are very concerned about these definitions and he should listen to what they have to say.</P>
    <P>That press release of the Union of Students in Ireland continued:</P>
    <P>I am insulted and appalled at the definitions used in this Bill.  People with disabilities have fought long enough to be treated as equal citizens. Defining disabilities in the manner in which the Minister has puts the rights of people with disabilities back generations.</P>
    <P>While I and the Minister know that is not the intention, if that is the message received by people with disability <i>vis-á-vis</i> this Bill, then it is not achieving its objectives and the Minister must have due regard to their criticisms.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Minister has remained adamant on this point because he has changed some other definitions and phrases used in both Bills, for example, the definition of &ldquo;family status&rdquo;.  While &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; is defined in the Employment Equality Bill, no such definition is contained in this one.</P>
    <P>Section 4 carries the side heading &ldquo;Undue difficulty&rdquo;, a defence in relation to charges of discrimination. This section will have to be thoroughly scrutinised to ensure its provisions are not misused in an effort to by-pass others.  The following is another extract from the press release I referred to:</P>
    <P>I am also alarmed at the vagueness of the clauses concerning educational rights for students with disabilities.  I feel that the Minister should set clear guidelines for what is meant by &ldquo;undue difficulty&rdquo;.  Without such <Col N="1137" /> guidelines this clause could be used as an excuse not to provide facilities for students with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister could take that on board for Committee Stage.  That excuse might be used not just for students but for all people with disabilities. However, I welcome the reference to the concept of reasonable accommodation, which was also mentioned in the Employment Equality Bill, and the Minister's commitment to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 5 contains a general prohibition against discrimination but it is followed by a long list of exceptions, some of which are seriously flawed and others are bewildering.  Section 5(3)(d) provides an exception for &ldquo;services of an aesthetic nature which require physical contact between the service provider and the recipient&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to insurance and pensions are another example of how lofty principles followed by loosely drafted exceptions are inadequate. Insurance companies and pension funds will not be allowed to discriminate but they will be allowed to do something which is &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; having regard to data on which it is &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; to rely, so where does that leave us?  People who have what insurance companies call a &ldquo;HIV-risk lifestyle&rdquo; justifiably complain about the difficulties they face in a world where one cannot borrow money without taking out life insurance but the experience in other countries shows the difficulties in regulating the insurance industry in this way.  Attempting to prevent insurance companies asking questions designed to exclude people who are HIV positive has resulted in them refusing to offer any cover for HIV related illnesses or deaths.  That is not necessarily discriminatory but neither is it a good thing.  To give another example, will the concept of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; reliance on &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; data make it permissible for pension funds to charge a woman more money to receive the same rate of pension as a man on the grounds that statistics suggest that women have a longer life expectancy? The treatment of insurance companies and pension funds must be given serious reconsideration if this is to prove to be effective legislation rather than a flawed pre-election Bill.  I take on board the comments made by Deputy McDaid on his area of expertise.</P>
    <P>Under section 5(3)(f) it could be permissible to treat men and women differently in the provision of medical goods or services.  This is either a statement of the blindingly obvious, that men and women have different medical problems, or it should not be in the Bill.  When it comes to allocating medical resources the criterion should be need, not gender.</P>
    <P>Another element of the Bill which requires a rethink is the provision dealing with &ldquo;dramatic performances and other entertainment&rdquo;.  Section 5(3)(k) envisages that a person who puts on a play may have to argue before the courts that a scene was reasonably required for reasons of authenticity, aesthetics, tradition or custom.  It is <Col N="1138" /> ludicrous for the House to pass legislation which gives the courts a role in assessing the literary merits of a play; that should be left to the drama critics.  Section 6 deals with land and accommodation but it has all the appearances of a rush job and it must be seriously revised if it is to make any sense.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with clubs and sections 10 to 12 deal with discriminating clubs.  The principles behind these provisions are understandable to those of us who have been involved in women's organisations.  When I was in the Seanad I was a member of the committee on women's rights.  We wrote to every golf club asking their position on allowing women to become full members and a number of them did not even have the courtesy to send a reply.  Fortunately golf clubs would not behave like that nowadays but we still have some way to go.  Many women, golfers in particular, were outraged at the way they were treated as second-class citizens.  The excuse was always that women got preferential treatment because they paid a lower subscription, but if a woman wanted to pay the full amount why could she not become a full member?  It was a contentious area.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately there are doubts about whether sections 10 to 12 as drafted are constitutional, having regard to the right to freedom of association. When one thinks of discriminating clubs one tends to think of those for men only, but what about women only clubs or gay clubs?  There is a difficulty about the right to associate with whomever one wants on private property and we need to make provision for such clubs if non-discriminatory conditions are to prevail.  Reservations have been expressed about the anomalies which may arise within this section so we must scrutinise it carefully.  The principles we are trying to establish are ones we must all accept.</P>
    <P>Section 12 attempts to address the issue of sexual harassment but, unfortunately, it is unsuccessful. My first criticism of the section relates to its structure.  Section 12(1) provides that a person shall not harass or sexually harass another person who falls into one of the categories set out in paragraphs (a) to (e), the implication being that it is all right to harass or sexually harass a person who does not fall into one of these categories.  We must be careful how we draft these provisions. Also, it is inappropriate to use the concept of the reasonable person in the definition of sexual harassment and harassment.  It is the injured party who should be the primary judge of what is offensive, although it might be acceptable to include a limit whereby something will not be treated as sexual harassment if no reasonable person could regard it as such.  That approach would put the opinion of the injured party at the forefront while maintaining some element of an objective test.</P>
    <P>A warning about this section was first given at the recent conference on sexual harassment in the workplace.  The Employment Equality Bill dealt with that issue but we cannot isolate it because sexual harassment is the same wherever it occurs. It is all about power and has nothing to do with <Col N="1139" /> sexual attraction, so it is relevant to refer to what was said at the conference.  The head of the Employment Equality Agency, which is to become the new Equality Authority, sounded the warning about our approach to dealing with sexual harassment, particularly in the workplace.  She said the &ldquo;reasonable person&rdquo; test could be appropriate and straightforward in other areas of law which apply to men and women equally but it was not appropriate for defining sexual harassment. This person is at the coalface on these issues and we must listen to what she and her organisation are saying.  We also cannot forget &ldquo;same sex&rdquo; harassment.</P>
    <P>We must re-examine the emphasis we are putting on sexual harassment.  I ask the Minister to consider it for Committee Stage.  I will put down an amendment and perhaps we could deal with the matter in a more complete way.  I am disquieted at the way it is being approached in this crucial legislation.  Any of us who have been involved in women's issues over the years realise the extent of the sexual harassment problem.  The power of the equality Authority to deal with these issues will be evident, but the approach taken must be the one that the Authority wishes to see in practice.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the procurement of discrimination or sexual harassment.  Such procurement will be a criminal offence under the Employment Equality Bill, but under this Bill it is merely prohibited conduct which can be the subject of a complaint to the director of equality investigations.  Will the Minister explain this anomaly?</P>
    <P>Section 16 was originally the most contentious part of the Bill.  Even before it was published this aspect was discussed to such an extent that I heard the Bill referred to as the Vintners <i>versus</i> Travellers Bill and other such colloquialisms.  This was unfortunate because it took away from what should have been the emphasis on discrimination, equality and protection.  Nevertheless, I congratulate the Minister for arriving at a reasonable compromise.  He consulted widely and went to great lengths to resolve the issue, although having done this, he may have rushed other sections.  If we are assured that on the one hand retailers and vintners can operate their premises in a way that is fitting while on the other hand we do not allow discrimination against people because of what they are rather than their actions then I will be happy.</P>
    <P>However, exemptions and exceptions which feature in the Bill have also intruded in this section.  Subsection (1) appears to allow discrimination on the grounds that failure to discriminate would produce a substantial risk of criminal or disorderly conduct.  In addition, subsection (2) provides that action taken in good faith by the holder of a drinks licence for the sole purpose of ensuring compliance with the licensing laws will not constitute discrimination.  This could allow a refusal of service on the grounds that drunkenness <Col N="1140" /> on a licensed premises under the Licensing Acts could not be permitted, not withstanding the fact that drunkenness is a condition that afflicts many patrons at the end of their visit.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that sections 18 and 19 are particularly important, especially with regard to people with disability.  They provide that the Minister may make regulations with regard to new passenger vehicles, but and rail stations.  Unfortunately, in their current wording the sections represent nothing more than a pious aspiration.  It has been suggested that there should be a mandatory obligation on the Minister to have these regulations in effect by a specified date.  Have the sections become a victim of the rush to have the Bill on the Statute Book before the general election?</P>
    <P>When debating the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in the Employment Equality Bill, many expressed the view that we should be more proactive in ensuring that the needs of people with disability are catered for.  The Minister should at least indicate when such regulations could come into effect.  The regulations will not cover taxi, hackney or limousine use.  Access for people with disabilities should be part of everyday life.  This aspect must be looked at more carefully.</P>
    <P>Section 20 places an obligation on the roads authorities to provide ramps, etc., on new or altered roads, which is welcome.  However, this does not go far enough to ensure that they meet the needs of people with disability when drawing up their development plans.  A wheelchair user who has been unable to gain access to a building will find little consolation in the fact that there was a dished kerb to facilitate the approach.  We must be firm in ensuring that due provision is made for those with disability, and not only for those with mobility disabilities.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 deal with enforcement. There does not appear to be a time limit in referring matters to the director, although there is a time limit within which the victim must notify the respondent of his her intention to do so.  There is no provision for an extension of this.  In many cases, the victim may be unaware of the existence of the director or of the remedies under the Bill. There should be discretion for the director to extend the limit in special circumstances.</P>
    <P>The role of the equality Authority is set out in sections 23 to 49.  At present, it is known as the Employment Equality Agency to which the National Women's Council is a nominating body. Not only has the council lost its rights under the new provision but there is no requirement on the Minister to appoint anybody with a specific knowledge of gender equality issues although he may appoint somebody who has a knowledge of equality issues in general.  This is a serious matter, given that the equality Authority has such an important role under the Employment Equality Bill.  It is also important if women are thought of as a minority group that must be catered for. Women constitute over half of our society and we <Col N="1141" /> must acknowledge the role of the National Women's Council.</P>
    <P>The Bill has many worthy aims but, unfortunately, it betrays too many signs of hasty and sloppy thinking.  This may reflect part of the anxiety to get it on the Statute Book.  I ask the Minister to take on board my criticisms, which have been made in a positive spirit in an effort to improve the Bill and to have some elements on which people have expressed concern addressed. I thank him for bringing the Bill before the House and I acknowledge that a huge amount of work has been put into it by his staff.  I look forward to teasing out the issues and introducing amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I was taken aback to learn that the Minister is to retire from parliamentary politics.  Nobody in this country or abroad who has dealt with his ministry would dispute that through his quiet tenacity he has put into law what we have all aspired to.  He will be remembered for the legislation which he has enacted and is putting through.  It will long outlast us.  When an architect was asked how he would describe his monument to posterity he replied: &ldquo;Look around you&rdquo;.  The improvements the Minister has made to Irish society will stand as a monument and testament to his ability.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill form an equality package aimed at bringing us into line with best international practice and allow us to ratify the relevant UN treaties. We should not forget we do not operate in isolation.  These Bills are intended to provide individual citizens with an anti-discrimination tool box.  The tools provided in both Bills must be accessible to all and user friendly.</P>
      <P>The Equal Status Bill deals with non-employment discrimination on nine grounds ranging from disability, sexual orientation, race and family status.  It is extremely complex legislation and many of its provisions need to be teased out in committee.  The Minister is adept on Committee Stage on any Bill.  He knows what he wants and is able to put forward his arguments but equally capable of listening to reasoned arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to outline briefly some areas where the Bill could be strengthened.  In section 2 the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; is much too limiting and does not accurately reflect either the causes or the nature of disability.  Defining a problem is only the first step towards addressing it.  In this regard I urge the Minister to consider incorporating the definition cited in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  It is comprehensive and includes virtually every foreseeable circumstance in which people may find themselves in relation to disability.  I am sure its <Col N="1142" /> insertion would not create a problem.  However, I have one slight problem with the definition, that is that the commission recommends that people who are substance abusers should also be determined. It restricts substance abusers to those enrolled in rehabilitation programmes.  I assume that refers to abuse of prescribed drugs.  I do not believe they should be included because we would then have to include those addicted to nicotine. That would be going too far.</P>
    <P>Section 4 gives rise to particular difficulties.  It stipulates that undue difficulty may be cited regarding the nature of the arrangements needed to properly accommodate a person; the number of persons who would benefit or be disadvantaged; the cost of such arrangements and the disruption caused by such special arrangements.  It does not define any of these conditions.  In effect undue difficulty as outlined in the Bill provides employers, service providers and others with an expandable loophole.  The &ldquo;undue difficulty&rdquo; clause applies particularly to people with a disability, those who are likely to require the special arrangements cited in the section.</P>
    <P>There are two ways in which the section could be strengthened.  A clause could be inserted stipulating that the Minister shall make regulations defining the extent of costs, disruption or other conditions which constitute undue difficulty. Alternatively &mdash;&mdash; I believe this would be the best solution &mdash;&mdash; the onus could simply be reversed providing that those genuinely unable to comply with the provisions of the Bill could apply to the authority for a certificate of exemption on the basis of cost, permanent disruption or other undue difficulty.  This would ensure that general compliance is required and that any request for exemption would be subjected to close scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Section 4 relates primarily to physical access. The track record of private and public bodies here is appalling.  Last year Democratic Left conducted a survey in Limerick which highlighted the extent of the problem.  Some 75 per cent of public buildings there were inaccessible to people with disabilities.  The buildings surveyed included public housing, services, major shops, financial institutions, hotels and a small number of churches and pubs.  Some 72 per cent of multi-story buildings did not have a lift while only 20 per cent of the buildings surveyed had wheelchair accessible toilets.  If we put ourselves in the position of someone who needs these infrastructural changes to gain access to these services it would be virtually impossible to live a functioning life.  These figures are replicated throughout the country and form an insurmountable barrier not only for people with disabilities but for the elderly and women with small children.  We are not talking about a small group of people with disabilities but rather an enormous group who experience the same difficulties and we need to address them.</P>
    <P>If section 4 is retained in its present form the access figures will not be very different in ten years' time.  &ldquo;Undue difficulty&rdquo; runs like a thread throughout the Bill, for example, it is cited in <Col N="1143" /> Section 7(3)(b) which relates to the educational establishments, with obvious consequences for integrated schooling.  I urge the Minister to consult with the various interest groups involved.  Of all the Ministers he tends to consult with a broad range of groups who have an interest in the legislation with which he is dealing.  If he does not alter the section &mdash;&mdash; described to me as a Houdini's charter &mdash;&mdash; it will allow those who wish to do so to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  That is not what this legislation is about.</P>
    <P>Section 5(3)(e) deals with insurance provision, a matter discussed at length by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  This section could be strengthened by providing that when differential treatment is accorded on the basis of actuarial or statistical data the individual concerned should be given access to that information.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 19 deal with transport for people with disabilities.  Despite the pious aspirations expressed in recent years, public transport remains largely inaccessible to many people with disabilities.  Where the transport is accessible the infrastructure surrounding it is not, for example, railway stations and DART.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with sexual and other harassment. We should not leave this section so open that the victim chooses the crime.  For that reason I have a difficulty with some of the arguments put forward.  The Union of Students of Ireland suggested the following: sexual harassment is unwanted conduct of a sexual nature or other conduct based on sex, affecting the dignity of men and women.  This seems so commonsense that any reasonable person would take that view.  I apologise to my two colleagues as I did not mean to take so much time.</P>

      <P>Coming from the same constituency I am sure you will allow him some extra time.  I join in the good wishes to the Minister, Deputy Taylor, on his retirement.  If any Minister could say he had put his stamp on Irish society, this Minister has done so in his term of office.  A classic example is the Equal Status Bill which he originally spearheaded in 1993.  Following a long consultative process with various groups he has produced this Bill which contains many important provisions.  Much time was devoted to drafting section 16 to ensure it took account of the genuine concerns of the Licensed Vintners' Association and other traders.  The Minister is to be applauded for listening to these concerns and providing for them in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could speak at length about the position of disabled people.  It is only in recent years that we have focused properly on their rights.  In my constituency the Access group focuses attention on the needs of disabled people and seeks to <Col N="1144" /> ensure that footpaths etc., meet their requirements. Local authorities, health boards and Departments should be encouraged to employ more disabled people.  Some of these bodies have already exceeded the 3 per cent requirement but many of them have not done enough in this respect.  People with disabilities want the right to compete fairly for jobs but many of them are discouraged from submitting applications because of the fear of rejection.  Disabled people with the necessary qualifications should be treated equally when applying for jobs.</P>
    <P>The Bill outlaws advertising which may give rise to discrimination.  The use by companies of box numbers is a type of discrimination in that applicants do not know the name of the company and do not receive a response to their application. People put much effort into the preparation of their curriculum vitae and companies should show them the courtesy of revealing their identity and responding to their applications.  It is expensive for larger companies which receive many applications to reply to all applicants and many of them place advertisements in the newspapers to inform them that the position has been filled and to thank them for their applications.  If companies cannot reply to all applicants then they should consider a similar approach.</P>
    <P>When talking about equality one cannot ignore the travelling community.  Limerick County Council has successfully integrated many travelling families with local communities who have shown great tolerance.  I welcome the recent legislation on the control of horses as it will deal with the minority of travellers who bring disrespect to their community by allowing their horses to wander freely in the estates in which they have been housed.  I look forward to the implementation of the bylaws to deal with this problem. Travellers have certain cultural rights but members of the settled communities also have rights.  The minority of travellers who show scant regard for the rights of the settled community in their estates tar the entire travelling community with the same brush.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Taylor.  I shared an office with him for many years before his appointment as Minister and I probably know him better than any other Member.  I worked with him on the same issues and he is a genuine, sincere and efficient Minister.  His decision not to stand for re-election is a blow not only to the Labour Party but to the Dáil and the country as a whole.  Even though he is not standing for re-election I know he will make every effort to ensure that his colleague, with whom I now share an office, is returned to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A commentator on a radio programme this morning described today as &ldquo;divorce day&rdquo;.  It may be more appropriate to rename it &ldquo;Taylor's day&rdquo; given that the historic divorce legislation comes into force on the same day as the Minister has brought this Bill before the House.  I worked <Col N="1145" /> closely with the Minister in the preparation of the Bill.  I worked as a national trade union official many years ago and during that time my union and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions campaigned for the introduction of many of the provisions in the Bill.  I am sorry it took so long to introduce the legislation but nevertheless it is welcomed by all my colleagues in the trade union movement and, in particular, by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the issue of discrimination as it relates to disabled people and women.  When I was Mayor of Drogheda in 1983-4 I told my private secretary to inform organisations which invited me to attend functions that I would only attend if my wife was also invited.  Many of the organisations from which I received invitations had women members.  I stuck strongly to my decision to only attend functions which issued invitations to me and my wife.  Much discrimination arises because people in public life and elsewhere accept invitations which do not include their wives and partners.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and am glad it has been introduced by the Minister, Deputy Taylor.  I wish him, his wife and family every happiness when he retires from the Dáil.  I am sure he will not retire from every other activity and that we have not heard the last of Deputy Taylor.</P>

      <P>I feel outnumbered here; you forgot, chairman, to include yourself because there are three Members from the Louth constituency present.  Perhaps Deputy Dermot Ahern should join us in case he misses something.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind the air of uncertainty in the House, I do not know whether I will get an Opportunity to speak on Second Stage of another Bill in the area of Equality and Law Reform. Therefore, I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Taylor, who is retiring.  I was genuinely sorry to hear he has decided not to stand for the next Dáil.  He has been an excellent Minister.  I thank him for the courtesy and helpfulness he has always shown me and for how he went about his business.  I hope he will have a long and relaxing retirement, which is well deserved.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in general terms, as I welcome any legislation which makes the lives of people easier and gives them a feeling of equality in a very unequal society.  There has been a wide range of legislation dealing with discrimination and inequality in the workplace.  Although the Minister has not done away with the majority of areas in the workplace where discrimination can take place, nevertheless, I am pleased he has introduced this measure which deals with the situation outside the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My cautious welcome for the legislation does not mean that I see nothing wrong with it.  On the contrary, if my interpretion is correct, the Minister has gone much too far in some areas.  I hope my colleagues and I can make him see the light during this debate and that he will accept <Col N="1146" /> amendments which will satisfy our reservations and improve the measure in the process.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with, indeed I positively welcome, the action the Minister proposes to take under section 3.  The attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party is that there is no room for discrimination against individuals, clubs, societies or any other social or ethnic grouping.  We have seen that in practice in this and other countries, which we have deplored and condemned unreservedly. There can be no place for discrimination in society and I hope this measure will confirm and reinforce that legitimate aspiration.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased the Minister has included a provision in section 15 whereby positive discrimination in the provision of special services in favour of the disadvantaged or persons in need of special treatment is allowed.  I trust this will allow for special and better treatment of people with disabilities who, for too long, have been the forgotten ones in society.  Anything which will ease their difficult lot in life is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I have a slight difficulty with section 16.  Prior to the publication of this Bill and in all my dealings with the Minister on this matter, the indications from his Department were that it would be made illegal to prohibit people from entering business premises without giving them a legitimate reason and explanation for their exclusion. As a result of representations by myself, other Members, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and the Licensed Vinteners' Association to the Minister, it was intimated that this Bill would soften that position somewhat and would allow the service provider to refuse entry or service, but would still allow the refused person redress in the courts.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and thank him for taking our representations on board.  However, we must set the record perfectly clear on this issue.  I request the Minister's specific and unequivocal clarification on this matter during this debate, so that the many people who have made representations to me on this subject will clearly know, once and for all, whether they can refuse entry or service under this proposal when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Let us not be coy about this or beat about the bush.  This problem was represented as a publican-traveller one and those with an interest in that subject waited for the Minister's clarification of the matter.  In all my dealings with the Minister in respect of the issues in this Bill, I have never mentioned or written the word &ldquo;traveller&rdquo;.  The problem is much wider than that and affects more businesses than just pubs and more individuals than just travellers.</P>
    <P>The Vintners' Federation of Ireland circulated a pamphlet on this subject which lists 20 groups, representative of constituent organisations and hundreds of thousands of individuals, all of which have a legitimate interest in this section of the Bill.  This is not just about a publican who wishes to keep out a traveller because of his perceived <Col N="1147" /> shortcomings and it would be wrong, and terribly unfair to travellers, to so represent the issue.</P>
    <P>This is about keeping known drug pushers and people who are known to dabble in drugs but have yet to be brought to court or convicted of a crime, out of discos, clubs and pubs.  Some of these people are well known to the managers of places off entertainment and it would be foolhardy, perhaps bordering on criminal. to tie the hands of those responsible for the welfare of their patrons.</P>
    <P>It is also about the antique jeweller who wishes to limit the number and type of his clientely and to exclude those who are known to be, but might not be proven, thieves and robbers.  It is about the amusement arcade owner who wishes to exclude those whom he knows will start a fight on his premises, people with known form in the area of fighting who will present a threat to the legitimate customer.  It is about a publican who wishes to keep known rowdies off his premises, not just for one night but in the long-term, to protect his livelihood which could be ruined by having his law abiding customers chased away by a fighting or insulting element.</P>
    <P>I fully realise that the publican-traveller problem is part of this scenario.  However, I do not want to get hung up on the minority issue or for the debate to stagnate on only one issue in the overall problem.  I am a little better placed than most to have an understanding and appreciation of what is involved in this element of the debate as my family has long service in the licensed trade.  I know the practical difficulties involved and how a business can be wrecked in a short time because the rowdies of the town remain unchecked and can exercise a right to enter and annoy at will.</P>
    <P>This debate is also about the supermarket manager who has to stand up and watch a professional shoplifter come through his door and wait for an opportunity to swing into action, in the secure knowledge that the hasty or false accusation which he can invite will mean great embarrassment for the proprietor, not to mention a substantial payment in damages.  It is also about football hooliganism.  Under the proposal which was first mooted by the Minister, would we have been able to exclude the hooligans who wrecked the Ireland <i>V</i>.  England match some time ago? Will garages be able to keep out the youngsters who scratch their cars just for laughs?</P>
    <P>This problem is much greater, and the debate needs to go much deeper, than just the trite publican-traveller stand-off.  The Minister must declare the position clearly and unequivocally so that everybody knows what is being provided for.  Can persons in charge or control of public bars, dance halls, shops and other places where goods and services are supplied refuse entry to individuals without having to later defend that decision in court?  I realise that section 16, as it stands, appears to indicate that our fears are groundless. However, I would prefer to hear that assurance <Col N="1148" /> from the Minister and see it firmly placed on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>We should not get bogged down in the traveller element of the debate because the issue goes wider than that.  I fully respect the rights of travellers to enjoy all the services the rest of the community enjoys, for example, education, housing, medical services, etc., and I support their receiving equal treatment.  I would go further and commend those areas where there is positive discrimination in favour of the travelling community.  Travellers are as entitled to enjoy the benefits of modern Ireland as anyone else, and if positive discrimination is required to get it for them, I do not have any difficulty with that.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note also, and this is not a scientific finding, that there is a greater willingness on the part of travellers today to integrate into the community than heretofore.  They are anxious to avail of the benefits of the 21st century and are slowly but surely moving towards the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>Rights bring responsibilities, however, and many travellers do not bear those responsibilities. We provide halting sites for them and we must then provide caretakers for those sites.  Caretakers are not provided on local authority housing estates; the residents form an association and look after their own estates.  I cannot understand the reason one area of the community is operated differently from other areas.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments made earlier today by my colleague, Deputy McDaid, in relation to insurance and genetic technology.  There is no doubt the advances in genetic technology may create an uninsurable underclass.  I have spoken in previous debates about DNA profiling and genetic testing of criminals.  We should consider the possibility of compiling a DNA profile of everyone in the country.  That would help in solving crimes, although I understand constitutional difficulties might arise.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see modern technology being abused in the area of insurance.  Genetic science is at the point where susceptibility to common causes of death such as heart disease and cancer can now be assessed.  As tests become more sophisticated the risks of dying young or needing expensive medical treatment will be increasingly quantifiable.  It is expected that within a decade full scale genetic tests will be able to predict a threefold difference in mortality between people with good and bad genes.</P>
    <P>Far from being a Star Trek issue, genetic rating is now a reality.  The Association of British Insurers agreed, under pressure, not to use genetic test results for the next two years for mortgage related life assurance of less than £100,000. In life assurance terms, £100,000 is a low threshold. In Ireland, where life assurance is essential for a mortgage, the general application of genetic rating is obvious.  There has been an obligation for some time in the UK to submit genetic test results to insurers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> There must be community rating of the gene pool similar to that in the provision of health care.  The use of genetic tests for discriminative selection is ethically wrong.  Going down that road will jeopardise people availing of the positive health benefits offered by genetic science.  I was disturbed by the comments of the Irish Insurance Federation that while it currently does not have any plans to follow its UK counterparts, the possibility of doing so in the future has not been ruled out.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 11 which deals with sanctions against discriminating clubs.  The so-called exclusive clubs administered by fossils from the dark ages which discriminated on the basis of gender are not entitled to the largesse of the State, and I welcome that principle being formalised. There is more to discrimination than women being denied the right to play tennis where they like, or having a less costly membership of a club than their male counterparts.  Many people are actively discriminated against on the basis of wealth and, much as he might like to, the Minister cannot do anything about that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of section 12 in relation to the harassment of children in educational establishments.  In a closed environment such as a school or in the tightly-knit teaching profession, it may be difficult for a student to establish a case of harassment or emotional abuse against a teacher.  It would not be too difficult for someone to identify at least one person in the profession whose methodology borders on the kind of discrimination described in section 12(4) and (5).  The phrase &ldquo;intends to offend, humiliate or intimidate the victim&rdquo; will ring hollow for students if action cannot be successfully taken under section 12.</P>
    <P>In providing for such behaviour to be unlawful the Minister is only going part of the way towards eliminating an officially accepted type of bullying. In conjunction with this provision, which is long overdue, the Minister may need to set about educating the teachers' unions to be equally cognisant of the harm their delinquent teachers are doing to student victims, and to encourage those unions to desist from protecting their members at the expense of the pupils.  This is a particularly insidious and cowardly form of discrimination and I urge the Minister to take it seriously.  It has existed in some cases for decades and needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Section 12 also makes provision for the protection of members of clubs from harassment of any kind.  This is necessary, as we have seen from court reports in the press in recent years, and the defining of such an offence and the provision for prosecution is to be warmly welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the provision of services specifically for those with a disability is being placed on a statutory footing and apparently being given a greater priority, but it will be useless if it is not followed by the necessary financial provisions.  There is little point in telling Bus Éireann it has to modify its coaches or requiring <Col N="1150" /> public buildings to have ramps and lifts if the resources are not available to put the directive into effect.  The commitment to those with disability has to be more than a paper exercise two months before an election.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to an area not covered by the Bill.  I was appalled to discover recently that currently it is not an offence for an able bodied person to park in a bay set aside for disabled drivers. I understand regulations are due to come into effect to make it an offence but it is an indictment of our society that we have to introduce regulations to prevent people doing that.  It is sad that able bodied people are not compassionate enough to leave those spaces free for those less fortunate than themselves.</P>
    <P>In relation to passenger vehicles and station equipment, I welcome the provisions regarding accessibility for people with a disability.  The area of taxi-hackney use is not covered in the Bill.  Taxi licences previously issued in Dublin made provision for wheelchair users, although I understand not every taxi can be made so accessible.  Will the Minister indicate if any provisions will be put in place to extend this to the other four main cities? I welcome the provisions requiring local authorities to make kerbing, etc. more accessible to wheelchair users.  I hope that will be done by many local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill lists nine grounds on which discrimination is prohibited, but the definition of some of those grounds seems to be at variance with the Employment Equality Act.  Those variations should be addressed.</P>
    <P>This is imaginative legislation and I commend the Minister accordingly.  I ask him to clarify the matter of the refusal of entry to a place of business and confirm that my interpretation is correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a short contribution to this Bill which apparently has excited great acceptance, with the Minister being eulogised to an unusual degree.  While I thank him for his contribution, the best I can do for the Minister is to wish him a very happy and long retirement.  I am sure what I have to say will not entirely please him, but it may not entirely surprise him either.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the Bill in a general sense, it is yet another layer of legislation, much of which will not be implemented &mdash; I refer specifically to the drink driving laws.  If those laws were properly implemented it would be necessary to have a Garda car outside every public house.  The laws in that area are blatantly abused, whether by Joe Soap down the country or by a judge cruising around Dublin trying to get into the Shelbourne Hotel in the early hours of the morning.  We turn a blind eye to the ravages of drink &mdash; it is the greatest problem in the country &mdash; and its effects on people and families.  We are ambivalent on that tender issue; there is an acceptance of drink in Irish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the Bill to remove intolerance, discrimination and bigotry, are aspirational fairytales.  Intolerance and bigotry will be evident <Col N="1151" /> until the end of time, unless we are all cloned like Dolly, the sheep.  The removal of those characteristics is something to which we should aspire but it is not surprising that discrimination and bigotry are on the increase.  Discrimination is practiced not only here, particularly in the North, but in every country including the Middle East, Africa and, mostly, in the home of the brave, America, where there continues to be discrimination on grounds of colour.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the threat to deny owners of businesses, whether newsagents or public houses, access to their premises.  That provision has been watered down as a result of political pressure because most Deputies recognised that it was totally unacceptable.  I fear this is yet another directive from Europe which is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Itinerants are disadvantaged from birth.  They suffer tremendous intolerance and bigotry, much of which they earn by their attitude to society. Nobody denies itinerant people, or any other section of the community the right to services such as education and social welfare, the right to progress.  When one hears of success among itinerant folk it is gratifying to know that they are climbing above intolerance.  Every political party has failed to honestly address the itinerant question. There has been a refusal to bring in legislation, for instance a responsibility Bill dealing directly with itinerants &mdash; itinerant people seem to have no sense of responsibility.  I refer particularly to problems associated with itinerant people in every town and village who seem to claim the right or the special status to do what they like irrespective of the wishes of the settled community.</P>
    <P>In my town in Dundalk millions of pounds have been spent on providing an inner by-pass and frequently well-heeled itinerant folk who come from England and across the Border in beautiful Volvo cars, Hiace vans, trucks and wagons park indiscriminately on that public highway.  That is an unacceptable image to people visiting and passing through Dundalk.  Itinerants park on private property, IDA property and UDC property.  They stay in the industrial zone where industrialists are brought by the IDA to sell the town, which has double the national average of unemployment. That practice manifests itself all over Ireland, but Governments refuse to address the problem.</P>
    <P>A few years ago there was a cavalcade of itinerant vehicles parked on the national primary route at Collinstown, from Dublin Airport virtually all the way to Swords, in view of people arriving in Ireland, holidaymakers, tourists and business people.  That is unacceptable.  While I do not deny itinerant people their rights, like everybody else they should accept their responsibilities.  The sooner the special status, or &ldquo;fools pardon&rdquo; is removed from them, the better.</P>
    <P>The question of halting sites must be addressed by a future Government.  That is a national problem which should be addressed by all political <Col N="1152" /> parties, not in a confrontational atmosphere in the Dáil Chamber but by consensus.  This issue is a major source of irritation to the settled community and is the source of much of the irrational and intolerant attitude to itinerant folk.  A PR exercise is necessary because to a large extent those people are their own worst enemies.  My views on this matter are shared by many people in the House, but some Members may not wish to express them.  They believe this a worthwhile Bill, the Minister has put a lot of effort into its publication and he is retiring.  However, the ordinary people want me to address this matter.  I am sure I am also speaking on behalf of the various councils who are scourged by this problem.  An itinerant family can move into an area, park on the public highway, block a public footpath and remain there until a local authority seeks a court injunction to have them removed.  I understand the average court injunction costs an urban or county council £4,000 and takes some time to process. Itinerant folk are well schooled by the solicitor and barrister professions and will move on the morning the court order is being made merely to be replaced in a week or even a day's time by another family.</P>
    <P>Every council should cater for itinerants.  There should be a greater willingness to provide housing and serviced sites for them.  Dundalk was one of the first towns to provide a halting site for itinerants. It is located near where I live.  I live nearer to the site than any other councillor in the town, but itinerants have not caused any difficulties for me or my family.  I have no difficulty living near them.  However, a shopkeeper should be entitled to deny the right of access to any member of the community, itinerant or otherwise.  I do not normally speak in defence of public houses or the drink trade, but I have no difficulty doing so in this case.  Is it fair to require a person who borrows a large sum of money to build up a business to tolerate a drug dealer canvassing for the sale of his drugs in one corner of the premises while a prostitute carries out her negotiations in another corner?  It is farcical that people could even conceive of that being acceptable.  I look askance at some of the laws introduced by the EU because, while they may be appropriate in other parts of Europe, they are not acceptable here.  All Members &mdash; irrespective of whether they propose to retire, I may even retire myself &mdash; must be vigilant of this type of nonsense.  A person's home is his or her castle and that should be extended to business premises.  Surely, Deputy McDaid would agree that he should have the right to remove from his clinic a person whom he considers unacceptable.  Let us stop the hypocrisy.  People should have the right to make such a decision.  It would be a sad state of affairs if the right to refuse entry to one's business premises or home was denied to ordinary householders.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister a happy retirement and hope he acknowledges some of the points I made.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy McDaid, who has been elevated to the Front Bench.  I wish him every success in his new portfolio.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Equal Status Bill.  It is important that we culminate an attitudinal change in regard to discrimination in the introduction of legislation.  Discrimination may be covert rather than overt in that people can use language or legalise acts they do not realise are discriminatory in nature.</P>
      <P>Some of my colleagues expressed concern that the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in Part 1 could be considered a medical definition.  For example, section 2 (1) (c) refers to &ldquo;the malfunction, malformation or disfigurement of a part of a person's body&rdquo;.  The Students' Union of Ireland have expressed concerns in this regard and I understand the Minister and his officials propose to reconsider the matter.</P>
      <P>Section 7, which deals with educational establishments, overlaps with section 37 of the Employment Equality Bill.  Is there a need to copperfasten the provisions of that section?  Section 7(2) states:</P>
      <P>An educational establishment shall not discriminate in relation to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the establishment,</P>
      <P>Our educational ethos is unable to deal with disruptive children who cause problems in an institution. That may cause problems, particularly with the forthcoming Education Bill.  It should be teased out, especially in relation to obstreperous children who may not want to be in school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reservations about access to third level institutions.  That will not be perceived as exempt in this Bill and there should perhaps be positive discrimination, or affirmative action as it is termed in America, to ensure that those perceived as disadvantaged have access to third level education.  The Minister might show in the Bill that the educational establishment has taken cognisance of the fact that not everyone has access to third level education.  Third level institutions should acknowledge that not having a <Col N="1154" /> quota of perhaps ten places in some faculties for those who are less well off is discriminatory.</P>

      <P>Section 9 refers to discrimination in clubs.  Many people have serious reservations about club membership, particularly golf clubs, and the Minister has intervened in some cases.  I welcome this section and the sanctions that can be imposed on a club if it does not comply with the ethos of the Bill.</P>
      <P>If we are to speak of true equality, we must be prepared to be equal.  I am not a golfing fan but sometimes I wish I could close golf clubs when husbands do not come home in time for their Sunday lunch, though that is not the golf clubs' problem.  Many women who want to be full members of golf clubs should be allowed to do so and associate membership should be available to men.  If people are prepared to pay to be full members of clubs it is wrong to designate &ldquo;Ladies' Days&rdquo; and to deny women the chance to use golf clubs at weekends.  There should be a balance for men and women so they can choose whatever type of membership suits them.  The Minister seems to agree with that interpretation.</P>
      <P>Section 12 refers to sexual and other harassment. There has been much debate on sexual harassment and despite the legislation people have still not got that message.  It will be an ongoing problem unless we pursue it vigorously.  People in management should be <i>au fait</i> with it and there should be more in-service training in companies to ensure people know what sexual harassment is; it is not always the harassment of a woman.  It can work the other way, which has not been publicised. However, I welcome the inclusion of students in this section because they are very vulnerable if they challenge authority, needing legislative support if they do so.  They need to know it will not affect their passing examinations, for example.  This provision was needed as the matter was swept under the carpet for a long time and the Union of Students of Ireland was no doubt pressurising the Minister to introduce it.  I welcome the provision and students' unions should promote the rights of students, particularly this one, as soon as the legislation passes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 was probably one of the Minister's most controversial provisions and a balance has now been achieved.  My family is involved in the hotel and public house business.  Problems arise and the view is that the travelling community causes most of the bother.  However, most of the solicitor's letters sent by our establishments in recent years show it was the settled rather than the travelling community which caused trouble.  It is important that the Minister clarified the provision. The vintners' associations are now happy with the proposal and I congratulate and thank the Minister for listening to the views expressed. We do not want to place people in invidious positions if they know a person may disrupt a social <Col N="1155" /> occasion or cause damage.  People know their customers in small local areas and know the people who will cause bother.  Without the Minister's clarification matters would have ended up in the courts, causing much hassle and aggravation in small places.</P>
    <P>However, section 55 may need reconsideration when it is taken in conjunction with section 16. Section 55(c) states that a person:</P>
    <P>who is required under this Act to answer any questions, furnish any document or thing or supply any information to the Director or the Authority shall be entitled to the same immunities and privileges as a witness before the High Court.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister in his reply advise the House regarding the implications of that provision in relation to section 16?  For example, a person could be most derogatory about another person when stating why he or she should not be allowed entry to an establishment.  This matter needs clarification because we must ensure that status will not be abused if it is given to an owner of a pub or restaurant.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority for 11 years and it is obvious the message in section 20 has gone over people's heads regarding work carried out on roads and footpaths.  They do not think about the disabled.  A lovely development was built in Donegal town but the footpath is too high not only for the disabled but for mothers with pushchairs.  One would need to be a mountain climber to get off the road.  These issues are covered in legislation.  It is important that county engineers are made aware of the provision and implement it.  It is fine to cover this issue in the Bill but it flies in the face of what we want to achieve if it is not implemented.  It is most important that the Minister for the Environment also takes my point on board and ensures the legislation is implemented.</P>
    <P>Silly things happen; for example, there could be a parking space for a disabled driver but when he opens the car door, he may not be able to get out because the footpath is too high.  Little thought is given to these matters, even in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It was only when a disabled Senator was elected that we realised he could not get into the restaurant or through the corridors.  It is important to reiterate the point that proper facilities must be provided.</P>
    <P>On public transport, the Bill refers to regulations which may be made requiring new road or rail passenger vehicles to be readily accessible and usable by people with disabilities.  However, this measure will not be implemented in County Donegal because I do not know when the county last received a new bus.  It was probably 40 years ago.</P>

      <P>We will have to wait a long time to implement this measure.  The county has a very old fleet and although it would be easier to implement the provision with regard to rail transport, unfortunately, Donegal does not have the privilege of a railway service.  Cognisance should be taken of the fact that some counties have very old stock.  If CIE does not plan to provide new buses on an ongoing basis, perhaps some of the coaches which are in good working order should be adapted to provide access for people in wheelchairs.  Otherwise, the provision will be irrelevant in County Donegal and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The section does not apply to people involved in private use taxis, limousines or hackneys. However, if we are to be truly non discriminatory, it is important to give some assistance to those who may provide private hire services to disabled people who are as entitled as anybody else to take a taxi.  The imposition of the subsection would have a financial impact but some way of addressing it should be considered.  Everyone is entitled to the same services if that is at all possible.</P>
      <P>The Bill needs a small amount of teasing out and a number of concerns could be addressed in the Minister's reply.  The Equality Authority &mdash; the former Employment Equality Agency &mdash; is experienced and is very much aware of what is expected of the legislation and the reality on the ground.  The explanatory memorandum with regard to the financial implications of the introduction of the Bill states that resource requirements, including the staffing and operational costs of the agency, are being considered.  The Employment Equality Agency made a great contribution to the State by acting as a watchdog in terms of the implementation of legislation. However, it was put to the pin of its collar financially in that regard.  If we want to ensure the Bill is implemented and the contributions to the debate do not fall on deaf ears, the Equality Authority must have the necessary resources to do its job.  I hope the Bill will be implemented as soon as possible and I compliment the Minister and his officials for introducing it.  I hope it will encourage an attitudinal change towards discrimination.</P>

      <P>In welcoming the Bill I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Taylor, who, since its publication, has announced his intention not to contest the next general election.  In politics it is only after one has moved on or died that one is praised.  On the one or two occasions I spoke on Bills brought forward by the Minister I took the opportunity to praise him.  I join in the warm and genuine tributes paid to him by Members on all sides of the House.  I had the honour to serve briefly with him between 1992 and 1994.  I sat across the table from him in negotiating the partnership <Col N="1157" /> deal that led to the formation of that Government.  I found him to be an honest, straightforward and straight talking individual who said what he wanted to say, was always prepared to listen to the opposing view and never afraid to change his mind, although he had some deeply held convictions from which he could not be swayed.  It was and still is a pleasure to work with him.  I wish him a long and pleasant retirement with his wife Miriam and family.  He deserves it.</P>
      <P>He has left his mark in the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  He has done the job so well &mdash; I am sure Deputy McDaid does not mind me saying this &mdash; that there is almost no longer a need for a separate ministry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea to establish the Department, which was a good one, emanated from Labour Party sources &mdash; it was probably his own &mdash; during the partnership talks and derived from the failure to give priority to legislation such as this within the Department of Justice which was experiencing difficulties in other areas.  Given recent experience, if this decision had not been taken few of the Bills the Minister has successfully steered through the House would be on the Statute Book, not because of malice but due to the difficulties experienced in assigning personnel to deal with them.  Members on all sides will be able to point to the Minister's record in office and that of others whenever they have to justify their existence.  All Members like to think they will make a difference.  The Minister fits into that category.</P>
      <P>I understand that to date only four Members on the Government side of the House have contributed to the debate on this Bill on which there is consensus.  This does not do the Minister justice. I do not intend to deal with each section in detail, rather I will touch on a number of matters, including the needs of the disabled, insurance, medical examinations and the composition of the Authority which is dealt with in section 28.  I will also deal with the amendments the Minister has made to the Bill in deference to publicans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year 1984 was designated Year of the Disabled. It is nothing short of a disgrace that we still have to include provisions in legislation dealing with the accessibility of public buildings and public transport. Despite passing resolutions and issuing circulars, there are still public buildings, including places of entertainment, to which disabled persons cannot gain access easily as they are not wheelchair friendly.  It reflects badly on us that despite the issuing of circulars and building regulations there is a great lack of accessibility to public buildings and transport.  We could all cite cases in our constituencies of a lack of accessibility to, say, post offices, building societies and, perhaps, some of the buildings in which we hold clinics.  It <Col N="1158" /> is regrettable that it is necessary to include this section, but its inclusion is welcome as people will have recourse in the event of lack of accessibility.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers, particularly Deputy Coughlan, referred to access to public transport.  Deputy McDaid made the point that we do not expect every bus to be adapted for wheelchairs, but initially a reasonable number should be adopted and eventually all public transport should be accessible to those who are wheelchair bound.  It is regrettable that legislation is necessary to ensure that and that semi-State companies are not moving rapidly enough to ensure all citizens are treated equally in terms of accessibility.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies also discriminate against citizens.  Deputy McDaid referred to genetic testing and that the Association of British Insurers announced yesterday that unfavourable genetic test information should not be taken into account when people apply for term life assurance or an endowment policy linked to a mortgage of up to £100,000.  We do not have to go as far as considering people who have had genetic tests, but people who suffer from a fairly common complaint, diabetes, are actively discriminated against here in terms of joining a pension scheme, obtaining a driving licence and for certain duties in the Army. That discrimination is based on an outdated notion of the disorder and a lack of knowledge as to how well it can be treated and self-regulated. I do not know the detail of how it can be self-regulated, but those in the medical profession know it can be controlled.</P>
    <P>I know a diabetic who is a teacher and who was refused entry to the pension scheme of the Department of Education.  I know of a constituent who is a lorry driver and a diabetic whose application to renew his driving licence has been turned down.  He has had a driving licence for some time.  I do not know how the licensing authority learned he had become a diabetic since his licence was first issued, but because it is specifically stated in law that an authority can refuse to grant a licence to a diabetic, his local authority has refused to renew his licence.</P>
    <P>From my personal experience in the Army, I know that Army personnel with diabetes who volunteer for service in the Lebanon or other places overseas are turned down.  Any decision can be justified.  The justification of that decision by the military authorities is that a person afflicted with diabetes while on duty could endanger his colleagues.  I am advised by people who know about diabetes that there are different types of it.  Some of it can be self-regulated and, in some cases, there is little or no danger of a diabetic collapsing once the treatment is maintained. I draw the Minister's attention to that type of discrimination.  No doubt the officials concerned will say there are sound reasons people with diabetes should not be granted a driving licence, allowed join a pension scheme or serve in the Lebanon.  However, that is an automatic reaction.  People have not been brought up to date on the treatments available for diabetes.  Will <Col N="1159" /> the Minister consider this matter, obtain medical advice on it and arrange for the circulation of guidelines to the various Departments concerned? The lorry driver to whom I referred will lose his livelihood because he cannot renew his driving licence for his heavy goods vehicle and that has serious consequences for him and his family as he is not entitled to compensation for that loss.  This type of discrimination needs to be addressed.  Rather than insurance companies imposing a blanket ban on diabetics, they should consider applicants individually.</P>
    <P>Section 28 deals with the setting up of the authority. Having paid the Minister compliments, I will not insult him by saying he would engage in certain activities.  He is retiring from public life, but this legislation will be in place for many years to come.  Section 28 deals with the composition of the authority and states that two of the ordinary members of the authority, one man and one woman, will be nominated by the employer organisations and two, one man and one woman, will be nominated by the employee organisations. That is welcome.</P>
    <P>The section also states that the remaining seven members will be nominated by the Minister. There is no reference to the process by which those seven members will be selected, whether on the basis of nomination by interested bodies or the Minister deciding that the seven people he selects are worthy.  I do not have a problem with the current Minister, who is a fair minded man, selecting those seven members.  I am sure in his selection he will take into account issues of gender, political affiliation, religion and a particular interest in inequality.  However, if he were on this side of the House, I am sure he would share my fear that at some future date a Minister could nominate seven people to the authority who would not have an appropriate qualification for the job other than being friends of the Minister or supporters of his or her party.  This aspect of the Bill should be re-examined.  I do not recommend that a Minister's hands should be tied in regard to nominating members to a board.  For example, in the case of a board of 11 members the Minister should have absolute discretion to select three or four.  In respect of a Bill such as this, those with disabilities and others affected such as employers with an obvious interest in its provisions should have a right to nominate even three members, the Minister selecting one of them is probably the safest route to take.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I have talked <i>ad infinitum</i> about gender-proofing.  Yet whenever one asks a trade unionist, a representative of employers' groups or anyone else to be mindful of gender-proofing in nominating people, inevitably one discovers they nominate whoever they wish.  As in the case of An Bord Pleanála, the Minister should give all such bodies nominating rights, instructions to nominate three members, the Minister selecting one, apart from those he might want to nominate himself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> With the exception of the Minister, I do not observe any reference to the Director of the Equality Authority having to be answerable to anybody.  While this is a very worthy body to which we are giving extensive powers, in any comparable legislation we should ensure that the director of any such body is answerable to this House and obliged to appear before its committees to account for his stewardship.</P>
    <P>I accept that the object of establishing an authority such as this was to remove this from the political arena&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I avail of this opportunity to wish the Minister for Equality and Law Reform good luck on his retirement from politics, I acknowledge his great contribution to equality issues, particularly in the lifetime of this Government. He played a very significant role in introducing legislation to tackle discrimination here, one component of which is this Bill.  His record is outstanding as he introduced many Bills about which many people had spoken over a long period. They expressed their commitment in theory but demonstrably not in practice.  Through his capable stewardship, his approach and that of his officials he has demonstrated that it is possible to draft and introduce very difficult legislation in an efficient manner which does not alienate any section of society or pitch one against another, whose provisions in the longer term will raise standards and attitudes <i>vis-á-vis</i> the law as far as equality is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a female Member I am extremely grateful for the work the Minister has done in the overall area of equality.  People have been calling for equal status legislation for many years, including in employment, but there always seemed to be something standing in its way.  I suppose that is the case worldwide; it is difficult to put one's finger on the precise barriers in the way of its introduction, to make clear, unambiguous statements <Col N="1161" /> about our approach to the disabled, those discriminated against or to really tackling the problem of gender inequalities.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been welcomed by Members from all sides of the House.  In tackling the many difficult issues involved, the Minister has managed diplomatically to allay the concerns of publicans and others in regard to this Bill, who feared there would be no control in public houses.  Having struck a very delicate balance, clearly welcomed by both sides, the Minister has managed to ensure that the travelling community will not be discriminated against, My fear had been that ultimately the repercussions of those lobbying for publicans would lead to travellers discriminated against but that is not the case.  The Minister has managed to deal with the concerns of both groups on which he is to be congratulated.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this Bill will allow us to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination which is welcome.  It also means we can withdraw any reservations we may have had in relation to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and to ratify that convention, not possible heretofore.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt with the matter of sexual harassment much more effectively in this Bill than in the Employment Equality Bill.  When the latter is going through the Seanad will he reexamine the definition of &ldquo;sexual harassment&rdquo;&mdash; in particular the use of the phrase &ldquo;reasonable person&rdquo; because I continue to have concerns about it?</P>
    <P>I hear that the number of sexual harassment cases being taken in the Labour Court has dropped while the number of inquiries to the Employment Equality Agency has risen.  I am concerned because women are very easily intimidated when it comes to reporting sexual harassment. I want clear legislation supportive of them. I do not want to witness women bringing cases to court, when the courts and the Labour Court discover it is almost impossible to conduct such a case because of difficulties of definition.</P>
    <P>This Bill also deals with the matter of clubs that discriminate against women.  I am tired talking about this subject; it really is not something we should even have to address at this point.  What is being stipulated in this Bill is quite modest, that such clubs will not receive any succour from the State if they discriminate against anyone on any of the grounds mentioned and, if they do, they will be unable to obtain a licence.  While I hope this sanction will not have to be applied, I am enormously relieved the Minister has included it. It would appear that most clubs have seen sense and changed their dreadful discriminatory practices, so prevalent here over such a long period. It is quite extraordinary that it has taken until this year for one of our most prestigious clubs to change its rules but I am glad it has done so.</P>
    <P>There is more to be said about the Bill but I am sharing my time.  The main point is that if legislation to prohibit discrimination is in place <Col N="1162" /> attitudes will begin to change.  Who knows whether attitudes or legislation comes first, but the two certainly go hand in hand.  The Bill is most welcome and the Minister has done well to bring it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for sharing her time.  I add my plaudits to those already given to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  As a colleague in the Labour Party I know that he fulfils the description &ldquo;a scholar and a gentlemen&rdquo;.  I am disappointed he will not be going forward in the next election because we could do with men and women of his stature and calibre.  I wish him well in whatever future life he decides to pursue.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see the Equal Status Bill before us because we urgently need to implement it to fulfil our international obligations to combat discrimination on the grounds of race and sex. We have been unable to fulfil those obligations because we have not enshrined those provisions in our statutes.  I am glad we can now present ourselves in the world arena as a nation which has fulfilled its international and domestic obligations.</P>
      <P>Travellers are one minority group which will welcome this legislation.  They have waited patiently for it and are the largest single group which will benefit substantially from its passage.  There has been large-scale lobbying, particularly by vintners, about this provision but their fears are groundless.  The Bill will give travellers the status they deserve and will eliminate once and for all the idea that the settled community somehow has greater rights and status.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, indicated in the budget that the public service would meet its obligation to ensure that 3 per cent of its employees are people with disabilities. Dublin City Council recently decided to grant a further 200 taxi plates, all for wheelchair accessible vehicles.  We should be moving in that direction all the time.  State bodies should take the initiative in equal rights and should not be forced to do so.</P>
      <P>The Minister might also consider the right to vote because one sector of the community still denied it is the prison population.  Every citizen should have that right and it would be of enormous benefit to prison reform if prisoners were entitled to invite politicians to hear their views about conditions and the operation of the system. It would also open up the prison regime to greater communication and visibility.  Insurance is an extremely important matter.  Certain sectors of the community &mdash; homosexuals, women and people with certain illnesses &mdash; are discriminated against and we must emphasise that there should be no discrimination in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met representatives of An Post this morning to discuss a proposal to close a rural post office because it was perceived as not viable.  That could be called discrimination on the basis of numbers &mdash; An Post did not feel there were enough people <Col N="1163" /> to justify the service.  That is an important issue in a country like Ireland, where the population is shifting to the main urban centres with a consequent decrease in rural areas.  If essential services are removed from an area it would appear to be discrimination against the local community. It is difficult to address such a point as it could be discussed in terms of public policy but it is relevant to this legislation.  I am glad the Bill has been welcomed on all sides of the House and I look forward to its early passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I wish the Minister well in his retirement.  I had the privilege of knowing him in a professional capacity and he brought the same qualities of fair dealing and a conscientious approach to his work to the performance of his ministerial duties.  I know the Minister is looking forward to his retirement having worked in his Department on equality issues and introduced divorce legislation to reflect the great social changes which have taken place in recent decades.</P>
      <P>As to the creature of the Minister and the instrumentality of these changes, the Department of Equality and Law Reform, I do not share his view about its continuation.  The idea of establishing a Department to address a particular problem is a good one and this Department has been a tremendous success.  It has allowed the Government to introduce legislation on equality matters and to provide for the re-marriage of separated persons, and the expedition of law reform measures generally.  This device was also used during the Emergency when the late Seán Lemass was put in charge of the co-ordination of supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a legitimate device to bring a Minister into the Government and give him a distinct mandate relating to a pressing problem.  However, there is a danger that the resulting administrative apparatus becomes a permanent aspect of the machinery of the State and it can be argued that the functions of the Department could usefully be allocated to other Departments once the Minister's magnificent work is done.  This measure will probably be adopted by both Houses prior to the dissolution of the Dáil, although the Seanad debate may take place after the dissolution of this House and the Minister could enjoy his time discussing this measure in the Upper Chamber while the rest of us attempt to secure our re-election. However, on the assumption that the measure is enacted, we will have two solid laws on equality, the modernised employment equality code and this equal status measure which breaks new ground in this jurisdiction.  There are other pressing social problems &mdash; drug abuse, for example &mdash; which might warrant the appointment of a Minister for the lifetime of a Government. In introducing the measure today the Minister referred to the equal right of participation for designated categories and the need to outlaw discrimination against them.  These measure properly <Col N="1164" /> deal with discrimination against specific categories.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the Minister's remarks on Fr. MacGréil's work on prejudice.  He took a pessimistic view of the new edition of his book. However, it shows a lessening of popular attitudes of prejudice with regard to a range of categories. Nevertheless, the revised study conducted by Fr. MacGréil on the question of prejudice and tolerance in our society illustrates that there is still a substantial reservoir of prejudice against certain groups.  The Minister instanced the travelling community in that respect.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <P>It is a matter of serious concern to me that a number of women who have been reported missing have not yet been traced.  However, it is worthwhile noting that the vast majority of women reported missing are subsequently traced.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that every possible effort is made to locate missing persons.  The Garda have a specific responsibility in tracing persons under 18 years of age or who are physically or mentally handicapped or whose disappearance occurred in circumstances which give rise to fears for their physical or moral safety.  The Garda put substantial resources into tracing such missing persons.  In the cases of missing <Col N="1165" /> juveniles, the local juvenile liaison officer liaises directly with the family.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resource is a matter for the Garda authorities.  In this regard, I am informed by them that they are satisfied that the current procedures and resources in place for dealing with missing persons are adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply.  It would appear from her figures that since 1990, 17 women reported missing have not been traced.  She will agree this is the cause of the greatest distress to the families concerned.  They are anxious that the State does everything possible to trace their missing loved ones.</P>
      <P>Given the pressures on gardaí, does the Minister agree it is desirable to establish a small specialised until within the Garda Síochána to concentrate on tracing missing persons?  In this context, does she see merit in it having a specialised unit to investigate serious murder cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>An untraced missing person is a matter of great concern to all in this House. While most missing women are traced, I realise that even with numbers of missing women in single figures in each of these years, with 1991 and 1993 recording the highest number at four each, there are traumatised families who must continue to live not knowing what has happened to a loved one.</P>
      <P>The case of every missing person, whether male or female, is followed up by the Garda.  The total number of people who have gone missing in each of the years 1995-6 are 1,578 in 1994, 1,444 in 1995 and 1,848 in 1996.  All of these have been traced except for 13 in 1995, 12 in 1995 and eight in 1996. The majority of those untraced in each of those years are male.  The Garda Síochána advise me that it does not need a specialised unit to trace missing women.  The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the deployment of his forces and personnel and constantly reviews Garda structures.</P>
      <P>We do not know whether those missing are the victims of crime; they may have decided to leave home.  One can surmise that something terrible has happened to some of them, but there is no certainty about the reasons for their absence until evidence is produced that they are still alive or sadly dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda recently reviewed the structure of the specialist units attached to Garda headquarters and the central detective unit at Harcourt Square.  This review arose from trends emerging in different forms of criminal activity. Following the review, the expertise and resources available to these units have now been combined to form the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation under the control of a chief superintendent. The resources of the unit will be available to investigate any serious crime, and to trace missing women, should a local district officer <Col N="1166" /> require it.  This is in addition to the existing specialist services available in the form of finger print, ballistic, photography and forensic expertise at the Garda headquarters.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner reviewed the different specialist units available to him and has brought a number of them together to create this bureau so that cases of missing persons where there is suspicion of criminal activity can be investigated. The files of the untraced people I have listed will remain open until some trace of them has been found.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little doubt, following the late arrival of the State pathologist at the scene of a violent death recently, there are deficiencies in the investigative process which should be remedied.  In that context there is no difficulty whatsoever in broadening the scope of a specialised unit to include men.  Clearly we will not discriminate one way or the other.  Whether men or women, a considerable number of people are missing.  In many cases their relatives who believe they met with violent death are deeply concerned they are not in a position to give their loved ones a Christian burial.  It is incumbent on the Government to ensure these people are found.  The best way of doing that is to set up a specialised unit within the Garda Síochána to ensure every possible effort is made and no stone is left unturned with a view to ascertaining the whereabouts of these people and if a violent death was involved that those responsible would be brought to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that missing persons remain on an open file and all investigations continue to be carried out.  The figures I have given represent people of whom we all know.  Following my discussions with the Garda Commissioner I assure the Deputy no stone is left unturned to follow up any information that may come the way of the Garda.  I undertake to pass on to the Garda Commissioner, who is responsible for the deployment of the force, the Deputy's strongly held view on the need for a unit separate from the criminal investigation unit.  I do not think there is a case for such a unit at present because the Commissioner has recently reviewed the structures and decided on the way to use the expertise available to him.  I am taking his advice on this matter.</P>

      <P>I am informed that 15 persons have made application to the High Court for habeas corpus arising from the invalid constitution of the Special Criminal Court.  One of these cases was heard in January 1997 by a divisional court of the High Court and in a reserved judgment delivered yesterday the court dismissed the application.</P>
      <P>Requests for legal aid in the case of habeas corpus applications fall to be dealt with under the Attorney General's scheme which is not administered by the Department of Justice.  I understand, however, that in the case already heard by the High Court, an application was made under the Attorney General's scheme and the court has recommended that the application be granted.  I also understand a number of the other applicants have also applied to the court to have the Attorney General's scheme applied to their cases and the court has also recommended that their applications be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that no costs have yet been paid under this scheme in defending the application. In so far as action on the report by Messrs. Cromien and Molloy is concerned, a series of measures relating to procedures and systems in the Department have been introduced.  These include revised administrative procedures in relation to <Col N="1168" /> the implementation of Government decisions and the handling of correspondence generally.</P>
    <P>So far as the Special Criminal Court is concerned, I informed the House on 19 November of changes made in the administrative system for dealing with these matters and I will deal further with this aspect of the matter when we come to Questions Nos. 20 and 48 on today's Order Paper.</P>

Since the foundation of the State I am not aware of any Minister who has ever been called on to pay the cost of a court case or costs in respect of water leakage in an office etc.  I would be interested in hearing about cases where a Minister or civil servant had to pay because of a mistake in the way correspondence or any other matter was handled within the Department.  If a person was found guilty of embezzling money etc. he or she would have to pay.

The report of the beef tribunal raised questions about the administrative role played by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, but he was not asked to pay the large costs of the tribunal.  No former Minister was ever asked to pay for court cases arising out of decisions taken in their Departments.  If a Minister was obliged to pay the costs in a case arising out of a decision or action in his or her Department no one would ever accept the job.</P>

      <P>As a member of Government and Minister for Justice, I am concerned that all offices and agencies which have a role within the criminal justice area should operate effectively and efficiently.  The steps taken to improve the structure and management of the legal services provided to the State are, therefore, to be welcomed. I should emphasise that my Department does not have responsibility for either of the offices mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The part of the report on the DPP's office relevant to my Department is the comment on the role of the Garda Síochána in preparing files for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The matters concerned are being examined by a small working group, which includes representatives of my Department and the Garda authorities, established to review procedures.  The group had its first meeting earlier this month and will report within three months.</P>

      <P>On the report on the effectiveness or otherwise of the Chief State Solicitor's office, which acts as solicitor for the Director of Public Prosecutions in the prosecution of criminal offences in the Dublin area, will the Minister agree that while it is very strong on critical analysis and recommendations for change it is very weak as a mechanism for accountability?  Will she further agree that the report outlines a panorama of difficulties and possible embarrassment for the Government if the present maladministration, which has been admitted, is allowed to continue? <Col N="1170" /> Has she been made aware of any hard cases where the State's case collapsed and criminals evaded justice because of incompetence in the Chief State Solicitor's office or delays in the preparation of the book of evidence?  My question relates to accountability, not contingency plans for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for the Chief State Solicitor's office.  The report was not prepared at my behest and it is, therefore, not a matter for which I have responsibility.  Similar questions were put to the Taoiseach who stated that a high level group had been established to provide a strategic overview of the law offices of the State.  He went on to outline the terms of reference of the group and stated that the group, which had met on five occasions, was chaired by the Attorney General and included representatives of the offices of the Chief State Solicitor and DPP and the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Justice and Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I do not know of any hard cases which have collapsed.  The decision on whether a prosecution should be taken rests solely with the DPP and I have no part to play in such matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I did not ask about cases where a decision was taken not to prosecute.  I asked about cases to be prosecuted by the State &mdash; I am sure the Minister has an interest in criminal prosecutions &mdash; which had collapsed because of incompetence and delays in the preparation of the book of evidence.  If the Minister is saying she has no interest in the efficiency of the prosecution service then she is taking yet another breathtaking flight from accountability.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that when a criminal case, which has implications for the victim and society in general, collapses because of inefficiency and delays in the preparation of the book of evidence etc. then there should be accountability and it must be a matter of public record? Does the Minister have any interest in the issue of accountability for the processing of criminal trials?</P>

Of course I have an interest in the State's criminal prosecution system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report criticised the way in which the Garda presented files to the DPP.  The file should be sent first to the State Solicitor or Chief State Solicitor, depending on the county in which the crime occurred, so that he can make whatever changes are necessary or request additional information. The file is then sent to the DPP.  I do not carry out the investigation.  I do not have information <Col N="1171" /> with me on hard cases which collapsed because the book of evidence was not prepared in time etc., but if the Deputy tables questions I will try to get information for her.

The Deputy can give me the names of anybody whom he thinks should be brought to the attention of the Garda Síochána and I will pass them on.  I assure him, however, there are ongoing intensive investigations into this awful murder and any tiny bit of information which comes the way of the Garda is diligently and scrupulously followed up.

Is it the norm for people who publicly admit to very serious offences of this nature to receive visas to travel abroad?  Was the Government involved in encouraging the grant of that visa?  That would be entirely against the concept of the administration of justice in this State.  The position in this State is that if an individual admits to such an offence the rule of law applies.

I do not know about the specific legislation, immunity, visas or the details of the person to whom the Deputy referred because they were not included in the question.

The people living near the proposed sites for the location of these masts should have been consulted prior to the Government's decision to accept the plan presented by Esat Digifone.

The issue of planning permission is not a matter for me as Minister for Justice but for the relevant local authorities.  My role was to ascertain whether an arrangement <Col N="1175" /> between Esat Digifone and anybody else who applies to use masts on Garda sites, either for additional antennae or the replacement of the masts, could be implemented without interfering with the Garda system.  The planning and technology aspect was examined by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the Department of the Environment.  As matters stand, under existing planning regulations which have now been amended for clarification purposes, a number of other telecommunications organisations and radio operators have already put antennae on masts under an exemption.  Planning permission is required for the erection of some masts but not for others.  The Deputy is correct in saying that in cases where masts are exempt from planning permission, the people concerned will not have any recourse to the planning authority under the planning code, but they can comment if they believe there are health and safety considerations.  I am not sufficiently expert in the health and safety legislation to inform the Deputy in that regard.</P>

In July last year the Minister for the Environment published a document entitled <i>Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures</i>.  Paragraph 4.5, which refers to sharing facilities and clustering, states: &ldquo;Support structures used by emergency or other essential services are not suitable for sharing with public mobile telephone services&rdquo;.

I remind the Deputy that when his party was in office and Eircell was awarded the contract, the then Minister for the Environment gave it six months' clear exemption for all their masts under planning law specifically introduced for that purpose. I could use the Deputy's term to describe that arrangement as a cosy deal but that was the correct approach at the time to get that system up and running.  The agreement that will be reached in this instance will ensure Esat Digifone does not have control over the masts, that anybody can apply to use a Garda mast and that there will be capacity on those masts.  A special deal has not been done with Esat.  It has been given a facility to use the Garda masts to fulfil a contract awarded by the Government to provide a second mobile phone licence.  When the third mobile phone licence comes on stream, that company will have the benefit of the exemptions on existing masts if they want to erect up to 12 antennae.

      <P>I understand the first approach was made to the Garda Síochána last July arising from the publishing of the document by the Minister for the Environment on the desirability of co-sharing as a means of preventing the proliferation of masts around the country.  Most Deputies will agree that is a good objective.  The discussions proceeded from July between Esat, a technical expert from the Garda Síochána and some staff from my Department.  The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications was involved in the technical issues, the Office of Public Works was involved in the sites that might be shared and the Department of the Environment was involved in examination of the planning laws to find the lacuna and where it is possible to amend the regulations. There was involvement by the Departments of Justice, the Environment and Transport, Energy and Communications as well as the Office of Public Works and the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I will not ask the Minister for Justice what the Mullaghmore man, the man in the iron mast, Minister Michael D. Higgins, thinks of this.  Will the Minister tell the House whether consultation took place with the health authorities to ensure there is no risk to people's health as a result of the erection of masts?  People are entitled to such reassurance from the Minister and to expect that at least that level of consultation took place.</P>

      <P>The International Radiation Protection Association prescribed maximum emission levels for base station sites.  These are included as an appendix to the guidelines for local planning authorities on the siting of telecommunications antennae and support structures, issued by the Department of the Environment last year.  Esat Digifone will be required to comply fully with these standards.  The fact that developments on some sites will be exempt from planning permission does not mean Esat Digifone will be exempt from the need to fulfil other guidelines laid down by the Radiation Protection Association and health and safety legislation.  I am not aware that my Department was involved in discussions with the health and safety authorities, but Esat Digifone, was made aware in all the discussions, <Col N="1178" /> that it must fulfil all requirements relating to health and safety standards and the guidelines laid down by the Radiation Protection Association.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Department of the Environment, in its guidelines, state that there should be no sharing of masts and antennae?  There was clearly a very good reason for that, and the Government should alleviate people's fears in that regard.  I am not suggesting that the deal reached may not be of benefit to the Garda Síochána, but it is of fundamental importance that people be reassured in terms of their health.  That is the very least they are entitled to from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that Esat Digifone and any other company that may in future seek permission to use a Garda mast, an RTÉ mast or any other mast will be bound by all the guidelines.  If the Deputy wishes, I will read the statement of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, dated 12 February 1997, which I am sure was circulated to all Members, outlining the position. I am being asked questions about the planning process, but my role in this matter is to see if an arrangement can be made with Esat Digifone, leaving aside capacity for a third telephone licence.  Esat Digifone should be able to share masts, subject to the provisos in the agreement.</P>
      <P>That is the appropriate way forward rather than a proliferation of approximately 460 new masts, which would be required to provide a second mobile telephone service.  I think everybody is in favour of competition and if masts are not shared, 459 new masts would have to be erected throughout the country, as well as perhaps another 459 masts for a third mobile licence. As the Minister for the Environment said, the concept of co-location on existing radio masts and mast sharing by different operators is a good and effective policy.  If Deputies are against that they should say so, or are they trying to pretend they are in favour of it while telling the public they are against it?  They must decide whether they are for or against it.</P>

      <P>My Department is carrying out a review of this complex issue and will report to me shortly.  The review has involved an extensive range of meetings with representative and trade bodies in the industry, Government Departments and agencies and the Garda Síochána.  The security industry comprises a large number of companies providing a wide range of services, including security on business premises, storage and transit of cash, supply and installation of intruder and fire alarms, providing 24 hour monitoring for alarm calls, providing security for private individuals and carrying out private investigations.  The departmental review includes analysis of the issues involved in regulations and of ways in which such a broad spectrum of activity could be regulated in practice.  It also involves analysis of regulatory practice for the security industry in other jurisdictions.  When I have examined and assessed the contents of the review I will make a further statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Accurate information is available on the number of companies involved and the number of employees in those companies, but is there monitoring of the activities of the companies and the way in which they undertake their activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The security industry is not regularised by law.  There is no regulatory authority to monitor each company or to which people may apply when they wish to set up such a company. The latest figure of people working in the security industry, given at the recent Irish Security Industry Association &mdash; ISIA &mdash; annual dinner which I attended, is approximately 3,000.  The ISIA carries out a great deal of monitoring and regulation and presents certificates to people who undertake special training courses.  Companies are self-regulated. The concern arises when people who are not members of the association give a bad name to certain sections of the industry.  After years of <Col N="1180" /> begging by bona fide members of the security industry of successive Ministers for Justice to consider the industry in its entirety, I took up the cudgels for them.  An intensive review of the industry has been carried out and a report is in the final stages of preparation.  When I have that report I will contact the president of the federation and the ISIA, both of which represent the industry, to progress the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long time &mdash; January 1995 &mdash; since the Brink's-Allied raid brought this matter to a head, and more than two years later there is still no sign of the regulations which the Minister promised for the security industry.  The way matters are progressing, Rip Van Winkle will have woken up before the regulations are in place.  Will the Minister accept there has been considerable lethargy in regard to this matter and that people could be forgiven for believing the Minister is waiting for another serious robbery from a security industry depot before introducing regulations?  Why has it taken so long for regulations, which appear to be simple enough to draft, to see the light of day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not need to introduce regulations to examine the way in which cash in transit is handled.  Shortly after the Brink's-Allied robbery a number of changes were made to the way cash in transit is handled, but I do not intend to spell them out to the House because, while Members are law abiding citizens, people who are not could hear of the changes and plan robberies accordingly.  A great deal of effort has been made to ensure a cash in transit robbery will not recur. However, as I am not a miracle worker I cannot ensure a robbery of cash in transit will not take place again.  It would be foolish for a Minister to do so.</P>
      <P>I do not accept I have put the matter on the long finger.  A large number of meetings have taken place.  I have attended almost every security function, launch and presentation since I became Minister and views differ greatly on the type of legislation that should be enacted.  A number of companies do not want regulation because they believe small companies will not be able to pay for the structures they will have to put in place to meet requirements and so on.  My officials have met representatives of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises, SIPTU, the International Professional Security Association, the Irish Security Industry Association, the Security Institute of Ireland and, more recently, there were communications with the newly formed umbrella body.  The security industry is not cohesive in that it does not have one organisation to speak for it.  It is only in the past week or two that the new organisation has brought all the associations under its umbrella.  Now that they may all sing from the one hymn sheet, progress should be much easier.  The matter is not dead and as soon as the report is complete I will progress the matter further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise a group of convicted criminals released from prison could set up a security industry?  Does she realise she did the industry no favours by failing abysmally to regulate the industry over a period of two years in office, particularly when deficiencies were highlighted by the Brink's-Allied raid?  Will she assure us the regulations will be brought before the House by a certain date?  Is it possible to even get that information from the Minister today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge there are valid concerns about people with criminal records setting up security companies, but once criminals have completed their sentences and paid their debts to society they are free to set up any business. People with criminal convictions do not have to forfeit their constitutional rights to start up a business.  However, I am aware of the concerns and have raised them with the industry, but it does not believe the matter is as serious as the anecdotes and dramatic headlines portray.  Those type of headlines damage the reputation of bona fide people working in the security industry. There will probably be another headline after today and bona fide people in the industry will feel they are being labelled as criminals who have completed their jail sentences.</P>
      <P>I cannot and will not give the Deputy an exact date as to when or if regulations will be brought before the House.  I have not completed my examination of how best to proceed.  The matter will require primary legislation, it is not a question of sticking a few regulations on a piece of paper.  This is a complex and diverse matter.  I attended a luncheon last week with a large number of representatives from the security industry and two members of the Garda Síochána who could not agree among themselves on how the industry should be regulated.  Those who provide products for the industry do not believe they should be regulated in the same way as others in the industry.  Many different views were expressed at the lunch.  It is not an easy industry to regulate.  I will continue my examination of the industry and before long I hope to be able to give a clearer indication of the path we are taking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is factually incorrect to suggest convicted criminals can set up any business they wish.  The Minister should give leadership, make regulations and introduce legislation. She should make decisions in the best interest of the industry and those who put their faith in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is a matter for the Government to decide how an industry should be regulated and I am consulting with the industry in that regard.  I am confused at the Deputy's views.  In his remarks on the last question he beat me over the head for not consulting with somebody and when I am holding extensive consultations on a matter he wants me to proceed with an iron fist and make the regulations.  I will not <Col N="1182" /> do that.  If it were as easy as the Deputy believes, why was nothing done about security industry regulations since 1981 when I first met representatives of the industry?  The Fine Gael, Labour, Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil parties have been in Government since then, but did nothing to regulate the industry.</P>
      <P>We have analysed the variety and complexity of the industry and are beginning to get a better picture of the legislation that will be required.  I cannot give the Deputy a date as to when legislation will be introduced because I have not completed my examination of the industry, but it will be introduced in a proper and effective manner, if and when it is introduced.</P>

      <P>The Garda Commissioner is satisfied that the provision of gardaí in Kerry is adequate and they keep the matter under review. I have been Minister for two years and the Deputy may not like to know that there has been a decrease in overall numbers of crimes committed of about 20 per cent between 1994 and 1996.</P>
      <P>In 1994 1,897 crimes were committed in Kerry; in 1995, 1,697; and in 1996 there is a provisional figure of 1,536.  The detection rate is 40.3 per cent for 1996 so the trend for Kerry is good.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to close rural Garda stations.  The Deputy will know that rural policing started in June 1982, when his party was in Government, as a pilot scheme in three areas.  In 1989 that was extended and again in 1991 to a further 12 areas.  In 1994, before I became Minister, the then Commissioner presented a proposal that the scheme be extended to 12 more areas.  I asked for more information and practice before I would consider such a proposal and the Commissioner is now in consultation with the 12 existing areas and those areas proposed for inclusion in 1994.  I will make no decisions on the extension of rural community policing in Kerry or anywhere else until that consultation process has been finished and a report submitted to me.</P>

This letter advised the Deputy that if specific examples and details were conveyed to me regarding situations in which Regulation 14 gardaí were allegedly engaged on ordinary Garda duties I would gladly have them investigated.  My reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 156, 157, 166 and 173 of 10 December 1996 addressed the various situations where Deputies had concerns on this matter.</P>
      <P>Regulation 14 of the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations, 1988, provides for the recruitment of persons having special technical qualifications to An Garda Síochána.  The deployment of the force is the responsibility of the Garda authorities and they have informed me that members recruited under this regulation are not employed on ordinary duties, that is regular uniform duties.  The Garda authorities provide training courses for all Regulation 14 members and, depending on the nature of their duties, they are trained in aspects of policing which their superior officers consider appropriate.</P>
      <P>At the Ireland versus England soccer international in Lansdowne Road on 15 February 1995 the Garda authorities point out that members of the Garda Band, which has both Regulation 14 and other personnel attached to it, were on duty in their capacity as bandsmen.  They assisted their colleagues during the riot at Lansdowne Road. However, none of the Regulation 14 members of the Garda Band were ordered to assist during the riot but most did so voluntarily.</P>

    <P>The Garda authorities also inform me that 17 gardaí recruited under Regulation 14 for the Garda Band each gained three days' station experience as part of their induction training course.  Fourteen were stationed at Store Street Garda Station and three at Pearse Street Garda Station.  Their attendance at these Garda stations <Col N="1185" /> was solely as part of their initial training and they were at all times accompanied by experienced members from the stations concerned.</P>
    <P>I am assured that the Garda Commissioner is satisfied with the level of training currently given to Regulation 14 gardaí and that this is sufficient to enable them to carry out their duties. However, as with all training needs, these are constantly evaluated and in-house courses are provided as necessary.</P>

      <P>I wish to correct a wrong impression given by Deputy Dempsey.  His question of 3 December was general.  He asked the number of times untrained regulation 14 gardaí were used for active duty in each of the years from 1994 to 1996 and the occasions on which they were used.  It was a written question so three days were available to compile a reply.  I said the deployment of the force is the responsibility of the Garda authorities and I was informed by them that the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the use of regulation 14 gardaí was not readily available.  I also said I would arrange to forward the information to him as soon as it was gathered and processed.  I did so but the question was not specifically about the use of regulation 14 gardaí.</P>

      <P>I will repeat my reply: &ldquo;However, none of the regulation 14 members of the Garda Band were ordered to assist during the riot but most did so voluntarily&rdquo;.  I have a file from an individual garda, who in some letters but not in others asked me not to use his name.  I will not give his name but he obviously wrote to a number of Deputies.  I have a list of the Deputies who forwarded his letter to me with a covering note asking me to reply to it.  Each of those Deputies received a reply from me and I have a list of the dates on which the replies were issued.  This matter is obviously concerning an individual garda but, from the information supplied by the Garda Síochána, none of the regulation 14 members were ordered to assist.  However, in that difficult situation, I imagine gardaí, regardless of whether they were regulation 14 members, probably voluntarily assisted,</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred earlier to the Department occupied by the Minister.  I should have said that I was not expressing party policy in that respect but a personal view about the need to rationalise different Departments from time to time and to consider whether a more efficient distribution of their functions could be arranged.  I also referred to the book by Fr. Micheál MacGréil, <i>Prejudice in Ireland Revisited.</i></P>
      <P>In discussing the philosophy of the Bill, the Minister drew attention to the fact that it is important Ireland complies with its international obligations.  The legislation will allow us to meet our international obligations in certain respects. The inspiration for the Bill goes back some way in history.  If one examines the 1916 Proclamation one will see a reference to equal rights and equal opportunities.  A legislative measure dealing with negative discrimination is not the only method of securing equal rights and opportunities.  Many other legal instruments and policies must be adopted to do it but the Minister conducted wide ranging consultations in relation to the Bill.  As a result of these consultations, which extended over the entire span of two Governments, he has managed, close to the end of the second Administration, to produce a measure which has not evoked tremendous controversy.  That is a great tribute to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the substance of sections 9 and 10, the Minister has provided two sanctions to deal with discriminating clubs.  One is that they will not be able to obtain an intoxicating liquor licence and the other is that they will not be in a position to apply for funding from State sources. The most obvious example of that is national lottery allocations but I assume other funds become available from time to time.  Does the provision in section 11(1)(a), which states &ldquo;no grant or loan of public funds&rdquo;, extend to funds distributed or disbursed by a local authority as distinct from the State?  How wide does the expression &ldquo;public funds&rdquo; extend?  Does it relate to the Exchequer <Col N="1189" /> or money voted under the annual Appropriation Act or does it extend to local authorities, corporations set up under statute and companies in which the Minister has a shareholding?  I ask the Minister to clarify this issue because it is uncertain.</P>
    <P>Am I correct that the only clubs which will not be allowed to discriminate are those which are engaged in the consumption of alcohol? It appears that a club which does not need an intoxicating liquor licence for its purposes will be free to discriminate under the legislation.  In enacting a measure dealing with equal status we find that a club which does not find it necessary to provide for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor on its premises is not capable of discriminating. That is an interesting assessment of the national character and a reminder of the central place alcohol has in national life.  Is this desirable?  In legislation such as this, should we consider other issues?  I appreciate the Minister wants to conclude his wide-ranging consultations and that the list of bodies which might be captured by an extension in this respect would be more extensive. I interpret the Bill to mean that a club which does not have an intoxicating liquor licence but does discriminate will still not be able to obtain public funds.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with sexual and other harassment, a topical subject in recent years.  The person described in the Bill as the victim may have a separate civil remedy in respect of conduct which amounts to sexual harassment.  It might be no harm to insert a subsection to state that the section's provisions are without prejudice to any rights a person may have in common law or equity to institute proceedings.  The casual reader of this legislation and the explanatory documentation which I assume the Department will prepare, if it continues to exist, might be led into thinking that this is the sole remedy in the legal system.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides an expeditious remedy. One will be able to go to the director, whose appointment is provided for in Part III, who may award damages up to the limit one may receive in the District Court.  If an entire body was practising sexual harassment, I assume the authority could intervene and seek an injunction.  This is without prejudice to the rights a person may enjoy in general law.  Perhaps we should not comment in this forum on spent litigation but it was interesting to note in recent weeks how such litigation could give rise to great heat and public interest.</P>
    <P>On the question of enforcement, the director will investigate any claims referred to him or her by the authority.  A time limit is specified for the lodgement of an appeal by either party to the claim.  This must be determined by the Circuit Court which may provide for any redress for which provision could have been made by the decision appealed against.  I take it that the Circuit Court proceedings will be held in open court <Col N="1190" /> and that there will be no restrictions on publicity. I assume, however, that when the director is investigating a complaint the proceedings will be of a somewhat private and informal character.  If there is an appeal, the documentation involved should be placed in the public arena.  It is important, in the public interest, that any appeal proceedings are reported so that the public will be able to see how the legislation is being implemented.  It is clear that this will be the case but this is a topical subject about which there is much anxiety.  It relates to the publicity that should properly attach to most court proceedings.</P>
    <P>The question of insurance and the arrangements made by insurance companies for wide categories of persons has been raised.  This is a matter on which many Members receive representations. Any claims of discrimination will fall to be investigated under this measure.  It will, however, be difficult for the director to establish the facts with insurance companies about these matters.  Under the Bill, the authority may require any person, by notice delivered to that person, to supply such information as it specifies in the notice and requires for the purpose of the investigation and to produce any document specified; to summon witnesses and administer oaths or other appropriate declarations.</P>
    <P>Should provision be made for some form of <i>ex parte</i> procedures in an appropriate case, albeit an extreme one?  I am not generally well disposed to such procedures but they can be valuable in seeking to gather evidence.  Under these procedures the authority, on its own motion and subject to court approval, would be able to intervene and acquire the information it requires for the proper investigation of a complaint or matter it is seeking to refer to the director.  It is often difficult to obtain information from big corporations which have the ability to conceal information.  I do not mean to impute malice but such corporations have the resources to make it difficult to obtain information at the right time.</P>
    <P>Of all the issues which arise under this legislation the most fundamental is the persistent discrimination against disabled persons in terms of access to buildings in public use.  In the course of his long consultations with the vintners has the Minister raised the question of access for disabled persons to licensed premises?  It seems that disabled persons and those with disabilities encounter difficulties in gaining access.  I do not know if the Minister has to complete his consultations with the industry but this matter should be looked at.  As I understand it, the legislation imposes no absolute obligation on the private sector, I assume for reasons of cost.</P>
    <P>I commend the legislation and renew my good wishes to the Minister for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill I extend my good wishes to the Minister.  I am delighted that various matters, the source of much contention due mainly to misunderstandings, have been put to rest.  It is important to outlaw in legislation <Col N="1191" /> as many forms of discrimination as possible.  It is equally important to try to change people's mindsets.</P>
      <P>The original proposals relating to public houses caused many misunderstandings.  Happily this difficulty has been resolved.  I am sure Members would not consider that anybody, irrespective of their ethnic origin, should be excluded from any place.  However, most public houses bar certain people from their premises, usually locals, for justifiable reasons which, for legal reasons, may be difficult to explain.  For that reason I am delighted the matter has been laid to rest.  A customer who is willing to be well behaved has a right of entry to any public place and it is appropriate that right will now be enshrined in law.  I also welcome the important provisions dealing with sexual harassment. It is appropriate that they will also be enshrined in law and that people will be protected from that type of unacceptable behaviour.</P>
      <P>It will be difficult to outlaw insidious, indirect and various other forms of discrimination in legislation. I have noticed actions proposed regarding the housing of certain groups where at times some more favoured groups can be quite adept at using all types of laws to stymie provisions.  Some of those who are most vociferous in condemning discrimination tend to be the quickest to use those devices to protect their interests when they are challenged.  Communities which have been most accommodating in facilitating, say, the travelling community often make the complaint that they are not willing to carry the full burden.  We must be fair in dealing with this matter.  Communities have an equal responsibility to ensure that all sections and areas of society are willing to accommodate the provision of housing for travellers.  That is not the position at present. People with the greatest material endowment tend to be the most ingenious in devising indirect ways to ensure travellers are housed in every-body's back yard except theirs.  We must be honest about this.  This major difficulty is one of a mindset with which we must deal.</P>
      <P>Other forms of discrimination are not covered in the Bill.  They include discrimination in regard to attaining professional qualifications.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment recently.  Professional bodies purposely put up barriers to prevent, say, foreign nationals gaining access to professions to protect their professions from outsiders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Language barriers have been erected by the medical profession which insists that doctors from the Third World and other countries outside the EU must complete an English language test, although EU nationals are not compelled to do so.  It is extraordinary that a doctor from the United States of America must complete an English language test but a doctor from Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Germany or France need not.  If language is a requirement for a job, surely English language tests should be completed by those who come from countries where <Col N="1192" /> English is not the lingua franca and the decision as to who should complete one should not be made on an arbitrary geographic basis.  That type of discrimination is unacceptable and should be tackled.</P>
    <P>There is also discrimination on age grounds and that must be tackled.  In some cases people are not allowed to apply for jobs because they are over a certain age.  That type of discrimination is becoming more apparent as people in late middle age become redundant, particularly in the public service.  It is unacceptable that anybody, irrespective of the arguments put forward about pensions and so on, should be discriminated against on age grounds.  If a person is of an age to do a job, it is not right that an upper or lower age limit should be set for access to that job, particularly if he or she has a remaining work life of up to 20 years. Those unnecessary rules and regulations are discriminatory and should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>A discrimination that arises in my part of the world concerns a group that is often forgotten, the Irish speaking minority.  It is amazing that the Government has not introduced any proposals to deal with discrimination on the grounds of language. I have said on other occasions that if we want to show our fellow people in the northern part of this country a society free from discrimination, we must first consider how we treat our minorities, travellers, Irish speakers or any other linguistic or ethnic minority.  Despite the official love-in between the State and the Irish language over 70 years, there are still monoglots in my constituency to which people close their eyes and do not believe exist.  We have monoglot older people aged from 70 to 90 in my constituency who have very limited or no knowledge of English.  They are habitually sent to old people's homes where nobody is able to speak to them in basic Irish. Over the years we have highlighted cases where, for example, people in hospitals have looked for deoch uisce and none of the staff knew what they wanted.  That is unsatisfactory and intolerable.  As people become old and senile they tend to revert to the language of their home and youth, it is wrong that we pride ourselves on having a love for the Irish language and providing services. Even if we did not have a policy on the Irish language, surely we should provide a basic linguistic requirement for our citizens?</P>
    <P>When Irish speaking parents have to seek help for their children who have language difficulties and require speech therapy, which arises irrespective of what language is spoken in the home, they find that none of those services is available through the Irish language.  That is unsatisfactory. I am often amazed that people who come back to Connemara and mix with the ordinary people discover that they use Irish as their every day form of communication and that it is the language with which they feel at ease.  It is discriminatory that we refuse to provide services in the language which those people feel most comfortable using, and that should be addressed.  I hope the Minister for Equality and Law Reform as his last act <Col N="1193" /> before retiring will persuade his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, of the necessity to set down in statute people's basic fundamental right to speak their language.  There is no point in having a constitutional provision, if we are not prepared to tackle the problems faced by our people.  Lest people think this is not an issue I estimate there are probably 100,000 people who habitually use Irish in the Gaeltacht area in which I live.  The vast majority of people from Furbo to Carna, along with a number in north Connemara if given a free choice of services through the medium of the Irish or English language will always choose the service provided through Irish.  The older people tend to have very little English because of the school system that operated.  Therefore, one finds people with very limited knowledge of spoken English who find it easier to read and write in Irish because they were never given much tuition in English.  Of course, they learned to read Irish with the séimhiúis and now experience difficulty in reading the new Roman script.  That is not a problem for the younger generation.</P>
    <P>There is often a preference for using Irish as the language of communication.  I can testify to this in the course of my constituency work, where some people communicate with me only in Irish. Anybody who ever sits in my clinic in Maam Cross on a Saturday will know that people from the English speaking area speak English and those from the Irish speaking areas speak Irish. There is an obligation on the State to ensure that good, efficient services through the medium of Irish are provided for this large number of people.  In Connemara one may be talking about some 20,000 people, a significant minority who are entitled to their basic humanitarian and linguistic rights irrespective of any national feeling for the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I do not intend going into the detailed provisions of this complex Bill but it is good that we have travelled this far.  There has been a range of practices that most of us in rural areas have found very strange, particularly discrimination reminiscent of the 19th century against women in such places as golf clubs.  Because of a shortage of numbers, in certain respects rural Ireland has been much freer of that type of discrimination. We must call on all members of our community to assemble a crowd for most activities and men and women mix actively and freely.  We have not experienced the crazy demarcations between various groups.  The concept of tennis or golf clubs not admitting women members is archaic and out of tune with the times in which we live.</P>
    <P>What would have been perceived as a male bastion, the GAA, has recently been opened up, although men and women always were involved at local club level.  The GAA has now opened up the playing area where women's Gaelic football is probably the fastest growing women's sport nationwide, being treated more and more equally <i>vis-á-vis</i> men's football, something we all welcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> We were aghast a number of years ago when a young girl, I think in Bray County Wicklow, had to take a case to court to establish her right to play on a juvenile team.  I am proud to relate that in my part of the world last year a young girl played and won a medal in the under 14s local football team.  Playing along-side 14 young fellows, she was one of the star players.  This has never posed a problem in rural areas.  This is the way we should go.  We must do away with demarcation and unnatural divisions between people remembering that, at the end of the day, we are all fellow human beings.</P>
    <P>I want to revert to the huge issue of travellers in my constituency.  I pay tribute to those members of the travelling community making so much effort among their people, working to combat anti-social behaviour.  A huge number of travellers want to be fully integrated into society.  The vast majority of them I know are willing to play their full part, on an equal basis, with everybody else in society.  It is totally unfair to criticise or discriminate against any group because of the actions of a minority within it, which unfortunately is what has happened.  We must cease to patronise travellers.  In the final analysis, the solution to their problem must rest with them.  They must decide whether they want to fully integrate in society or continue to live as a separate group within society.  They have a right to choose.  To suggest otherwise would be to patronise them and initiate a subtle form of discrimination; patronage of that type can be as debilitating and discriminatory as many other forms of discrimination.  Given the wherewithal, the responsibility for their own development, accompanied by full support on an equal basis, they have a huge contribution to make to enriching our society and playing a full part in it.</P>
    <P>We must work with all groups, listen to what they have to say, stop prescribing answers and, instead, ascertain what answers they have to their own problems.  We must also work with them to improve their quality of life and differentiate between ethnic differences and changes in social habits.  As I have already pointed out, the people of Inishmaan and the Aran Islands are no less Irish-speaking now, because they live in modern houses, have water, sanitation, electricity, television, telephones and all modern conveniences, than they were some 30 or 40 years ago when none of those facilities existed.  They are no less an identifiable group with a culture of their own because they have, quite rightly, adapted to all the changes in society over the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of the travelling community, we must differentiate between real culture, values and differences between them and the settled community and changes which have taken place in the physical world in which they live.  We hope they will adapt to changes needed whether it be in settled housing, in new ways of dealing with the industries or businesses in which they are involved, so that they can become full partners in society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank all Members for their very gracious remarks to me on my forthcoming retirement from public political life.  I appreciate those comments by Members from all sides of the House; they certainly are heart-warming.  I have enjoyed my period as a Minister.  I hope I have made a contribution, I certainly did my best toward that end.  I will still be around in politics, not in a public way, but will continue to assist in every way that I possibly can.</P>
      <P>I also thank Deputies for their wide-ranging and positive comments on the Bill, which is a landmark in the fight for greater equality in Irish society.  Equality is a broad concept and Deputies have touched on various aspects of it.  The Bill specifies eight or nine categories but I do not suggest that is a comprehensive list &mdash; other categories can and should be tackled and I have no doubt they will be in the fullness of time.  Deputy Ó Cuív highlighted the question of language, a matter on which I would be supportive, and there are many others.</P>
      <P>The Bill covers much ground and a broad range of areas outside the context of employment. Together with the Employment Equality Bill, these measures will give Ireland a modern, comprehensive anti-discrimination code which will be among the best in the world.  The country will be proud of it.  This Bill has the potential to affect the lives of many people.  It is not concerned with arcane or technical issues &mdash; it applies to everyday matters such as entertainment and leisure, sporting facilities, access to credit and obtaining accommodation.  It is based on the simple principle that no one should be denied access to such facilities or amenities simply because of a prejudice or a stereotype.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGahon asked Deputy McDaid whether, in his practice as a doctor, he should not have a right to refuse someone access to his surgery for a variety of reasons.  Deputy McGahon is right &mdash; people have the right to refuse a person, but &ldquo;variety of reasons&rdquo; is the operative phrase.  This Bill provides that one does not have the right to refuse someone for the sole reason that the colour of his or her skin is black, because the person is a woman or because of age, disability, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to apparent discrepancies between this Bill and the Employment Equality Bill.  As the two Bills will operate in different spheres it is not surprising that there are such differences.  A significant part of the <Col N="1196" /> Employment Equality Bill has been influenced by the need to transpose EU gender equality directives, case law and related treaty obligations into Irish legislation.  No similar constraints apply to the Equal Status Bill.  There are also differences of presentation as the two Bills represent distinct drafting styles.  I will, however, give careful consideration to the views expressed and will further examine the Bill in the light of these views.</P>
    <P>Deputies mentioned the timescale for the making of regulations on transport accessibility, which we all agree to be extremely important.  Such regulations will have to be carefully drafted, having regard to technical and EU considerations and with a view to meeting the needs of people with disabilities in the most cost-effective way.  I cannot say at this stage when exactly such regulations might be put into effect but an examination of that question will be made as soon as the Bill has passed into law.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDaid referred to the use of language in legislation in a way which discriminates against women.  I was responsible for the Interpretation (Amendment) Act, 1993, which corrected the inequality which had existed in this area.  In response to his slightly critical comment about the use of verbiage in a Labour Party Bill, I remind him that his party's record in the equality area has not been too happy on a number of occasions.  I have referred before to a Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice who, regrettably, appointed an all-male Legal Aid Board, which I rectified at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh said the Bill had the signs of being rushed so that it could be enacted before the general election.  She is very much at odds with bodies representative of the categories which will be protected by this Bill, who have been concerned at the delay &mdash; unavoidable, as far as I am concerned &mdash; in proceeding with the Bill.  I assure her that those groups want this Bill enacted as soon as possible so that it is not subject to further uncertainty.  It was considered over a long period and a great deal of thought went into its provisions.  I am pleased at the extent of support for the Bill from all sides of the House and I know I will receive co-operation from Deputy McDaid and Deputy Keogh in securing its passage into law at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh raised the question of sexual orientation.  I can confirm that I will move an amendment to define this on Committee Stage. She described section 5 (3) (d) as &ldquo;mind-boggling&rdquo;. This paragraph deals with services of an aesthetic, cosmetic or similar nature and is intended to cover services of establishments such as hairdressing and beauty salons which traditionally have been offered to persons of one gender only at particular establishments.  I do not propose to make this unlawful and I wonder whether Deputy Keogh would.  She also criticised subsection 5(3)(k) which provides that, in a dramatic performance or entertainment, certain distinctions are acceptable.  This is totally reasonable. The point about exceptions like these is that the <Col N="1197" /> Bill generally prohibits less favourable treatment, therefore we need to have exceptions for those cases of different treatment which are not regarded as unacceptable, otherwise they too would be unlawful.</P>
    <P>As to the limitation period, the Deputy drew attention to section 21 (2) (a) which provides that the complainant should notify the respondent of the alleged prohibited conduct within two months of the incident.  She suggested there was no limitation for the referral of complaints to the director of equality investigations.  In fact, section 21(1) makes section 41 of the Employment Equality Bill applicable to equal status cases and this section provides for a six-month limitation period along with discretion to extend it.</P>
    <P>Regarding exemptions for insurance and genetic testing, I will consider the points made by Deputies about the exception in section 5(3)(e). However, apart from health insurance, the insurance and assurance business does not function on the basis of community rating.  I take the point that life expectancy varies far more within the genders for non-gender reasons than it does between men and women and there is a difficulty of principle in attributing group characteristics to the individual.</P>
    <P>Exclusions on the lines of section 5(3)(e) exist in other countries, for example in Britain with regard to sex.  The insurance company must satisfy the Director of Equality Investigations on the nature of the data it is using to justify different treatment.  It will not be a case of people proving anything by the selective use of statistics. If the insurance company wishes to avail of that subsection it must satisfy the Director of Equality Investigations that the statistical and actuarial data on which it proposes to rely is acceptable. This would have to be established to the satisfaction of the independent officer hearing the application.  It would not be a matter of the company's say so.  The officer and the complainant and its representative would have the opportunity to probe reliability and ascertain if the statistical material tendered was appropriate and valid and what force it should be given.</P>
    <P>Genetic testing as a predictor of certain illnesses would have to be considered in this light also.  While I will consider the Deputy's points I do not believe it will be possible for me to significantly amend this provision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan referred to section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Bill and how it related to this Bill.  The section deals with the employment of teachers and so on, whereas section 7 of this Bill deals with access to schools and their facilities.</P>
    <P>I dealt in great detail with the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; under the Employment Equality Bill. The definition here is, in essence, the same as in that Bill.  The intention is to give the widest possible protection to the widest possible range of people with disabilities.  A disability which may exist in the future or which is imputed to a person <Col N="1198" /> is covered.  In this respect I refer Deputy Keogh to section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies rightly referred to the problems which people with disability have in gaining access to buildings.  I indicated that I would give consideration to the inclusion of a reasonable accommodation provision in the Bill. The inclusion of such a provision will go a long way towards meeting Deputies' concerns on this issue.</P>
    <P>Important issues such as the right to refuse admission, the position on registering clubs, the equality authority, etc., were also raised by a number of Deputies.  I look forward to dealing with these in detail on Committee Stage.  I thank Deputies for their constructive, informed and supportive contributions.</P>

      <P>This is an important issue to the town of Drogheda.  It has been on the agenda for some time with officials in the Department of Education and the Minister has capitulated to them in their attempts to abolish a number of vocational education committees and amalgamate others.</P>
      <P>Drogheda is one of the largest vocational education committees in the country, yet the Minister proposes to merge it with County Louth vocational education committee.  While it may be the smallest county, Louth has the difficult problem of long-term unemployment.  Recent figures show that unemployment in the north-east and especially in County Louth are higher than elsewhere, including Dublin.</P>
      <P>However, this move is not only seen as the removal of the vocational education committee but a downgrading of a town the size of Drogheda.  The town and its catchment form an area far greater than other areas with vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> This is an anti-democratic move.  It illustrates the tendency of the Minister to centralise everything into bigger units.  Fianna Fáil is vehemently opposed to the regional structures which the Minister is putting in place as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for abolishing some of the vocational education committees. My party favours the vocational education committee structure.</P>
    <P>Some Government Deputies, including Deputy Bell, have been saying that Fianna Fáil proposed the abolition of Drogheda vocational education committee when it was in Government.  That is a political lie.  A proposal was put forward by officials when Fianna Fáil was in Government but it was rejected by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey.</P>
    <P>The Minister has effectively given in to her officials.  By contrast, Fianna Fáil in Government was able to withstand any such proposal because it was anti-democratic.  It is similar to what the Labour Party seeks to do by way of centralisation.</P>

      <P>The town of Drogheda vocational education committee was established pursuant to the enactment of the 1931 vocational education committee legislation.  It is a significant vocational education committee and one of the seven town vocational education committees, as they are classified.  It has a population catchment of approximately 70,000 people and caters for students in the south County Louth, east County Meath and north Dublin catchment.  Approximately 1,690 second level students attend Saint Oliver's and Saint Laurence's Colleges and approximately 1,900 participate under the adult education vocational education committee structure.</P>
      <P>Given its proximity to Dublin, Drogheda has effectively become a dormitory town for the greater Dublin area.  As a measure of the success of the colleges under its aegis, a student achieved seven grade As in his leaving certificate.  The vocational education committee provides Youthreach, VTOS and Plc courses and back-up services for 22 voluntary organisations in the catchment area.  It is community driven, has close links with industry and responsibility for the administration of school transport in the area. Recently it has forged links with universities in the North and the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The town of Drogheda vocational education committee does not compare with the other vocational education committees in the country. Drogheda is the second largest provincial town in the country but does not have a regional technical college.  To maintain the status of the vocational <Col N="1200" /> education committee system the town of Drogheda vocational education committee needs to be retained.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the decision to effectively abolish it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you and the Deputies for affording me the opportunity to reply to this debate on behalf of the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education <i>Charting our Education Future</i> sets out Government policy in relation to the rationalisation of vocational education committees.  It states that legislation will be introduced to amend the Vocational Education Acts which will, <i>inter alia</i>, provide for the retention and rationalisation of the vocational education committees within the new education board structure.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the White Paper proposals, a Commission on School Accommodation Needs was established, the first task of which was to examine the existing vocational education committee structure and to report and make recommendations on the rationalisation of vocational education committees.  The commission consisted of a large &mdash; 34 member &mdash; steering group representative of the partners in education and a technical working group which prepared reports for the steering group.</P>
      <P>The report of the steering group was published on 11 October 1996.  While the report of the technical working group recommended that following the process of rationalisation the number of vocational education committees should stand at 18, the steering group's report came down in favour of a final figure of 21.</P>
      <P>The principal recommendations of the steering group are that the number of vocational education committees be rationalised to 21, the first phase of which would be the amalgamation, by ministerial order, of the five urban district vocational education areas &mdash; Bray, Drogheda, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford &mdash; with their respective country vocational education committees as provided for in the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  The second phase would include the making of ministerial orders for the amalgamation of further vocational education committees, following amendment of the 1930 Act; the rationalised committees restructured in terms of their composition, term of office, powers and responsibilities; and a mechanism established for reviewing the numbers of vocational education committees in the light of demographic needs and developments in educational provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following consideration of the report of the steering group of the commission on accommodation, the Government decided the process of rationalisation of vocational education committees would commence with the making of ministerial orders to amalgamate the five town vocational education committees &mdash; Bray, Drogheda, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford &mdash; with their respective county vocational education committees, <Col N="1201" /> as provided for under section 100 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  This decision was announced on 15 October 1996.  The Minister signed the orders on 21 February 1997 and they will come into effect on 1 January 1998.</P>
    <P>To ensure these amalgamations proceed smoothly a facilitation process has been put in place. Mr. Micheál Breathnach, a former chief executive officer with County Wicklow vocational education committee, has been appointed facilitator.</P>
    <P>Local committees representing the five towns will be retained until the next local elections. Final decisions on further amalgamations will be taken in the context of amending the vocational education legislation.</P>

      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise the extremely important and urgent matter of the closure of the Advanced Technology College in Merrion Square where 500 students have been left high and dry.  This is a failure on the part of the Government to deliver on the promise to regulate the private education sector.</P>
      <P>At 3.30 p.m. yesterday the Advanced Technology College went into examinership.  Its 500 students were turned away from the college and are effectively locked out.  Neither the students, the 20 lecturers nor the other staff has any idea what the future holds.  Some of the college students have paid almost £6,000 to study for their qualifications in photography, graphics and computer programming.</P>
      <P>Earlier today I spoke to the mother of one of the students.  She was extremely angry and distressed. Her son was only three months from his City and Guilds qualification, for which he had put in a considerable amount of hard work over many long hours.  What is this young man to do now?  Is he likely to reap any benefit from his years of study?  Will the Minister ensure that he and his fellow students find alternative education accommodation so that each can qualify in the courses they have been pursuing?  Will the Minister accept she could have averted this turn of events if she had kept the promise collectively given by her Cabinet colleagues in the programme, A Government of Renewal, and introduced new laws to regulate private education?  In its programme, the rainbow Government spelled out its commitment to provide &ldquo;Legislation to regulate private education to ensure proper educational standards, consumer protection and employee rights&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is there no such legislation from the Minister's Department?  Why has the Minister misspent her time setting up new layers of bureaucracy in Irish education rather than honour her commitment three years ago to ensure events such as the examinership of the Advanced Technology College did not happen?  Did she learn nothing from the closure of Newman College two years ago?  The aspirations in the programme, A <Col N="1202" /> Government of Renewal, ring hollow.  The Minister has run a coach and four through the students' rights to consumer protection and the rights of the college employees.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to outline how she proposes to address the immediate needs of the staff and students of the college and how the commitment to regulate the private education sector will be honoured.  Of paramount importance in all this are the students standing out in the rain.  They must be accommodated and reassured about their future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you and your office and the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to reply on behalf of the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>I express my sympathy for the position of the students affected by the Advanced Technology College being placed in receivership.  It is important that I set out clearly the position of the college.</P>
      <P>Under section 20 of the National Council for Educational Awards Act, 1979, the Minister for Education may, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, and after consultation with the NCEA, designate an educational institution other than a university as being an institution to which the NCEA Act applies.  A number of private commercial colleges have been designed under the NCEA Act.</P>
      <P>The Advanced Technology College is a private commercial college.  It is not in receipt of Exchequer funding and does not come under the aegis of the Department of Education.  It is not a designated institution for the purposes of the National Council for Educational Awards Act, 1979, and none of its courses is validated by the NCEA.</P>
      <P>The Minister has established and published a code of standards for the approval of colleges for the purposes of tax relief.  The Advanced Technology College is not on the list of approved colleges for the purposes of tax relief.  Therefore, the Minister has no role or responsibility in relation to the Advanced Technology College.  The position in relation to private commercial colleges, as set out in the White Paper, <i>Charting our Education Future</i>, is that: &ldquo;In future, such institutions running courses which receive State certification for their awards will be subject to new control regulations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is important to regulate such colleges to provide guarantees for the academic integrity of the courses being offered, the institutional standards and the financial investment of students.  The White Paper sets out the parameters of the control procedures which will be the responsibility of Teastas, the Irish National Certification Authority. These regulations will apply only to private commercial colleges which seek State certification for their courses.  In this regard the Advanced Technology College does not have State certification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister established a working group to advise her in relation to the codes of standards to <Col N="1203" /> be applied for the purposes of approving private colleges and courses for tax relief purposes under section 6 of the Finance Act, 1995.  The group examined the issues of academic and financial bonding and consumer protection and concluded that such provisions should not be incorporated in the codes of standards but should be pursued separately by the Department in association with Teastas and the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
    <P>The Department is considering the first report by Teastas, the national certification authority. The report presents the initial proposals and recommendations of the board on a national qualifications framework and the organisational structure for Teastas.  It also seeks to inform the Minister on the progress made during the extensive consultative process and on the complexity of the task. The key issues in relation to the development of a national qualifications framework are quality assurance, accreditation, access, progression and mobility and international recognition.</P>
    <P>The Department has commenced discussions with Teastas on the system of approval for institutions seeking State certification.  This will encompass issues in relation to financial and academic bonding.  The Minister understands that a number of NCEA designated private colleges represented by the Higher Education Colleges Association are developing proposals for academic and financial bonding for consideration in the context of decisions about the future framework.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter as it would be wrong if the House did not recognise this landmark day in terms of social policy and welcome the coming into force of the divorce legislation. For the thousands of casualties of broken marriages this is a particularly important day as it extends to many the possibility and hope of legalising second relationships and to others recognition by the law that their marriages are at an end.</P>
      <P>It is approximately 25 years since I first called for the introduction of constitutional changes to allow for divorce.  I am very pleased to see the fruits of the referendum held in November 1995 coming into operation.  The Government deserves to be congratulated for bringing us to this point. I would not like any of my remarks to take away from the congratulations it deserves for finally addressing this long outstanding social issue.</P>
      <P>I want to begin by making a declaration of interest, although my not doing so may not give rise to a difficulty.  It is no secret that I still wear my solicitor's hat outside the House and do a considerable amount of work in the family law area. I make this point lest anyone accuses me of having a vested interest in the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a practising lawyer who for many years has <Col N="1204" /> represented many people suffering the trauma of broken marriages, I am very anxious to ensure that people seeking divorce incur the minimum legal expense possible in resolving what for many is the final outstanding issue arising out of a broken marriage.  Many people have long since sorted out the consequences of the breakdown of their marriage and there will be no disputes about property, finance and how their children should be cared for.  In such cases the level of legal costs should be kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the recently published rules of the Circuit Court will unnecessarily add to the complexity of divorce proceedings and increase legal costs.  I want to make it clear that the rules have been put together by a committee and the Minister for Justice is not in any way at fault for this problem.  The rules and documents prescribed for the processing of divorce proceedings are ideal in cases where couples contest financial issues or where there are disputes about children.  The forms required will ensure that the maximum information is exchanged before any contentious issues have to be addressed by the courts.</P>
    <P>My concern relates to the thousands of cases where there are no contentious issues as the husbands and wives have sorted out their problems and many of them are in second relationships. The documentation requiring elaborate background information will impose a burden on those people by asking them to reveal and detail information in which neither of them is interested.  Such couples do not want to know the financial position of the other spouse and do not want to have to incur extra costs by requiring their solicitors to complete the drafts of complex documents which they must ultimately swear as affidavits.  In cases where divorces are not contested, where couples have been living apart for many years and where neither wishes to raise financial issues of contention there should be a simpler documentary format for processing divorce proceedings.  I ask the Minister to request the Circuit Court rules committee to reconsider this matter.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that the number of divorce cases will increase during 1997.  If we do not put in place by 1998 new court structures and implement the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on the reform of courts and the manner in which they deal with family cases the courts could face gridlock in terms of dealing with divorce cases and granting divorce decrees within a reasonable period of time.</P>
    <P>Consideration must be given to the urgent implementation of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and, in so doing, to give courts dealing with divorce cases and other family problems the necessary back-up welfare services which are badly required and which are recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  Such services are of particular importance in cases involving allegations of domestic violence or disputes <Col N="1205" /> about the custody and well-being of children.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for raising this matter.  It is appropriate that someone of his status and standing in the family law area should raise this matter on the day the Family Law (Divorce) Act comes into operation.  He is continuing his interest and involvement in the courts and how they deal with family law.</P>
      <P>The hearing of family law cases in the courts is a matter of great concern to me and I am committed to ensuring that all cases are dealt with in the most effective and efficient way possible.  The Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, which came into operation today, provides that the Circuit Court shall, concurrently with the High Court, have jurisdiction to hear and determine proceedings under the Act and shall, in relation to that jurisdiction, be known as the Circuit Family Court.</P>
      <P>The Circuit Court Divorce Rules also came into operation today.  These rules provide for procedures in relation to making applications to the Circuit Court under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  They also specify the forms to be used in the various applications.  I assure Deputy Shatter that I will raise with the rules committee the points made by him.  I received draft High Court Divorce Rules from the Superior Court Rules Committee on 21 February last.  These are being examined by my Department and I hope they will be ready for publication next week.  Court rules will also be required for the District Court to deal with the enforcement of maintenance orders made under the legislation.  I understand that these rules are being drafted by the District Court Rules Committee.  As Deputy Shatter pointed out, the rules are prepared by another body and I just have an examination brief over them.  The rules are made by those committees.</P>
      <P>A training programme for court managers and staff on recent family law legislation, with particular emphasis on the Divorce Act, 1996, has been initiated.  This programme, in addition to providing information on the legislation, deals with rules of court and procedure for processing family law applications, including applications for divorce.</P>
      <P>A total of eight new courtrooms are under construction in the former Richmond Hospital and Riverbank Theatre.  These courtrooms will become available in April or May.  It is my Department's policy that a family suite, consisting of a courtroom, two consultation rooms and two waiting areas, will be provided in major towns as part of the courts building programme.  These facilities have already been provided in such places as Galway, Cork, Clonmel, Ballina and Ballinasloe over the past few years.  They will also be available at the refurbished courthouse in Naas and the new one at Carrick-on-Shannon due to open for business in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> The issue of family courts is also being considered by the working group on a courts commission, under the chairmanship of the Honourable Mrs. Justice Susan Denham.  I understand the working group will take the report of the Law Reform Commission on family courts into account in its deliberations.  Deputy Shatter is absolutely right in urging that it does so because there is some very good advice in that report.</P>
    <P>The provision of modern accommodation is just one of a number of areas which I will address in order to improve the operation of our courts system.  I have also increased the number of judges and support staff to expedite access to the courts.</P>
    <P>On 1 January 1995, just before I took over, there was a legislative provision for the appointment of 86 judges, that is, five Supreme Court judges, 17 High Court judges, 18 Circuit Court judges and 46 District Court judges.  Today there is legislative provision for the appointment of 107 judges, that is, eight Supreme Court judges, 20 High Court judges, 28 Circuit Court judges and 51 District Court judges.  To date, all but five of these posts have been filled.  There are currently 26 judges serving in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently in touch with the Department of Finance on the question of further additional support staff to cater for the expected increase in court business resulting from the implementation of the divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>I have confidence that the measures I have taken, including the appointment of the additional judges and support staff to all courts, will provide the courts with the necessary resources to deal effectively with delays in the hearing of family law cases and assist in the prompt disposal of such cases in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Batt O'Keeffe and I for a considerable period of time have raised the grave need for the Deputy State Pathologist to be based in the southern region, which was illustrated by the Sophie du Plantier case in west Cork.  That the body was not examined by the pathologist until 24 hours after it was discovered meant the body temperature was irrelevant.  This, in turn, meant that the time of death could not be ascertained.  This country has received a considerable amount of poor publicity on this matter in Europe, particularly in France.  That criticism is justified because the body should have been examined by a pathologist earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tragically, there was another violent death yesterday in County Kerry.  There was also a long delay until that body was examined by a pathologist. This clearly inhibits the prosecuting authorities in their role.  However, it is also a cause of tremendous distress to the families of victims.  It is inhumane to leave a body lying in a field exposed to the elements for a long period.  The situation is already bad enough for the families of <Col N="1207" /> victims, their grief is heavy in their hearts, without having to carry the terrible burden of the knowledge that the body of their loved one is left exposed to the elements.  That is too much to ask any human being to bear.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious the Deputy State Pathologist needs to be located in the southern region.  There are in excess of 50 post mortems every year outside the greater Dublin region, which is borne out by the 1996 figures.  Last year the State Pathologist cried out for help for his Department.  He stated that the loss of Dr. Margaret Bolster, the then temporary Deputy State Pathologist, would be a grave loss to his department.  She resigned because she was not appointed permanently by the Department of Justice.  Apparently, she would only have been appointed if she had decided to move to Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is hard to understand all this.  In a recent report to the Director of Public Prosecutions' office it was stated that long delays in the provision of forensic reports which may be of considerable importance in deciding whether there should be a prosecution were a relevant factor in delays in some court cases.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious there is a need to locate the Deputy State Pathologist in the southern region. There is tremendous anger about the delay in examining the body of the young man in Tralee. The Minister stated she can see no good reason to regionalise the pathology service.  She also stated in a letter to me that she did not think it would help the service to do so.  I earnestly ask her to reconsider her position in the light of recent experiences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated in the House that it was important for the media to respect the dead.  It is also important that the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government respect the dead.  I am very dissatisfied that we have not learned any lessons from the debacle which occurred with the death of Madame du Plantier in west Cork due to the fact that 24 hours elapsed before the State Pathologist arrived on the scene.</P>
      <P>Less than two months later, there has been a very serious murder in Kerry of a young lad whose body was left lying in a field in bitter cold and lashing rain.  The family had to endure, on top of all the agony they were already suffering, the sight of that young man's body waiting for 12 hours before the State Pathologist arrived.  Was that necessary?  Should that ever have been repeated?  The obvious answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  It is vitally important for a pathologist to arrive at the scene of a crime at the earliest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite ironic that somebody with the qualifications of Dr. Bolster, who served as a temporary Deputy State Pathologist, whose expertise and experience Dr. Harbison lauded in his report and who was suggested by him as being more than suitable for a full time position, would have to resign that position when she could not be given <Col N="1208" /> a permanent post.  Why was Dr. Bolster not asked to attend in Tralee this week?  She could have been there within an hour and a half of the murder being made known.</P>
    <P>Why, given that almost one third of the murders which occurred in this country last year were committed in the Munster region, will the Minister not regionalise this post?  Is it not the intellectual capacity, knowledge and experience of the State Pathologist which is important at any crime scene?  In the interests of humanity, it is time for the Minister to ensure that this post is regionalised and taken out of Dublin so that people can be assured that such delays will not occur again and the families involved will not have to experience such inhumanity again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter and express my sympathy to the families of those who have lost their lives as a result of tragic, criminal activities in recent months.  It is more difficult to deal with this issue when investigations into crimes are ongoing because I run the risk of sounding as if I am simply giving out information and not taking into account particular circumstances. Because post mortems and examinations of bodies are part of an investigation I cannot say a great deal about individual cases.</P>
      <P>I want to put on the record some facts about the State Pathology Service which I believe are not fully clear to many people.  I thought they would be clear to those in this House but from what I have just heard, they are obviously not.  I do not mean to lecture the Deputies opposite but it is important people understand this service.</P>
      <P>Dr. John Harbison was appointed State Pathologist in 1974 under contract to the Attorney General. He was transferred to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions when that office was set up in 1975.  I took over personal responsibility for the State Pathologist in July 1996, while the Minister for Health took on responsibility to provide him with a suitable office and laboratory. For 21 of the 22 years of this service the DPP was responsible for the State Pathologist.  His office continued to be financed by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions up to 31 December 1996.  It was not until this year's budget, with effect from 1 January 1997, that provision was made for him in Vote 19 of the Office of the Minister for Justice.  This new arrangement ended years of requests by Dr. Harbison to be brought under either the Department of Health or the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Finance, under Deputy Bertie Ahern as Minister, sanctioned a post of Deputy State Pathologist in June 1993 to be filled, first, on a temporary basis by a pathologist nominated by the State Pathologist, that person to hold the post pending, second, an appointment on a permanent basis by competition held by the Civil Service Commission.  It was not a case of me or anybody else telling Dr. Bolster she was acting in a temporary capacity and that, therefore, she <Col N="1209" /> could have the full-time job.  I am bound by the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    <P>No action was taken by the appropriate authority, the DPP until I became Minister, to implement this decision.  Officers of my Department and I met Dr. Harbison in 1995 and persuaded him to nominate a pathologist to be appointed on a temporary basis pending filling the permanent post by competition.  Dr. Margaret Bolster was nominated by the State Pathologist and held the temporary post from 16 June 1995 until 16 June 1996 based on conditions set out to her before she accepted the post, and she was paid by the DPP.</P>
    <P>Dr. Bolster resigned on 16 June 1996 because she was not prepared to do State pathology work in all parts of the country.  Recent indications are that she would work only in Munster.  Because the post was a temporary one Dr. Bolster also worked for at least two other institutions.  Deputy O'Keeffe wanted to know the reason Dr. Bolster has not been asked to carry out post mortems when Dr. Harbison is not available.  I am aware that since June of last year she has been asked to carry out post mortems and that, in some instances, she did not make herself available.  She may well have been able to do them in some instances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying she was asked in the Sophie Toscan du Plantier case but she has been asked.  Other pathologists have since been nominated by the State Pathologist to fill the post for short periods to cover post mortems, but currently there is no temporary Deputy State Pathologist, even though Dr. Harbison has been asked repeatedly by officers of my Department to nominate one.  It seems to be proving very difficult to get any suitably qualified person to take on the job on a temporary basis even though some pathologists are available on a once off basis.  A number of pathologists have done work in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as filling the post on a permanent basis is concerned, in July 1996 I initiated procedures to have the post filled by competition by the Civil Service Commission.  As this was the first time a State pathology post was being filled by open competition, detailed discussions were necessary with the State Pathologist and officers of the Departments of Finance and Health about the terms and conditions to be applied to the post.  In the event, the post was advertised by the Civil <Col N="1210" /> Service Commission on 16-17 January 1997.  The closing date for the competition is 6 March 1997.</P>
    <P>The case being made today and in the past is not so much the location of the central laboratory-office, etc., but to divide the country between the State Pathologist and the new Deputy State Pathologist, to draw a line across the centre of the country.  In 1996 the State Pathology Service carried out 100 post mortem examinations under section 33(2) of the Coroners Act, 1962.  Almost 50 per cent of those post mortems were in the Dublin region while the rest were spread fairly evenly throughout the country.  Any country, therefore, could have a call on this job. Given the geographical spread of the work both pathologists must be prepared to carry out post mortem examinations anywhere in the Twenty-six Counties as it is not possible to predict where their services will be required.  For this reason the post has been advertised as being based in Dublin with a countrywide commitment.  This does not preclude the successful applicant from living anywhere in the country outside Dublin provided they commit to a countrywide service.</P>
    <P>In July 1996 I also initiated discussions with representatives of my Department, the State Pathologist and the Department of Health about the provision of suitable accommodation &mdash; the current State Pathologist is working out of an office attached to Trinity College.  I am glad that substantial progress has been made on this matter and I am hopeful a new laboratory, office and ancillary services will be built on a site at Beaumont Hospital before the end of this year.  It is clear that because these facilities are being provided in Dublin the service will be based around them.  It would not be practical or economical to duplicate these full services in two separate locations.  Post mortems are carried out throughout the country by the State Pathologist. Although the current State Pathologist is based in Dublin, 50 per cent of his work is often carried out in various locations outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am inquiring into the circumstances of the two recent post mortems but as they form part of ongoing investigations I am not in a position to comment specifically on them.  I have again urged Dr. Harbison to nominate a deputy to carry out post mortems when he is not readily available, pending the appointment of a permanent deputy by the Civil Service Commission.  I have asked the Garda Commissioner to ensure that gardaí at the scene of a crime are fully informed as to the actions necessary when the services of a pathologist are required.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 4 March 1997.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Garda authorities recently carried out a review of the structure of the specialist units attached to Garda headquarters and the central detective unit at Harcourt Square.  This <Col N="1212" /> review came about as a result of trends emerging in regard to different forms of criminal activity.  As a result of this review the expertise and resources available to these individual units have been combined to form the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation under the control of a chief superintendent.  The resources of this unit will be available to investigate any serious crime, including murder, should a district officer require it.  Of course, this is in addition to the existing specialist services available in the form of fingerprint, ballistic, photography and forensic expertise at Garda Headquarters.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the new bureau is under the control of the Assistant Commissioner responsible for all crime related matters.  Given the link between different forms of criminal activity the expertise of other specialist Garda units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, which are also under the control of the aforementioned Assistant Commissioner, can be called upon to assist in any investigation throughout the country where expertise in any of these areas is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>I think it best to begin by explaining what is meant by the term &ldquo;unlawfully at large&rdquo;.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1960, under which most offenders are granted temporary release, provides that an offender who breaches a condition of his temporary release is deemed to be &ldquo;unlawfully at large&rdquo;.  The breach, however, may be of a relatively minor technical nature, such as failing to sign on at the correct time or failing to reside at a particular location.  Only a very small proportion would be escapees from a closed institution or a prison escort.</P>
      <P>As of Monday, 24 February 1997, the total cumulative number of persons classed as unlawfully at large was 1,323.  The corresponding figure for 23 February 1996 was 1,243.  On 4 September 1995, the earliest date in respect of which this information is available, the figure was 1,020.  The number of offenders who failed to return from temporary release at Christmas and who remained at large on 25 February 1997, was 23.</P>
      <P>All instances where offenders fail to return to their institution following a period of temporary release, or abscond or escape are immediately reported to the gardaí who may arrest such individuals without warrant and return them to custody. Offenders in this category, some of whom may have been at large for some time, are regularly returned to the prisons by the gardaí.  These procedures apply equally to all offenders who are at large, including those who failed to return at Christmas 1996.</P>

      <P>The number of women recruited to the Garda Síochána in the period 1994 to 1996 is as follows: 1994, 112; 1995, 69; 1996, 90.</P>
      <P>Admission to the Garda Síochána is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and is governed by the provisions of the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations, 1988.  Article 9 of those regulations requires the Commissioner, in conformity with employment equality legislation, to assess, in relation to each recruitment competition &mdash; or intake from each competition &mdash; for Garda trainees, the requirements of the force as regards certain specific posts.  This includes posts required to be filled by persons of a particular sex by reason of the nature of the duties of those posts, in particular where such duties necessitate the carrying out of personal searches or the interviewing of persons in connection with the investigation of sexual offences.  In practice, the gender profiles of student intakes to the Garda college is such that the number of male and female gardaí available to meet these specific requirements is more than adequate.</P>
      <P>Recruitment to the Garda Síochána is by means of an open competition conducted by the Civil Service Commission on behalf of the Garda authorities.  The Commission is an independent statutory body and candidates are selected on merit.  Both the Commission and the Garda authorities are committed to a policy of equal opportunity in employment.  I might add that the selection procedures for Garda recruitment will be reviewed prior to the next Garda recruitment competition.  An assessment of procedures in relation to equal treatment for candidates of both sexes will, of course, be an important aspect of that review.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the investment-based naturalisation scheme approved by the Government in 1994.  This scheme requires that an interdepartmental advisory group operating within terms of reference assess all applications for naturalisation based on investments in the State.  The terms of reference of the advisory group were announced to the House by my predecessor in answer to a parliamentary question on 25 October 1994.</P>
      <P>In 1996, 23 applications for naturalisation were processed in accordance with these terms of reference by my Department in conjunction with the advisory group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> In the same period, 11 persons were naturalised on foot of their investments in the State.  The applications for naturalisation of five of the persons who were naturalised in 1996 were assessed by the advisory group in that year and the other six were assessed by it in 1995.</P>
    <P>The applications for naturalisation of two persons were refused in 1996 because the persons in question did not comply with the terms of reference of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In relation to the remaining 16 cases assessed by the advisory group in 1996, four persons have been approved for naturalisation subject to making their investments, purchasing residences and so on.  They will be naturalised as soon as these matters have been finalised.  The remaining 12 cases assessed by the advisory group in 1996 have not yet been processed to the point where they can be submitted to me with a final recommendation from the group.</P>
    <P>I should also add for the information of the House that following a Government decision in September 1996, no new applications are being accepted by my Department pending the enactment of legislation to place the scheme on a statutory footing.  Work on preparing the legislation to give effect to this decision is under way in my Department.  The position of the applications before the Government decision in September 1996 is still being considered.</P>

      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities. They have informed me that the O'Connell <Col N="1216" /> Street area is policed by gardaí assigned to Store Street Garda station.  I understand that foot and mobile patrols are regularly carried out by both uniform and plain clothes personnel.  There are special foot patrols on O'Connell Street between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 a.m. and these are extended up to 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. at weekends. The divisional task force based at Fitzgibbon Street also patrols and responds to calls for assistance in O'Connell Street and its environs.  In addition, a special patrol van, which is assigned to Store Street Garda station and is equipped with a video camera, also operates in the O'Connell Street area.  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Office located in O'Connell Street is open to the public daily between the hours of 9 a.m. and midnight.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may already be aware that funding was provided as part of the anti-crime measures announced in July 1996, for the extension of the Garda closed circuit television system to the O'Connell Street area as an aid to policing.  Work on the system is at an advanced stage and it is expected to be operational shortly.  This system will cover O'Connell Street and adjoining streets in the north city centre area.  It is envisaged that when operational the system will greatly assist the gardaí in monitoring and detecting all forms of criminal activity in the areas in which the cameras are located.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities estimate that approximately 500,000 people pass through O'Connell Street each day.  There are many late night establishments in the general area and patrons going to and leaving such establishments frequently pass through O'Connell Street and occasionally incidents of disorder can occur.  However, I understand from the Garda authorities that any incidents of public disorder are monitored and dealt with by the local gardaí.  They have further informed me that they are satisfied that the current policing arrangements in place for the O'Connell Street area are adequate to meet its requirements and have assured me that the situation is monitored on a continuous basis and any necessary changes made.</P>

    <P>Although there is no vacancy in the Supreme Court at present, the Government has nominated Mr. Justice Henry Barron of the High Court to fill a vacancy that will arise there on 14 March 1997.  Arrangements will be made shortly for the filling of the resultant vacancy in the High Court. Also, the Courts Bill, 1997, which was published on 26 February 1997, provides for an increase of three in the maximum number of judges who may be appointed to the High Court.

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the proposals, if any, she has received from the private sector in relation to the prisons building programme; the way in which she has responded to each of those proposals; the date on which commencement of the new jail at Wheatfield can be expected; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Expressions of interest in the current accelerated prisons building programme were received from a broad spectrum of private sector interests in the building construction industry and associated enterprises.</P>
      <P>The proposals received covered various combinations of project design, construction, finance, prison operation and management, including lease back arrangements.  They also covered options in regard to conventional, pre-cast and containerised construction methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All proposals received in regard to the prisons building programme were acknowledged and brought to the attention of the inter-departmental group on the accelerated prisons programme under the chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Coveney, Minister of State at the Office of Public Works for assessment and evaluation.  The committee had representation from the Department of Finance, the Office of Public Works and my Department. The committee, in coming to its conclusions, considered a number of aspects including general suitability of the approach proposed <Col N="1221" /> for provision of prisons, speed and control of the planning and construction programmes and cost of capital financing.  It was decided that all projects should be Exchequer funded.</P>
    <P>In the case of Castlerea Main Prison and the new Remand Prison at Wheatfield a design-build option for procurement was preferred, while for the new Women's Prison beside Mountjoy, Curragh Prison, Unit A at Castlerea and the replacement block at Limeick Prison, the conventional method of inviting tenders for a fully designed facility was followed.  Selective tendering procedures are followed in respect of all projects under the prisons building programme.</P>
    <P>The proposed new remand prison at Wheatfield, to provide 400 places for male prisoners, is a major component of the overall accelerated prisons building programme which will provide over 800 additional places by the end of 1998.  Construction of this new facility is planned to commence in May-June this year and to be completed by the end of 1998.</P>

    <P>* It should be noted that the decisions taken in each year do not necessarily relate to applications made in those years. In addition to the decisions taken, a significant number of applications were withdrawn for various reasons in the years in question.</P>
    <P>At 31 December 1996 there were 1,396 cases awaiting determination with a further 31 cases at appeal.</P>
    <P>It has been the policy of successive Ministers for Justice not to disclose information on the nationality of asylum seekers or refugees having regard to the general and understandable desire on the part of individual applicants to ensure that an application for recognition as a refugee is processed in confidence.  As the number of applicants of some nationalities is small, it would be relatively easy in some instances to identify particular individuals if nationality statistics were provided. Such identification could have serious implications, particularly if members of an applicant's family are still in the country of origin.  Accordingly, I do not propose to depart from stated policy in this instance.</P>

      <P>The State pathologist or a pathologist nominated by him carried out 100 post mortems under section 33 (2) of the Coroners Act, 1962 in 1996.</P>
      <P>Almost 50 per cent of these post mortems are in the Dublin region, while the rest are spread throughout the country.  In these circumstances I consider that the deputy State pathologist must be prepared to carry out post mortem examinations anywhere in the 26 countries.  For this reason the post has been advertised as being based in Dublin with a countrywide commitment.</P>

      <Quest>the number per month of persons seeking political asylum in each of the past two years; the extent to which a proportion of this figure can be attributed to economic refugees; the State's policy in relation to economic refugees; the services, if any, which are provided to such political asylum seekers and economic refugees respectively; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following tabular statement sets out the number of applications for asylum per month since 1 January 1995.  Such applications are examined in accordance with the provisions of the 1951 United Nations Convention and 1967 Protocol relating to the status of refugees.</P>
      <P>Since January 1994 66 applicants have been recognised as refugees.  An additional 16 applicants have been granted permission to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds.  About 1,700 applications during the period in question remain to be processed to final decision and it is not possible to indicate, therefore, the extent to which a proportion of the overall figure can be attributed to economic migrants.  Having said that, there is no doubt but that there is widespread international concern that the special provisions for the protection of refugees are being abused by persons who have no valid claims to refugee status.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that what sets refugees apart from other persons in need of humanitarian assistance is a need of international protection.  A specific set of reasons &mdash; involving persecution and a lack of national protection &mdash; essentially distinguished a refugee from other categories of migrants.  Most persons can look to their own governments and state institutions for assistance but a refugee as defined in international law is not in a position to do that.</P>
      <P>International law, therefore, imposes an obligation on states to refrain from forcibly repariating a refugee who has a well-founded fear of persecution. There is no similar legal responsibility for a state to admit economic migrants and the generally accepted, and appropriate, response to economic deprivation, for example, is considered to be humanitarian assistance at source rather than international protection.  Persons who are victims of economic deprivation and human misery are undoubtedly in need of assistance but they do not necessarily require the kind of international protection implied in the word &ldquo;refugee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Refugees and other migrants, of course, often use the same routes for entry into another country. However, it is important for a state to be able to make a distinction in a fair and consistent manner in order that people who are genuinely in need of protection are granted such protection. It is important also that the system of protection established by any state in response to the humanitarian nature of the problem of refuges is not made unworkable as a result of being overwhelmed by economic migrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to services provided for asylum seekers, the position is that all applicants for asylum <Col N="1227" /> are eligible for State services.  In 1996, an interdepartmental committee recommended that health boards should nominate community welfare officers to act as co-ordinators for the reception of asylum seekers: such co-ordinators to arrange that an asylum seeker is properly accommodated; receives the appropriate welfare assistance and accommodation allowance; is referred for appropriate health checks; is assisted, where necessary, with schooling arrangements for children; is made aware of any voluntary-helping-ethnic groups or other social groups who may be of assistance to the applicant; receives assistance for any special needs he-she may have, e.g. an asylum seeker who suffered mental or physical abuse may need to be referred to the health boards for conselling and medical assistance; if he-she is an unaccompanied minor, to put in place any necessary steps such as arranging foster care.</P>
    <P>Since the report was made, seven of the eight health boards have nominated community welfare officers to fill the co-ordinator's role and an eighth nomination is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>Asylum seekers are entitled to welfare assistance. While no accurate statistical information is currently available on the cost of maintaining asylum seekers, it is estimated that the annual figure would be in excess of £500,000 per 100 asylum seekers.</P>

      <P>The issue of a paedophile register will be addressed in my Department's forthcoming Discussion Paper on Sexual Offences.  The paper will examine the various complex issues involved, e.g., what is meant by a paedophile register, who can be regarded as a paedophile, for how long should a person be obliged to register and who should have access to the register.</P>
      <P>As regards arrangements currently in place to protect children, the Garda Criminal Records Office maintains indexed records of all persons convicted of criminal offences, including persons convicted of sexual offences.  While these records are confidential and cannot normally be disclosed there is an important exception.  The Garda Síochána may, with the applicant's consent, disclose to employers &mdash; including those in children's residential centres &mdash; information on the criminal convictions, if any, recorded in respect of any applicant for a post which involves substantial access to children.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to this matter is as follows.  Esat Digifone, the second licensed mobile telephone operator, approached the Garda Síochána with a proposal to co-locate mobile telephony equipment on Garda radio masts or sites on the basis of paying the full rental value of the sites and providing facilities and services to the Garda Síochána which would be of significant operational and strategic value to them.  The Government has approved the proposal subject to the finalising of an agreement which will take account of all legal and planning requirements as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The agreement proposed with Esat Digifone on the use of Garda facilities which will require them to comply fully with planning requirements, health and safety legislation, the Radiological Protection Act and all relevant guidelines which may be set down from time to time by the International Radiation Protection Association is designed to ensure full protection to the public. In that situation, the question of my Department engaging separately on a consultative process of the kind suggested by the Deputy, does not arise.</P>

      <P>I am informed that 15 persons have made application to the High Court for habeas corpus arising from the invalid constitution of the Special Criminal Court.  One of these cases was held in January 1997 by a divisional court of the High Court and in a reserved judgment delivered yesterday the Court dismissed the application.</P>
      <P>Requests for legal aid in the case of habeas corpus applications fall to be dealt with under the Attorney General's scheme which is not administered by the Department of Justice.  I understand, however, that in the case already heard by the High Court, an application was made under the Attorney General's scheme and the court has recommended that the application be granted.  I also understand that a number of the other applicants have also applied to the court to have the Attorney General's scheme applied to their cases and that the court has also recommended that their applications be granted.</P>
      <P>I am informed that no costs have yet been paid under this scheme in defending the application. In so far as action on the report by Messrs.  Cromien and Molloy is concerned, a series of measures relating to procedures and systems in the Department have been introduced.  These include revised administrative procedures in relation to the implementation of Government decisions and the handling of correspondence generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The precise information sought by the Deputies is not available.  However, in 1993, the latest year for which relevant information is available, the total number of persons committed for non-payment of debts, default of sureties and contempt of court was 277.  In that year, 1,880 persons were committed in default of fines.</P>
      <P>The number of such persons in custody at any one time is in the order of 1 to 1.5 per cent of the total prison population, i.e. about 30 people.  This is due to the fact that many debtors make payment either on committal or shortly afterwards, so that the average amount of time spent in prison by individual debtors is quite short.  It should also be noted that in the case of debtors or contempt of court cases, the Minister has no power to release such people until their debt is paid or they have purged their contempt in court.  The Minister does have power over fine-defaulters.</P>
      <P>As regards costs, the average, as distinct from marginal, cost of keeping a prisoner in prison is approximately £890 a week.</P>

    <P>Final figures for 1996 are not yet available but the provisional figure is 1,252.</P>
    <P>On 26 February I published a Bill to amend the criminal law dealing with non-fatal offences against the person and criminal conduct involving syringes known as Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Bill, 1997.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been in preparation for some time and will repeal the greater part of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861, and restate in modern statutory form the law relating to the main non-fatal offences against the person.  In the preparation of the Bill account was taken of the recommendation contained in the Law Reform Commission Report on Non-Fatal Offences against the Person published in 1994.</P>
    <P>The Bill will restate the law relating to various forms of assault, threats to kill or cause serious harm, coercion, poisoning, false imprisonment and abduction of children and will provide for increased penalties.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment given by me during 1996 the Bill will deal with syringe offences.  It will provide a range of new offences to combat criminal conduct involving syringes, including offences of possession of a syringe or container of blood with intent to threaten or injure, placing or abandoning a syringe in any place in a manner which injures or is likely to injure any person, injuring a person with a syringe or threatening to do so, and throwing or putting blood on another person or threatening to do so.  The penalties provided will range for five years to life imprisonment.</P>

      <P>The granting of temporary release is a statutory function of the Minister for Justice under the Criminal Justice Act 1960.</P>
      <P>Temporary release may be granted to prisoners serving sentences of imprisonment or detention for various reasons, including compassionate reasons such as the illness of near relatives, bereavements, christenings and first communions of children.  Temporary release may also be granted to help with resocialisation programmes in the case of longer term offenders.  In all cases the views of the gardaí are taken into account in deciding on whether or not to grant temporary release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every case release is subject to the condition that the person released must be of good behaviour. Various other conditions may be applied; e.g. the individual concerned may be subject to supervision by the probation and welfare service, he or she may be required to report at regular intervals to a Garda station, or to reside at a particular location and so on.  If any of the conditions are breached the individual concerned can be <Col N="1237" /> immediately returned to custody without the need for fresh proceedings.</P>
    <P>Short-term releases may be granted for different periods of time, as appropriate, ranging from a few hours to one or two days.  Full temporary release, where an offender is not required to return to the prison, is normally granted in appropriate cases where the offender is nearing the end of his or her sentence.</P>
    <P>In so far as the operation of the system of temporary release is concerned, I am satisfied with the procedures currently in place.</P>

      <P>In addition, proposals for medium and longer-term reforms of the institutional framework of the justice system which were outlined in the Department's SMI statement entitled Community Security-Challenge and Change are proceeding. Among other matters legislation providing for the establishment of a courts service arising from the third report of the working group on a courts commission is being prepared as a matter of priority and an expert group which was established to work out the detailed aspects of a proposed new prisons board or agency is to report its findings in the next few days.

      <P>It is clear that the restructuring of the institutional framework of the Justice system which is progressing represents a very significant organisation development programme.  It will require the development of a new relationship and accountability framework for all agencies associated with my Department and it will change significantly the role of the core Department when fully implemented.  This programme is being overseen by a high level steering group which is mandated to report to Government on progress on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that on 9 December 1996, Operation Nicotine was established to co-ordinate the Garda and customs response to the illegal sale of tobacco in Dublin and other parts of the country.  This operation is targeting the main street sellers and importers of tobacco products.  A number of joint operations on streets, and searches of private houses and warehouses, have been carried out and are ongoing.  Since the commencement of the operation, to mid-February 1997, a total of 5,006 packets of cigarettes and 504 packets of tobacco with an estimated value of £11,000 has been seized by the Garda.  The operation has been very successful to date, and will continue.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who have statutory responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation and sale in the State of unstamped tobacco products, that action is being taken in a number of ways.</P>
      <P>Customs officers and the gardaí are working in close co-operation in a series of joint operations against street selling.  In close co-operation with other EU member states, investigations are continuing in an effort to trace the source of the illegal products feeding into this illicit trade and to intercept them on importation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that overall about 24 million cigarettes and 7,309 kilos of roll-your-own tobacco have been seized since January 1993 at import points and <Col N="1241" /> from distributors and street traders.  As a result there has been an increased number of prosecutions both for smuggling and illegal selling offences.</P>
    <P>The adequacy of the existing legal provisions to deal with this particular problem is being reviewed.  The Minister for Finance has recently announced that a range of measures are being considered in the context of this year's Finance Bill.  These include increased penalties for illegal selling and increased powers to Revenue officers and the Garda to deal with offenders.  These proposals are currently being considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>I have consulted the Garda authorities on the matter and they have informed me that there are a number of events planned to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the foundation of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>A series of concerts by the band of the Garda Síochána will be held throughout all the Garda regions, with each region preparing its own brochure and programme.  In conjunction with the concerts, the curator of the Garda Museum will provide an information display on the Garda Síochána at most of the venues.  Details of these concerts are as follows:</P>

    <P>The band of the Garda Síochána are also to produce a commemorative compact disc and cassette. Also during this year a commemorative stamp and call card are to be produced.</P>
    <P>In Letterkenny a heritage centre has already been formally opened by the Commissioner.  The centre is located in Letterkenny Garda Station and traces the development of the Garda Síochána in the area.  It is open to the public.  On 17 August 1997, it is planned to hold an open day at Dublin Castle to commemorate the handing over of Dublin Castle to the Garda Síochána and officially open the Garda Síochána Museum which is located at Dublin Castle.  A number of books, some by members of the force, are to be published this year and the Garda Management publication &ldquo;Communique&rdquo; will, in its June issue, <Col N="1242" /> contain a special history of the 75 years of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Garda Síochána sports and cultural organisations such as Coiste Siamsa and the International Police Association will also celebrate the founding of the Garda Síochána through various events.  The Garda choir held a concert in February 1997.</P>

The existence of the national lottery, which is a matter for the Department of Finance, is also relevant in any consideration of charities.</P>
      <P>The Select Committee on Legislation and Security was very recently forwarded a copy of the deliberations of the advisory group on charities and fundraising legislation concerning this issue and recommended that the cap be raised.  In that context, the question of revising the existing limit on lotteries is under review.</P>

Twenty eight of these cars are permanently assigned to the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Government Ministers, the Chief Whip and the Minister of State to the Government, the President, former President, former Taoisigh, Director of Public Prosecutions, Chief Justice, Attorney General and the Ceann Comhairle.  Nineteen vehicles are not specifically allocated to individuals and are used when vehicles are undergoing repairs, maintenance, etc.</P>
      <P>Thirteen new vehicles were purchased for the ministerial fleet in 1996 at a cost of £438,725. Some of the existing cars went into the spare fleet and some of the older cars were disposed of.  It is estimated that the running cost of the fleet in 1996, including petrol, service, maintenance and repairs was approximately £225,000.  This figure does not include the cost of Garda drivers who work on a week-on-week-off basis.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his Question No. 259 of 28 January 1997 on the same matter.  In that reply I stated that the concept of refugee status is generally defined as applying to a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of persecution, is outside his or her country of nationality and, owing to such fear, is unable or unwilling to avail of the protection of that country.  That is the definition contained in the 1951 UN convention relating to the status of refugees.  The convention infers also that a threat to life or freedom on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group is always persecution.</P>
      <P>The Refugee Act, 1996, which will become operational later this year, follows the definition contained in the 1951 convention.  I have no proposals to commision a study as proposed by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The House will appreciate that the question of the appropriate sentence which is to be imposed in any particular case is obviously a matter for the court to <Col N="1246" /> determine in accordance with law.  Obviously it would not be appropriate for me as Minister for Justice to comment on sentences in individual cases.  It should be borne in mind, however, that where a sentence appears to be too lenient the law does allow the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal that sentence.</P>
      <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission both in a consultation paper and their report last year on the matter.  Action has already been taken on a number of recommendations contained in the report and other recommendations are being examined in my Department.</P>
      <P>While it is not a matter for me to interpret the law, it might be helpful for me to refer the Deputy to Chapter 6 of the commission's report which refers specifically to the point I assume the Deputy has in mind.  Essentially, the commission appears to be of the view that the relevant rulings of higher courts did not necessarily oblige a court in all circumstances where a guilty plea had been entered to impose less than a life sentence.  The commission, which was of the view that it would not be appropriate to address this matter by way of legislation, indicated that the situation is confused and should be clarified as soon as possible by the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>A new contract for doctors in prisons has been undergoing protracted negotiations for a number of years. The delays are due to lack of agreement.  Officials of my Department met the Irish Medical Organisation again recently and were informed that the organisation is in favour of the revised contract for prison medical doctors.  Two new matters raised by the Irish Medical Organisation at the meeting are under consideration by the Department of Finance.  I expect to have a reply from the Department of Finance shortly at which time my officials will seek an immediate meeting with the Irish Medical Organisation with a view to finalising the contract.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my response to Deputy O'Donnell on 28 January 1997 the contract will provide a basis for improving medical services within Mountjoy prison.  It will, however, be only part of the solution and discussions are currently ongoing with the Department of Finance regarding the complement of doctors at the prison.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána Act, 1924, as amended by the Garda Síochána Act, 1977, provides that it shall not be lawful for a member of the Garda Síochána to be or to become a member of a trade union or of any association other than an association established under the Act.  The Act also makes it an offence for a person to cause disaffection or to induce any member of the Garda Síochána to withhold his or her services.  These restrictions are confirmed in the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>Under section 13 (5) of the 1924 Act, as inserted by the 1977 Act, I may, from time to time, authorise the Garda associations established under the Acts to be associated with a person or body outside the Garda Síochána subject to certain restrictions which I may deem necessary to specify.</P>
      <P>This section can be invoked where I am satisfied that membership of the body to which an association wishes to be affiliated would not be incompatible with the status and duties of members of a disciplined police force, to which the necessary legal prohibitions in relation to trade union membership and withdrawal of services apply.  Garda associations have been authorised to affiliate with the ICPSA, that is, the Irish Conference of Professional Service Associations. I have not received any formal application from any Garda representative body to affiliate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and, in the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to comment on how I might deal with such an application.</P>

      <P>The evidence of Provisional IRA activity since the ending of their ceasefire on 9 February 1996 is clear.  The Provisional IRA has carried out attacks in this State, Northern Ireland, Britain and Germany which, all told, have resulted in loss of life, serious injuries to many people and widespread damage to property.</P>
      <P>The Government has unequivocally denounced these savage attacks and consistently pointed to the futility of the PIRA's renewed campaign of violence in pursuit of political ends.  Violence of any kind is counter-productive to bringing about a political settlement to the Northern Ireland situation. It serves only to further delay the commencement of political talks and make the successful negotiation of a settlement all the more difficult to achieve.  The Provisional IRA must recognise that progress toward a political solution can only be realised by reinstating their ceasefire so that political dialogue can proceed.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the efforts of the security forces in countering the terrorist activities of the Provisional IRA and pay tribute, in particular, to the Garda Síochána on the success of their most recent operation at Kinnegad which resulted in the recovery of a significant quantity of homemade detonator cord.  These important interventions have without doubt prevented serious loss of life and damage to property.  The Government will continue to provide all the resources necessary to support the Garda Síochána against those who assist, prepare and carry out these attacks.  The Government will also continue to ensure that Anglo-Irish and wider international security co-operation is maintained and, where possible, enhanced in the interests of all communities threatened by terrorist activity.</P>

      <P>I have seen the newspaper report mentioned by the Deputy, which referred to a forthcoming study by the National Economic and Social Council entitled <i>European Union: Integration and Enlargement</i>.  I understand that the study in question is at present being finalised.  Afterwards its recommendations will be carefully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, naturally, aware that should the UK not join EMU from its inception on 1 January 1999, the possibility will exist of a sharp fall at some point in the value of sterling against the euro; and that this possibility is of concern to Irish businesses which face competition from UK companies. Of course, the UK Government has not yet decided whether the UK will join EMU from the <Col N="1249" /> outset on 1 January 1999, but rather that the issue will be decided closer to that date.</P>
    <P>Membership of EMU will reinforce the need to maintain and improve competitiveness and flexibility throughout the Irish economy.  The Government has of course a central role in promoting an economic environment as conductive as possible to business success.  The present environment is characterised by low inflation, sound public finances, low interest rates, moderate wage developments under Partnership 2000 and a high level of investment, which together have supported high economic and employment growth.  In addition, recent budgets have contained a series of measures designed to improve competitiveness, including competitiveness <i>vis-á-vis</i> the UK.  The Government will continue to bear in mind the importance of competitiveness in framing future budgetary strategy.  However, it is primarily a matter for firms to equip themselves to respond to changes in the trading environment for their particular products and services.</P>
    <P>Under Partnership 2000, the Government is committed to continuing its efforts to ensure that Article 109m of the Treaty on European Union, whereby each non-euro area member state shall treat its exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest, is used to maximum effect, consistent with the Treaty, with a view to avoiding real exchange rate misalignments and excessive nominal exchange rate fluctuations.  The principles and main elements of improved surveillance procedures covering all member states were agreed under the Irish Presidency and are now being discussed in detail.  As the ECOFIN Council report endorsed by the European Council in Dublin pointed out, these procedures will seek to ensure that the domestic policies of all member states are geared to price stability and sound public finances, thus creating the conditions for keeping exchange rates stable.  Member states which do not join the new Exchange Rate Mechanism as the UK has indicated it is unlikely to &mdash; will present policies so as to enable appropriate surveillance in the ECOFIN Council and in the General Council of the European Central Bank. ECOFIN and the Commission are considering further the methods for the effective surveillance of exchange rate developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick-East</i>): International experience has shown that mobile clinics can be a successful part of treatment programmes for drug misusers.  The services offered by such clinics can range from methadone maintenance programmes for stabilised drug misusers to harm reduction programmes, including low threshold methadone doses for chaotic drug misusers.  Services do not include rehabilitation. The mobile clinic is intended to complement the services provided in the community-based treatment centres and by general practitioners.  The important consideration in the type of programme to be provided is that clear operational policies be drawn up for the clinic and that, in addition, clear objectives, which would be subject to review, be defined.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Eastern Health Board's mobile methadone clinic, which commenced in the south inner city area in September, 1996, and which is now also operating in the north inner city, is being operated in a responsible fashion, with clear objectives and involving the support of both the Garda Síochána and local communities. It is proposed to operate in further sites and consultations are being held with the local community in each case regarding the selection of suitable locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has worked closely with the Garda Síochána in relation to the locations and movements of the vehicle.  The board has carried out any recommendations made to it in relation to security and it is satisfied with the arrangements <Col N="1251" /> which have been put in place for the clinic, while it is both stationary and mobile.</P>
    <P>The clinic provides a service only for people who have been assessed by a consultant psychiatrist. If these people are deemed suitable for treatment, they receive the treatment from staff who are specifically assigned to the clinic.  These include three general assistants and two nurses. An outreach worker from the area also attends the clinic for their particular area.</P>
    <P>Because the clinic is operating within clear guidelines and protocols I am satisfied that it poses little or no risk to local communities. Indeed, the provision of drug treatment services to addicts in their area, should allow these individuals to become stabilised and therefore no longer need to become involved in criminal behaviour to feed their drug habit.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. I am satisfied that the health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.  In these circumstances I am satisfied that the arrangements in place ensure that all premature babies are provided with appropriate health care.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the information sought regarding the <Col N="1252" /> level of funding for the home help service in each health board area for each of the years 1994-96 is not readily available in my Department, I have asked the health boards to supply same and I will forward it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is a matter for each health board to decide the level of home help services required and the level of payment to be made in respect of these services.  The chief executive officer of each health board is in the best position to decide on these issues as my Department has no involvement in the day-to-day management of the service.  However, I would like to point out to the Deputy that my Department has allocated additional funding to three of the health boards this year for the purpose of increasing the rates of payment to home helps.</P>
      <P>In response to a previous question from the Deputy on this issue I stated that the Department in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards has under active consideration a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within the health boards for the provision of this service.</P>
      <P>A discussion document submitted by the chief executive officers group formed the basis for this examination of the home help services.  Following on from these discussions, my Department decided to have an examination of the operation of the home help services carried out by an independent body which will advise on how the services can be developed in a cost effective way in tandem with the other community based services. Following receipt of tenders for this review, the contract has been awarded and the work will commence shortly.  It is expected that the review will be completed before the end of the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics on inpatient and day case admissions are collected by the Hospital Inpatient Inquiry <Col N="1254" /> System [HIPI] which includes statistics on the procedures performed on patients.  Most procedures recorded are surgical in nature.  Minor procedures may not be recorded and the lesser medical procedures and non-operative procedures are not recorded.</P>
    <P>Most day case admissions involve a procedure but there is no clear dividing line between medical and surgical procedures.  There has been a growth in medical procedures in a day case setting. For example, in 1995 there were 7,496 chemotherapy and 6,153 radiotherapy procedures in a day case setting.  These day cases would not have been reported in earlier years so an estimation of six year rates is not possible.</P>
    <P>The number of all procedures, medical and surgical, recorded has increased, reflecting in part the improved coverage and quality of HIPI data over the period.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Details of the rates of remuneration applying to hospital consultants employed in the public health service holding the consultants' common contract from 1 June 1991 to date are set out on the following tabular statement.  In addition to the allowances set out on the tabular statement an additional earmarked fund of £0.5 million a year has been distributed among health service employers for disbursement to consultants with particularly onerous levels of emergency duty.</P>
      <P>Information on the precise amounts paid in salary and allowances by public health service employers to individual hospital consultants are not available in my Department as these are matters between individual hospital consultants and their employers, having regard <i>inter alia</i> to the type of consultant post held and the level of call out etc.</P>

      <P>Natural Heritage Areas are only at the proposal stage and will not be designated until the necessary amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1976, has been passed by the Oireachtas. I expect to publish this Bill in the coming months. Even after formal designation, NHAs will not give rise to any compulsory restrictions on farming practices and thus compensation will not arise.</P>
      <P>Special Areas of Conservation are important natural areas which are required to be protected under the terms of the EU Habitats Directive.  I signed the regulations transposing the directive into Irish law yesterday and implementation will commence immediately.  Farmers with land included in these areas will be required to farm in accordance with an agreed agri-environmental plan.  This plan will be based on sustainable farming practices.  My Department will not object in any way to farmers operating at the maximum level that is sustainable, and restrictions will apply only to activities that would damage the land.</P>
      <P>Where restrictions in SACs cause income or capital loss for the farmers or landowners compensation will be payable.  In the context of Partnership 2000, it was agreed that a fair and proper level of compensation shall be paid having regard to the level and extent of restriction and all reasonable losses arising as a result of SAC designation and to the difference between the value pre-designation for environmental purposes and the subsequent value of the land consequent on designation as an SAC.</P>
      <P>Following extensive negotiations, agreement has been reached with the farming social partners on a scheme of compensation for losses arising as a result of SAC designations.  Landowners or occupiers, part or all of whose land is designated as an SAC, may opt for either of the two alternative compensation packages, as follows:</P>
      <P>Option 1:</P>
      <P>Direct compensation scheme administered by my Department.</P>
      <P>In this context a farmer will quantify the losses that he considers arise as a result of SAC designation. The losses will be assessed by my Department and an offer of compensation made.  If agreement is not reached on the amount payable, independent arbitration will be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the Waterways Service was transferred to my Department from the Office of Public Works in March 1996.</P>
      <P>The Kilbeggan Branch on the Grand Canal was closed to navigation in the 1960s.  In 1994 the Waterways Service carried out a topographical survey of the system which indicated that extensive resources and funding would be required to make the Kilbeggan Branch navigable again.  For example, there are 11 earthen dams and unauthorised crossings across the canal at various locations which would have to be removed.  All the culverts under the branch line would have to be repaired or replaced, and the overflows and overflow dams would need rebuilding.  Approximately 80 per cent of the system is embanked and extensive repairs would be required to the embankments, particularly in bogland locations.</P>
      <P>In view of the scale of the works over a short distance of 8 miles or 13 kms the project was not included this time for funding under the current EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-9. Capital funding was allocated to projects on a priority basis to, for example, develop the existing infrastructure on our navigable waterways and to restore to navigation other major waterways such as the Royal Canal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Waterways Service has carried out a limited programme of works on the Kilbeggan Branch since 1990.  This has included the provision of assistance and advice to the Kilbeggan Community Group in regard to several FÁS schemes along the branch line and on the <Col N="1259" /> Harbour Stores project.  In 1990 the Waterways Service cleared the harbour and 3 kms of canal banks were cleared from Grange to Campbell's Bridges.  However, in view of the scale of the works that would be required to restore the branch line to full navigation it would take many years, given current resources, to complete the work.  Clearly, significant funding would be necessay to shorten the restoration period to a few years.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 1995 provides for both the licensing of public service vehicles and the licensing of drivers of small public service vehicles.</P>
      <P>Public service vehicles are divided into small public service vehicles, which have seating accommodation for eight or less passengers, and large public service vehicles, which have seating accommodation for more than eight passengers.</P>
      <P>There are three types of small public service vehicle licences &mdash; taxi, wheelchair accessible taxi and hackney licences.  Small public service vehicle licences are granted by local authorities as licensing authorities under the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1995.  These licences remain in force for a period of two years.  Before a licensing authority can grant or renew a taxi, wheelchair accessible taxi or hackney licence the applicant must pay the appropriate fee, provide the appropriate vehicle certificate issued by the Garda Commissioner stating that the vehicle is suitable to be licensed as such and must satisfy the licensing authority that the use of the vehicle will be covered by insurance.  An application for renewal must be received by the licensing authority on or before a date six months following the date of expiry of the licence.</P>
      <P>A licence to drive a small public service vehicle is granted by the Garda Commissioner under Article 34 of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, as amended.  The licence remains in force for a period of one year. An application for a licence must be made in such form and manner, and contain such particulars, as the Commissioner directs and must be accompanied by a current driving licence, a receipt showing that the fee has been paid and an undertaking in writing that the applicant is available as a driver of a small public service vehicle for at least forty hours in each week and will not drive for more than eleven hours a day in any period of three consecutive days.</P>
      <P>Before granting a small public service vehicle driver's licence, the Commissioner must, <i>inter alia,</i> be satisfied that the applicant is a fit and proper person, has a knowledge of general traffic regulations, the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations and the area in which he intends to operate; is not engaged in any occupation which the Commissioner considers would be likely to impair his efficiency, or to conflict with his responsibilities, or to be incompatible with his employment as such a driver, and has not been convicted of an offence which would render him unsuitable to drive a small public service vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is not specified in regulations that public service vehicle licences or public service vehicle driver's licences be made available to <Col N="1261" /> unemployed persons only, the requirements about hours of availability, efficiency and conflict with responsibilities in relation to public service vehicle drivers licences are relevant.</P>
    <P>A review of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1995 is being undertaken in my Department and I will have the question of the duration of public service vehicle licences and small public service vehicle drivers licences examined in that context.</P>
    <P>Large public service vehicle licences are granted by the Garda Commissioner under Article 6 of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Licensing) Regulations, 1978, as amended.  These licences remain in force for a period of three years.  Before the Commissioner grants such a licence, he must be satisfied that the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold the licence, that the vehicle is safe for the carriage of passengers and will be covered by insurance and that it will comply with the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996.  Depending on the size of a large public service vehicle, a category D or D1 driving licence is required to drive such a vehicle.</P>

      <Quest>his policy in relation to local authorities installing heating into their houses which are rented out to tenants; whether there is a difference between Dublin Corporation and Mayo County Council in this regard in view of the fact that a person in Mayo applied under the disabled person's grant scheme for heating and was turned down and a person living in a Dublin Corporation house can get heating installed under the same grant scheme.</Quest>

      <P>I assume that the question relates to the provision of heating in a rented local authority house occupied by a person with a disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations, 1993, a local authority may pay a disabled person's grant in respect of works of adaptation that, in the opinion of the authority, are reasonably necessary for the purpose of rendering a house more suitable for the disabled person.  Subject to the regulations, it is a matter in individual cases for local authorities to determine eligibility for a grant and the type of works for which a grant may be given. <Col N="1263" /> Local authorities were informed by my Department in May 1996 that, for the purposes of determining the level of a disabled person's grant, the cost of providing central heating may be included in the overall cost of necessary adaptation works.  In circumstances, where a proposed central heating system extends beyond the accommodation for the disabled person, an apportionment of the cost is made.</P>

Road authorities have been advised, however, in guidance notes on the Act, that while the safety of road users should be of paramount importance in the exercise of their powers and duties under section 70, they should also be aware of their responsibilities in relation to the environment and the preservation of amenities.  Under no circumstances should road authorities send notices to landowners under the Act to fell trees, or exercise a policy of wholesale felling of trees, unless they are satisfied from physical inspection that trees or other vegetation are a hazard or potential hazard.</P>

Among its other recommendations, this chapter states that programmes relating to the misuse of tobacco, alcohol and other substances are to be developed in schools.</P>
      <P>This policy is already being put into place in both primary and second level schools through the promotion of awareness in, and the provision of information to, school management, teachers and parents; the provision of programmes for schools, including resource materials and training for teachers; particular interventions in areas where it is known that there is a high incidence of substance misuse.</P>
      <P>At second level, the substance misuse education programme, &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo;, which was launched in 1994, continues to be disseminated. By the end of the current school year, all second level schools will have had the opportunity to participate in this programme.  The materials used in the programme are being revised at present in the light of feedback from teachers and training for teachers in the programme will continue next year.</P>
      <P>The substance misuse prevention programme for primary schools continues to be developed. A set of educational resource materials has been prepared for use in all classes and information booklets for schools and for parents on substance abuse prevention are in preparation.  The pilot phase of the programme, including training of teachers, is currently under way in 27 schools. When the pilot phase is complete, the materials will be disseminated to all primary schools in the priority areas &mdash; areas identified by the ministerial task force on measures to reduce demand for drugs &mdash; and thereafter to all primary schools on a priority basis.</P>
      <P>Finally, training modules on substance abuse are being arranged for teacher counsellors and for home school liaison co-ordinators in the priority areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the case made by the school in question for a remedial teacher service.  Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's Inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year.  I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.  I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process. When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the school in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <Col N="1269" /> To maximise the efficient use of school transport services, every effort is made to ensure schools in an area co-ordinate their opening and closing times.  School transport services at post-primary level are co-ordinated by the transport liaison officer for each county and vocational education committee area.  Generally, consultations between school representatives and the transport liaison officer for each area are held in April and May each year for the purpose of coordination of transport schedules.  This allows schools the opportunity to participate in the formulation of these arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127, 128 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>On 25 February 1997 there were a total of 43 prisoners in custody in Shelton Abbey which has a maximum capacity of 56.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> Records are not maintained in such a manner as to facilitate the provision of the information requested, the average length of detention in the institution.  One offender has been there for a great many years.  The normal profile of an offender in Shelton Abbey would be one who is coming near the end of a sentence whose stay could be less than one year, people in custody for non-violent offences and older offenders, and stays can range from three months to a number of years.</P>
    <P>Shelton Abbey was acquired by my Department and adapted to hold long-term prisoners moving towards the end of their sentences.  Over the past six years or so the population mix there has changed to include many short-term prisoners from the Wicklow-Wexford-South Dublin area. These prisoners and their families have undoubtedly benefited by the use of the excellent education and rehabilitation facilities available at this location and I make no apology for the fact that this population mix has been maintained in my time in office as Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Shelton Abbey is one of three open centres in our prison system and, as such, plays a vital role in the management of offenders sentenced to imprisonment or detention in this jurisdiction. Open centres are a feature of penal systems in most similar jurisdictions world-wide where sentence management systems are in operation. They provide an appropriate type and level of accommodation for a range of offenders at a significantly reduced level of security and, I should say, cost.  As open centres are usually located in the countryside they also provide substantial direct and indirect local employment.</P>
    <P>The regime in place at Shelton Abbey provides for considerable flexibility in the management of the inmates who can avail of indoor and outdoor recreational facilities.  The majority of inmates qualify for concessions including temporary release on a regular basis and increased remission.  Apart from the above there are no special arrangements for prisoners in place at Shelton Abbey either now or during December 1996 or January 1997.  It is not clear what special arrangements the Deputy has in mind.  If he could be more specific I would be happy to consider his question.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the operation and management of Shelton Abbey and successive prison visiting committees there have confirmed this view.</P>

      <P>An Garda Síochána have a mainframe computer at Garda headquarters with access provided to all stations <Col N="1271" /> in the Dublin metropolitan area, all divisional headquarters and stations serving major population areas elsewhere.  The mainframe computer provides instant access to records on vehicles, crimes, criminal records, missing persons, fines on the spot and firearms.  In addition, the force is also served by stand-alone systems supporting personnel, store accounting, fleet maintenance, exhibit tracking, false alarms and a computerised command and control communication system which serves the Dublin metropolitan area.  Last year I formally inaugerated a state-of-the-art automatic fingerprint identification system at the fingerprint bureau in Garda headquarters, at a cost of £1.8 million.  The force also has approximately 700 personal computers which are used for more general office purposes.</P>
      <P>In 1993, the Commissioner, in the context of the Garda Síochána corporate strategy, commissioned a strategic information technology plan which identified the future information technology needs of an Garda Síochána.  The plan highlighted the need for a major investment in new systems and networks and recommended the replacement of the existing hardware and networks which were approaching the end of their lifecycle.  Following Government approval, a joint Garda and Consultancy team produced a conceptual design plan which identified specific system areas required by the force and specified the necessary hardware, software, infrastructure and resource requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August 1996, work commenced on the core component of the IT strategy which has been entitled PULSE, police using leading systems <Col N="1272" /> effectively.  The overall cost of the project will run to £36 million and take four years to complete making it one of the largest technology driven projects ever undertaken in this country.  The Deputy will recall that I signed a contract with Andersen Consulting in September last year for the delivery of this core component which involves the design and development of the software and some 17 systems areas.  Work in this regard will be ongoing throughout 1997 and it is anticipated that the first of the new systems will go into operation in December, 1998.  A change control mechanism has been built into the contract with Andersen Consulting to allow for modification of the project scope to meet changing circumstances &mdash; something which is inevitable in a project of this size.</P>

      <P>All offenders sentenced to terms of imprisonment or detention are committed to prison on foot of the warrants issued by the sentencing court.  In time, some prisoners do, for various reasons, qualify for temporary release and in some of these cases pressure on prison accommodation is a factor.  The extensive prisons building programme which I have initiated will when complete provide over 800 extra prison places reducing the current deficit in prison accommodation and alleviating the consequent need to release offenders due to a shortage of prison accommodation.</P>

      <P>There are just in excess of 5,000 petitions on in my Department and consideration of these will take account of the 1995 High Court judgment on petitions.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that I have told the House that I was preparing and would be issuing new guidelines which would take account of the judgment and which would assist both members of the public and public representatives to ascertain if there is a case to petition or not.  These guidelines and copies of a new application form issued to all Members of both Houses yesterday.  I will be taking separate steps to inform the general public of the new guidelines.</P>
      <P>During 1996 a total of 295 petitions were finalised of which 21 were successful.  Of the number of petitions finalised since the High Court judgment 96.2 per cent were unsuccessful.  With regard to the element of the Deputy's question which refers to petitions running out of date I presume that she is referring to the status of warrants which are the subject of petition.  The position here, as I have explained on previous occasions, is that a petition does not place a stay on the order of the District Court Judge.  Notwithstanding the fact that a petition has been lodged by or on the defendant's behalf, if the fine is not paid within the time allowed by the judge, a warrant will be issued to enforce the court's decision as is the normal procedure in cases where fines are not paid on time.  Section 1 (1) of the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1991 provides that a warrant must be issued within six months of the due date of payment of the fine imposed.  Statistics in relation to warrants related to fines which are under petition are not maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Every administration in the history of the State has <Col N="1275" /> exercised the power to remit sentences and this is especially true of recent Governments including the one in which the Deputy's party was involved.</P>
      <P>It is long-standing practice not to comment in detail on individual prisoners' cases and I do not intend to depart from this precedent on this occasion.  I can, however, inform the Deputy that the individual in question was granted weekly temporary release by reference to the circumstances of her particular case subject to conditions which remain in force for the full duration of the sentence.  In the event of a breach of any of these conditions at any time before the expiry of the sentence the individual may be immediately returned to custody.</P>
      <P>There are often very good reasons &mdash; as there were in this case &mdash; for releasing offenders at a relatively early stage of a sentence where offenders may be suffering from drug addiction problems and may be in need of medical assistance which in certain circumstances can best be availed of in the community.  There could be reasons associated with an offender's children or family circumstances.  Overall, the question of whether continued incarceration or release into the community where the offender remains under supervision for the full duration of his or her sentence is a matter of judgment and requires careful and balanced consideration.  A decision to release in these circumstances is often the correct one. Early releases from custody are frequently necessitated by a shortfall in prison places which has developed over the past ten years when, quite frankly, there was a failure to invest in necessary expansion of the prison system.  Having examined the problem in comprehensive detail the Government has embarked on the largest prison building programme in modern Irish history.  It will result in the creation of some 800 extra prison spaces by end 1998.  Also I am continuing to search for any positive measures that can be taken, in the short term, to alleviate the pressure for early releases.  Even when we have additional places, under the 1960 Act, the Minister for Justice will still have power to give temporary release.  All such releases will continue to be vetted to ensure that any potential risk to the public is minimised. Temporary releases are generally limited to offenders serving relatively short sentences or those coming to the end of longer sentences.  I am working to streamline and enhance the consultation procedures with Garda and other services prior to such temporary release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shortfall in accommodation which I referred to above has arisen due, in part, to a rise in the numbers being committed to prison for serious offences by the courts over the past ten years.  This has posed problems for the operation of our prisons with, in some cases, extra pressures being placed on the available facilities particularly in the main committal prisons such as <Col N="1276" /> Mountjoy.  This problem is, at last, being addressed as I have just outlined.  Our building plans include the new female prison at Mountjoy with a capacity of 60 prisoners, a 50 per cent increase in size over the current female prison at that location.</P>
    <P>In excess of 160 additional places under my prison expansion programme became available in 1996, a further 180 places are scheduled to be completed in the current year and the remaining 460 new places will become available in 1998.  The building programme, when completed, will provide an increase of approximately 35 per cent in the total prison capacity.  This represents a major and indeed historic long-term investment in the prison system.

      <P>As I announced in last month's budget, an important change is being made in the rules relating to the requalification for unemployment benefit which will have a substantial beneficial effect on the incomes of many workers, particularly those in atypical employment such as seasonal and casual workers like dockers and firefighters.</P>
      <P>These workers were precluded from requalifying for unemployment benefit until they had a further 13 PRSI contributions paid subsequent to exhausting their unemployment benefit entitlement. In future, a person will be able to requalify for unemployment benefit by having 13 paid conributions at any stage after the 156th day &mdash; i.e. six months &mdash; of unemployment.  This will mean that, where the 13 contributions are paid between the 156th day and the 390th day, the claimant can requalify for a further 390 days of unemployment benefit immediately after the first 390 days has been exhausted.</P>
      <P>These arrangements will be brought into effect at the end of next month, following the enactment of the Social Welfare Bill, 1997.</P>

      <P>Section 179 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 as substituted by paragraph <Col N="1278" /> 3 of the sixth Schedule to the Act, provides for the payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The legislation also enables the Minister to make regulations prescribing the circumstances and conditions under which such a supplement may be paid, the class or classes of persons to whom a supplement may be paid and the amount of supplement that may be paid, and this has been done in S.I. 382 (Social Welfare (Consolidated SWA) Regs.) of 1995.  The SWA scheme is administered by the health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>In addition, Article 12 (1) of 1995 specifies that the amount of weekly rent supplement paid will be calculated so as to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board have indicated that the person in question was being paid a rent supplement of £27.40 up to the week ending 15 February 1997.  When she commenced a FÁS course in retail sales the following week, her case was reviewed and her means were reassessed to take account of her change in circumstances.  The Midland Health Board decided that her combined income of £79.70 from a single parent family payment and her FÁS course allowance of £64.70, totalling £144.40, exceeded the income guidelines for eligibility for a rent supplement.  She has been informed by the Midland Health Board of her right of appeal but no appeal against this decision has been lodged to date.</P>
      <P>FÁS training allowances are assessed as means for the purpose of determining entitlement to a rent or mortgage supplement.  People participating in FÁS training courses do not automatically retain secondary benefits.  I am having this situation reviewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position in relation to proposals to develop a national conference centre in Ballsbridge, Dublin 4, is that following the failure of the open tendering competition to produce an acceptable private sector proposal, an alternative strategy was pursued whereby Bord Fáilte, under the aegis of the independent Management Board for Product Development, examined an outline proposal from the Royal Dublin Society which, as a voluntary body, is potentially eligible for consideration for a higher rate of capital assistance normally reserved, under the Operational Programme <Col N="1279" /> for Tourism (OP) for public and similar bodies.</P>
      <P>Upon completion of their examination of the RDS proposal, Bord Fáilte, on the recommendation of the management board, commissioned an independent cost/benefit analysis which is required under the Tourism OP in the case of all large projects.  This was undertaken by an experienced UK consultancy firm who were selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure.  The results were favourable to the RDS proposal.  The Government, having taken into account a number of factors including the recommendations of the management board and Bord Fáilte, and the results of the cost benefit analysis, agreed on 5 November to make a submission to the European Commission recommending formal approval of the proposed development by the RDS.  The Government is recommending approval of 75 per cent capital grant-aid subject to the existing financial provision for such a project in the current Tourism OP.  The proposal has been submitted to the European Commission for approval, as required under the OP for projects of this scale, and the Commission's response is now awaited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Forbairt's general grant giving powers are set out in the Industrial Development Acts, 1986-95.  Within that overall context, Forbairt is actively involved in assisting its client companies to formulate longer term development plans and strategies and, where appropriate, in providing financial assistance to ensure that such development plans are successfully implemented to enable companies to safeguard existing jobs and to grow sales and employment in the long-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In situations where the dynamics of the international marketplace force companies to take actions which may result in closure or job losses, at the least in the short-term, Forbairt is prepared to intervene, with its range of expertise and funding services, including investment in ordinary equity or preference shares together with assistance towards management and new product development, when there is a prospect of retaining, or replacing it with, a viable enterprise. Examples of such assistance include assistance towards management or worker buy-outs where Forbairt works with existing management, or in a minority of cases, workers, to maintain the existing business in the case where existing shareholders have taken the decision to exit from the <Col N="1280" /> business, or seeking new investors to revitalise or replace an existing business.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1984-97 contains a new promoting adjustment measure designed to provide financial support and advice towards helping traditional industry to adjust to increasingly demanding levels of competition.  This measure is administered by Forbairt under the auspices of a steering group appointed by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  For administrative purposes it is known as the change programme and specifically addresses the situation where job losses are expected to occur as companies adjust to new competitive pressures.</P>
    <P>The aims of the change programme are: to promote R &amp; D, enterprise, innovation and the development of product/market strategies in SMEs; to encourage firms under competitive pressure to diversify; to help firms to move out of products or markets in decline; and to promote joint ventures and linkages to make individuals and firms more competitive.</P>
    <P>The programme provides funding assistance of up to 50 per cent of costs incurred up to a maximum of £30,000.  Eligible initiatives include developing and improving business systems; strengthening management and other personnel resources; building partnership arrangements; raising new funding for the business; improving customer focus and ability to serve market needs and environmental management.  The programme has a budget of £7 million over the four years of the operational programme and is targeted at companies employing 25-100 people in traditional manufacturing sectors including food companies which have not received FEOGA support.</P>

    <P>Under EU regulations covering the scheme the maximum payment that could be made in the 1996 calendar year was 80 per cent of entitlements. <Col N="1281" /> The regulations also provide for all payments to be completed by 30 June of the year following the year of application.  Balancing payments under 1996 schemes have now commenced and in line with the charter commitment most should be paid by end March 1997.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any particular difficulties regarding the attendance and participation of central council members in the affairs of the Irish Red Cross Society.  Council meetings are normally held twice a year.  Government carefully considers and nominates persons whom it deems will contribute to the betterment of the society.  The tenure of office of members nominated by Government expires on 30 April 1997.</P>

      <P>A number of significant improvements to the accommodation <Col N="1284" /> at Castleblayney military post were undertaken during the last few years at a cost of more than £200,000 &mdash; principally refubishment of the gymnasium, construction of new officers' mess premises and upgrading of the heating system. Consideration is being given to refurbishing a billet block during 1997 in addition to which routine maintenance work will, of course, continue to be carried out as required.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the plight of the Dublin sea trout fishermen who derive 80 per cent of their income in the months of March, April and May due to algae on the nets after the end of May and who must cease sea trout fishing at that time and move further out from the shore for salmon fishing; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that these sea trout fishermen will be put out of business if the proposed change from 12 February to 15 May is not altered back to at least 1 April.</Quest>

      <P>The new conservation regulations introduced for the 1997 season in respect of salmon and trout complete the first phase of implementing the recommendations of the salmon management task force. There has been, at home and abroad, general acceptance that the measures introduced for 1997 are necessary.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed about the specific and localised impact of the new conservation measures on draftnet estuarial fisheries.  In addition to actively encouraging a local catchment management approach to cater for specific needs in each area, these overall concerns are currently being assessed from all relevant perspectives &mdash; and there will be further consultations on the matter.  The concerns of fishermen engaged in the east coast sea trout fishery will be encompassed in this process of review and consultation.</P>
