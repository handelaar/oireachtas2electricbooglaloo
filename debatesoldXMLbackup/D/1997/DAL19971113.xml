    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 6a, motion regarding the First Report of the Standing sub-Committee on Dáil Reform on Establishment of Committees in the 28th Dáil; No. 6b, motion regarding Standing Order 78; and No. 10, statements regarding the Annual Report of the EU's Drug Monitoring Service (resumed).  Notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, it is proposed that Nos. 6a and 6b shall be decided without debate.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 19, motion regarding tax relief on certain corporate donations to charities (resumed).  It shall be taken on the conclusion of No. 6b.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, will the Taoiseach or the Chief Whip confirm that in respect of No. 6a we are agreeing to the establishment of the committee but not necessarily its exact composition or the Members who will serve on it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Ombudsman has found that regulations governing subventions for the support of elderly people in private nursing homes are not based on legislation and may, therefore, not have appropriate effect and be discriminatory, does the Government plan to introduce legislation to provide a proper and fair legal basis to support the care of elderly people in residential care?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the Ombudsman's report this matter is being reviewed by the Government to ascertain what changes need to be made.  The care of the elderly is an important issue and we may have to introduce legislative changes to deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that there are lessons to be learned here about introducing regulations which do not have a proper statutory basis?  The Government must obviously respect the rule of law in its own actions.  The Department of Health should consider whether it should review all regulations and ensure they are put on a proper statutory base in light of the Ombudsman's finding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, made a lengthy statement on this issue yesterday in conjunction with the Nursing Homes Association.  I reiterate that this matter will be reviewed.  It is proper that regulations be based on what is laid down in legislation.  If that is not the case, such regulations do not stand and it is far better to have appropriate legislation.  The matter will be reviewed and the Minister will report to the House in due course.</P>

      <P>In view of the near debacle of the Cabinet confidentiality referendum, has the Taoiseach considered my proposal for an informal all-party committee to examine how low turnouts for referenda and elections can be addressed by this House?  I am aware that the Taoiseach indicated some other committee might address the issue.  Given that a referendum on the serious matter of the Amsterdam Treaty is due to take place in March, will the Taoiseach indicate his thinking on that issue? What steps is the Government taking to inform the public of the contents of the Amsterdam Treaty given that, once the referendum is under way, the Government will be severely restricted in the amount of information and expenditure it will be able to undertake?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue was discussed at length during Question Time yesterday.  The All-Party Committee on the Constitution has already commenced its meetings and has started to discuss this issue.  Perhaps that committee and/or the environmental committee which is due to be set up next week could examine the issue of referenda. The Minister for the Environment has already started to look at means of ensuring that various referenda are dealt with in such a way that we can use the resources of the State to ensure that when we want to pass something we have some control over that.  The argument was made yesterday by one of the Deputy's colleagues that the way in which we are doing this, based on the Supreme Court decision, is not the best one.  All of those matters should be examined by the two committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> In relation to the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty, a White Paper on the subject will hopefully be ready prior to Christmas.  I have already stated that it is hoped to have the referendum early in the spring.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Tax Relief on Charitable Donations: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Noonan on Wednesday, 12 November 1997:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1359" /> That Dáil Éireann, recognising the invaluable work being undertaken by those charitable organisations which constitute the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group, acknowledging that tax relief similar to that being sought by the Irish Tax Reform Group is available in other European jurisdictions and in the United States, Canada and Australia, calls on the Government to allow tax relief on certain corporate donations to charities, to announce this decision in the Budget Statement of 3 December 1997, and to implement it in the Finance Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann</P>
    <P>&mdash;acknowledges the valuable work being undertaken by the large number of charities operating over a very wide range of areas;</P>
    <P>&mdash;also recognises the considerable resources and exemptions from tax already available to charitable bodies; and</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Enright, Gerry Reynolds and Ulick Burke.</P>
      <P>I support the proposal by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group that relief be given on corporate donations to charities.  I believe this proposal is supported by all taxpayers, including those who have been promised tax cuts in the budget. Regardless of how self-sufficient one is, most people will require the services provided by charities at some stage.  No man is an island and when one is old, sick or disabled one needs the help of others.</P>
      <P>In ideal circumstances all charities would be fully funded by the State.  However, this will probably never be the case.  The services provided by charities are very labour intensive and costly. These costs will continue to increase as the standard of service people rightly demand improves over time.  Charities will always have to depend on an element of fund-raising and the State will continue to depend on the charities to help it meet its responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the nation was shocked and outraged to hear on &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Brown&rdquo; tragic stories about the level of underprovision for services for people with a disability.  I am a <Col N="1360" /> member of a health board and the public would have been even more shocked if the services funded by voluntary effort were not provided. Although fund-raising cannot meet the massive level of infrastructural investment required, it can improve the quality of services, thereby improving the quality of life for recipients.  Even if the issues of compassion and human decency are taken out of the argument, there is no more cost efficient way of the State meeting its responsibilities in this area and ensuring we do not hear similar stories in the new millennium than granting relief on corporate donations to charities. Such stories are an affront to, and indictment of, all Members of the House.  I include all sides of the House in this as the problem has been allowed to develop over many years.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke glowingly of the work of voluntary fund-raisers.  They have a proud tradition of service and have made a huge contribution over many years.  I have been involved in fund-raising for St. Michael's House for more than 20 years.  However, the pool of fund-raisers is dwindling and in many cases fund-raising is now undertaken by the families of those receiving the service, people who are mentally and physically exhausted from the burden of care they carry.  These people sell tickets for prizes which are pathetic when compared to those offered by the national lottery.  They also organise race nights and sales of work.  However, the returns and audiences are diminishing as people have other calls on their money and time.  We should make it easier for those people to raise funds. Corporate donations are available at present, but not at the level that would be available if tax relief was introduced.  I understand the Minister's reluctance to introduce further tax reliefs, but there are already many reliefs in place for causes less worthy than charities.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Estimates, it appears charity organisations will have to carry the burden of financial probity.  We are talking about £3.3 million in total revenue forgone by the State.  The State could be a net beneficiary of such a measure.  At present multinational companies pay a mere 10 per cent corporation tax.  They repatriate most of their profits to the home country and probably invest in charities there because tax relief is available.  If some of those profits were invested in Irish charities the economy would benefit.  Many companies, both domestic and multinationals, would be more generous in their contributions to Irish charities if tax relief was available.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said last night he would be reluctant to grant this concession because there would be no control over money given to charities as a result of tax relief, but that is a red herring.  Every day taxpayers' money is made available to individuals, groups and organisations over which we have no control whatsoever. If controls are needed the Minister should put them in place.  Charities should not be penalised because of lack of controls.  That is no excuse <Col N="1361" /> for not granting tax relief on corporate donations to charities.</P>
    <P>This concession should be put in context.  We are talking about a maximum of £3.3 million in revenue forgone.  It is not a vast sum, it will not throw our finances into disarray and it will make no difference to the Maastricht criteria.  There is universal support for such a measure.  Nobody believes that the so-called Celtic tiger should be a predatory animal feeding off the disadvantaged and most vulnerable groups in society.</P>

      <P>The question of tax exemption for charitable organisations has been raised for years.  Charitable organisations point out that the previous Governments considered this matter but did nothing about it.  It is time something was done in this regard.  Why is tax relief necessary for charitable donations?  There are many organisations involved in charitable work such as the Conquer Cancer Campaign, the National Council for the Blind, the CRC in Clontarf, an area I represent, and the Irish Hospice Foundation.  The St. Francis Hospice in Raheny does tremendous work and there is increasing demand for its service. Unfortunately, it had to raise approximately £1 million in funding last year.  If this exemption was granted, it would be able to provide a better service for the large number of people who rely on it.  Many of the less well off in society have to rely on charitable organisations.  Our economic growth is not filtering down to those in need.</P>
      <P>We must note the recommendations of the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group and take action.  Representatives of that group have spoken to the Minister for Finance who will give careful consideration to their submissions.  I wholeheartedly support that group.  The community at large will benefit if it receives the tax exemption it rightly deserves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are discussing a private Members' motion tabled by Fine Gael which has a great deal of merit but little substance.  This issue has been a hot potato with charities for a number of years. They have sought tax breaks in the past and some have been granted.  None of us has a gripe with the great work done by charities and voluntary groups.  We all acknowledge the efforts of those who raise money for various charities at their own expense.  However, not all of the money ends up with the people for whom it is raised.  Much of the funding raised for charities is spent on administration. Most people are willing to help charities <Col N="1362" /> to ensure they maintain the services they wish to provide, but we must ensure more of the funding raised by charitable organisations ends up with the people for whom it is raised.  While I accept charities do their utmost to curtail spending on administration, they should be properly audited. Perhaps registered charities should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General from time to time.  I am not saying this is necessary, but the public would be much happier if this were done.</P>
    <P>All charities do good work whether at home, in the Third World or elsewhere and their work should be supported.  Tax relief on corporate donations is only the thin end of the wedge.  Personal donations will eventually be exempt from tax and, while I would have no difficulty with that, the amount of tax relief that could be claimed on donations from private individuals would have to be capped.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should examine another option of allocating a small percentage of the revenue raised by the State for subdivision among charities. According to 1995 figures, charities receive approximately £487 million from various Departments. That is more than £1.25 million per day from the State.  In view of that contribution, one wonders how the State can be expected to carry the extent of revenue loss currently being proposed by charities.  The charities should consult with the Department of Finance and the other funding bodies to see where common ground can be found in the future with regard to dealing with the charities' requirements.</P>
    <P>There is a need for personal donations to charities, whether they are through receipts from estates or from charitable donations during the donors' lifetimes, as most charities depend on them for their income.  However, why is this money spent in ways which do not always benefit the needy?  The administrative element of the cash take of charities is exceptionally high and people should be aware of that.  I am not criticising the charities.  I am aware that if they do not pay reasonable salaries they will not recruit people who are capable of carrying out the work they require.  However, there is a need to balance that with the efforts of people on a voluntary basis at local level raising funds which are sent to the headquarters of charities and are not spent in the local areas.</P>
    <P>This is a motion of convenience.  Every Deputy has received letters from various charities in recent months seeking changes in the current system. The charities should come together and arrive at a realistic proposal instead of the proposal the group has put to the Minister for Finance. A sensible approach is necessary.  I am not opposed to donations to charity but a capping system is necessary with regard to the amount of money that can be donated and the incentives that can be offered for such donations.  An acceptable level would be a donation of £50 per annum which would be tax exempt in the context of personal taxation.  The maximum donation from companies which should be tax exempt <Col N="1363" /> should be about 1 per cent or 2 per cent of profits. The ceiling of 10 per cent of profits, as was proposed in some of the submissions I received, is beyond what could be acceptable.  A £3,000 charitable donation from a company at 10 per cent is the equivalent of £30,000 profit if the company were given a £3,000 tax exemption.  In the case of corporate entities it is equal to between £6,000 and £7,000 of profit being tax exempt.</P>
    <P>We have sympathy for the charities.  However, the system must be tightened.  It is also necessary that charities be accountable to those who provide them with funding whether it be Departments, the Exchequer, the health boards or other organisations.  They should be open to the same examination as the State groups which provide them with funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on a similar motion in the Seanad a couple of years ago.  At that time the Minister concerned, Deputy Noonan, was unconvinced by the many speakers in the Seanad, perhaps because the motion was tabled by Fianna Fáil.  I am pleased he has had time to mull over the contributions and decide they have some merit.  Like my colleagues I have received representations from the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group which I compliment on its co-ordinating role in this issue.  I received representations from each of the charities involved and it is not my intention to focus on any individual group.  They are all worthy of our support and appreciation. For that reason it was appropriate that the co-ordinating body, the ICTRG, should press the cause on behalf of all charities.  It has given the charities a great degree of strength and co-ordination and focuses all minds on their cause.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned at the apparent differences in treatment of individual charities.  It is unfortunate that in the past funding has gone to those with the best PR machine at the expense of those with the best cause.  This co-ordinating body should remain in place after this issue is dealt with to try to redress the imbalances.</P>
      <P>My approach to the representations has been to respond to each group expressing support for the concept and to contact the Minister for Finance on behalf of each group requesting him to consider the issue in the context of the forthcoming budget.  That is why we need to support the amendment.  The amendment acknowledges the careful consideration the Minister is giving to the proposal.  I have no doubt the representations from all sides will be taken into account.  We will have to wait until budget day to hear the Minister's decision and I am sure Deputy Noonan will manage to be patient until then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a perception that charities, by their nature, are not as professional as corporate bodies. I dismiss that myth.  Charities today are large professional organisations with full-time staff and the highest of standards.  However, the fund raising base of many of them is still the voluntary worker, to whom I pay tribute.  Whether it is the <Col N="1364" /> person outside the supermarket with a bucket &mdash; I have been that person on many occasions &mdash; or the walker &mdash; my husband is permanently one of those &mdash; cyclist or parachuter, they are all worthy of our recognition for their effort on behalf of Irish charities.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the amendment pays tribute to the work done by charitable organisations in Ireland.  In an ideal world many of these bodies would not be charities but would receive all their funding from the State.  When public representatives attend meetings of various voluntary organisations the case is made that without their effort the burden on the State would be extremely high and in all probability those supported by voluntary efforts would not be catered for.  I reiterate the words of the Minister and support and pay tribute to those charitable groups who work tirelessly on behalf of the causes they represent. Even in good times, financial resources are limited and all calls cannot be met.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers said there is considerable support for charities already in place.  Exemptions from income tax, corporate tax, deposit interest tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty and probate are available in certain cases.  I do not claim to have a knowledge of many of these taxes and perhaps they cause the charities to have to do much extra work.  The Minister said Exchequer support for charities was estimated at £487 million in 1995.  This is a significant amount of money which the Exchequer must account for to the taxpayer.  However, it is money for which we get extremely good value.</P>
    <P>Direct income to charities has suffered from the introduction of the national lottery and the limitations on charitable lotteries.  There is a perception that not enough money is being directed from the profits of the national lottery to charities who are losing out because of the success of the national lottery.  If the amendment is agreed and the Minister is in a position to deal with it in the budget, more financial resources will be directed towards the charities who have made representations.</P>
    <P>Tax relief for any group is a complex issue and I do not pretend to understand it.  Any relief given has knock-on effects and inevitably results in calls for extensions and expansions.  In recent years the policy has been biased towards widening the tax base and moving away from new tax reliefs.  That is a sensible and reasonable policy.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned for some time at the absence of a statutory framework for the regulation and supervision of charities.  I welcome the commitment from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to introduce legislation on this matter.  Many people are concerned at the use of fundraising organisations who take what is often seen as an unfair share of the money raised.  They are in the minority but there is much public concern at reports which suggest that the administration costs of some of these charities has been far in excess of that for more efficient charities who <Col N="1365" /> manage to keep their administrative costs extremely low.  While this is not strictly relevant to corporate donations it is a matter which has been of concern in the public domain.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge recent funding by the Minister for Health and Children for major works at the Cerebral Palsy Ireland Centre, Sandymount and for his commitment to funding for the Irish Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus who do not receive their fair share of funding.  I understand the intent of the motion tabled by Fine Gael.  It is more or less the same as that which the Fine Gael Group in the Seanad had when we tabled a similar motion.  There is general agreement on the need to ensure where corporate donations are given, as was the case when the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn introduced the relief on donations to Third World bodies, that we will level the playing pitch and ensure the same criteria applies to Irish charities. I am sure the Minister is aware of this.  I am prepared to accept the amendment in the belief that the Minister will deal with it at budget time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ulick Burke and other Fine Gael Deputies.  On behalf of Democratic Left I express my support for the motion in the name of Deputy Michael Noonan, which calls on the Government to introduce tax relief for donations to charities, as sought by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.  Like other Members, earlier this year I received a submission from the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.  It was succinct, fully costed, modest in its demands, well argued and entirely logical in the case it made.  At a time when the Exchequer is awash with money it would take a Minister for Finance with particularly Scrooge like qualities to deny the reasonable demands of the reform group.</P>
      <P>Charitable organisations play a key role in society.  In many cases they plug the gaps in our health, social and community services.  One has only to look at the range of organisations that constitute the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group to appreciate the breadth of the role they play, organisations such as Victim Support, the Simon Community, Rehab, UNICEF, the Irish Cancer Society and many more.  It is no exaggeration to say that our society would break down without the work being done by charitable and voluntary organisations, yet in many cases they get scant recognition and little support from the Government.</P>
      <P>Most charities live a hand to mouth existence. They are almost totally dependent on voluntary fund raising which itself is subject to the vagaries of public opinion.  The financial uncertainty makes long-term planning difficult, even in regard to guaranteeing the jobs of their professional staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties in raising funds have increased enormously during the past decade due to the spectacular success of the national lottery and charities estimate they have lost up to £200 million <Col N="1366" /> in donations since it started to operate.  The reality is that unless we are prepared to contemplate a massive increase in public spending across a range of services we will continue to rely on charitable organisations in dealing with poverty, illness, homelessness and services for people with disabilities.  As long as we rely on charities to provide services that the State is unable or unwilling to provide it is reasonable that we should provide them with appropriate financial and other supports.</P>
    <P>One simple, effective and relatively cheap way in which we can assist charities is by agreeing to their modest request in regard to tax relief on donations.  The principle of allowing tax relief on donations has already been conceded by the State but only in relation to personal donations to charities operating in the Third World.  This was done in the 1995 Finance Act but the result is that we have in effect a two-tier system for charities with those doing commendable work in the Third World able to offer tax relief on donations while those doing equally commendable work at home are not.</P>
    <P>The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group is seeking to allow donations between £100 and £10,000 to approved charities to be regarded as a business expense and thus qualify for tax relief.  It further proposes that the total amount allowable in donations in any one year from any one company would be £50,000 or no greater than 10 per cent of the company's taxable income.  It believes, based on research it has undertaken, that this move would result in an additional £11 million in donations to Irish charities.  The cost to the Exchequer in terms of tax forgone would be £3.29 million, a modest sum when compared to the £40 million in tax forgone in recent years through the car scrappage scheme.  In what is in my experience an unprecedented offer from a lobby group the group states that it would agree to a suspension of the scheme in the event of the tax foregone exceeding £3.29 million.</P>
    <P>In withholding tax relief on donations to charities we are out of step with most of the developed world where such tax relief is the norm.  As a people we pride ourselves on our generosity when it comes to making donations to charities.  It is time for the State to show the same generosity.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a general review of the legislative framework governing charities.  There are, I understand, close to 4,000 bodies recognised as charitable organisations by the Revenue Commissioners.  These range from small local voluntary organisations with modest budgets and no staff to vast international organisations with multi-million pound turnovers and large numbers of staff at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Despite the huge growth in this sector we do not have an up-to-date legal definition of the term &ldquo;charity&rdquo;.  I understand the current definition in Irish law has its roots in 1601 enactments. This is ludicrous and needs to be updated urgently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> Promises of legislation have been made by successive Government but to date nothing has been forthcoming.  It is essential that we produce a proper legislative framework to govern the operations of modern charities.  This should clearly define a charity, set clear guidelines for the operations of charities, deal with such matters as how money raised can be spent, set limits on the amounts that can be used for administration purposes and specify the minimum standards for the production of accounts.  These would be welcomed by all legitimate charities and help to protect the image of the sector from the activities of the occasional rogue operation which pops up from time to time.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, if and when he is preparing the legislation, to look at another initiative which could assist charities.  This was raised on a number of occasions by my colleague, former Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I referred earlier to the difficulties being created for charities by the success of the national lottery.  Section 8 of the National Lottery Act provides that prize money unclaimed after 90 days is returned to the national lottery. Unclaimed prize money, currently estimated to be approximately £4 million per year, is returned to the national lottery and used to top up what many people regard as already extravagant jackpots. Given the level of prizes already available I doubt if the additional £4 million adds much to the appeal of the national lottery or sells more tickets but that £4 million could make a huge difference to the charities concerned.</P>
    <P>The unclaimed prize money should be diverted to a special reserve fund from which money could be disbursed to charities working in a particular area, for example, the badly underfunded area of mental handicap.  As I mentioned, it is estimated that the national lottery has taken revenue of the order of £200 million from charities since it started to operate.  This would provide an opportunity, without additional costs or significant loss to the national lottery, to restore the balance.</P>
    <P>We all accept that charities are part of the fabric of civil society.  The way in which they interact with State organisations and the critical role they play in tackling poverty and disadvantage in society needs to be given more formal recognition by the State, initially in the way suggested by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group by allowing tax relief on donations to charities.  Subsequently the legislation which governs their operations should be examined and unclaimed national lottery prize money should be used to compensate them for some of the loses they have incurred since the national lottery was established.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Gerry Reynolds and Enright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the motion in the name of Deputy Noonan which is a reasonable one in the current climate.  It calls on Dáil Éireann to recognise the invaluable work being undertaken <Col N="1368" /> by the 20 leading charitable organisations which constitute the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group. Each and every one of these organisations has a valuable role to play in catering and providing services for the disadvantaged, the homeless, the disabled, the very young and the very old.  How could any Minister for Finance at a time of unprecedented buoyancy overlook or even decline to respond to the motion?  I am sure he simply went through the formalities of tabling an amendment, as would any Minister, and will postpone announcing his intentions until budget day when he will have an opportunity to respond favourably to the needs of this worthy group.  Never before has a Minister for Finance been afforded the opportunity he will have on 3 December to respond positively to their request and recognise their good work.  Over the years these charities have stepped in to compensate for the inadequacies of Government Departments, particularly in respect of health and education and even stretching to the environment.  All too often, the needs of these sectors have been pushed aside in favour of greater capital expenditure on infrastructure and their other needs have been ignored.  Ultimately these needs must be met.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to suggest that nothing was done by previous Governments to face up to the enormity of the problem.  In 1989 the then Minister, Mr. Gerry Collins, established an Advisory Group on Charities and Fund-Raising, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Declan Costello, whose report was presented on 26 November 1996.  This clearly demonstrates that efforts have been made to tackle the problem over many years, yet nobody has had the courage to devise legislative programmes to regularise the position.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to assume that this constitutes a major demand on Government resources since a mere £3 million to £4 million is the total amount requested by these groupings.  Not alone is that all they have requested but they have guaranteed that they would request the scheme's suspension if ever its provisions exceeded those parameters, a very reasonable gesture on their part and nothing of which any Minister or Government should be fearful.  They have capped their requirements.  Very few lobby groups knocking on a Minister's door prior to budget day would have the sincerity of this grouping.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Finance will respond as positively as possible to their very meagre demand.</P>
    <P>These charities along with the parents, families and friends of these groups have rendered the living conditions of many disabled and disadvantaged persons somewhat easier, less painful and perhaps less dependent on these voluntary groups.  Does the Minister recognise that a small gesture on his part would mean an infinitely better life and living conditions for many of these people?  The figure of £487 million in Government contributions is mistaken because it represents services which would have to be provided by the Government in any case.  Were it not for <Col N="1369" /> the enormous efforts of the many voluntary groups to raise funds for these organisations the Government's bill would be much greater.</P>
    <P>On the matter of fund-raising, there are those who would assert that not everything is accounted for or sufficiently transparent.  I reject any such assertion because each and every one of the charities listed within this group has accountability as a priority.  All persons involved in voluntary fund-raising must protect their reputation and cannot afford to prevent disclosure of any of such funds raised.</P>
    <P>If we want to describe ourselves as good Europeans it is important that we align ourselves with the position in other European countries in addition to the United States, Canada and Australia.  If the Minister maintains that we are the good Europeans we claim to be, he can no longer resist standardising this position by granting a small relief of £3 million to £4 million to this group.  If there are any suspicions with regard to accountability, this would clear the air.  I suppose it is fashionable to question the operations of Third World organisations because of the standoff between GOAL and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Therefore, it is important that we tackle the matter and legislate properly for all charities.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot have its loaf and eat it.  Deputy Gilmore mentioned the national lottery. As a result of its operations all national charities have suffered enormously.  It is important that Government Departments which benefit from national lottery funding recognise that they have usurped funding which would otherwise go to the charities in question.  If the Minister for Finance levels the playing pitch, this would allow many of them to run a lotto without the former very severe capping imposed on them. It is important that the Minister urgently recognise that fact.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond positively to this request so that, following the forthcoming budget, these organisations and their wonderful work over very many years will be recognised and rewarded in this very small way.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the House, I wish to share my time with Deputy Enright.</P>
      <P>It is worth quoting the motion tabled in the name of my party spokesman on Finance, Deputy Noonan:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Eireann, recognising the invaluable work being undertaken by those charitable organisations which constitute the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group, acknowledging that tax relief similar to that being sought by the Irish Tax Reform Group is available in other European jurisdictions and in the United States, Canada and Australia, calls on the Government to allow tax relief on certain corporate donations to charities, to announce this decision in the Budget Statement of 3 <Col N="1370" /> December 1997, and to implement it in the Finance Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>This speaks volumes about the direction in which our society is going.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group should not have to lobby politicians. All Governments and political parties should recognise the amount of extraordinarily difficult work these groups undertake within our community generally.  It is my firm belief that all Members of this House would be agreeable to having the provisions of this motion implemented.  We all know the hard work done by charitable organisations and we can give examples of it.  Most of this work is done on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>We are speaking of £3 million to £4 million of a concession.  We are told every day this country is awash with money and that we do not know what to do with it.  The vulnerable and the underprivileged should be cared for as a priority.  We are not requesting an exorbitant amount of money, and it would help these organisations to develop their care of underprivileged people in our society.  The Minister has probably given a standard reply which he does not believe. Because of the lobbying of the Irish Charity Tax Reform Group, we are now aware of the constant difficulty charities face in raising finance.  I hope the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will acknowledge this in his December budget by introducing what is called for in Deputy Noonan's motion.</P>
    <P>Ireland is noted for its donations to GOAL and other charities working overseas.  However, we must take into account all charitable groups and persons with disabilities should also be taken into account.  They are the most vulnerable in our society and need all the financial help they can get.  Doing something as small and minuscule as this would go a long way towards saying politicians understand the valuable work people are doing on a voluntary basis for the most vulnerable in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House this morning should have the full support of every Member.  The Minister states in his amendment that the House acknowledges the work of such charities, recognises the considerable resources and exemptions from tax already available to charitable bodies and notes the submission from the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.  I am sad the Minister did not agree to the motion in principle so that he could grant the concession in the Budget Statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a party political issue.  We all share the common goal of improving the lot of charities which require financial assistance.  Tax relief was allowed in 1995 on personal donations to Third World charities.  The motion today is motivated by the considerable criticism of the lack of tax relief for corporate donations to charities.  There should be such relief.  Much work is done by these organisations.  The Children's Medical and Research Foundation is the fund-raising arm of <Col N="1371" /> Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, Dublin, and everyone knows the work being undertaken there.  The Irish Kidney Association, the Irish Hospice Foundation, the National Council for the Blind, the Irish Migraine Association, the Irish Wheelchair Association and many other bodies have been doing wonderful work over the years.</P>
    <P>The national lottery has been a great success, but many people who would otherwise give their pound to Rehab, the St. Vincent de Paul, the Irish Hospice Foundation, the Irish Kidney Association and others spend it on lottery tickets instead.  As it has effectively reduced the income available to these charities, the House has a duty and obligation to address that problem and it is essential it does that.  When one sees the number of homeless people in Dublin, the numbers in wheelchairs, the other people with problems I have outlined and the difficulties experienced by groups caring for them in trying to raise funding, we must realise it is essential that we help redress the imbalance which has occurred.</P>
    <P>A number of people who are directors of financial and business institutions become directors of these charities and do a great deal of good work. It is in everyone's interest to encourage more of these corporations to contribute to charities.  The Minister stated it is very difficult to work out the amount of money which would be lost to the Exchequer.  I understand the figure would be between £3 million to £4 million.  However, in the context of the benefits which would accrue and the savings which will be made by the Government in many other areas, it would be shortsighted not to grant this exemption.  It is essential it be granted.  There has been strong economic growth for the past four years and the growth rate will be approximately 7 per cent this year.  We should be able to fund this tax exemption and I strongly recommend that the Minister accept the motion.</P>

      <Col N="1372" /> Charities are largely dependent on voluntary contributions and the support of a generous public. For many years we have allowed things to turn on their heads; instead of doing charitable work, charities have been confined by the fact that they are dependent on charity.</P>
    <P>President McAleese's theme is &ldquo;building bridges&rdquo;.  Charities build bridges between the haves and the have nots, the sick and the healthy, the rich and the poor.  It is our duty as citizens, ordinary members of the public and, particularly, as Members, to ensure that their work is protected and promoted so that they can continue to build bridges.</P>
    <P>Charities are forced to undertake a wide range of activities to secure funding.  There are numerous charities and different organisations crop up every day to respond to the needs of society. Each day we are faced with public and church gate collections, flag days, children or students collecting at traffic lights, student fun days, scratch cards, lotteries, coffee and tea mornings and theme days.  The imagination of charities has been stretched to the limit to advertise their good work in an effort to secure funding.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that parents of children with special needs find that much of their time is spent raising funds rather than looking after the needs of the child.  This is why it is the Government's duty to assist in every possible way.  How can we achieve this?  The Government funds charities through the national lottery and the Exchequer. A report issued by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs called <i>Supporting Voluntary Activity</i> suggests that £488 million should be given to charities every year.  This is a very generous sum.  However, is it, or can it ever be, enough?</P>
    <P>National lottery funding has rightly been increased over the years because the money raised by charities through their own methods is decreasing.  In 1992 the public gave £246 million to charities.  In 1994 the figure was £217 million, a drop of £29 million.  During the same period national lottery receipts increased by £39 million. It is not easy to simply compare one figure with another and claim that there is a direct correlation. However, people have only so much spending power; if they give to one they cannot give to others.</P>
    <P>Those most affected by the national lottery are the charitable lottery organisers governed by the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  I welcome the charitable lotteries fund established by the Government which was advertised and launched on 8 October.  This has been established to supplement the income of private charitable lotteries whose products are in direct competition with similar products available from the national lottery. The basis for disbursing the fund is complete, fair and transparent.  However, perhaps there is also an opportunity to review the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, which places a cap on the prize money offered by charitable lotteries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> Public and church gate collections are suffering because there are so many of them and fewer people are attending churches.  I question the criteria for licensing flag days, particularly in Dublin. All too often we are faced by collectors urging us to help the unemployed and the homeless. These are general terms which give no indication of the beneficiaries or the charities involved.  Collections should be more specific and collectors should be properly trained to indicate the beneficiaries of donations.</P>
    <P>I question the use of children in so much fund-raising. For 16 years I taught in the Dominican College, Sion Hill.  The school is generous in allowing students collect for worthy charities.  As transition year co-ordinator, not a week went by without my receiving a request for help.  I was forced to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; on occasions because some of the children found it extremely difficult collecting on the streets.  They got abuse, were questioned about some of the charities, found it unsafe and had to travel in groups.  Perhaps more attention should be given to using children in collections only where charities ensure they are backed up by proper adult support.</P>
    <P>I am most concerned by the amount of charities who collect money from traffic stopped at traffic lights.  This is highly dangerous.  Students and young people dash among the traffic, pushing boxes and leaflets through car windows and then try to escape while the cars are on the move.  I hope this will be declared illegal.  I raised the matter during my time on Dublin Corporation and was told it would interfere with newspaper sellers who are part of the city's culture.  Newspapers sellers are long accustomed to the traffic and know how to negotiate their way.  However, young people out on a once-off occasion think it is great fun to dash between traffic.  This is an accident waiting to happen and it needs to be reviewed by the Garda, the local authorities and the charities. While acknowledging the charities' need to raise money, dashing between traffic is not how it should be done.  It is hazardous for both collectors and drivers.</P>
    <P>The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group made a pre-budget submission requesting relief for corporate donations to charities.  This is not a new idea.  Some groups can receive corporate relief.  For example, donations made to education, Cospóir, the arts and the Minister for Finance are allowable against tax.  It seems a natural and logical step to extend relief to charitable donations. Many OECD countries permit companies to make donations free of tax to properly registered charities.  This ensures that large companies can be more generous than would otherwise be the case.  The situation in other European countries allows us to say we will not be out on a limb.  The Government is committed to supporting the work of the charities in whatever way it can.  The Minister has adopted that principle and we can be assured of his favourable consideration in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in the House yesterday.  Everyone in Ireland is aware of the valuable work done by charities, many of which are voluntary and community groups.  They play a major role in performing important functions such as providing social services, combating poverty and engaging in local development.  All governments recognise the important work charities do and this is reflected in the level of support provided.</P>
      <P>I urge all Members to support the amended motion.  The discussion on the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group's proposal, referred to by Deputy Hanafin, seeking a tax relief on corporate donations to charities has been a useful tool in clarifying the issues involved.  While I am sure we were all convinced that we knew what constituted a charity there is now a realisation in the House that there is no comprehensive definition of a charity in our legislation.</P>
      <P>There is also a mistaken belief that the Revenue Commissioners supervise charities.  The function of the Revenue Commissioners in this matter is that it will grant bodies which have proven their case certain important exemptions from tax.  The Revenue Commissioners do not approve or register charities.  While the Revenue Commissioners randomly check charitably exempt bodies they have no role in supervising their activities.</P>
      <P>It is important to consider the criteria the Revenue Commissioners use to determine what is a charitably exempt body.  Our legislation does not contain any real definition of a charity.  Section 334(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, says &ldquo;. a charity means any body of persons or trust established for charitable purposes&rdquo;.  This is not a very useful definition.  Because &ldquo;charitable purposes&rdquo; has not been defined in law the matter has been determined by a judgment in a court case dating from the last century.  In this case four categories of charitable purpose were set out as follows: the advancement of religion; the advancement of education; the relief of poverty; and other categories beneficial to the community not falling within the other three categories.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners pointed out that the number of applications received for these tax exemptions over the years is around 12,500 of which approximately 8,000 have been approved, and it is estimated that 4,000 of these are currently active.  This is a very large number and I am sure it has surprised some Members of the House.</P>
      <P>Another point to note is that in the five years to 1996, 57 per cent of all applications for charitably exempt body status were for the fourth category, that is bodies that are &ldquo;beneficial to the community&rdquo;.  This is potentially a very wide definition of a charitably exempt body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main difficulty with the proposal to give tax relief to charities is the current lack of any form of registration or supervision of the large <Col N="1375" /> number of active charities.  Governments have been aware for some time that the current position of charities is unsatisfactory.  Members will remember the committee chaired by Mr. Justice Declan Costello to examine this.  He made a number of recommendations.  As my colleague, the Minister for Finance, said in the House yesterday, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, is examining legislation as well as a programme of reform relating to the administration and supervision of charities, based on the recommendations of the Costello report and the Burton advisory group.  This will meet the future requirements of the large number of charities operating here.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: I congratulate Deputy Noonan on raising this important matter before the budget when there will be an opportunity to debate it.  I have a personal interest in this issue.  I am chairman of the Delta Centre in Carlow which caters for up to 50 adult trainees with mental handicap.  From the experience I have had in this area, I would welcome the acceptance of this proposal.</P>
      <P>Most, if not all, charities deal with people who have a disability of one form or another.  Such disability causes sufficient problems for families without expecting them to take on the main role of fund-raising.  These families go to meetings expecting to be briefed on ways to handle problems involving a child or an adult needing special care, but the only question they are asked is whether they are free to raise funds.  That results in people not wanting to go to meetings.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago the parents and friends of people with mental handicap in our organisation subscribed a great deal of money but they tired of doing that.  I do not blame them.  I realise the health boards offer greater assistance now than they did in the past but we should do everything possible to take pressure off families who are experiencing problems in fund-raising.  Asking these people to raise funds is only adding insult to injury.</P>
      <P>A great deal of voluntary work is done by charitable organisations and people give freely of their time.  I attend the AGM of the Irish Wheelchair Association every year and I marvel at the number of people who are willing to let their names go forward for election to a committee which involves a great deal of hard work.  These committees do not get publicity.  The people involved are required to lift people and drive them here, there and everywhere.  These are the same people who are expected to stand on the streets and raise funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> I do not want to repeat what has been said already but the lottery has caused havoc for many charitable organisations.  The £1 investment which in the past could win a person £25 is no longer appealing when one can win £250,000 for the same £1.  There has been a problem with lottery funding but it already has been referred to and I will not go over it again.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to discover that if a company donates £1,000 to charity it is included in the tax bill and they end up paying £1,360.  If the company's profits are £50,000 and it pays £1,000 as a charitable donation, that is taxed.  That is unbelievable. Companies are willing to transfer money if necessary to charitable organisations, and that makes perfect sense to me.  From my own experience I know the importance of such donations to the various charitable organisations.  I look forward to a positive response from the Minister for Finance so that people will be able to devote their time to the welfare of the people they look after rather than selling tickets on the streets or holding coffee mornings. The necessity for such activities should come to an end.  I look forward to a positive result to this excellent motion tabled by our spokesperson, Deputy Noonan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies on all sides of the House who contributed to this debate and who supported universally the sentiments that underpin this motion.  I know Deputies are constrained by arrangements with Whips, but if there were a free vote in the House its view is as clear as crystal.  There is universal support for this motion and I have not heard a voice opposing its principle.  If in regard to Private Members' motions, Deputies were in a position, as they should be, to voice their opinion the Minister would be advised strongly by the House to make an appropriate announcement in the budget to implement a provision along the lines of the motion in the 1998 Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister argued this case strongly last year in the debate on the Finance Bill with the then Minister, Deputy Quinn.  It is appropriate to congratulate Deputy Quinn on his election as Leader of the Labour Party.  He has a long and distinguished ministerial career and I hope he will have a long and distinguished career as Leader of the Labour Party.  Our congratulations should extend to Deputy Howlin who was also a very able Minister and a good contender in the leadership contest.  The Labour Party is fortunate because it could have picked either of the two contenders and had a good leader.  This case was argued and the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, was well disposed to it, but on his officials' advice he did not support the proposal put forward by Deputy McCreevy.  Positions are now reversed and the same type of advice is being given by the officials.  I am not criticising them.  They are doing their jobs.  It is the job of officials in the Department of Finance and persons in the employment of the Revenue Commissioners to resist parliamentarians when they organise raids on the <Col N="1377" /> Exchequer, but it is also the job of parliamentarians if they think something is worth doing as a matter of policy to impose their policy decision on officials who then carry it out.</P>
    <P>I am amazed the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at that Department have stitched into the record the arguments made last year.  I know the burdens of office are onerous, but decent people who have strong political nous and a good sense of what is happening seem to leave that behind them as soon as they take up an official script.  They put the official view taken from the word processor in the Department of Finance on the record.  I ask Ministers in this Administration to exercise their political judgment on this because while many of the arguments put forward against the motion are valid they could be dealt with in the Finance Act.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments is that if this proposal were introduced the cost to the Exchequer would be unquantifiable and would be a serious burden on it.  The only estimate I have is that provided by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group who engaged Fitzpatricks Consultants to carry out an assessment.  They could not find a figure in our statistics in regard to the total amount contributed by businesses to charities in Ireland.  They studied the position in European jurisdictions where in almost all cases business donations have the benefit of tax relief.  They calculated the percentage of gross domestic product dedicated to the charities and applied that ready reckoner to the Irish position.  In other words, they took the European average contribution, applied it to Irish GDP and came up with a figure of £11 million. However, because there is no tax relief in that regard here it seems the amount being contributed at present is much smaller.  The figure of £11 million is a calculation of the post relief position and it is hoped that relief of £3 million to £4 million which would accrue to businesses on that level of donations might be included also as a further contribution to charities as the years go by.  There is no suggestion that there will be a major burden on the Exchequer as a result of accepting this proposal.</P>
    <P>We confined our proposal to tax relief on business donations.  We know the difficulty that would arise if it were extended to personal donations. There is a great case to be made for extending relief to personal donations but the burden on the Exchequer would be much larger because the proportion of personal donations to business donations is 20:1, even though the sums might be smaller.  There would be large administrative and Exchequer costs.  I strongly advocate that the Minister should provide for this proposal in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said there is no definition of a charity and that frightful difficulties would arise because we would not know to whom this would apply.  However, any eligible charity would have to have a CHY number.  The same series of arguments were put forward when our Administration extended tax relief to donations made to <Col N="1378" /> charities operating in Third World countries.  Last evening the Minister said there was hardly any uptake on that scheme, but we thought it would provide major funds to Third World countries. However, he said that there seems to be a very insignificant uptake on it.  He was not able to provide a figure for the loss to the Exchequer in that regard, but it seems minimal.  It is not beyond the ability of those who draft finance Bills to construct a section which would protect the Exchequer and target the types of charities we want to benefit.  It need not apply to the 12,000 applicants or the 4,000 charities currently in operation. Conditions could be included in a Bill or by way of regulation subsequently.</P>
    <P>If we are waiting for the Government to implement the recommendations of the Costello report, we will be waiting for a long time.  Mr. Justice Costello recently announced his retirement. He was in the full flourish of his career when he compiled the report.  Every party in the House and half the Deputies participated in Government since that report was published. There was no political will to implement its recommendations.  It is only being waved around now as a shield to protect an Administration that is reluctant to take a step which, politically, its Members know they should take.  This was discussed more recently on the committee chaired by the former Minister of State, Deputy Burton, when the same issues arose.  This proposal should be included in legislation and regulatory power should be conferred on the Minister to decide the parameters of who the beneficiaries should be and the conditions that should apply.</P>
    <P>We are looking for relief on business donations only and are not arguing that it should extend to personal donations.  There should be cash limits on the amount a business could contribute and on which it could obtain relief.  It would be silly to apply the relief to sums less than £100 because the bureaucratic difficulties involved would not be worthwhile or justified.  The upper ceiling should be £10,000.  The total amount contributed to charities in respect of any company for which relief would be allowed should be £5.000 or 10 per cent of the profits of the company, whichever is the smaller amount.</P>
    <P>On the advice of the charities we on this side of the House are confining and focusing this proposal. It is not beyond the ability of the Minister's officials and the Revenue Commissioners to construct an appropriate section in the next Finance Act if the will exists.  All the arguments that have been put forward were put forward in respect of tax relief for charities operating overseas which is now in statute law.  All the arguments made in opposing it were made when that provision was introduced and the sky did not fall.  The revenue losses were of such a minor magnitude that the Minister was unable to quantify them in his speech yesterday.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State, who I know is in full agreement with what I am saying, to use his influence &mdash; as Ministers of State frequently do <Col N="1379" />&mdash; by adopting this as one of his pet projects for the budget and the Finance Bill and taking responsibility for ensuring there is a scheme in place.  We will agree any series of valid provisions to ringfence this measure to meet the concerns of the Revenue Commissioners and officials in the Department of Finance.  We want to target the <Col N="1380" /> measure towards the charities we are all talking about.  We do not want it to go all over the place, to be used as a sort of scam or to apply to a series of contributions.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for returning to the House and replying to the debate.</P>

      <P>With the agreement of the House, I would like to allocate my remaining time to Deputy Richard Bruton.</P>
      <P>The report from the European Union Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is an extremely interesting and invaluable one.  The Minister has acknowledged that.  It is very important that we get an overview of the strategies being implemented in other European countries to tackle the drug issue in order that we can compare what we are doing with what they are doing.  In doing so we could harmonise the best possible approaches to dealing with demand reduction for drugs in the same manner as we are harmonising international and criminal law provisions to tackle the criminal justice system.</P>
      <P>The Minister should ensure that all Members of the House receive this annual survey in future. There will presumably be another survey next year.  The leader of the Opposition requested this debate last week but Members did not receive the report.  The Library has been put to great difficulty in having to photocopy copies of an extremely large report for Members who wish to contribute to this debate.</P>
      <P>As we were involved directly in contributing information to the survey, it should be possible for the Department to ensure that future reports of this nature, which are much more important than some of the bumph we receive in our post on a regular basis, are made available to all Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to debate this report which deals with some of the most serious issues facing this city.  Given the German and Dutch figures in this report relating to the social cost of drugs at about £35,000 and £40,000 per addict, the social cost of the drug problem in the greater Dublin area would be £300 million, of which about £50 million would represent losses of victims of crime and another £50 million the cost of prisons and policing. It is estimated that there are approximately 8,000 hard drug users in the city.  These figures put us ahead of much larger cities like Berlin, and also ahead of Vienna, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, cities that many people would regard as much more vulnerable to the problem of drugs than our own city.  However, the reverse is the case.  We have a really serious drug problem in our city and it has a very high cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important also to reflect on the recently published report on the attitudes of 15 and 16 year old young people.  That survey is a dire warning that our drug problem may get far worse.  It shows that 42 per cent of Irish 16 year <Col N="1382" /> olds have used drugs, more than three times the average instance in the countries surveyed.  We are second only to the UK.  It also shows that Ireland is the country with the easiest availability of drugs.  Availability was seen as fairly easy or easy &mdash; for cannabis by 65 per cent, for ecstasy by 51 per cent, for heroin by 20 per cent and for inhalants by 80 per cent.  Of the 24 countries surveyed, Ireland was regarded as the country where all of those drugs were most easily available.  The third finding, which is very significant, is that Irish young people have the lowest perception among the countries surveyed of the risks of drug use.  A staggering 63 per cent fewer saw heavy drinking as a great risk; 32 per cent fewer saw cannabis use as a great risk; and 5 per cent fewer saw cocaine, crack or ecstasy use as a great risk.  The message is very clear from these figures.  Irish young people find it easy to get drugs, are more willing to experiment with drugs than young people in any of the other countries, and have a poorer appreciation of the risks involved.  That is a dire warning.  The same picture is borne out in the attitude of young people to drinking.  Ireland ranks fourth in the proportion of young people who have been drunk in the past year, 66 per cent reporting bouts of drunkenness, which is a 30 per cent higher incidence than the average.</P>
    <P>Although this survey did not include most western European countries, the report we are debating today shows the picture in those countries. The only heartening thing we can see in the report is that most young people, in the context of drugs, are in the &ldquo;trying out&rdquo; phase.  Here, 75 per cent have used drugs only once.  In the UK, which shows similar findings, the vast bulk of the people had used drugs many times.  Therefore, we have an opportunity to cut this problem off at the pass.  To do that we need to have a much more effective preventive programme, in our schools first of all.  We also need to insist that the focus on the disadvantaged areas continues.  There is still a doubt in the community that the £20 million set aside for youth services development will go into the 11 communities in Dublin identified as priority ones.  We want to see that done.  We also want to see the establishment of an independent drugs commission because we have very scrappy information about the extent of the problem, and no systematic research into how effective programmes like the preventive programme in schools are.  We need that sort of research capacity.  At times it will be uncomfortable for Government because it will come up against criticism, but it is very important that we go ahead with that if we are to have a long-term impact.</P>
    <P>The commitment made by the Minister's party to establish area education co-ordinators is crucial because, as people come out of treatment and are no longer the responsibility of the Minister's Department, they must be provided with a means to progress.  That is where our system falls down at the moment.  There is no availability of progressive steps back into education, training and work, or at least back into useful channels for <Col N="1383" /> their energies.  Co-ordinators are necessary to act as mentors to people trying to shake the drug habit and bring them back into mainstream activities. Those are the key challenges we face.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Tony Gregory.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on this very important report.  The report confirms what many of us have believed for a long time, that is, that we are facing an extremely serious drugs crisis.  It goes further than that.  If we look at other information relating to young people, their use and abuse of alcohol, the high incidence of smoking, suicide and teenage pregnancy, we can only come to the conclusion that we are facing a major crisis in relation to our young people, and that bodes badly for the future.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat disappointed by the Minister's comments on this report last night, the general tenor of which was quite defensive.  Purely from a health perspective, and with occasional references to law enforcement, he trotted out once again what the Eastern Health board and other agencies are attempting to do about the drugs problem.  Let me give credit where credit is due &mdash; much progress has been made over the past year or so in the context of the health response, and some progress has been made in the context of the justice response also.  It is unfortunate, however, that the Minister did not seek to place this report and this issue in some kind of social context.  The information contained in it signals yet another symptom in terms of the direction young people are taking.  It is important to look at this in a much wider context, in terms of where we are going as a society and where our young people fit into today's society.  We have to address the reasons so many of our young people seem to have no purpose in life and why there is so much experimentation with harmful substances, whether drugs of one kind or another, alcohol or cigarettes.</P>
      <P>There are very big issues facing us as a society. We have to bear in mind the very rapid rate of change over the past ten years on both the economic and social fronts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor is the declining influence of the Catholic Church and the fact that that influence has not been replaced by anything else so that once people stop practising their religion they are left with little in terms of points of reference for themselves regarding standards of behaviour. This is quite a significant problem.  I am aware that there would be huge reluctance on the part of the Government to become involved in this area, but we have no choice other than to address the moral agenda.  For many years we depended on the Catholic Church to provide moral education. Clearly that is no longer happening in the case of vast numbers of people.  There is an onus on the State to step in and examine the general ethos and mores in society and how they can be <Col N="1384" /> shaped.  Too many people are left without a point of reference in their lives and that needs to be addressed.  Growing materialism has turned off many of our young people so that they are no longer clear about their place in society and purpose in life.</P>
    <P>The decline in a sense of community is a huge problem and that affects young people in particular. Most of our generation grew up in very straightforward, simple times where we knew where we stood in regard to the rest of society. Many young people do not have that comfort any longer.  A period of rapid change and great social turmoil is especially disconcerting for young people trying to come to terms with life.  The unfortunate increase in family breakdown in recent years, the changing shape of families and of relationships between men and women and those between parents and children are factors. As legislators we need to turn our attention to them.  It is unfortunate the Minister did not seek to formulate the report in a social context.</P>
    <P>It is critical that various relationships within society are examined and the absence of parenting for many young people is recognised.  Role models should be created to provide the support which many unattached people desperately need, particularly young parents.  A great deal could be done by health boards and various State agencies in terms of strengthening family relationships and unless such basic social problems are addressed other symptoms, such as the increasing drug problem and incidence of alcohol abuse and teenage suicide, will not be tackled.</P>
    <P>One of the most disturbing aspects of the report is the profile of drug users as it does not fit the accepted stereotype.  Drugs traverse all class boundaries.  A growing body believe in the decriminalisation of certain drugs.  However, I reject that line completely.  People who talk in those terms are thinking of university students who dabble in cannabis, see nothing wrong with it and then get on with their careers with the terrific opportunities open to them.  They will move past this stage to lead a fulfilling life.</P>
    <P>It is also important to look at recent reports, particularly one by the Garda Síochána on the incidence of drug use which shows that over 50 per cent of drug addicts started meddling with cannabis, alcohol and tranquillisers and then rapidly progressed to harder drugs.  There is no doubt a strong link exists between the use of so-called softer drugs and the quick progression to the harder drugs culture.</P>
    <P>This issue was not given the attention it deserved in recent years partly because it was confined to the Dublin area.  I have been frustrated in the House during that time as I attempted to ensure urban issues received the attention they required.  I was staggered when I first entered the House by the very strong rural bias that exists throughout all parties.  That works against problems being experienced in the Dublin area, particularly heroin abuse.  The majority of Members could afford to totally ignore that issue <Col N="1385" /> and in most cases choose to do so.  Many Dublin Deputies could choose to ignore the growing drugs problem and survive by concentrating their attention on middle class areas.  The price is being paid for such negligence.</P>
    <P>Tackling the drugs issue effectively needs to be approached on three different fronts &mdash; supply, demand and treatment.  The establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau last year was the single greatest achievement in making progress in terms of supply.  It brought all relevant agencies together to work in a co-ordinated fashion, which people had sought for a number of years.  It is now enshrined in legislation and the benefits are there to be seen.  There is potential for widely extending the work of the CAB because it does not just have a role in tackling the major drug barons.  Flats or houses are raided by the drugs squad on a regular basis in the Dublin area.  They may not find drugs but could discover £20,000 or £30,000 hidden under a floorboard.  It should be possible in such cases for the drugs squad to call in the CAB to investigate the matter further. There is scope for using the bureau for the less prominent players in the trade.</P>
    <P>More gardaí and dedicated drugs squads are needed in urban areas.  For too long a small fraction of gardaí worked in this specialised area and it needs to be greatly beefed up.  Some improvement has taken place over the past few months but more specialised people working in dedicated units are required.  There is room for much more progress in terms of estate management in all local authority and other housing estates where supply is concerned.  I carry out a great deal of work with people on drug watches in my constituency, particularly in the Ballymun area.  We meet on a regular basis to review the situation and time and time again the same complaint is made.  People operate in partnership with Dublin Corporation and the Garda providing local intelligence and information which is so important to them.  The corporation then seeks eviction orders in the courts which is where the problem arises.  The person waits six to nine months for a hearing, comes before the court without legal representation or with some other excuse and the case is further delayed.  The corporation probably secures an eviction order 12 months later which is then appealed and the case is put back for another six months.  This has a devastating effect on morale in local authority estates where people have worked closely with the authorities.  It takes a huge battering when there is such a delay in the legal system.  It is a major problem and undermines the progress made over recent months at community level.  A special court is needed to deal with drug related housing cases to restore confidence in our communities and to fast track the system so that such communities can deal speedily and effectively with the people destroying them.</P>
    <P>Education has a role in the demand reduction aspect of the problem but it should not be over-emphasised. <Col N="1386" /> It is important for all young people to be made aware of the huge dangers involved in taking drugs.  It is also important to provide a proper life skills programme which will give young people other options and the courage to withstand the peer pressure which is so pervasive in the drugs culture.</P>
    <P>One cannot over-emphasise the capacity of education to tackle this problem effectively.  Too many young people lack a purpose in life.  For many of them it is the risk involved in taking drugs that is attractive.  Unless we tackle the root causes of the problem, for example, social issues and the problems relating to poverty and family breakdown, we will not make significant inroads in dealing with it.  Education can play an important role in changing young people's perception of many drugs.  Too many young people are not aware of the dangers of drugs and compare many of the so-called softer drugs with alcohol. The perception of both these substances needs to be changed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Eastern Health Board is making progress in this area but there is still a problem with community attitudes.  There is an onus on all public representatives to have the courage to support the provision of treatment centres and make the case for them to their constituents. If we are to get to grips with the problem we need a significant number of major treatment centres and a large number of smaller satellite clinics in almost every community.  We must also ensure we do not concentrate solely on the use of methadone.  The main argument centres around the use of methadone and selling the benefits of it to communities, but we must think in terms of a range of treatments which can be made available in all treatment centres depending on the needs of the addict.</P>
    <P>Obviously treatment must be locally based and there must be a greater concentration on rehabilitation. The health board is beginning to make progress in this area but there must be a widespread rehabilitation programme for the 7,000-8,000 heroin addicts in the Dublin area.  This problem poses huge challenges not only for health boards but for all State agencies.  FÁS and the Department of Education must also become involved in this issue.  I am extremely disappointed at their poor response to the drugs problem in recent years.  All agencies must play a part in helping young people to return to a life of normality and to avail of the education and training facilities to which their counterparts in other areas have access.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to progress implementation of the protocol governing the prescription and dispensation of methadone.  Some progress has been made in this respect and an implementation group is considering the matter.  The use of methadone is a major issue in the Dublin area but there are no regulations governing it.  For example, GPs can take on as many clients as they wish and pharmacies can dispense methadone to as many clients as they wish.  This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> It gives methadone a bad name and makes it very difficult for the health board to gain public support for its services.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the protocol is put in place as quickly as possible so that chemists and GPs can sign up to it.</P>
    <P>The situation in prisons is absolutely disgraceful. Given the position in Mountjoy Prison, I am ashamed to say I am a public representative.  Will the Minister urge his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to take charge of the matter and sort out the chaotic conditions in Mountjoy Prison. A very large number of the inmates in Mountjoy Prison are drug addicts and we must provide treatment for them.  This means tackling the problem of the supply of heroin within the prison and bringing in the Eastern Health Board on an agency basis to provide treatment services similar to those available in communities.</P>
    <P>Some of the people availing of treatment in the community end up serving sentences in prison where they go back on heroin.  The lack of a decent treatment programme in Mountjoy Prison means some of these people may contract the HIV virus or develop AIDS.  The State will have a serious case to answer in such circumstances. The situation in the prison is an utter disgrace and I urge the Minister to work with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in sorting out the problem and providing a full range of treatment services.</P>
    <P>We spend much time trying to sell the benefits of treatment centres to communities, yet there is a captive audience in Mountjoy Prison crying out for such treatment.  If this service is not provided we will be flying in the face of the provision of rehabilitation and basically telling these prisoners we are not prepared to help them and that after they serve their sentence they can go back out into the community and continue their life of crime to feed their habit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for sharing her time with me.  When I ask questions about the extent of the drug problem I am usually told that the level of seizures by the Garda reflects the extent of the problem.  If one applies that criterion to the seizure of £8 million worth of amphetamines and huge quantities of cocaine and heroin in the past few weeks then the problem is much worse and more extensive than it was at any time in the past.  Unnamed gardaí have stated in reports in the newspapers that this is their belief.  I share that belief.  Despite the major setback they suffered following the murder of Veronica Guerin, the criminal gangs which control drug distribution are regrouping and are now more dangerous than they ever were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened intently to the Minister's speech and while I generally accept the overall direction and analysis outlined by him I am not convinced that the Government is fully committed to taking the necessary action to deal with the heroin problem, particularly in Dublin.  Due to time constraints I <Col N="1388" /> will confine my remarks to the heroin problem. The Minister rightly said we do not know the extent of the problem.  We know the number of people attending treatment centres, some of whom have a long history of involvement with heroin, but we do not know the number of young people in disadvantaged areas who are smoking heroin and who are well on the way to addiction. The problem is much more extensive than the figure we are given &mdash; it increases by 1,000 every few years.</P>
    <P>The only way to establish the correct figure is to act on the promise given by the previous Government &mdash; this Government gave a similar promise during the election campaign &mdash; to set up a specific research body with the sole responsibility ascertaining the facts and figures on the drug problem.  Every other European country with a major drug problem has a specific research body dealing with it.  The research measures referred to by the Minister are <i>ad hoc</i> and piecemeal. They do not provide for the resources, staff, secretariat or access to experts with time to provide an analysis based on accurate information. If that is not done, we will drift on without the information we need to build the correct strategies, fill the gaps and work on the successful models of intervention in other countries which may be brought into play here.  That is absolutely critical, but there is no indication there is an immediate attempt or commitment to set up such a research body.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the £20 million provided for the youth services development fund, a point referred to by Deputy Bruton.  I do not have time to refer to the Minister's comments on this matter but, reading between the lines, it appears that money will be spread nationally.  If that is the case, it will be wasteful and will have no impact. The money must be concentrated on areas of deprivation, particularly the ten areas in Dublin and the area in Cork.  That is only a minor measure in dealing with social exclusion and social inequality.  The Minister said the overall policy is correct and that drugs are a manifestation of social exclusion and social disadvantage, but heroin is the real problem.  It is critical the £20 million is concentrated in areas that need it most, which have been identified.</P>
    <P>A sum of £10 million has been allocated to implement the task force proposals, but more than £10 million will be required to implement all the proposals cleared by the national committee, and there is no commitment the money will be available.  That may be an oversight, but such commitments would be welcome.  Definite action should be taken based on the work being done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comments about treatment centres.  There is need for solidarity among public representatives.  They should not use this as a political issue and should not overburden any particular area.  Each area needs to look after its own people who are addicted to drugs.  Mistakes have been made in the past &mdash; I will not mention some of the treatment centres <Col N="1389" /> that are a scandal and have turned people and communities throughout the city against such centres, regardless of how small or localised they are.  Those mistakes must be rectified.  Public representatives should give leadership at local level to ensure the proposals for local centres are supported.</P>
    <P>The work carried out in some centres outside Dublin, for example, by Sr. Concilio in Athenry and Bruree in Limerick and Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll in Cuan Mhuire in Athy, is first class.  Those centres provide detoxification treatment and long-term rehabilitation.  More of that work is needed.  Based on my experience and from talking to people who deal with this issue, centres such as those have a very high success rate.  Since long-term rehabilitation produces success, the Minister should ask his advisers to see what can be done to give further assistance to those centres outside Dublin and work with people to establish other centres.</P>
    <P>I will not become involved in the methadone controversy because I am not qualified to deal with it, but I have grave doubts about some aspects of it.  Some chemists who provided a service in the early days when no one wanted to deal with addicts have built up a huge clientele.  One such chemist in Inchicore in my constituency, who has received a great deal of publicity, played a part in ghettoising that area and bringing down what was a fine urban village.  The Minister said that 50 or 60 chemists take part in the scheme. There must be a limit on the number of people who attend those chemists.  I accept efforts are being made in that direction.  If the Minister wants communities and residents to accept the necessity of treatment, urgent action must be taken.  As long as abuses continue, the public perception will be that, regardless of the type of service provided, the position will be similar to that in Inchicore and Pearse Street.</P>
    <P>I am concerned the resources available to the Criminal Assets Bureau restrict it to high profile cases &mdash; I am aware that is the primary responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, but the Minister referred to it.  I witnessed cases &mdash; Deputy Shortall referred to others &mdash; where mid-range drug dealers sold houses which they had been flaunting up to now, and nothing was done about it.  The work of the CAB does not extend to communities.  It does not follow up the middle men who make fortunes.  That matter must be dealt with.  An inter-agency project in which I am involved in the north inner city is drawing up proposals in that regard.  I regret I do not have further time to deal with this issue in greater detail, but I will avail of another opportunity to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for drugs and drug addiction. Like Deputy Gregory, I have worked in this area since the early 1980s.  I admire the work he has done over the years and his efforts to achieve <Col N="1390" /> recognition for this problem.  I welcome the Minister's speech and the indications that he is willing to pursue the drugs problem.  This debate concerns one of the most serious and complex issues facing the country.  Too often people come up with simplistic answers to the problem.  There are no simple solutions to it.  Parents often ask why young people get involved in drugs.  There are at least 60 different reasons.  I am concerned about the simplistic approach that states deprivation is the main cause of the drugs problem.  Evidence shows it is merely a contributory factor.  Those who indulge in wild parties after receiving examination results seldom come from deprived backgrounds.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the debate, it is many years too late.  There has been a long delay in accepting the seriousness and extent of the drugs problem. Some sections of society have failed to accept responsibility in this area.  To put it mildly, there has been a muddled approach to the fight against drugs and alcohol.  The medical profession could not agree on whether the matter should be dealt with by psychiatrists, psychologists or general practitioners.  Its main concern was about where responsibility should lie and consequently little action was taken.  In 1983, when I accused general practitioners of creating 80 per cent of the drugs problem in Cork, a headline in the local paper stated &ldquo;Lord Mayor unfair to doctors&rdquo;.  I did not pull that statistic from the air.  Gardaí, pharmacists and others involved in compiling the 1983 report of the committee on drug and alcohol abuse specifically identified that the problem in Cork related to prescribed drugs.  I was merely bringing this message to the people and trying to resolve the problem.  Since then the Irish Medical Organisation has learned a great deal and has disciplined people who were out of line, but much damage has already been done.  Some medical personnel discounted the extent of the problem. I recall a banner headline relating to the Dublin scene stating the problem was a figment of some politicians' imagination.  We now know who was correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general public also had a muddled approach to the problem.  Some parents smugly claimed their children would not get involved in drugs and pitied the parents of those children who did.  I constantly pointed out to such people that, but for the grace of God, their children could be on the wrong street corner or at the wrong party and experiment with drugs or alcohol. I also pointed out to them that if they did not get involved as concerned members of society their homes could be robbed by those involved in drugs.  I encouraged them to get involved even on those selfish grounds.  It took a long time to get people committed to resolving the problem.  We need the general support of the public to this community-wide problem.  We all have a role to play.  I have been involved in the drugs problem since 1982, but I do not have a medical background. I have talked to people with such a background and used their experience and knowledge <Col N="1391" /> to deal with the problem.  The approach of politicians was also a case of &ldquo;the curate's egg&rdquo;.  Some people, such as Deputy Gregory and others, raised their concerns here and elsewhere, but many others hoped that by not talking about the problem, it would go away.  We now know that will not happen.</P>
    <P>Those facts are of historical significance only. Unfortunately, we have failed to come to grips with some aspects of the problem.  From time to time there is reluctance to make difficult decisions.  People have argued against certain solutions, such as installing scanner and security cameras because of a breach of civil liberties and so on.</P>
    <P>Young people take drugs for the same reasons the majority of us started taking alcohol but there appears to be reluctance to link drugs and alcohol. Because so many of us drink alcohol, we are reluctant to talk about drugs under the same heading.  The Southern Health Board was the only health board to make a policy decision linking the two.  In 1983 the committee on drugs and alcohol abuse recommended that health education officers should be employed to deal with the drugs problem and the first such person was appointed in 1996.  However, the Department informed us it could pay him only for the time he spent working in the drugs field.  We were told a different section would have to pay him if he spoke about the evils of alcohol.  I made a formal protest about the matter and I hope the position has changed since then.  That type of approach has prevented us from dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory claimed the £11 million EU funding should be targeted specifically at areas threatened with a heroin problem.  While I understand the logic of his argument, in the past three or four years some excellent programmes on the prevention and treatment of alcohol abuse have been implemented in the Southern Health Board area at a cost of approximately £1.25 million.  Last year we needed approximately £400,000 to implement these programmes.  We received £125,000 to cater for Cork and Kerry and to implement an excellent programme which included health promotion, provision of social support, research monitoring and evaluation and treatment intervention.  We were told £125,000 would have to do for our programme but three months later there was another announcement. Somebody had decided that Cork North-Central, a constituency within the Southern Health Board area, had a heroin problem and that £1 million was to be allocated to a new group to be set up there.  This group did not have expertise in drug and alcohol treatment or in dealing with or devising programmes for it.  It was a community group.</P>
    <P>That approach was contrary to what I had been trying to have implemented for the previous 15 years.  I was shocked £1 million could be found so easily and handed over for a certain area.  Cork is a tidy city in size.  It is beautiful and a river runs through its centre.  However, somebody in their <Col N="1392" /> wisdom decided there was a heroin problem on one side of the river and used that premise to allocate £1 million.  It was decided there was no such problem on the other side of the river so that area did not receive any money.</P>
    <P>There could be only two sources of information on the background to the drug problem in Cork. One is the Southern Health Board and the committee of which I am chairman and the other is the Garda Síochána.  I spoke to the Garda Sergeant involved in that area and neither of us had made a submission on the matter.  However, somebody in the Department or the Government was able to allocate funding to the area.  I felt strongly about the matter because the committee had put forward an excellent programme.  It was agreed at national level that our programme was the most forward looking, practical and comprehensive of the programmes put forward by the eight health boards, yet we could not get funding for it.  That was not due to a lack of funds but because a group of people decided to allocate the funding elsewhere.  This is indicative of the muddled thinking I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>We must focus on the drug problem.  I agree with Deputies who spoke about the need for full information about the extent of the problem, the reasons for and background of it and the issues involved.  We received £50,000 to carry out a study of the health board area but we would have used more money to get further information.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that available funding is targeted at the areas which can best use it and which have a proven track record, whether that means funding a community group in Dublin or a branch of the Southern Health Board in Cork and Kerry.  At least there should be consultation with local people involved with the problem.</P>
    <P>There is wide acceptance of the extent of the drug problem.  Unfortunately many years were lost before such acceptance was achieved.  A previous speaker said we should look at the experience of other countries.  However, this is Ireland's problem and we must get our act together, although we can learn from and join others in tackling it.  In that context, Cork is involved with ECAD, European Cities Against Drugs.  There is a conflict in Cork's approach with that taken in Dublin because ECAD policy is based on drug free treatment of alcoholics and drug addicts.  If an area uses methadone as part of its policy it is in conflict with the approach in Cork.  Many cities throughout the world have adopted the ECAD programme and are seeking to implement it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory referred to Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll. He was one of the employees of the Southern Health Board who set up the first unit, Arbour House, in 1984.  He carried out an excellent study of teenage-adolescent alcohol and drug abuse based on the people who went through that centre.  The information in his report should be widely distributed and used where it can be useful in other areas rather than re-inventing the wheel, as it were.  If we want to gather information we <Col N="1393" /> should approach the people who are already involved in that area, even if there might be disagreement on how to deal with the problem.  The Hazelden Centre in New York, for example, promotes a drug free approach.  Centres such as Tarbor Lodge and Talbot Grove in Cork and Kerry, the centre in Bruree and the centre in Athy, where Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll is based, insist on a drug free programme.</P>
    <P>Dublin is in a unique position in that its drug problem is largely based on heroin abuse.  It is not my place to say how the problem there should be handled and what programmes or treatment should be used.  By the same token, however, there is no sense in the Dublin administration, whether it be the health board or other groups, telling the rest of the country to set up methadone clinics in every town.  There is a need in Dublin and it must be tackled and, as I am not the gardener in that patch, I will not say it should be done.  However, a number of people need alternative treatment which does not involve methadone.  A motion regarding methadone treatment was put before the health boards about three years ago and defeated.  That type of loose thinking does most of the damage.</P>
    <P>One reason the public is reluctant to get involved in this issue is that it does not understand the problem.  People think there is a huge difference between drugs and alcohol when there is not.  We are lucky to have organisations, concerned parents and others to run programmes aimed at preventing people taking drugs or to treat or rehabilitate drug addicts.  We are also lucky to have an organisation such as the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, which is seldom mentioned when credit is being given to the AA and other organisations.  Preventative groups such as the PTAA are often seen as holy Joes but they should be appreciated, lauded and helped.  We should try to establish groups within the public which will encourage people to take the early step of saying they will not get involved in drug abuse. The question &ldquo;why do people abuse drugs?&rdquo; is often asked and there are at least 50 responses.</P>
    <P>Denial of the problem handicapped our efforts for a long time, particularly with regard to alcohol. The head in the sand approach has caused huge damage.  A minimum of £5.5 million is spent each day on the abuse of alcohol yet we claim we do not have an alcohol abuse problem.  If we make the same claim about drugs we will never deal with that problem.  We must accept we have a problem and proceed from there.</P>
    <P>A new issue has come to our attention recently, that is, the call for the decriminalisation of drugs, particularly cannabis resin.  The call tends to emanate from a section of society which could be described as the intelligensia and it is gaining momentum, particularly in the European Parliament. That worries me.  I am worried that a media commentator can blithely claim there is no danger in dabbling with drugs.  I also worry about pop stars and sports stars who tell young people it is great to take drugs.  Ten years later we read <Col N="1394" /> their stories under banner headlines such as &ldquo;My Horror with Drink and Drugs&rdquo;.  We must be wary and organised and there must be debates such as this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comments and I am glad he is willing to support anti-drugs projects. However, we must go further and that will involve funding.  The funding that becomes available as a result of the activities of the Criminal Assets Bureau should be immediately directed to groups such as the Southern Health Board.  They have the programmes and personnel in place and they need the funding now.</P>

      <P>In preparing for the EU Presidency the previous Government sought to make the drugs menace its theme.  It was a decision consistent with the exceptional measures both on the criminal law side and on the demand reduction strategy side that the Rainbow Government put in place domestically to confront the worsening drugs problem.  For a decade or more successive Governments had neglected to tackle the drugs problem which is primarily an opiates problem, mainly heroin.  I was pleased that my party, Democratic Left, played a lead role in transforming Government policy towards the drugs crisis.  The measures and strategies put in place by the previous Government can only be reversed at society's peril.  The drugs problem has taken root and the damage done has been severe in terms of human life and misery inflicted on entire communities. On all sides of the House and, perhaps more importantly outside in the communities ravaged by the drugs scourge, there has been a welcome for both the first and second reports of the ministerial task force, of which I was chairman.</P>
      <P>After years of neglect that induced alienation and hostility in the communities worst affected, the mood has been transformed to one of positive co-operation and hope.  The single most important factor in this transformation is the partnership concept at the heart of the 13 local task forces we set up.  Almost without exception these have won the support of the local communities and where previously there was objection, obstruction and hostility there is now support, commitment and co-operation.  I am immensely proud of that success but unless my successor involves himself in continuing to give political leadership and in driving the implementation of the comprehensive recommendations devised, the serious outstanding problems will not be tackled effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I avail of this opportunity to extend my best wishes to the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, who is taking over that responsibility.  He is a good choice for the job because he has an understanding of the phenomenon of deprivation and long-term unemployment that has contributed to the worsening heroin problem in this city.  The drugs problem in Ireland is not merely about the abuse of opiates, it is clear to anybody who has studied the problem that the phenomenon of heroin, concentrated in Dublin, is the most serious <Col N="1395" /> and desperate aspect of the drugs menace.  The Minister of State, Deputy Flood, is well qualified to continue the drive I am proud to have been a part of in the last Government.  It was ungracious of the Minister, Deputy Cowen, not to acknowledge, as the Taoiseach and other Deputies did when on this side on the Fianna Fáil benches, the manner in which that ministerial task force in the previous Government transformed the fight back against the drugs menace.  It has totally transformed the attitudes of these communities.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Dennehy.  I appreciate he was not a Member in the last Dáil and, therefore, may not have had the opportunity to read the reports.  I do not wish to deal with the point he raised about the division of Cork by the River Lee and the reason there is a problem on the northside and not on the southside.</P>
    <P>The 13 areas were selected essentially on the basis of the figures for those presenting for treatment. There is a direct link between drug abuse and multiple deprivation.  That is a fact on the basis of expert advice.  I am not challenging Deputy Dennehy's conviction that there is a drug problem outside that phenomenon and reports such as the ESBAD to which the Minister, Deputy Cowen, referred clearly show that to be the case.  We cannot get away from the fact that there is a direct link between multiple deprivation and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>The situation in Dublin was shamefully neglected by all Governments in the previous 15 years.  The consequences are horrific in some of those communities.  I was able to persuade the previous Government to resource the recommendations prepared in those two ministerial reports.  The Government allocated £14 million to underpin the recommendations of the first report of the ministerial task force and £20 million in respect of the proposals in the second report. Unless the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, continues to give political leadership to this assault on drugs and unless he continues to drive the response agreed on all sides, and more importantly outside in the communities, it will not effectively tackle the phenomenon that has besieged these communities.</P>
    <P>The report from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction bears out the gravity of the drugs problem and especially draws attention to the phenomenon that has attracted less attention.  It states:</P>
    <P>The unprecedented number of Europeans, of an increasingly young age, who are using synthetic drugs such as ecstasy, LSD and amphetamines as part of youth culture, . the users are not from marginalised or disadvantaged backgrounds, but are for the most part young workers or students and relatively well off.</P>
    <P>This may be the area to which Deputy Dennehy referred.  The main value of the report is that it makes available to Governments comparable information on drugs and drug addiction throughout <Col N="1396" /> Europe.  This is a valuable contribution even if it is not altogether clear that the methodology for collection of the raw data is consistent throughout.  It appears different polling techniques are used, prompted to a large extent by a recognition that since the abuse of hard drugs is illegal, the problem is often hidden.  It is no surprise to find Ireland missing from the comparative tables of serious drug abuse because it has surveyed the problem less systematically than some other countries claim to have done.  For example, in respect of the opiates problem the first report of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs, of which I was chairman, concedes that: &ldquo;we have no accurate count, but there could be up to 8,000 addicts in the greater Dublin region&rdquo; and again &ldquo;we have no accurate qualitative measure of the size of the problem.&rdquo;. It goes on to state: &ldquo;we do have an indicator &mdash; statistics are compiled on the numbers of drug abusers presenting for treatment&rdquo;. That ministerial task force expressed the view that:</P>
    <P>It is essential that every effort is made to obtain and compile valid, concrete data on the true extent of the drugs problem.  This data is necessary in order, first, to accurately quantify the problem and also to provide the base for epidemiological analysis and modelling.  Such epidemiological research is necessary to:</P>
    <P>assist in the long-term targeting of drugs services;</P>
    <P>ensure that an appropriate mix of services is provided, based on need; monitor progress and measure effectiveness; and help determine the appropriate level of Exchequer funding of the drugs services.</P>
    <P>I understand from public statements that the reports of the ministerial task force established by the previous Government have been adopted by the Government.  Its first report concluded that:</P>
    <P>.the lack of valid, concrete information on the nature and extent of drug misuse in this country needs to be addressed.  Notwithstanding the difficulties involved in compiling such information, there is a need for accurate research to assist in the longer term targeting of the drug services and to ensure that an appropriate mix of services is provided, based on the evidence for their need and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Since the Government has declared its commitment to overseeing the full implementation of the first report of the ministerial task force, will the Minister indicate the state of progress on the implementation of our recommendations in respect of databases?</P>
    <P>On the face of it, the finding of the EMC report that an increasing number of young people are resorting to the use of synthetic drugs as part of a youth culture is the most interesting conclusion. I find it difficult to discern the reliability of the <Col N="1397" /> data listed.  However I read comment from people at the coalface to the effect that only parents and politicians are surprised at the extent of the problem. If it means what it seems to mean, the claim, for example, that almost four out of ten school-going teenagers admit they have used cannabis is surprising.  It is difficult to evaluate the seriousness of this conclusion.  As one journalist put it, is the finding mitigated by &ldquo;once behind the bicycle shed&rdquo; bravado?  It is not surprising that cannabis is the most used drug in the European Union.</P>
    <P>The EMC report should be read with a major report from ESPAD on alcohol and other drug abuse among students in 26 European countries which I have just received and which has been the subject of comment by Nuala Haughey of <i>The Irish Times</i> who has followed the drugs crisis here.  The report reveals that &ldquo;Irish 16 year old students are top of the class of 26 European countries in terms of binge drinking&rdquo;; second, after the United Kingdom, when it comes to taking cannabis or other illegal drugs and second, after the Faroe Islands, when it comes to smoking.  These findings are not just surprising but shocking.</P>
    <P>One conclusion of the ESPAD report that must be taken into account by the Minister and policy-makers generally is that teenagers in the main are introduced to drugs by their peers or siblings. Only 2 per cent of students who had taken illegal drugs said they had been introduced to them by strangers.  Dr. Mark Morgan, a psychologist, who carried out the research among 1,900 16 year old students in 80 schools in 1995 is quoted by Nuala Haughey as saying: &ldquo;The idea that some people have that there are pushers hanging round schools who give kids drugs and then hope they'll get them hooked and so on isn't the case&rdquo;.  In other words, the link is not directly between the suppliers and the kids but rather kids are being supplied by other kids.</P>
    <P>Dr. Morgan's conclusion is: &ldquo;For policy-makers this shows clearly that prevention starts with friends and that you can't blame the supply of drugs for the drug problem&rdquo;.  It is clear that prevention starts with friends but I am not convinced the supply of drugs is not part of the problem. However I reluctantly accept that no matter how effective the supply side measures are there will still be drugs available.  The question therefore is if we can tackle the demand side effectively.  This question dominated the first and second reports of the ministerial task force which dealt with a comprehensive strategy aimed at treatment, research and information, rehabilitation, education and prevention programmes.  They also dealt with the questions of estate management, sports facilities, community policing and the allocation of resources.</P>
    <P>When in Opposition, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, produced a report which he had blatantly cogged. If imitation is the best form of flattery, I accept the compliment.  I welcome this because it means, as the Taoiseach said, the Government is committed <Col N="1398" /> to implementing the recommendations of the reports of the ministerial task force.</P>
    <P>Some cosmetic changes have been made.  As we have not yet had an opportunity to tease them out at Question Time &mdash; I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, will deal with them &mdash; I am not sure whether they have been made for the sake of being different or whether they are meaningful.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether it was a good idea to abolish the ministerial task force.  As the records will show, it met virtually once a week.  Immense work was done and valuable evidence heard from experts such as the governor of Mountjoy Prison and representatives of the probation and welfare service, the Eastern Health Board and so on.  It appears the ministerial task force is being supplanted by the Cabinet subcommittee of which the Taoiseach is chairman.</P>
    <P>The structure established by the previous Government took the form of the local unit, the local drugs task force, a partnership between the local community and the various statutory agencies with responsibilities in this area.  It reported to the ministerial task force which, in turn, reported to the Cabinet subcommittee which was chaired by the Taoiseach.  As chairman of the ministerial task force, I was in a position to report directly to the Cabinet subcommittee, the secretary to which was an assistant secretary in the Department of the Taoiseach.  That was an effective structure that went to the heart of decision-making. This was reflected in the allocation of resources.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, or the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, deal with this aspect of the matter?</P>
    <P>The question of community policing seems to have been conveniently passed over by all concerned. Will Members on all sides cast their minds back to the marches and protests we witnessed virtually every night on our television screens and to the attempts made by certain persons to fill the vacuum by applying their own policing methods and taking direct action?  Besieged communities on the streets of this city, particularly in my constituency, which did not receive an adequate response from the Garda Síochána, were sometimes satisfied to accept help from elsewhere.  It was the recommendation of the ministerial task force that more Garda resources should be deployed in a community policing role.  In the event the Garda Commissioner proceeded with Operation Dóchas on which I commend him and which has made a contribution.  The Operation Dóchas concept is different from that of community policing.  In some of these communities it ought to be a priority of policymakers that there be no alienation from the Garda Síochána, so that they can implement community policing in these worst affected areas.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation that he will have my support in the lifetime of this Dáil.  Perhaps he or the Minister of State at the <Col N="1399" /> Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, would clarify the position about the £20 million youth services development fund, one of the main proposals of the second report of the ministerial task force.  Preventing an entire generation falling into the clutches of the drugs menace necessitates a strategy that makes available recreational and other opportunities for children who might otherwise resort to drug misuse.</P>

      <P>In response to the various queries Deputy Rabbitte raised, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Flood, will be contributing shortly and I hope he will deal with the replacement of the ministerial task force by the Cabinet subcommittee and the £20 million youth service development fund.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the very valuable work undertaken by Deputy Rabbitte in the previous Government.  The work undertaken by that ministerial task force has proved to be extremely valuable.  It is the intention of this Government by and large to implement its proposals and build on its work.  We all owe Deputy Rabbitte a debt of gratitude for the tremendous work and long hours put in and the very valuable recommendations of that task force which I acknowledge without hesitation.</P>
      <P>While copies of these reports have not yet been made available to the Department of Education and Science, the initial briefing information available to us gives considerable cause for concern. The indications are, especially from the survey undertaken of the school-going population aged 15 to 16 years, that some of our worst fears have been confirmed.  People dealing with the misuse of drugs among young people and others such as parents, teachers, youth workers and the Garda have been expressing anxiety about these trends for some time.  In spite of the success of the Garda and customs authorities in increasing seizures of cannabis, that drug continues to be widely available. It appears that young people are prepared increasingly to experiment with cannabis.  The use of ecstasy appears to have become an indispensable part of certain aspects of the pop music scene.  The use of both drugs does not appear to be confined to any particular social group or geographic area.  Heroin use continues to be a major concern in urban disadvantaged areas, especially but not exclusively in Dublin.  The phenomenon has begun to appear to a disturbing degree in certain parts of Cork and in Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite its known dangers, levels of cigarette smoking among young people show no significant <Col N="1400" /> signs of decreasing.  Drinking alcohol continues to be a major problem and, if anything, is increasing among young people and at younger age levels. It is because of concern about the increasing availability and use of both legal and illegal drugs by young people that my Department has become actively engaged in introducing substance misuse education programmes in schools at primary and post-primary levels.  The various initiatives have been gaining momentum in recent years.  In general terms the approach has been to encourage schools to introduce programmes of social, personal and health education to achieve some balance in the curriculum.  The aim is to ensure that the personal and social issues facing young people are dealt with in an appropriate manner in schools.  It is in that context that substance misuse prevention education programmes are presented to schools.</P>
    <P>The indications are, from the ESPAD survey, that up to 37 per cent of our 15 to 16 year olds have experimented with the use of cannabis at some stage, an alarming figure which does not take into account the fact that many of these were once-off users of cannabis.  There are no statistics available of people who use cannabis regularly. We are also told that our figures are somewhat on a par with those for the comparable age group in the United Kingdom, the implication being that if 37 per cent of our young people have experimented with cannabis, 62 per cent have not.  I regard that as cold comfort since 37 per cent is quite a frightening figure.</P>
    <P>When the full report is available to my Department shortly I can assure the House it will be considered very carefully.  There is no room for complacency.  It must be accepted that illegal drug use among young people is increasing together with the use of alcohol and continued cigarette smoking.  This underlines the need for us to redouble our efforts to curb the supply of illegal drugs and to educate our young people and the population generally about the dangers inherent in the use and misuse of drugs.</P>
    <P>A further interesting indication from the survey undertaken of 15 to 16 year olds is that the first use of illegal drugs is with friends and that such experimentation takes place as a group activity, the particular illegal substance having been obtained from &ldquo;friends&rdquo;.  This shows the important influence of peer groups, a factor of particular significance for education programmes for young people.  This influence has been known to those concerned with the development of education programmes and has been a very important factor in their preparation.  It clearly demonstrates that young people must be helped to understand the influences on their behaviour and learn the personal and social skills necessary for independent decision-making.  That is why emphasis is placed on social and personal skills and the promotion of healthy lifestyles in our schools programmes.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the statistics available in this report merely highlight the extent of the problem <Col N="1401" /> that has become evident in recent years to those who work most closely with young people in our youth services.  The report clearly demonstrates that young people have become the most vulnerable category in terms of the threats drugs pose to individual communities and society in general.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that youth organisations, youth workers and volunteers are faced with an increasing level of drugs related problems among young people.  However, I am convinced that the flexible approach of youth work, which encourages assertiveness, self-esteem and responsibility, reaching out to those most at risk, is an ideal medium for implementing demand reduction strategies among young people.  Youth work has been a particularly successful form of intervention in terms of reducing demand for drugs among young people.  That is the case for a number of reasons, on which I intend to concentrate in the course of redrafting the youth work Bill which will have to be introduced since the legislation produced by the preceding Government has become unworkable following the abandoning of the proposed regional education boards.  I have examined that legislation very carefully, particularly within the context of the importance of youth work and organisations in reducing the demand for drugs.  The Bill I will present to the House, hopefully in January but at the latest in February next, will be very different from the Act which has become redundant.</P>
    <P>The youth service is particularly well placed to respond to the pressures experienced by young people in relation to drugs, particularly with regard to youth culture, unemployment, isolation, social exclusion and peer pressure.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that the second report of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs recognised the inherent suitability of youth work as an approach to drugs education and prevention.  In doing so the report recommended the establishment of a youth services development fund to provide substantial additional funding for the expansion and enhancement of our youth services over the next three years.  The Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation will refer to this matter in greater detail in the course of his contribution.  For my part I intend to ensure that young people gain the maximum benefit from this initiative and that our youth services are enabled to fulfil their immense potential in combating drug abuse among the young.</P>
    <P>However, in order to realise the optimum benefit from initiatives in the drugs area, it is important to have available reliable data relating not only on the extent of drug abuse among the young but on the particular attitudes that lead them to pursue a drug-abusing lifestyle.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the partnership approach of this Government, I have provided funding for the National Youth Council of Ireland to undertake a survey which will seek to establish the influences and attitudes that lead young people to develop a drug habit lifestyle.  We must all be sufficiently <Col N="1402" /> strong to accept that the spread of drugs is due, in part, to the commonality of our young rather than to their differences; hence all backgrounds are susceptible to its influence.  In addition to garnering contemporary facts and figures, this survey will seek to analyse those attitudes which influence teenagers to lead a lifestyle that includes drug-taking.  The proposed sample of 1,400 young people will be sufficient to achieve the best geographic and demographic spread across the country and enable cross-analysis of attitudes specifically in relation to criteria such as gender, age group and location.  I am confident the responses of young people to this survey will be of enormous assistance in developing strategies to combat drug abuse.  I have asked for the survey to be completed within the shortest possible timescale and I hope to have the results in January.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science is involved in a number of substance misuse prevention measures.  For example, a comprehensive programme of substance misuse prevention was introduced in second level schools in late 1994 and that will be expanded considerably.  A substance misuse education programme is being developed for primary schools and we look forward to substantial developments in that soon.  In addition, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health are cooperating in the development of the health promotion schools network.  It is linked to other such networks in Europe.  After the current school year, the network experiences in Ireland will be disseminated to primary and postprimary schools. In addition to that, the Department of Education and Science participates in the work of the national drugs strategy team.  There is room for development there which I am sure my colleague will deal with.</P>
    <P>It will take time for educational programmes to show whether they are influencing behaviour.  No magic wand can be waved which will result in the immediate elimination of substance misuse in a society.  We must ensure we are introducing the right programmes based on the reasons young people use and misuse drugs.  That is why the survey I expect to have after Christmas will be extremely interesting and very useful.  Programmes must be implemented in an appropriate way.  There is little value in preaching and sermonising. It is a paradox that the more the dangers of something are highlighted, the greater the attraction it becomes for some.  That is something we must take into account in developing these substance abuse programmes.</P>

      <P>Is í fadhb na ndrugaí galar mór na h-aoise seo a thrasnaíonn aois, aicme agus áit. The 1997 report of European Union's Lisbon based drugs monitoring agency confirms a worrying trend which has been obvious for a long time in this country.  Nearly 40 per cent of Irish 15 to 16 year olds admit to having used cannabis, the number of addicts under 25 years of age undergoing <Col N="1403" /> treatment in this country is more than double the European Union average, and the number of drug related deaths in this country has increased six-fold over the past decade.</P>
      <P>No public representative in this capital city can be in any doubt that cannabis is widely available and misused.  In 1985 gardaí and customs officials seized a total of 43 kilograms of cannabis.  By 1995 that figure had increased to nearly 16,000 kilograms.  Enormous profit can be made from the sale and distribution of this illicit drug.  Evidence given before the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court this week indicated that the gang leader who organised the importation and distribution of cannabis in this country between 1994 and September 1996 grossed approximately £16.8 million in that period.  Those who organise the importation of cannabis to this State do so not as part of the liberal crusade to make soft drugs available but for monetary reward.  The professionalism of their operations include the targeting and marketing of cannabis to vulnerable teenagers.</P>
      <P>This House has always provided tough penalties for those who distribute and control drugs.  In the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, a penalty of 14 years' imprisonment was provided for those who possessed drugs for the purpose of sale or supply. In response to the growing menace of drugs, the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, increased that penalty to life imprisonment.  Despite massive seizures of drugs over the past 13 years, I am unaware of a single person convicted of the offence of the possession of drugs for the purpose of sale or supply who has been sentenced to life imprisonment. It is time for this House to revisit the issue of sentences for drugs distributors and to provide for a minimum sentence for those in possession of a substantial quantity of controlled drugs.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly support the proposal contained in the Fianna Fáil position paper on drugs published in March of this year, <i>A Radical Approach to Drugs and Drugs Related Crime</i>, which proposes a new offence of drug trafficking for substantial monetary reward which would carry a minimum sentence of ten years' imprisonment. That alone will not solve the problem but it will act as a significant deterrent to those prepared to import drugs to this country and to facilitate their distribution.  I am also aware that this proposal has been criticised by many on the Opposition benches, but I do not accept the argument that a person in possession of controlled drugs with a street value of £10,000 or more is in some way a small player or a pawn in the drugs industry.  People who possess such a quantity of drugs, including cannabis, know full well its capacity to cause destruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of treated drug misuse in the greater Dublin area for the five years 1990-94, carried out by Kathleen O'Higgins and published by the health research board shows that cannabis was replaced in that period by heroin as the most commonly used primary drug.  It also confirmed that the percentage of persons who first misused <Col N="1404" /> a drug between the ages of 15 and 19 increased from 55 per cent to 68 per cent.  Those are the years when teenagers are at the greatest risk from a drug pusher.</P>
    <P>If we are serious in our attempts to reduce the incidence of drug addiction, we must put substantial resources at the disposal of those who seek to form and shape the activity of 15 to 19 year olds. We must ensure adequate sports facilities and personnel are available.  Idleness, either enforced or optional, is the greatest asset of drug pushers. The Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown local drugs task force recommends the recruitment of drugs education and intervention officers and childcare staff, the formulation of a youth service proposal for an &ldquo;alternative high&rdquo; programme, leaflets for primary schools, training for sports leaders, support for women as carers and family therapists. These recommendations demonstrate the nature of the work required to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure the Garda has sufficient resources to properly police and monitor areas and locations where 15 to 18 year olds gather. This is especially important in relation to discos and raves.  Many raves are thinly disguised supermarkets for drug distribution.  Gardaí are frequently powerless to move in and close down these operations.  Garda superintendents should be given the power to order the immediate closure of raves where drugs are being distributed. They should also be given similar powers in relation to all other licensed premises.  While this would be an extension of their powers, it is comparable to powers given by the Oireachtas and upheld by the courts in other areas.  Under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, Garda chief superintendents are empowered by section 29 to issue a search warrant authorising the entry and search of a person's house.</P>
    <P>The threat to the future of this country posed by those who deal in and distribute illicit drugs is as real as the threat posed in the past by unlawful organisations and our response should be commensurate. There were 3,859 detected drug offences in 1995.  That is only the tip of the iceberg. Those figures do not tell us what percentage of the £46 million stolen in Ireland in that year was stolen in drug related crime.  It is clear that addicts need money and they obtain it from larceny, burglary and robbery.  An addict with a relatively modest drug habit will need between £50 and £100 per day to fund his addiction.  Many will consume up to £200 of heroin per day.  An addict stealing cash in robberies or muggings will need to steal between £18,000 and £40,000 per year simply to feed his habit.  In many instances the amount will be greater, as much as £75,000.  If an addict tries to fund his habit through the theft of goods from houses or shops the value of goods necessary to steal will increase dramatically.  The harsh reality is that each serious addict is a one man crime wave.  This House has shown the capacity and resolve to tackle the drugs issue.  It must continue through policies in health, education, justice and other Departments in a joint <Col N="1405" /> effort to show that we have the capacity and resolve and that together is féidir linn deireadh a chur le galar na ndrugaí sa tír seo.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this report.  The figures it contains are frightening in their implications for the physical and mental health of young people and their ability to learn and remember.  Most of all it is frightening for their ability to contribute as solid and productive citizens.</P>
      <P>What is most frightening is that, for the first time, we are seeing figures which indicate that Irish teenagers drink more alcohol and use more drugs than those in other countries.  This may signal some other disturbing fundamental changes which are occurring in our society.  I use the word 'may' because there are difficulties in cross-country comparisons in surveys of this nature.  It may be that Irish teenagers are more honest than their counterparts elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Over the past 20 years Irish society has changed at an unbelievable pace and much faster than in the previous 2,000 years.  The Ireland that teenagers are growing up in is as different as it could be from the country in which most Members of this House grew up.  The authority influences, constraints and rules which operated in the past and controlled our behaviour have all changed and are still in a rapid state of change. Young people may be receiving mixed messages from adults who themselves may not have a more broadly accepted value system.  We are all coming to terms with change and the throwing out of old values.  This is a challenge for us all.  We must put the new Ireland into a context in which we can live.</P>
      <P>If this Ireland is a challenge for us, how difficult an environment must it be to grow up in?  It is a world in which there are no rules or values which seem immutable.  That was the advantage we had when growing up but it is not available to young people today.  Materialism is the only certainty left &mdash; the pursuit of products, the sense that there is something we can buy which is the answer to everything, the notion of instant gratification for almost every want and whim.  Perhaps this is the primary message that young people are picking up from adults.  Perhaps, even by the age of 14 or 15, their palates are so jaded that they are already looking for the next fix, buzz or product.  I do not wish to exaggerate and I do not pretend to have the answers, but these questions need to be discussed by politicians, churches, parents and society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past we primarily associated the drugs problem with socio-economic disadvantage.  That is where the problem is at its greatest and where heroin abuse is causing horrendous social and <Col N="1406" /> public health problems.  However, this survey is telling us something else.  The survey is not confined to socially deprived areas.  It covers the gamut of Irish society and it indicates a definite and significant rise in the use of recreational drugs.  I do not like the word &ldquo;recreational&rdquo; but that is how they are described.  It is almost as if youngsters increasingly see drugs and drink as lifestyle accessories which are accepted by their peers as the way to recreate.  This indicates the operation of forces other than deprivation.  These are forces which we may have entirely missed in our approach to the drug problem.  It is important to identify these forces if we are to respond correctly as politicians.  The National Youth Council will shortly carry out a survey based on attitudes and motivations.  If possible, this report should come before the House as it might give some insight into what is going on.</P>
    <P>Demand reduction is the key to solving the drug and drink problem.  Over the past two years there has been a raft of legislation giving additional powers to the enforcement agencies. These powers are beginning to pay dividends. Virtually every day the newspapers contain news of seizures.  The agencies are to be congratulated on their successes.  However, it would be naive to think that we are going to stem the supply of drugs and that Ireland alone will succeed in doing so.  Other countries with far greater resources have failed to do so over a longer period of time. Increasingly, resources and attention must be directed towards demand reduction.  Treatment for existing abusers is essential and many more resources have gone into health boards to deal with this problem.  I plead with politicians to pursue their electorates to accept the need for local treatment centres.  That is the key to solving the problem.  If services are difficult to access they will not be used.  People are naive if they think there is no problem in their community.  There is a problem in every community.  Demand reduction is the way forward to prevent children from getting into the areas which lead them from drink to drugs and into a lifestyle which is irredeemable.</P>
    <P>Underage drinking takes place openly in Dublin. I am sure it is the same elsewhere.  It is there for everyone to see in parks, public spaces, laneways and derelict sites.  This is where youngsters learn to smoke, drink and take drugs.  It is also where the problem of teenage pregnancies begin. It is the kindergarten of drug abuse.  Incredibly, this behaviour is largely ignored.  Gardaí seem to adopt a benign attitude to these gatherings. Understandably, they are dealing with serious crime and these youngsters may not do harm to anybody.  Nevertheless, this is where they are learning to &ldquo;do drugs.&rdquo; If we are serious about stemming the tide of under age drinking and drug abuse we must put resources into this area where the problem begins.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, he has taken to improve the safety of the Irish fishing fleet in view of the facts presented by the Report of the Fishing Vessel Safety Review Group which stated that 64 per cent of the vessels inspected suffered serious deficiencies.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to implementing the recommendations and objectives of the Fishing Vessel Safety Review Group, having due regard to availability of required resources.  A number of important steps have already been taken to improve fishing vessel safety on foot of the report of the review group.</P>
      <P>I announced at the end of October an £11 million investment in the modernisation of the Irish fleet.  This involved some £3.0 million in EU grant aid for 112 fleet modernisation projects under Ireland's Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-99.  This investment is aimed primarily at the whitefish fleet to enhance safety on board vessels and will help maximise the return to fishermen and maintain jobs in the sector.</P>
      <P>I am working to put in place, with EU agreement, a pilot grant aid scheme for a number of new whitefish vessels.  I am also pursuing all other options that will promote investment in the fleet including making the industry attractive to providers of capital by examining the scope for the provision of fiscal incentives.</P>
      <P>In addition, agreement has been essentially secured on Ireland's national programme under the EU Fleet Programme 1997-2002, MGP IV. The MGP IV Programme for Ireland provides that safety improvements may be excluded, on a case by case basis, from vessel tonnage calculations for the purposes of the programme.  This will ensure that vessel owners are not penalised for making safety improvements to their vessels.</P>
      <P>There have also been significant developments in the crucial safety training area and the Department has been working closely with BIM concerning the establishment of new and more accessible training facilities.  BIM has launched two mobile coastal training units which will bring training in the safe operation of fishing vessels to strategic locations around the coast.  In addition, BIM is in the process of establishing a new fisheries training facility at Castletownbere to service the south coast region.  BIM has also recruited three additional professional training staff who are specialising in the provision of safety skills instruction.  These additional training resources strengthen BIM's overall programme to significantly improve the safety competence of fishing vessel crews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> The review group identified the absence of mandatory social insurance cover for fishermen as the cause of many trained deckhands leaving the fishing fleet.  This situation has since been addressed and share fishermen now qualify for full PRSI cover.</P>
    <P>Having regard to onshore marine radio communications, the Department has recently installed new medium frequency transmitters at Belmullet and Rosslare which will enhance radio coverage and improve emergency response to fishing vessels operating off the north west coast and in the Irish Sea.  In addition, it is proposed to instal VHF digital selective calling equipment at Irish Marine Emergency Service coast radio stations.</P>
    <P>On the subject of search and rescue, a new medium lift helicopter is to be provided on the eastern seaboard.  Tenders for the helicopter are currently being evaluated by the Department and I expect this important facility to be in place on 1 July next.  The all weather night flying Dauphin helicopter currently based at Baldonnel will then be relocated to a base on the south or south east coast.  These two measures will significantly enhance search and rescue coverage, thereby contributing to the safety of the fishing fleet off the east and south coasts.</P>
    <P>The Department is currently putting in place the necessary administrative and technical staffing resources to enable the drafting of comprehensive new safety regulations recommended by the review group.  These regulations will cover fishing vessel construction and equipment, the carriage of specified radio equipment and increased training and manning requirements.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of three additional marine surveyors is at an advanced stage and it is hoped they will be appointed by the end of the year.  A further additional marine radio surveyor is also being recruited.  As well as providing vital technical assistance in the drafting of the safety regulations, the surveyors will also be involved in the implementation of a strict enforcement regime which will include regular structural surveys and safety equipment inspections for fishing vessels.</P>
    <P>A new Fishing Vessel Safety Management Committee is currently being established to oversee the implementation of an overall safety programme for the sea fishing sector.  A new specialised Fishing Vessel Safety Unit is also currently being set up in the Department.  This unit will support the work of the committee, facilitate the development of a co-ordinated safety strategy and liaise with surveyors in the drafting of comprehensive safety regulations for the industry.</P>
    <P>The Department is currently developing a safety awareness campaign which will attempt to highlight safety issues particularly relevant to fishermen.  A new series of safety brochures entitled &ldquo;Safety on the Water&rdquo; were published earlier this year by the Department's Marine Safety Working Group.  One of these booklets deals specifically with fishing vessel machinery failure which has been identified by the rescue <Col N="1409" /> services as the main cause of emergency incidents involving fishing vessels.  Copies of this useful booklet have been circulated to the skippers of all fishing vessels on the register for distribution to their crews.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the comprehensive safety programme for the sea fishing sector will necessarily involve ongoing consultation with the industry, which has a vitally important part to play in developing a safety culture among fishermen. The Department has recently been in contact with the representative organisations in the fishing industry with a view to arranging an early meeting to discuss the ongoing implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Fishing Vessel Safety Review Group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was influenced by a series of unfortunate accidents involving trawlers between 1 January 1990 and 31 August 1997 which resulted in 33 fatalities.  We all regret the unfortunate tragedy in 1995 when six people were lost on the <i>Carrickatine.</i>  The steps the Minister intends to take on the safety of vessels are welcome, but will he agree that part of the problem affecting our fishing fleet is the profitability for the catchers.  The people making a great deal of money in the fishing industry are the processors and the distributors.  The catchers do not appear to have the finance to upgrade their vessels.  In a policy document Fianna Fáil said it will examine the possibility of equipping all fishing vessels with some form of electronic locating device.  That is a valid commitment.</P>
      <P>With regard to vessels under 24 metres, and the vast majority are in that category, will the Minister agree there is some validity in the State giving the maximum assistance to fishermen to provide basic safety equipment such as electronic locating devices?  If fishermen do not have the financial resources to upgrade their vessels, it is absolutely vital that the State helps them.  Will the Minister outline his policy on safety improvements for the future?  Also, will he comment on the decision taken by Bord Iascaigh Mhara in 1993, as a result of the resignation of an instructor, with regard to a coastal unit to provide fishing training facilities for fishermen?</P>

      <P>I mentioned in the reply that at the end of October I announced an £11 million investment for the modernisation of our fishing fleet.  That money will go mainly towards providing the safety measures mentioned by the Deputy.  It will mean a substantial injection of funds, with EU assistance, into this area.  It will provide aid for 112 fleet modernisation projects under the Operational Programme.  I am concerned about the question of further assistance for that area and I will do all I can to find the necessary moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of recent meetings in Luxembourg, instead of having to reduce our fleet it is almost certain we will be able to maintain it at approximately its current level.  Some £4 million was set <Col N="1410" /> aside for decommissioning.  That money will be available and I will dedicate it to this area.  That will give a further fillip in this respect.  At present some £6 million of EU aid is not committed to the fleet under the programme.  I will review the priorities to ensure we get the best return in terms of upgrading and modernising the fleet from the point of view of the grant aid available. A major boost was given to this area the week before last during negotiations in Brussels.  That will enable me to increase the amount of money for this area by approximately £4 million.</P>

      <P>I welcome the aid for the modernisation of our 112 vessels and the emphasis that will be placed on safety measures.  I remind the Minister that 44 per cent of our fleet is more than 25 years old.  Will the modernisation of our fleet be concentrated on the newer vessels and to what degree will it percolate to the 44 per cent of the fleet that is more than 25 years old?</P>

      <P>The Deputy might remember we announced the introduction of a pilot scheme under which four new vessels would begin to tackle this problem.  We have had some success in our discussions with the European Union and the Commission in that regard.  I expect we will be able to provide assistance for more than the four we promised.  I will consider this matter from different points of view.  I accept the Deputy's point.  That pilot programme was introduced as an initial step.  I cannot say at this stage how much beyond it we can go, but the position will be improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the concerns of the aquaculture industry in relation to the imposition of rates on land based fish farms under the Valuation Acts. This primarily affects salmon smolt and trout producers. However, with the ongoing development of the industry new land based projects such as holding and purification facilities for shellfish as well as eel and turbot facilities are coming into the net also.  I am sympathetically disposed to the case made by the industry to be given parity of treatment with the agriculture sector.  I am also aware that fish farmers in Northern Ireland and Scotland do not pay rates.  This can create a competitive disadvantage for our industry in the EU marketplace.  Since taking up office I have been pursuing the issue with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, with a view to obtaining a satisfactory resolution.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on their ministerial appointments. I appear to be following the Minister from one Department to another in terms of marking him.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, for his commitment to the removal of the iniquitous tax applied to fish farming because it is one of the only primary food producing industries subjected to that form of tax.  Is the Minister of State aware that up to 3,000 jobs are dependent on the survival of this industry?  Is he also aware that unlike similar industries in the UK, Norway and other countries on the Continent, it does not receive subsidisation?  Will he agree that if he were prepared to make this change he would honour a commitment given by his party to the IFA before the last election?  It is important to fulfil what has been promised, particularly having regard to the disadvantages to which this sector of the primary food industry has been subjected.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his congratulations and good wishes and no doubt we will see much of each other.  I am conscious of the job levels in the industry.  I am also conscious of the Deputy's point concerning our commitment to the removal of rates.  I wrote to the Minister for Finance a week ago and the letter I received from him states:</P>
      <P>Under existing valuation legislation, fish farms are considered rateable and it would require amending this legislation to remove the burden.  You may be aware that the draft heads of a Valuation Bill are at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department.  The purpose of the proposed Bill is to modernise and streamline the valuation code.  I have already indicated that I intend to consider the issue of rates on fish and shellfish farms when the draft heads of the Bill are being finalised.  It is hoped to be in a position to circulate a draft Memorandum and heads of a Bill to all Departments in the very near future.</P>
      <P>The IFA's Fish Farming Section has been actively campaigning for me to grant an exemption from rates to fish farmers in the forthcoming budget. Because of the constitutional constraints to do with local government revenues, it will not be possible for me to consider this question in the context of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has confirmed the removal of rates will follow the legislative process.  Under the 1986 Valuation Act fish farming was not included in the provision dealing with agriculture, horticulture, forestry and other sectors. Apart from the parliamentary procedure followed in terms of consulting the parliamentary draftsman's office and heads of Departments, can the Minister of State indicate when the Bill will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot guarantee when the Bill will be published, but it is at an advanced stage <Col N="1412" /> and I am confident it will be introduced in the near future.  I assure the Deputy and the former Minister, who had a particular interest in this area, that I will vigorously follow up this matter.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>the progress, if any, he has made in negotiations with the United Kingdom regarding greater control and monitoring of the flags of convenience ships registered in the United Kingdom, most of which fish in Irish registered waters.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a key priority of mine to ensure that all fishing vessels, including flag ships, fishing in our waters are strictly monitored and controlled both at sea and in port.  I am also pressing other member states to play their part in controlling the activities and landings of flag ships.</P>
      <P>Virtually all flagships operating in Irish waters are registered in the UK.  It follows that effective co-operation from the UK authorities is essential for Ireland as the coastal State directly concerned. We have a good level of liaison and co-operation on control matters and Department officials meet their UK counterparts regularly to maintain and enhance that co-operation.  I will be meeting Minister Cunningham within the next few weeks to review a range of fisheries issues of bilateral concern, including flag ships.</P>
      <P>In addition to building on existing co-operation with the UK as the flag state concerned, I am also pressing the Spanish authorities to improve significantly the policing of landings by flag ships into their ports.  As the Deputy is aware the landing pattern of flag ships poses particular enforcement problems.  I met Minister Palacio in Vigo last September and I am confident that our ongoing bilateral discussions and contacts with the Spanish authorities will produce results in terms of improved control.</P>
      <P>I am also pushing in Europe for demonstrable commitment by all member states to delivering effective control of fishing activity.  When I met Commissioner Bonino in July I stressed the urgent need for the Commission to bring forward new proposals aimed at enhancing control measures for flag ships in particular.  I will be pressing Minister Cunningham, as incoming Chairman of the Council of Fisheries Ministers, and Commissioner Bonino to ensure that these proposals are expedited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also pleased to report that at last month's fisheries council meeting I won agreement to a package of measures which will significantly enhance Ireland's ability to act against illegal fishing by flag ships and other vessels in our waters. In addition to new conservation measures to protect juvenile stocks, member states agreed to the introduction from July next year of &ldquo;real time&rdquo; catch reporting by fishing boats entering and leaving Irish waters.  Up to now boats had to <Col N="1413" /> report their exit and entry, but not the quantities of fish on board.  This agreement will be a vital additional weapon in the monitoring and detection of over fishing and illegal catching in the Irish zone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used the words &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo; and &ldquo;enforcement&rdquo; and these are valid.  I remind him, however, that the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Party programme for Government spoke about seeking the banning of flags of convenience fishing vessels from Irish waters.  How successful has the Minister been in trying to achieve this objective?  As an objective I am sure it gained many votes for the Minister's party from fishermen.  Indeed, it was backed by one of the fishery organisations.</P>
      <P>Regarding his statement on juvenile fish, does the Minister feel this will conteract the situation that exists where the Spanish are allowing under size fish to be landed?  These fish are landed from Irish water and the Spanish still have secret compartments to hide them.  Can the Minister see the controls he envisages in Spanish ports counteracting the illicit activities of Spanish fishermen?</P>
      <P>The 150 flag ships operating in Irish waters and registered in the UK are catching fish which would be valuable to our fishermen.  While those fish form part of the quota of the UK, the host country, they are ripping out our fishing stocks. We are hearing the same type of buzz words used in July when the Minister was questioned by Deputy Barrett.  Following his talks with Mr. Cunningham and the Spanish Minister, can the Minister assure us that he will achieve his objective of banning the flags of convenience fishing vessels from Irish waters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, there were two very significant developments at the Luxembourg council meeting a fortnight ago.  Because they are so recent and occurred close to the same time of the general election, there has not been much coverage of these developments.  However, they are highly significant in the context of flag ships entering Irish waters.  The Deputy is correct when he says UK flag ships are legitimately fishing for UK quotas in our waters, but the problem is that in our view they are over fishing and are taking more than they are reporting.</P>
      <P>At an early stage I set about getting approval for the concept of a weighbridge in the sea whereby flag ships on entering and leaving our waters would have to report their catch.  At present they only have to report that they are entering and leaving our waters.  It is highly significant that from 1 July 1998 they will have to report the quantities of fish they have on board on entering and leaving our waters.  They can be inspected at any time on the basis of those records.  This will provide a very tight and greatly improved control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secret compartments are a separate matter and must be discovered.  Even without secret compartments, a vessel could enter Irish waters claiming <Col N="1414" /> to have a certain tonnage on board and that in our waters it collected a relatively small quantity, thereby taking far more than the quota allocated. Our intention was to stop that activity and introduce a method of assessing catches.</P>
    <P>When I had ministerial responsibility for this area in the early 1990s I visited Howth Harbour where a young fisherman displayed an idea he had for a square mesh window at a certain point in the top of the nets as a means of conservation and letting juvenile fish escape.  I presented this idea to the Department and requested studies on it.  The report of these studies showed the concept to be highly successful.  At the Luxembourg meeting I was able to get agreement to this upper square mesh window which is very effective in dealing with the problem of juvenile fish.  Those at the meeting, including the Spanish, agreed that this should become mandatory, starting with prawns and then other species.  The people whom the Deputy and I speak to on the quayside are those who know the business and it is significant that the idea of a young fisherman has been adopted as an EU wide measure of conservation which will achieve one of the outcomes the Deputy is looking for.  I will be interested to see it in practice from next July and I am assured it will be effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is committed to a policy of increased diversity of species in Irish forests, including those managed by Coillte Teoranta. This policy is outlined in the Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector, which has been approved by Government. Included in the strategy is an objective of reducing sitka spruce to 60 per cent of total annual afforestation.  Diversification is, of course, dependent on the suitability of the site to be planted. The policy is implemented through the Department's afforestation grant and premium scheme, which favours the planting of diverse species and broadleaves.  Coillte, as well as other private planters, are participants in the national afforestation programme.  The Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies, in its report on Coillte Teoranta published this year, recommended that Coillte should agree a programme with the Department for the phased reduction of Sitka spruce planting to a level of 70 per cent by the year 2000.</P>
      <P>Coillte Teoranta is a private commercial company in which decisions are taken on a commercial basis.  Notwithstanding this, and in view of the Joint Committee's recommendation, my Department is engaged in ongoing communication with Coillte</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> Teoranta on this issue.  The company has recently assured the Department that it is committed to a reduction in the percentage of Sitka spruce planted annually, where it is commercially viable to do so.  The achievement of this objective is very much related to land intake and the quality and the suitability of that land for the planting of Sitka spruce.  However, every effort is being made by Coillte to achieve its objectives.  My Department's grant and premium scheme, which I referred to earlier, will be used to encourage progress by Coillte in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's intention to abide by the objective of 70 per cent planting of Sitka spruce by the year 2000.  The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and its predecessors were too lax with planters over the years.  More than 85 per cent of our plantations seem to comprise Sitka spruce.  Is the Minister of State aware that some financial experts say that, if current trends are anything to go by, more than 50,000 jobs will be lost in western Europe by the year 2000 in the pulp and paper industry because of a slump in demand? Paper pulp is what most Sitka spruce is designed to become.  If that is the case would the Minister of State consider substantially improving the grants for native broad leaf species?</P>
      <P>It appears that many of the Sitka spruce plantations were located in mountainous regions where elderly people resided.  No consideration was given to the fact that the spruce was blocking out daylight for those people.  I make particular reference to the Borlin Valley in my own constituency where permission was given recently to a non-national to plant 300 acres of the valley with Sitka spruce.  In the coming five years that will cut out the light of day for the inhabitants of the Borlin Valley basin.  The Department should get its house in order with regard to planning regulations for such plantations.  Most of the plantations are owned by non-nationals.</P>
      <P>It is well known that Sitka spruce plantations affect animal and bird life and make it impotent. This is doing a great deal of harm.  The Sitka spruce variety is perfect if kept under control but I would not like a situation to develop where elderly people will be living in conditions where the curtains will effectively be drawn all the time due to forestry conditions.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy Sheehan's comments. As I know he is not given to exaggeration I take on board his comments in relation to the 50,000 jobs, the birds, bees and animals.</P>
      <P>Sitka spruce is a most attractive commercial species because it grows particularly well in Ireland, having a growth rate well in excess of the EU average.  It is also suitable for most sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> Sitka spruce timber is suitable for a wide variety of end uses such as structural timber, fencing, pallet wood and pulp wood.  Consequently, it must remain a major part of our forest plantations.</P>
    <P>The level of Sitka spruce planted by Coillte was 82 per cent in 1995 and 79 per cent in 1996. Coillte Teoranta is a private, commercial company in which decisions must be taken on a commercial basis.  I can advise the Deputy that it is quite likely that the target of 70 per cent will be reached and perhaps surpassed by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree with the stipulation that an environmental impact assessment must be carried out on a plot in excess of 70 hectares?  Does he agree that Coillte and the other planting bodies must be sensitive to local communities?  I attended a meeting last week where I met the people of Glenanaar and Moanmore in Ardpatrick.  They forcefully made the point that if Coillte proceeds with planting in that area 12 households will be entirely surrounded by forest.  The Minister of State would doubtless be concerned if the greed for profit and enhanced percentages of Sitka spruce were to lead to flight from a local area and dislocation of its people. Has the Minister of State any direct control over Coillte and the other private planting bodies in relation to these issues which may lead to population decline?</P>

I accept the Deputy's comments in relation to the need for sensitivity to local people who would like to continue living in a particular area.  I also agree that the &ldquo;light of day&rdquo; to which Deputy Sheehan referred earlier should not be blocked out.</P>
      <P>In my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources with special responsibility for forestry I visited Finland recently.  Houses there are built in the forests.  I accept that is not the situation here.  I am very conscious of people's rights and in order to achieve some sort of compromise with communities my Department officials are liaising with county council planning officers.  That is the road we must take.</P>

      <P>Regarding Deputy Gilmore's question, Coillte is a semi-State company and the Minister for Finance, having the greater number of shares, has an input.  Discussions are ongoing in that regard and I am quite satisfied with progress to date.  They will continue in light of what I have met in the industry and what I have heard today.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy McGinley's question, to date there has not been uniformity of planning. It is essential that all should be treated equally, and Department officials are visiting county councils and planning authorities with a view to achieving that.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Ferris's point, it is my intention that Coillte, farmer planters and company planters should find themselves on a level playing pitch and that people living locally are treated properly at all times.  If we are to progress a very exciting programme of afforestation we must have everyone on side.  I want to make a success of this and to see that nobody is discommoded by the activities of the people involved.</P>

      <P>Thirteen mussel farm operations have been offered licences in respect of 50 discrete sites spanning some 240 hectares in inner Bantry Bay.  Subject to some difficulties with two of the sites totalling eight hectares, these offers have been substantially accepted and it is the intention that formal licence documents will issue to these parties very shortly.</P>
      <P>Considerable departmental resources have been devoted over a number of years to achieving local consensus on the organisation and licensing of sites within inner Bantry Bay with particular emphasis on ensuring that navigational safety concerns are addressed.  All applications for these sites underwent a full public consultative process including consultation with the appropriate State agencies.  The licence offers have been fully informed by the outcome of this comprehensive process.</P>
      <P>Four additional applications are on hands for mussel cultivation beyond the inner harbour. Three of these applications have already been the subject of public notice through the local press and will be processed to finality under the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, which will be commenced shortly.</P>
      <P>Mussel farming in Bantry Bay has been a significant success story in terms of revenue, jobs and exports generated for the area.  In 1996 the value of mussel product from Bantry was around £6 million and the local mussel farming and processing section gives full and part-time employment to nearly 500 people in the region.  I am committed to ensuring that the mussel operations in Bantry Bay are regulated and managed in line with the highest standards and with the necessary local consensus among the operators themselves, in the interests of this important industry.</P>

I note the Deputy's point and it is my objective to speed up the granting of the licences.

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>if he will put a scheme in place to take into account the enormous drop in herring prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the Deputy's concern about the worrying state of the herring markets. As I stated in the House on October 22, prices in the autumn fisheries have been low, particularly when compared with the historically high prices achieved last year.  I outlined the background to the current situation and the global nature of the problem.  The main underlying factor is oversupply on the key Japanese herring roe and European herring flap markets.  This is due to forward purchasing of herring roe in 1996 coupled with very high output in the Canadian herring fisheries and the new Atlanto-Scandic herring fishery earlier this year.  The output from the Atlanto-Scandic herring fishery alone this year, in which Irish fishermen participated also, was over one million tonnes.  This has had a depressing effect on global herring markets.</P>
      <P>The extent and impact of the actions which can be taken at a national level must be set in this global supply and demand context.  I am pursuing a range of measures in order to improve the returns from our Celtic Sea and North West Herring fisheries in the interests of the Irish industry. My Department is closely monitoring the herring fisheries, particularly the Celtic Sea, and will introduce a temporary closure of the fishery if there is a sudden market collapse or if quality of fish landed is poor.  This will help to ensure maximum benefit is obtained from the available quotas.  We are also working on the ground to ensure fishermen are facilitated to make maximum use of existing market support schemes.  These allow for the withdrawal from the market of herring if it fails to reach the minimum withdrawal price when offered for sale and the payment of a subsidy where product is held over with a view to reintroducing it to the market at a later stage when prices improve.  I have also asked BIM to give priority to increasing market opportunities for Irish herring in overseas markets.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis international action is needed to tackle this serious problem.  At EU level, I am pressing hard for a reduction in the level of preferential access to European markets for herring from third countries.  Ireland and others are up against the large scale processing industries of Denmark, Holland and Germany in this fight.  It has consistently opposed the opening by the EU of tariff quotas for herring imports and I will continue to vigorously oppose this trend and look for support from other affected member states.  A lower global total allowable catch for Atlanto-Scandic herring in 1998 is likely to be agreed and this will contribute to easing the oversupply problem next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scope for additional schemes to compensate fishermen is constrained given that income subsidy is ruled out under European law.  I have met the fishermen involved in the Celtic Sea herring fishery to hear their views at first hand.  I am <Col N="1421" /> fully up to date with their difficulties and I agree with the industry that a hard, collective look at the market situation needs to be taken.</P>
    <P>I will set up a task force involving the fishing industry, BIM and the Department which will assess the options for better management and marketing of herring and which will draw up realistic recommendations designed to put the Irish herring industry on a sound footing.  I asked the industry to nominate representatives to the task force who will fully reflect all interests involved across the supply and demand chain, including catching, processing and marketing.  It is imperative there is maximum co-operation between the catching and processing sectors if the supply and demand problem is to be solved.  I will ensure Castletownbere is represented.  I am confident the task force will develop a set of realistic proposals, within the ambit of EU law, which will improve the management of the Irish herring fisheries, identify new markets, and secure the best returns from existing markets.  The task force will complete its work as quickly as possible with a view to taking action in the short to medium term.</P>
    <P>The measures in train will help us to stabilise the situation.  I look forward to new thinking from the task force which will tackle supply/demand and related management issues and which will enable us to minimise the impact of global price fluctuations for the Irish herring industry.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that herring prices have halved since last year &mdash; one fisherman said they are the worst in living memory &mdash; and that as a consequence those who fish the Celtic Sea face bankruptcy and the livelihoods of those involved in the processing industry are at risk?  Approximately 1,500 along the seaboard of the Celtic Sea are dependent on herring fishing.  Even though the Minister's good intentions are not in doubt does he accept that his words are cold comfort to those facing bankruptcy as he talks about monitoring, temporary closures and giving priority through BIM?  Where are the concrete measures that are needed to help those involved?  I wish to make a number of suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the task force is a good idea in the medium term.  The Minister referred to making maximum use of existing market support schemes.  I will not ask him to break EU law because I acknowledge the problem with subsidies but in terms of immediate action, will the Minister ensure the minimum price of £123 per tonne is available?  The current market price is between £80 and £85 per tonne.  I understand it operates on the basis that one cannot sell under £123 per tonne but will only receive £80 per tonne having dumped the fish.  Will the Minister convince <Col N="1422" /> his colleagues in the EU to ensure the minimum price is the same as the compensation price?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the carry-over scheme.  With all due respect, this is misleading as the scheme applies to only 6 per cent of the quota.  It should apply to all fish so that the market can be protected.  Will the Minister put those two suggestions into effect straight away?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy rightly stated that the withdrawal price is £123 per tonne and that the market price is down to between £90-£100 per tonne.  The reason for this is the reduction in demand.  The compensation paid to producer organisations in respect of withdrawn product is limited to 14 per cent of the annual quantity sold. If it becomes necessary to go beyond that I will take up the matter.  The task force will advise me in that regard.</P>

      <P>During the spring fishery they were paid in respect of 6.7 per cent, IFPO, and 14 per cent, ISWFPO, of the quantities sold.  This means that the IFPO has some spare withdrawal capacity for the autumn fishery.  Withdrawals by the ISWFPO will be limited to 14 per cent of total sales this season.  At present withdrawals are running at approximately 8 per cent of total sales. Withdrawal aid is 87.5 per cent of the withdrawal price for the first 7 per cent and 75 per cent for the remaining 7 per cent of the annual quantity sold.  That is the basis on which one calculates the annual return.</P>

      <P>On access by Canadian and Norwegian fishermen, I have no problem with access by third countries but the same rules governing subsidies should apply to them.  Tens of thousands of tonnes of herring are imported from countries outside the EU which give subsidies to their fishermen. Similar subsidies are not paid to our fishermen. Will the Minister agree that this is ridiculous? Will he raise the matter with the EU so that herring fishermen and those dependent on the industry for their livelihood have some prospects for the future?  Otherwise they might as well close shop.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the failure of EU policy.  It is no secret that I am not very happy with the EU in terms of most of our arrangements in regard to fishing.  Like the Deputy, I inherited a situation with which I am not comfortable or happy.  For that reason I plan to shortly undertake a wide-ranging review of the present position and proposals for the longer term.  I will continue the work in which the Deputy was engaged as Minister.</P>
      <P>In the measures currently undertaken by the EU, there is a withdrawal system.  The EU is in a vulnerable position in allowing 23,000 tonnes of imports from third countries.  We will make our views well known and will do everything possible at EU level in this regard.  If the task force is set up quickly we will work in conjunction with it, which is probably the best approach.  I will pass on Deputy Sheehan's information on beer, wine, mustard and brine.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible, through the Operational Programme for Fisheries <Col N="1425" /> 1994-99 and the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99, for the funding of research and development programmes for the marine sector and forestry. Total expenditure on research and development under these programmes will amount to £13.2 million.</P>
      <P>Research and development under the Operational Programme for Fisheries focuses on the key areas of fisheries and aquaculture, national marine survey, marine technology development and marine food processing.  Funding under the programme has also supported the acquisition of the first purpose-built Irish marine research vessel and is supporting significant upgrading of marine research laboratories.  In the case of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, research and development is co-ordinated by the Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, and covers matters ranging from nursery technology to end-product development in the sawmilling and wood-based panel sectors.</P>
      <P>Funding is also provided by my Department for research undertaken by the Marine Institute and the Salmon Research Agency.  The Marine Institute carries out essential programmes to underpin management decisions and policy including fish stocks assessment, aquaculture research, fish health and marine environmental issues.  The Salmon Research Agency is focused on research activities such as the selective breeding of salmonids, rearing techniques and census work on wild populations.  Funding for research by the two bodies amounts to £2.609 million in 1997.</P>
      <P>My Department also engages bodies to undertake research on forestry matters related to the implementation of the Forestry Development Programme.  This research is aimed at matters such as the improvement of forestry management and timber products.  Expenditure on this research in 1997 will be approximately £550,000. Specific research on matters relevant to their specific remit is also undertaken by a number of other agencies under my Department's aegis, including Bord Iascaigh Mhara on matters such as fishing gear technology, and the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards on matters such as water quality.</P>
      <P>Targeted applied research and development is essential to ensure Ireland realises the development potential consistent with sustainability from its natural resources.  It is a priority for me to ensure the ongoing development of the sectors for which my Department is responsible is underpinned by well-focused value for money programmes of research and development.  I am also committed to firmly locating research and development in marine and natural resources within the overall national science technology and innovation framework and in maximising opportunities for our scientists in EU-funded science and technology programmes.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that expenditure on research and development amounts to £13.2 million.  He listed a range of activities in the fisheries area but did not quantify investment in research.  He said that funding for research in one area of fisheries is £2.6 million, with an investment of £550,000 in another area.  Is further funding being made available under the headings not identified?  When will the results of research and development be published?  The future of the industry depends on proper research and investment by the Government and particularly by the EU.</P>

      <P>An increase is provided for in the current Estimates for research, which is very important.  The Marine Institute and other bodies publish full reports on the research in which they are engaged, which are particularly valuable, and from time to time I make statements on individual projects.  I accept it is important to communicate the work being done, which is to a high technological level.  Harland and Wolff in Northern Ireland are anxious to co-operate with us in the research of wave movements on the Continental Shelf.  That will assist them in the design of FPSOs, floating production storage and off-loading vessels.  In future, instead of using derricks, they will favour floating vessels which will store and off-load production and will also be used for oil exploration.  That is dependent on what happens below the ocean, and the work we have been doing is relevant to that.  Research is being carried out in co-operation with that company, which is an interesting development.  That highlights the work done here, which is recognised internationally as of a very high standard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 30 together.  I favour in principle the transfer of the Moy fishery to local control which is consistent with my stated strategy to move to a &ldquo;catchment management&rdquo; approach in fisheries generally.  I confirm that I recently met the chairperson and chief officer of the Central Fisheries Board to discuss the transfer of the Moy fishery from the Central Fisheries Board to the North Western Regional Fisheries Board.  The board is working on the detailed arrangements required to enable the management of this very valuable national fishery to be transferred on a basis which ensures accountability, value for money and continued sustainable development. However, the Central Fisheries Board has advised me that several issues have arisen which are currently delaying the transfer process.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: The people of Mayo were extremely grateful when the former Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, instructed the Central Fisheries Board to hand over responsibility for the transfer of the river Moy.  Does the Minister agree it is vital the transfer takes place soon? Does he agree it is administrative and economic lunacy to have two offices on the banks of the river Moy, one run by the Central Fisheries Board and the other by the North Western Regional Fisheries Board, two sets of staff, one under the aegis of the Central Fisheries Board and the other under the aegis of the North Western Regional Fisheries Board and two sets of vehicles, one with the stamp of the Central Fisheries Board and the other with the stamp of the North Western Regional Fisheries Board?  What are the obstacles to the transfer?  When will the matter be resolved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two specific obstacles. There is a legal problem over the title of the fishery which is being dealt with by the Chief State Solicitor's office.  I agreed with the decision of my predecessor regarding the transfer, but the title was not in a state in which it could be transferred. That was not his fault.  The second obstacle relates to an industrial relations issue which came to light recently.  This is being progressed by the Central Fisheries Board, the employer.</P>

      <Col N="1428" /> Does he agree that to ensure arrangements are in place for next season the management must be transferred without further delay?

I am anxious that the transfer takes place soon, but I am also in the process of developing a new procedure for regional fisheries boards based on the catchment area approach.  Those involved in the River Moy fishery published a report based on that approach.</P>
      <P>Of course we want to avoid duplication of effort, but we are not discussing the value for money report.  I was struck by a comment in the introduction of that report about the high quality of the officers involved.  I was delighted to note their excellent work as public servants is recognised. The other issues in the report can be discussed on another occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I spoke of two measures which could be taken immediately to deal with one aspect of the drug problem.  The kindergarten for the drinking and drug taking experience of young people in the Dublin area is <Col N="1430" /> the open spaces of our parks, laneways and derelict sites.  The Minister of State, Deputy Flood, is also aware of this Dublin phenomenon.  It is a widespread problem and becoming a major social problem for other people besides the youngsters involved.  It appears to be largely ignored.  The Garda Síochána take a benign approach and appear to believe it is not damaging to society.  In the context of other serious crime this approach might be understandable.  However, if this is where the drugs problem begins, it is where we must begin to tackle it.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of legislation under which this problem can be tackled.  There is a law against drinking in public and in public open spaces.  There are also bylaws to the same effect.  The public order legislation is also applicable.  A little zero tolerance in this area would go a long way towards solving the problem in its early stages.</P>
      <P>When youngsters as young as 14 or 15 years of age graduate from the open spaces kindergarten they move to pubs and clubs where drugs are freely available.  They have no trouble gaining admission to these establishments because they use fake ID cards.  If one stopped every teenager in the streets, every second one would have a fake ID card and possibly two or three to suit every occasion.  There is a thriving business in fake ID cards among young people and one must admire their ingenuity at making perfect reproductions of USIT cards and so forth.  As a result, however, young people have access to off-licences, public houses and clubs and have the opportunity to not only drink but also to take drugs in these locations.</P>
      <P>These two aspects of the problem must be tackled.  I accept that demand reduction requires more than the enforcement of penal measures and that it is a multi-dimensional problem. However, tackling the two areas I mentioned would yield huge dividends in the immediate term.  There are many civil liberties arguments against the introduction of ID cards but society and its problems have become too complex to just continue talking about them.  We must grasp the nettle.  The introduction of ID cards would at least deal with the under age problem outlined in the report and give the majority of youngsters a chance to reach 18 years of age with their brains still sufficiently intact to make the life decisions which confront them at that age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report of the European Monitoring Centre for drugs and drug addiction.  Establishing that body was one of the EU's most positive moves.  It is a pity that I and many other Members were unable to get a copy of the report.  There is one copy in the Library and we are relying on photocopies of it.  Even the Clerk does not have a copy.  That is most disappointing as it is an important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of reports have been published recently about the growing problem of drug abuse in this country.  Irish society is rapidly <Col N="1431" /> changing and one of the side effects of a booming economy is an increase in abuse of legal and illegal drugs.  Drug abuse is a problem in all age groups, with older age groups tending to abuse legal drugs and younger age groups abusing trendy, illegal drugs, especially new synthetic drugs.  In Ireland, 42 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age and tackling substance abuse among young people must be a priority.</P>
    <P>Irish young people are near the top of the European league in their use of tobacco, alcohol and illegal drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy. Irish school children are more familiar than their European peers with cigarettes, alcohol and illegal drugs.  Sadly, it is only in recent years that tackling this problem has become a priority in this country.  In the past ten years the problem has snowballed and in the past two weeks alone the Garda Síochána made seven significant seizures, some of which had a street value of more than £8 million.  Illegal drugs are now freely available in every village.  A comprehensive, co-ordinated strategy is necessary to tackle this rapidly growing cancer.  Yesterday, the Minister explained how much the Eastern Health Board is doing to tackle the problem.  The board deserves our congratulations. However, the same resources are not being allocated to other health boards.  Two years ago my brother, who was then 12 years of age, was approached by somebody with drugs in a disco.  This occurred in a rural community in the west.</P>
    <P>While the Garda Síochána must be complimented on its excellent work in this area, one must ask how many more drugs are getting through the net if so many seizures can be made. Such large seizures underline the fact that many people are prepared to risk lengthy jail sentences for the potential profits involved in supplying the market.  While we must continue to reduce the supply of drugs, headlines such as &ldquo;Irish Teens Top Cannabis Users List&rdquo; and &ldquo;Survey Shows Irish Students Take More Drugs Than Average&rdquo; will not be changed unless the demand is tackled. A new approach must be taken to curb demand rather than just the supply of legal and illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>Why do young people take drugs?  There are more pressures in their daily lives.  The points systems has become extremely stressful as is the lack of a permanent job and a stable income.  The quality of life has changed dramatically in the past 15 years.  Ireland has become a rat race and drugs give young people a means to get away from it.</P>
    <P>There is a severe lack of education and information on drugs.  When I went to school we heard nothing about drugs although they were freely available outside the school.  We now have the youngest drug taking population in Europe.  I am the same age as an average drug addict so I am part of this country's drugs generation.  Why?  We did not have the relevant information when we were growing up.  The information is now available <Col N="1432" /> in second level schools but it is still not available in primary schools even though people are starting to take drugs at a younger age.  The information should be available in primary schools and it should have been available in second level schools when I was at school.  The State let me and my generation down.  That must not happen again.  Anti-drugs policies must give greater priority to reducing demand and additional resources must be invested in this area.</P>
    <P>The report states that prevention is thought to be most effective when organised locally.  The priority must be to provide proper education and information in primary and second level schools. This is the most effective means of reducing demand.  The report refers to a county in Denmark which carried out a poster campaign and invited ex-users into the schools.  It also conducted a mail shot campaign in the local communities. That is the way we must tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>The general public must also be made aware of the risks.  More information must be made available on the risks and side effects of drugs, especially new synthetic drugs.  A hotline such as the one in Britain, which gives anonymous advice to callers about the risks associated with drugs and what precautions drug takers should take, should be established.  If somebody takes ecstasy, for example, he or she is advised to drink plenty of water.  The Eastern Health Board has such a hotline but it should be implemented on a national basis.</P>
    <P>Research into the demand for and availability of drugs is also required.  Throughout the report there are gaps in the information about Ireland because the relevant information and statistics are not available.  Resources must be put into research to find out why young people take drugs. The amphetamine craze is one of the major problems. It is the second most frequently used illegal drug in the European Union and is linked to discos and rave parties.  These young people are not coming from disadvantaged backgrounds.  They are relatively affluent and well educated young people who are students or employed.  This raises more serious questions.</P>
    <P>We need to crack down on the whole area of illegal drugs, especially the underage buying of cigarettes and alcohol.  Cigarettes are freely available to young people of any age.  One has only to walk down the street during the day to see young people with cigarettes.  Alcopops are becoming a big craze, especially among underage drinkers, and should be banned.  In Britain one can even get alcoholic milk and alcoholic mineral water. An ID card system will have to be put in place. If it is not possible to ban them the least we should have is a code of practice to ensure young people are not targeted.</P>
    <P>The growing rave culture will cause serious side effects in ten to 20 years' time because these are mind-altering drugs.  From the research done on animals it is clear that in ten years' time our psychiatric hospitals will be full.  This problem <Col N="1433" /> will have to be tackled.  We need to ensure the water is not turned off in the nightclubs where these drugs are distributed.  There is a need for registration and proper training for security staff which the Garda should monitor.  I urge the Minister to implement some of these suggestions.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate for two reasons.  It gives the House an opportunity to discuss the important report produced by the European Monitoring Centre for drugs and drug addiction and in the process to review and debate our policy for tackling drug abuse.  There appears to be general agreement on all sides on the broad thrust of the strategy being adopted, which is consistent with the two excellent reports produced by the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs, as endorsed and further developed in the Fianna Fáil policy document, A Radical Approach to Drugs and Drug Related Crime.</P>
      <P>My second reason for welcoming this debate is more personal.  It affords me my first opportunity, apart from responding to parliamentary questions, to set out the broad thrust of the Government's drugs strategy and to comment briefly on the thinking behind that strategy.  I am pleased to have been assigned overall responsibility for the effective implementation and co-ordination of the Government's strategy for drugs demand reduction.  I pay tribute to my constituency colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, whose contribution I listened to.  He was the first chairman of the ministerial task force on drug misuse and made a significant contribution to putting in place structures which I had the good fortune to inherit when appointed to this portfolio.  I pay tribute to Deputy Rabbitte for his commitment in that regard.</P>
      <P>The European Monitoring Centre for drugs and drugs addiction was established in Lisbon in 1994 to provide objective, reliable and comparable information at European level on drug addiction and its consequences.  The centre gathers and disseminates information on a range of drug-related issues including the demand for drugs and measures to reduce that demand; national and European Community strategies and policies; international co-operation and geopolitics of the supply of drugs; the control of trade in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and precursor chemicals; and the implications of the drugs phenomenon for producer, consumer and transit countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ultimate objective of the European Monitoring Centre for drugs and drug addiction is to provide policy-makers and others with an information base from which they can compare the effectiveness of policies and practices.  For this reason, its reports are important and deserve detailed examination and consideration, not only in Ireland but in all EU countries.  While the centre does not make policy recommendations in its <Col N="1434" /> reports, it contributes greatly towards and may well lead to the development of a common policy among our EU partners in addressing the drugs phenomenon.</P>
    <P>In opening this debate, my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Brian Cowen, has outlined in some detail the report and its key findings, particularly as they relate to the treatment and rehabilitation of drug misusers.  I propose to concentrate on the aspects of the report which deal with drugs demand reduction and the delivery of locally-based responses to the problem.  Two key points to emerge in the report were that many EU countries have new or revised anti-drug policies which give greater priority and increased funding for demand reduction and that prevention is thought most effective when organised locally and close to its targets.  The report states that the overwhelming majority of demand reduction work in the EU is locally based, focused on units such as the neighbourhood, the family, schools or local associations.  The increased emphasis on demand reduction and the development of locally-based strategies underpin the approach adopted by both the current and previous Governments in tackling the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>While the EU report recognises the increasing use of &ldquo;new&rdquo; drugs, such as ecstasy, it concludes that in most EU member states heroin dominates the indicators which reflect various problematic consequences of drug use, such as the demand for treatment, drug-related deaths and HIV infection. The report states that in most countries, opiates &mdash; mainly heroin &mdash; are reported most often as the primary substances used by problem drug users and that capital cities tend to have problem use rates higher than those of the provincial cities and the national average.  This is consistent with the findings in the reports of the ministerial task force established by the previous Government which was chaired by my constituency colleague, Deputy Pat Rabbitte.</P>
    <P>That committee concluded that the problem of heroin abuse was by far the most pressing aspect of the drugs problem confronting us and that it was a phenomenon confined almost exclusively to Dublin.  That is not to say that this situation could not alter quickly.  Past evidence confirms that the nature and extent of the drugs problem can change rapidly and move from area to area.  One of the fears raised by the crackdown on supply in the worst affected areas during the past year or so is that it may transfer the problem to other areas, as the drug barons go to any length to maintain their lucrative but deadly business.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, the heroin problem is concentrated in the most socially and economically deprived parts of the city.  It is no surprise that this phenomenon is repeated Europe wide.  Most of us are familiar to some extent with the situation in the inner cities in the US and in European cities such as Glasgow, Paris and Amsterdam.  While the factors at work in all of these cities may not be the same there is one major theme, the strong <Col N="1435" /> correlation between drug abuse and social, economic and physical marginalisation of working class communities.  The greatest numbers presenting for treatment for heroin addiction in Dublin are from areas which have been designated, by objective criteria under the local development programme, as being socially and economically disadvantaged.  These areas are characterised by chronic levels of unemployment, poor living conditions, high rates of early school leaving, high levels of family breakdown and a general lack of recreational amenities and other supports.</P>
    <P>The net result is that problems of unemployment, poverty and educational disadvantage have been transmitted from one generation to the next. Many initiatives have been taken in recent years to break this cycle.  It is my intention to continue with this strategy and to work to ensure that the efforts of all players in this area are continuously focused on rebuilding the social and economic capacity of our most deprived areas.  The link between drug abuse and social exclusion was a key factor in the Government's decision to reconstitute the Cabinet drugs committee, set up by the previous Government, into a wider committee on social inclusion and drugs.  This committee, which will continue to do the work of the previous committee in pulling together and giving overall political direction to the Government's drugs strategy, will also oversee the implementation of the local development programme and the national anti-poverty strategy.  The committee will continue to be chaired by the Taoiseach, reflecting the importance which the Government attaches to this issue, but its membership has been extended to include all relevant Ministers.  The Government has assigned special responsibility to me to oversee implementation of its drugs reduction strategy as well as responsibility in relation to the local development programme.  I will report to the committee on both issues.</P>
    <P>There are a significant number of areas which have suffered tremendously from the effects of neglect and deprivation in recent decades.  Do we have the capacity and the commitment to tackle the underlying causes?  This would make a significant difference in dealing with the issue we are discussing.  In my role as chairperson of the national drugs strategy team and member of the committee on social exclusion and drugs, I have taken the opportunity to visit a number of areas to see for myself the effects of this neglect.  In one instance I was appalled to find that out of 350 units of accommodation 50 were empty and had been vandalised.  It is the objective of the Government and the committee of which I am a member to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>The most important element of the Government's drugs strategy during the past year or so has been the establishment of the local drugs task forces in Dublin and north Cork city.  Prior to their establishment, it had been obvious for some time that considerable statutory, voluntary and <Col N="1436" /> community effort was being put into tackling the drugs problem.  However this did not appear to be as co-ordinated and targeted as it might have been nor did it give sufficient recognition to the important role local communities can play in tackling the problem in their areas.</P>
    <P>We are particularly fortunate in Ireland to have vibrant and active community participation in the social and economic life of the country.  Community involvement has underpined the success of the local development programme and I am confident it will equally ensure success in our efforts to come to grips with the drugs problem. Local groups and individuals who often work in extremely difficult circumstances, particularly in the context of the drugs problem, have a valuable contribution to make to the development and implementation of local strategies to tackle the drugs demand.  Many have been involved in tackling the drugs problem in their areas for many years during which time they have built up considerable and valuable experience which needs to be tapped as a resource.</P>
    <P>The local drugs task forces were established to meet three specific needs: to ensure effective co-ordination between drugs programmes and services; to target the areas worst affected by the problem; and, most important, to give local communities a real and meaningful role in the development and implementation of strategies to tackle drug misuse in their areas.</P>
    <P>In all, 13 task forces were established, 12 in Dublin and one in north Cork city, their areas of operation generally equating with those of the area partnerships established under the local development programme.  I am glad to report that, while it was originally envisaged that the role of the area partnerships would be to nominate the chairpersons and community representatives to the task forces, they have, for the most part, continued to adopt a hands-on approach and are playing a valuable role in assisting and facilitating the task forces in their work.</P>
    <P>The task forces form a tripartite partnership between the statutory, voluntary and community sectors.  The statutory sector representatives come from the health boards, the Garda Síochána, the local authorities, FÁS, the Probation and Welfare Service and the Youth Service.  The community representatives were nominated by the area partnerships and six were appointed to each task force.  The voluntary representatives represent voluntary organisations operating in the task force areas.</P>
    <P>The task forces were mandated to prepare profiles of the nature and extent of the drugs problem in their areas of operation; to compile inventories of the programmes and services available or planned in those areas to tackle the drugs problem; to identify gaps or duplication in these supports; to develop strategies to address these gaps and target services more effectively.  As Deputies will be aware, £10 million was set aside to fund the implementation of strategic plans which the task forces were asked to develop.  The <Col N="1437" /> task forces represent a bottom-up approach to tackle the drugs problem and their approach is not dissimilar to that being pursued by the area partnerships in tackling the problem of social exclusion with particular reference to long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>All 13 task forces have submitted their strategic plans which are being evaluated by the national drugs strategy team which hopes to be in a position shortly to make recommendations to Government regarding the allocation of funding to support their implementation.  Apart from the specific task of evaluating the task force plans, the national drugs strategy team has overall responsibility for ensuring the effective implementation of the Government's drugs strategy. The national drugs strategy team &mdash; a cross-departmental team of the type envisaged in the strategic management initiative &mdash; comprises representatives of relevant Departments and statutory agencies with two persons who bring the perspective of the voluntary and community sectors to its work.  On its advice, the Government has allocated interim funding of just under £5 million to fund the implementation of the more straight-forward elements of the task force plans.  This funding is being allocated on the basis of the quality of the proposals in the plans balanced against the needs of the individual task force areas rather than on an even geographic distribution between the 13 task forces.</P>
    <P>In commenting on their effectiveness to date, the process of establishing the task forces and asking them to prepare strategic plans has proved successful.  It has engaged communities in areas where the drugs crisis is at its worst and given them hope where previously none existed.  That is not to say there have not been teething problems. The task forces were under pressure to produce their plans speedily having regard to the need for communities in the priority areas to see developments taking place quickly.  This made an already difficult task even more daunting.  Everyone involved in the process is to be congratulated for the manner in which they have gone about their work and worked together towards the goal of developing their strategic plans.</P>
    <P>The statutory and voluntary-community sides have learned from this experience.  This will, in time, contribute towards their greater effectiveness. As Deputies will be aware, there is a commitment in Partnership 2000 to review the local drugs task force process at the end of the year.  It is my hope, learning from the experiences of the past year, that we will be able to further develop and expand the role of the task forces and make them ready to meet the challenges of the next few years which the drugs problem will pose.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on other aspects of the report.  In dealing with new trends in synthetic drugs, the report notes that in some EU member states unprecedented numbers of young Europeans have adopted the use of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy, LSD and amphetamines in the context of a mass youth culture.  It states that, <Col N="1438" /> unlike heroin addicts, the users of these drugs are not concentrated among the marginalised or deprived but are mostly young, unemployed or students and relatively affluent.  These findings are consistent with our own experiences here.</P>
    <P>The second report of the ministerial task force which dealt with, among other issues, the nationwide misuse of non-opiate drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy drew attention to the link between youth culture and experimentation with drugs, legal and illicit.  Concluding that the most effective long-term strategy to counter drug abuse is in the area of prevention, the report recommended the establishment of a youth services development fund to provide amenities and develop youth services in disadvantaged areas where there is a significant drugs problem.  It is proposed to bring this fund into effect in 1998. Proposals are being developed, for submission to Government shortly, in relation to the administration of the fund.</P>
    <P>By placing responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's drugs strategy within the same Department as that of local development and sport, we have clearly signalled our intention to place considerable emphasis on prevention as well as on cure.  With my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, I will seek to ensure sufficient resources are allocated to the task force areas to tackle the causes of the problem rather than simply treating its symptoms.</P>
    <P>Another key point which emerged from the European Union report is that more drug users may come into contact with the criminal justice system than with the treatment services.  The question of how best to address the needs of drug misusers who come into contact with the criminal justice system clearly is an important factor within the context of tackling the overall drugs problem.  We are conscious that a very significant number of heroin users here will most likely find themselves before the courts at some stage.  To complicate matters, this is not an issue that can be readily addressed by the strategies being developed by local drugs task forces, primarily because it is difficult to develop locally-based services for persons who tend to drift between the community and prison.  While there may be some scope for community-based actions to tackle this aspect of the problem, what is clearly needed is an integrated, coherent central response.  In this regard the Government proposes to proceed with the establishment of an independent expert group to undertake an assessment of the current supports available to offenders who misuse drugs and submit recommendations for their greater integration. Of course, the establishment of this group was recommended in the second report of the ministerial task force.</P>
    <P>The European Union report confirms that the broad strategies we are adopting to tackle our drugs problem are consistent with the policies and best practice obtaining in other European Union countries.  However, it is important that we show tangible progress in quickly meeting community <Col N="1439" /> needs and rebuilding a sense of hope within communities marked by high levels of unemployment and marginalisation.  This approach has the broad support of all sides of the House.  This bipartisan approach is extremely important if we are to come to grips eventually with this extremely complex social problem.</P>

      <P>First I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation on his contribution.  I have already put on the record my support of the Government's intention to continue the work begun some years ago to tackle this problem.  It is particularly relevant, from the point of view of Government, that the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, should lead this onslaught on drugs, as he is a Minister and public representative of a constituency ravaged by the problems of drug addiction, not merely in recent years but dating back some ten years or so.  He is well placed to meet that challenge head on.  He quite rightly and generously paid tribute to his constituency colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, now in Opposition, for the work he undertook in this area.  It is important that as a Dublin Minister and Deputy &mdash; where this problem is more acute than in other regions of the country &mdash; he should lead this campaign in which I wish him well and assure him of the support of this side of the House.</P>
      <P>This problem was allowed to fester in society for 15 years without a penny of Government resources being allocated to its resolution, or any real strategy to tackle it having been implemented.  If there is one thing to be learned from this European Union report it is the need to devise and implement a locally-based, effective strategy.  We will not deliver a reduction in addiction levels or any increase in information levels within our society through some tablet of stone emanating from Brussels or Merrion Street.  The real subscribers to the resolution of this problem lie within the communities familiar to the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, and other Members. It is there the solution will be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must engage in an awful lot of listening in this House.  As a Member representing a Dublin constituency I am not sure that in recent years this House took fully into consideration the kinds of urban problems resulting from the misuse of drugs.  We must listen carefully to people within the community worst affected by this problem and respond accordingly.  That is why the central plank of this strategy must be the allocation of requisite resources to locally-based task forces allowing them to proceed with the requisite task. Of course, there needs to be a ministerial canopy <Col N="1440" /> placed over this allocation of funding but, ultimately, it will be the responsibility of the task force to pinpoint, region by region, parish by parish, street by street the precise extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>The £10 million allocated to the locally-based task force will enable the fruition of the many projects already begun or about to be established in the immediate future to make a tremendous difference in urban areas.  It is not just a matter of establishing methadone administration centres nationwide or of ensuring that a premises is built, it is also about dissemination of information. Within a total of some 17 or 18 programmes proposed for my constituency, many are targeted at the provision of services for parents who, to date, have not had any or sufficient information available to enable them tackle the problem.  Up to now these programmes have tended to concentrate on the provision of training facilities for addicts and former addicts isolated from society resulting from the menace of drugs.  These are the kinds of projects that must be at the centre of our strategy and the lesson to be learned from this EU report.</P>
    <P>The issue of educational disadvantage is allied to this overall problem, particularly in the case of the use of heroin which, as the Minister correctly said, is ostensibly a problem in the inner city and new suburbs of Dublin.  It is my firm belief that that problem is a consequence of educational disadvantage. When I was a Member of the Seanad I got the idea from Senator Lee that in many ways this issue simply cannot be resolved by any one Minister, but will require liaison between five and seven, involving health, education, employment and training perspectives to tackle it on a weekly basis.  While recognising that the Minister has that sense of urgency I hope it prevails among his Cabinet colleagues with whom I hope he will hold regular weekly meetings as well as with Members of a committee of the House &mdash; which I hope will be established shortly &mdash; to keep them up-to-date with the drugs problem and their endeavours to resolve it.  If dealt with in that manner, the multi-faceted response, whether by way of health, education or otherwise, will ultimately win out.</P>
    <P>Another issue surrounding this problem of drugs is that, whenever we hear the word, we automatically assume it relates solely to young people, a very negative reaction.  While young people today probably observe the use and misuse of drugs more frequently than was the case ten years ago, we should not automatically assume that the vast majority of them are shooting up, popping tablets or blowing their heads out every Friday evening after work.  We regularly see sensational headlines which fuel the not very informed public debate on this issue.  The vast majority of our young people do not abuse drugs and are aware of their dangers.  That fact must be weighed against the problem experienced by so many other young people who come into contact with them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> There is need for a publicly-based upfront campaign against those elements of showbusiness and the media who argue that the legalisation of cannabis would yield a positive result and lead us to confront this problem within society.  That approach has not worked anywhere else.  One of the Minister's functions should be to launch a campaign against these people.  Many of them do not live here but they lecture us from abroad about the Dutch example which has not worked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hayes and the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, represent a constituency which has a significant drugs problem.  I represent Sligo-Leitrim, one of the more rural constituencies, but it would be naive to suggest it does not have a drugs problem.  It exists but is not as bad as in the inner city and suburbs of Dublin.  The only long-term solution to the problem is education.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister, Deputy Flood, the best in his position because it will be a difficult one.  Progress will be slow but, as long as it is made, it is the right way to go.  The interdepartmental strategy drawn up under the chairmanship of the former Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is excellent and sets out the guidelines we should follow in solving the drugs problem.  I am glad the Government has taken it on board and will propose it as its policy.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a national identity card scheme may go a long way towards stemming the increase in drug use among young people.  Every city, town and village suffers dramatically from underage drinking.  Young people experience drink and its effects between the ages of 13 and 15 and the next step is drugs.  Some elements in the media state that hash and other soft drugs are not harmful, that they can be smoked like cigarettes and that they give the user a buzz with little or no side effects.  That is extremely dangerous and is something the Government must fight.  There is no place for illegal drugs in this society.</P>
      <P>If we introduce a national identity card scheme, it would give a statutory basis for gardaí to enter public houses where they suspect underage drinking to be taking place.  I do not suggest it happens in many bars, but it is happening and is causing consternation.  Once people start drinking at a young age, the buzz they will want by the time they are 18 and going to college is drugs.  It is not just an urban problem but is happening in the most rural areas and I hope that is something the Minister, Deputy Flood, takes into consideration when discussing the drugs problem.</P>
      <P>A number of people state soft drugs should be legalised.  That is another claim which must be strongly opposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé fíor-bhuíoch as ucht cead a bheith tugtha dom an cheist seo a ardú.  I am disturbed by the lack of provision in the Estimates for preventative healthcare.  The incidence of asthma and other medical complaints as well as medical admissions to hospitals such as Beaumont are increasing annually.  Therefore, it was a shock to read recently in the <i>Big Issues</i> magazine about the effect of the Irish Medicines Board Act and the background and motivation for its enactment.</P>
      <P>Statutory Instrument No. 43 of 1996, the medical preparations regulation, classifies over 40 commonly found herbs, including plants such as ginger, garlic and dandelion, as medicines which now require prescriptions.  They will now come under the category of prescribed medicines if their vitamin or mineral contents exceed the World Health Organisation's recommended daily amount guidelines.  This draconian legislation also requires simple customer information about alternative health supplements, such as informing a buyer that vitamin C is helpful in preventing 'flu, to be provided and leaves retailers and suppliers open to fines of over £100,000 and/or ten years in prison if convicted of non-compliance.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organisation also plans to curtail the availability of food supplements.  It will implement a worldwide control and regulation programme for herbs and vitamins before December 1998.  The WHO's plan provoked a huge storm of controversy in America when it was revealed that the organisation's so-called independent advisory body comprised exclusively of giant drug companies.  The legislation is being challenged by alternative health practitioners and consumer rights groups in America who view the laws as anti-consumer and believe they are motivated by vested interests in the global pharmaceutical industry.</P>
      <P>To obtain a licence for herbal remedies requires a £3,000 application fee.  In reality, so much laboratory evidence is required that the entire licensing procedure could cost up to £1 million.  Many doctors may now be loath to recommend simple remedies, such as evening primrose oil which is effective in the treatment of menopausal hot flushes, for fear of litigation.  This also applies to calcium tablets for the treatment of osteoporosis and a huge variety of other supplements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government ideally needs to instigate a debate on community and preventative healthcare.  Such care needs to be resourced to ensure the pharmaceutical companies are not needed so much.  Fewer sick people should be our objective as a Parliament and a people.  In the short-term, the Irish Association of Health Stores should be represented on the Irish Medicines Board.  Before sending out such needlessly threatening <Col N="1443" /> letters, the board should meet with the association or the producers of complementary health products.  Otherwise, we will find ourselves in the ridiculous position of a teenager buying as much paracetamol as they like in a supermarket for the purposes of committing suicide, but needing a doctor's prescription to get vitamin C for a cold.  We have sold out to the pharmaceutical companies on this legislation to the extent that a public outcry is needed.  The Government must realise it has gone overboard and we need to think about preventive healthcare so that people will not have to spend money.  We need to start talking about a Department of Health rather than what we currently have, a Department of Sickness and Pharmaceutical Interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst I am aware of reports and rumours circulating along the lines set out in the Deputy's question, I wish to advise the Deputy and the House that there is no truth or substance whatsoever in the suggestion that the Irish Medicine Board has sent out more than 40 threatening letters to complementary health practitioners over the past six months.  Furthermore, some magazine articles recently published along these lines are inaccurate and misleading and do not properly reflect the regulatory position.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board was established by an Act of the Oireachtas and I cannot accept that any of the powers given to the board by the Oireachtas could, in any way, be described as draconian. The Act simply gave the board the same powers which had previously been vested in the Minister for Health as the licensing authority for human medicines, including powers of enforcement.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that there has been no new legislation, as is suggested, proscribing vitamins, minerals or herbs as legal medicines, nor are there any plans to introduce such legislation at this time.  The current regulatory controls governing the sale and supply of medicinal products are set out in the Medical Preparations (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1996, which replaced earlier regulations dating back to 1975.  These regulations reflect European Union requirements on the control of medicines and require that all medicinal products placed on the market in Ireland must be the subject of a product authorisation granted by the Irish Medicines Board.  However, before the board will grant such an authorisation, it must first be satisfied that the product meets criteria laid down by the European Union to establish the safety, quality and efficacy of the product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations are directed towards ensuring the health and safety of consumers and do not make any distinction between conventional pharmaceutical products and medicines based on herbs, vitamin or mineral supplements.  There are, of course, certain products, including herbal <Col N="1444" /> products, which may be classified as either food supplements or medicinal products.  Such products are commonly referred to as &ldquo;borderline&rdquo; products.  As far back as 1988, my Department issued guidelines on the classification of such borderline products.</P>
    <P>In relation to herbal products, these are classified as medicines when their labelling or associated literature makes preventive, curative or remedial claim or any of the ingredients presented is recognised as having medicinal properties.  In the case of vitamin or mineral supplements these would likewise only be classified as medicinal products if their labelling or associated literature makes any preventive, curative or remedial claim or if they are presented in a dosage form which exceeds the recommended dietary allowances.  At the same time, I must stress that if and when the board becomes aware of any medicinal product being sold or marketed without a product authorisation, it is obligated to seek the withdrawal of such products until they have been properly authorised in accordance with the regulatory requirements.  The primary objective is to ensure that all medicinal products which are made available to the public are demonstrably safe and of good quality.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State for attending.  Once upon a time there was a residential area in Moville, County Donegal, with a Garda station.  One morning people woke up to find a large mast erected beside the station.  I have no objections to mobile telephones or to masts.  However, I object to the lack of consultation.</P>
      <P>The change in regulations which occurred at the start of the year allowed for an amount of flexibility in relation to erecting telephone masts beside existing Garda station masts.  However, because of the lack of clarity regarding the amount of consultation with the public, people wake up to find masts outside their bedroom windows.</P>
      <P>I contacted the Department of Public Enterprise in regard to the situation in Moville. The Department is aware that people are concerned about the health implications of masts and informed me that WHO guidelines are compulsory in Ireland.  There is a feeling that there is no risk to health but this information is not getting through to the public.</P>
      <P>There should be some public consultation before a mast is erected in a residential area. Many people are concerned about the environment. There is a fear of the unknown.  Twenty years ago smoking was considered healthy, now it is considered unhealthy.  People fear that some beverages which are considered healthy today will not be considered so in 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people in Moville are questioning the positioning of telephone masts in residential areas.  It <Col N="1445" /> used to be the case that they were located in towns only as a last resort.  People wish to know when this policy changed.  There is much positive information available which would allay the fears of the public but it is not being got across to people who have genuine concerns.  We should consult more with local people and I am seeking information on the current guidelines governing the locating of these masts in residential areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is some public concern about possible adverse health effects from exposure to radiation emissions from transmitter masts associated with mobile phone systems. Licences to operate mobile phone systems are awarded by the Department of Public Enterprise which monitors all significant research in this area.  My Department liaises with that Department regarding the human health aspects. The general body of scientific evidence to date has not established a definite link between this form of radiation and ill-health.  Licensed telecommunications companies are required to operate within emission limits set by the International Radiation Protection Association.  Measurements taken here show that exposure levels are well within the recommended safety levels.</P>
      <P>Regarding the erection of transmitter masts, I would draw the Deputy's attention to Government policy on mobile phone services which is that these should be available as far as possible on a countrywide basis.  Telecommunications companies are obliged by their licences to provide wide population coverage.  This involves the erection of considerable numbers of telecommunication masts in urban and rural areas. Approval for the erection of the transmitter masts is the responsibility of the local planning authorities.  Where possible, companies are required to use and share existing masts to avoid unnecessary proliferation.</P>
      <P>Last year the Department of the Environment issued guidelines to the local planning authorities dealing with telecommunications structures.  The guidelines include a section dealing with the health and safety aspects which was agreed by my Department, the Department of Public Enterprise and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  This points out that the safe limits of exposure established by the International Radiation Protection Agency (IRPA) in 1988 were re-examined by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection using criteria produced by the World Health Organisation.  The commission's examination endorsed the levels set by the IRPA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Director of Telecommunications Regulation was established by the Minister for Public Enterprise earlier this year.  Its function is to ensure that licensed operators of telecommunications systems comply with all the conditions of their licence including emission standards.  Emissions are to be monitored on a regular and nationwide basis.  Early next year my Department will be cosponsoring <Col N="1446" /> with the Department of Public Enterprise a conference on health issues and the telecommunications infrastructure.  A wide range of health and technical matters will be discussed at the conference.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, research and studies in this area are carried out on an ongoing basis and medical officers in my Department keep themselves informed of developments.  Should conclusive evidence emerge that this form of radiation is causing an unacceptable public health risk, appropriate remedial measures will have to be put in place.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Urban Renewal Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity to raise this issue in the House this evening.  I want to impress upon the Minister and the Government the unique position of Rathkeale in County Limerick.  Rathkeale is a unique case because of the special circumstances which prevail there. Almost 45 per cent of the town's population are travellers, and the two cultures live in relative harmony in the town albeit with some tensions. The special circumstances make it important that the town should be considered for the urban renewal scheme.  Many of the commercial premises and some of the residential premises in the centre of the town have been withdrawn from commercial or residential use.  This is because the traders in the travelling community have purchased these premises and turned them into stores for furniture.  Most of the traders are in the furniture business.</P>
      <P>It is important to restore the centre of the town to commercial activity.  The extension of the urban renewal scheme will provide an incentive to do this and will attract business back into the town.  The decline in the physical fabric of the main street of Rathkeale is a serious problem. The inner core of the town is decaying with many of the buildings being derelict, dilapidated, unoccupied and disused.  The blight of decay which has strangled the physical, social and economic life of the town must be stopped.  People must be enticed to live in the town.  The potential of the town to attract private investment and development is depressed because of its physical environment. There is little interest on the part of many owners of properties to undertake development of the buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The designation of the main street in Rathkeale for the purposes of urban renewal will lead to a significant private sector investment in such properties and significantly contribute to the improvement of the town.  The Rathkeale Enterprise Committee is unable to address the problem of dereliction alone.  The increasing problem of dereliction and dilapidation on Rathkeale's main street was highlighted by a survey undertaken by the committee.  Of every ten buildings on the main street, four are derelict, dilapidated, <Col N="1447" /> unoccupied or disused.  Such buildings are often boarded up.</P>
    <P>The population of Rathkeale has declined in recent years contributing to the spread of dereliction and decline.  In 1991, there were 1,803 people living in Rathkeale and in 1996 the population was 1,546, yet the population of neighbouring towns has increased dramatically.  Two-thirds of the people living in the main street are elderly and they do not have children who are likely to continue living there.  The main street is an area which needs to be designated.  The widespread dereliction, decline and disuse of the buildings must be addressed by tax designation.</P>
    <P>For many years a market for second-hand property has not existed because of the number of neighbouring derelict buildings.  No new residential development has taken place in Rathkeale. An alarming number of businesses in the town have closed.  Such a loss of economic activity is directly related to the decline in population.</P>
    <P>In compiling a strategic plan for the main street, the development committee consulted Limerick County Council for ideas to tackle the decline.  The county council wholly endorsed the promotion of the urban renewal scheme in Rathkeale.  The enactment of the Derelict Sites Act, 1990, to prevent property becoming derelict and detracting from the amenity, character or appearance of areas has proved difficult for Limerick County Council to implement.</P>
    <P>In the case of Rathkeale's main street, buildings continue to be neglected and are unsightly. Urban improvement measures, whether promoted by the county council, initiated by community organisations or provided by private enterprise, were implemented in recent years and improved the physical appearance of the town. Such improvements are overshadowed by a number of derelict properties which, until removed, will make it impossible to achieve the objective of improving the physical environment of the town, attracting people to live in it and sustaining new enterprise.</P>
    <P>The experience of other designated areas underlines the interest of many people, particularly young people, in buying town houses or apartments in urban areas and bringing life back into such centres.  Elderly people also prefer to live in towns given their proximity to services. The activity generated by an urban renewal scheme would halt the worsening process of decay and dereliction and would change the face of the town.  The result of such development would be to improve the amenities for the existing population and attract significant numbers of young people to live in the town.</P>
    <P>The enterprise committee recognises the strong focus of the urban renewal scheme on residential development relying on measures to conserve and use existing infrastructure.  Rathkeale needs social and economic rejuvenation.  Tax designation will encourage people to move back into the town and revitalise the community.  A successful <Col N="1448" /> town is associated with a growing population. Many people are ready and willing to make the necessary investment if tax designation is granted. Many locals have invested money elsewhere in recent years.  The risk in investing in property elsewhere is significantly lower and the likelihood of appreciation in the value of properties is higher in other towns.  The designation of the main street and, in particular, residential allowances will bring new life into the town.</P>
    <P>The survey carried out by the group indicated there are 56 derelict, dilapidated, unoccupied or disused houses on the main street, more than 39 per cent of the total.  Only 27 houses are residential, 13 are residential and business and 16 business alone.  Twenty of the houses have only one occupant, 22 have two and three have two or more occupants.  Occupants of 38 of the 42 residences consist of people living alone or two people living together who are more than 50 years of age.</P>
    <P>We must bring down the barriers to development. Fifty-six properties in the main street are derelict.  Property values in the town are plummeting and there is genuine economic decline.  In the past 20 years, 64 businesses have disappeared from the main street and have not been replaced. There is a decreasing population and increasing employment and we must break this vicious circle of decline.  I ask the Minister and the Government to acknowledge the urgency in designating the centre of Rathkeale for urban renewal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I turn to the specific case of Rathkeale, it would be helpful if the general issue of urban renewal was put in context.  In 1986, the tax incentive approach to urban renewal was first introduced.  Under this approach, a range of special incentives was introduced for new construction and refurbishment works in designated areas.  When that scheme came to an end in 1994 a new scheme was introduced.  Under the second scheme, areas were designated in 35 cities and towns throughout the country.  This scheme expired at the end of July this year except for certain projects then in progress.  Subject to certain criteria, such projects were given a further year up to the end of July 1998 for completion. In these circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that the issue of extending the current scheme to additional areas does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is widely accepted that the two schemes which have operated since 1986 have produced some very useful results.  We can all point to examples of areas where a striking visible transformation has taken place; areas where dereliction and decay have been replaced by vigour and vitality.  However, in 1995, after almost ten years' experience of the urban renewal schemes, it was felt that we needed to look beyond these visible signs and carry out a more detailed review of how the schemes had worked.  As part of that review, a team of consultants was appointed to carry out a study of the impacts of the schemes in fiscal/economic, social and architectural-urban <Col N="1449" /> design terms.  They were also asked to make recommendations in relation to the future direction of urban renewal policy.</P>
    <P>The study was completed last December.  It concluded that the schemes have been highly successful as a mechanism for leveraging private sector investment into areas of dereliction and decline.  In terms of architectural-urban design, the schemes were considered to have had mixed success.  In social terms, while some local employment was found in urban renewal developments, in other areas the benefits to local people were considered to be low.  In addition, the level of integration between residents of new apartments and the indigenous communities was considered to be poor.</P>
    <P>For the future, the study suggested the need for a more strategic approach.  In particular, the consultants recommended that designation should not take place in isolation but should emerge from an integrated action plan for the area.  The plan would not only deal with issues of physical renewal but would also address issues central to the wider social and economic regeneration of the area.  The preparation of plans in this way would provide an opportunity for the needs of areas to be fully assessed.  It would also ensure that the role of urban renewal in meeting those needs could be clearly identified.</P>
    <P>After its publication, the study's conclusions and recommendations became the subject of a process of public consultation.  This consultative process culminated in a conference in which all the relevant interests participated.  The consultations and conference together proved to be a very useful exercise in bringing together the various strands of opinion in regard to urban renewal.</P>
    <P>With all stages of the consultation process completed, the Government has approved a framework for a new urban renewal scheme.  The framework generally incorporates the recommendations made by the consultants and also takes on board some of the comments made during the consultative process.  The new scheme will come into effect on 1 August 1998 when the qualified extension of the current scheme terminates.</P>
    <P>In general, the new scheme will be more targeted and will focus on the areas most in need of renewal.  Decisions on the areas to be designated under the scheme will be based on integrated area plans prepared for areas selected by local authorities.  Plans will have to identify targeted focused sub-areas for designation, justify the designation of those sub-areas by reference to the objectives of the plan and indicate the basis on which incentives are sought.</P>
    <P>Draft guidelines for the new urban renewal scheme were issued to local authorities earlier this year.  Those guidelines, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, set out the criteria which local authorities should use to select the areas for which integrated area plans are to be prepared.  The document also provides guidance <Col N="1450" /> on the types of issues which those plans should address.</P>
    <P>The draft guidelines, which will be finalised very shortly, deal with the important issue of the size of areas likely to be suitable for consideration under the new scheme.  The point made in the guidelines is that very few towns of less than 6,000 population received designation under the schemes up to now and that such towns would be likely to have greater difficulty qualifying under the criteria for the current scheme.  While this does not equate to setting a strict 6,000 population threshold, it does reflect the view that the successful implementation of the urban renewal scheme in an area requires a certain level of scale. Generally, centres would need to have a population of at least 6,000 to provide that scale.  What must be remembered is that the scheme is an urban renewal scheme.  It is not intended as, nor should it be expected to provide, a solution to the problems of towns irrespective of size.</P>
    <P>In regard to the specific case of Rathkeale raised by the Deputy, the position is that the designation of that town under the new scheme could only be considered if Limerick County Council was to decide, on the basis of the criteria, that an integrated area plan should be prepared for the town.  In that context, the council would clearly have to consider the extent to which the town meets the criteria for the new scheme, given that it has a population of only just in excess of 1,500 people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this item for the Adjournment.  The Minister of State, who is busy this evening, dealt with health and other issues earlier.  I regret that one of the three Ministers in the Department of the Environment and Local Government is not present to listen to what I have to say and to respond specifically to the points I will make.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who was a colleague of mine in the Seanad, is present and I wish him well as junior Minister at the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>In the latter part of the last century in Britain a position developed where many of the constituencies in that jurisdiction were referred to as rotten boroughs.  The same position is developing in our urban areas, particularly in the South Dublin County Council area.  It is a relatively new area and encompasses the towns of Tallaght and Clondalkin and the older areas of Rathfarnham and Lucan.  It is under-represented by the number of councillors on that local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1996 census shows there are 218,000 persons in South Dublin County Council administrative area.  That represents an increase of 4.5 per cent compared to the last census.  There are only 26 members on that local authority.  Under the recent census that compares to 32 members on Clare County Council representing an administrative area with a population of 94,000.  It also <Col N="1451" /> compares to the Minister of State's local authority, Galway County Council, which has 30 members and represents an administrative area with a population of 131,000.  Those figures show variations between the number of people in different administrative areas and the number of councillors on local authorities.  This is not good enough.  I call on the Government to outline its strategy in this regard.</P>
    <P>In our county area there are seven wards.  In the Clondalkin ward only three councillors serve 23,000 people while in the Greenhills ward four councillors serve 18,000 people.  There are inequities not only in terms of the number of local authority members on each council but in the local authorities in regard to the boundaries and the vast change in the size of the population, particularly in the new suburbs.  Tallaght, the third largest conurbation in the country, has ten local authority members.  It has a population of 70,000 compared to Limerick city with a population of 52,000.  There are 17 members on the local authority in Limerick compared to ten on the local authority in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>What is the Government's strategy to address these anomalies as we approach the local elections next year?  This position cannot continue. There are no guidelines on the ratio of the number of councillors to the number of people in an administrative area unlike the guidelines in the Constitution on the boundary commission.  What is the strategy of the Department of the Environment and Local Government on this as local authority members will probably go before the people next year?  The position, particularly in new county councils in Fingal, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin, cannot be allowed to continue.  I eagerly await the response of the Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised an issue as to local authority representation which cannot be considered unique to South Dublin and relates to the appropriate number of members for each and every local authority.  I welcome the Deputy to this House and it is good we both transferred from the Upper House.  There are no constitutional or statutory requirements relating to equality of representation between local authorities. Each local authority operates within its administrative area and the main priority is that the relevant council has sufficient members to carry out its functions effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general councillor-population ratios as between the different cities and counties vary enormously and to date there has not been any attempt to grapple with this situation and with it the possibility that while some authorities might gain others could face a reduction in their membership. The representational issue can be seen as even more extreme at town authority level <Col N="1452" /> with over 740 councillors to represent what amounts to a small segment of the national population. This is the background against which the question of the appropriate level of local representation falls to be considered.</P>
    <P>Among the many issues which arise in the context of any overall review of current local representational arrangements is that of the dual national-local mandate and whether it should be eliminated; the desirability of some local authority presence closer to the community at a more local level below that of city-county; the bringing together of the local government and local development systems post 1999; the public view generally as to changes in levels of representation; and the optimum size of local membership. Clearly, councils of unwieldy size are undesirable.  The former Dublin County Council was generally accepted to fall into this category. A simple proposal to base the number of members of a council on the national average population or on some variation of the national average would be likely to result in unrealistic and cumbersome levels of representation in the case of some of the larger authorities.  These points are being made to show that we are dealing with a complex issue and that it would be wholly inappropriate at this point to single out any individual local authority which felt its case merited special attention and to deal with it in isolation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is committed to a fundamental and comprehensive programme of local government renewal across the whole spectrum of issues &mdash; funding, functions, organisation, human resources, efficiency, legislation and representation.</P>
    <P>There will be many differing views on the appropriate level of councillor representation.  It is not a simple issue and will be looked at in the context of the programme for local government renewal.  Next year the Minister for the Environment and Local Government hopes to bring before the House a local government Bill to underpin that programme and generally modernise local government law which will provide a full opportunity for debate and consideration.</P>
    <P>There is of course statutory provision for the revision of electoral areas within local authorities to ensure reasonable equality of representation between the electoral areas of a local authority. The question of whether a general review of electoral areas is necessary is currently being examined in the context of the 1996 population figures which are now available.  Should such a review be undertaken, the position of electoral areas in south County Dublin would also be considered and any proposals for a revision of the electoral areas in that county considered necessary would be brought forward.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 18 November 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 16, 61 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>Concerns about the impact of mussel farming and other forms of shellfish aquaculture on the marine environment relate primarily to ensuring that the operations are managed and regulated in line with navigational safety considerations.  Management and regulation must also address interactions with fishing, wildlife and habitat, tourism, recreational use of the marine resource as well as visual and litter considerations.  International research endorsed by the EU Commission, and work by our own Marine Institute confirms that any potential environmental impact of mussel farming is limited by definition since no feed is supplied to the organisms.  Any organic enrichment which occurs, and which will in any event be highly localised, will be minimised and reversed by good management, location and spacing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absolute dependence of mussel farming and aquaculture generally on the quality of the <Col N="1454" /> aquatic environment makes it an effective continuous monitor of water quality in its own right. Aquaculture itself can be adversely affected by agriculture, industry, tourism and recreation.  This underlines the need to ensure a balanced and equitable approach to all developments and users of the marine resource &mdash; with aquaculture as an equal rights partner in that process.</P>
    <P>Mussel farming is a valuable and growing component of the Irish aquaculture industry, generating significant jobs, revenue, value added and exports with resultant benefits for coastal communities. Aquaculture production reached 35,000 tonnes worth over £40 million in 1996 of which mussels contributed 15,000 tonnes worth £5 million. The aquaculture industry is small by international standards but has a well established reputation for quality in the international market place.  The Government is committed to supporting continued sustainable development of the aquaculture sector with full regard for environmental concerns and the needs of other users.</P>
    <P>As I advised the Deputy in a recent reply, the Department has acted to address the unlicensed mussel farming activity at Dunmanus Bay.</P>
    <P>As I previously advised, failure by the company in question to remove the unlicensed longlines will lead to legal proceedings.  I am also confident that strengthened powers and penalties under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, will act as a real deterrent to unauthorised developments. Finally, I have arranged for a map of the area in question in Dunmanus Bay to be provided to the Deputy as requested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the need to provide for the safety of all persons being taken on boat trips by licensed boat operators.  I assure the Deputy that the operation of licensed passenger boats is continuously monitored by my Department to ensure that the highest standards of safety are set and enforced, to minimise the risks to human safety on our seas, rivers and lakes.</P>
      <P>Passenger vessels which carry more than 12 passengers are statutorily required to hold a valid passenger vessel safety certificate, which certifies that the vessel is fit to operate, subject to any conditions that may be imposed upon it.  These are issued annually on foot of surveys, conducted by a marine surveyor of my Department, which involve thorough inspection of the vessel and its equipment, as well as the operation of safety standards on board.  The certificate also specifies the limits beyond which the vessel may not ply and the maximum number of passengers that may be carried.  The passenger vessel safety certificate is only issued after a nominated person or persons are approved by the Marine Survey Office of my Department to act as master of the vessel.  The approval process requires that the person satisfy my marine survey office of a level of competence commensurate with the size of the vessel and the sea conditions in which the vessel will operate.</P>
      <P>The Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, provides that all passenger boats carrying 12 or fewer passengers must also be inspected and licensed by my Department.  A passenger boat licence may only be granted after the vessel has been inspected by a marine surveyor of my Department and found to be suitable.  The operators of all such vessels must, for licensing purposes, satisfy a comprehensive range of safety standards in relation to vessel construction and seaworthiness, and approved firefighting, life-saving and radio equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is the case with a passenger vessel safety certificate, the passenger boat licence also specifies the limits beyond which the boat may not ply and the maximum number of passengers that may be carried.  Passenger boats are surveyed by the <Col N="1456" /> Marine Survey Office every two years to have their licence renewed.</P>
    <P>Boats used for sea angling are defined as fishing vessels under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, and do not require a passenger boat licence under that Act.  All fishing vessel operators, including the operators of sea angling boats are encouraged to comply with comprehensive safety requirements including carriage of lifejackets and other essential safety equipment.</P>
    <P>Sea angling boats must, however, be regularly surveyed and certified by my Department under the Merchant Shipping (Load Line) Rules, 1968, for compliance with constructional standards. Vessels, including sea angling boats, are exempt from the Load Line Rules if they are less than 80 registered tonnes and do not carry cargo; do not carry more than 12 passengers; and do not operate more than 15 miles from the point of departure or more than three miles from land.</P>
    <P>Before a passenger boat licence or a load line certificate or exemption is issued, the Marine Survey Office must be satisfied as to the knowledge and ability of a designated person or persons in relation to the operation of the vessel, familiarity with the area of operation, emergency procedures, and the use of firefighting and safety equipment.  Only persons actually named on the licence or certificate are permitted to act as skipper of the vessel when carying passengers or anglers.</P>
    <P>While there is no statutory requirement at present for these persons to hold a recognised certificate of competency, the need to have persons trained to that level of competence &mdash; who will skipper licensed boats &mdash; is kept under constant review by my Department.</P>

      <P>The Marine Institute has recently forwarded its feasibility study on the introduction of a total allowable catch, quota and tagging regime for salmon which was a key recommendation of the salmon management task force.  In parallel with the Department's examination of these proposals, I propose to disseminate the document to all relevant players in the salmon sector and invite their views.  This wide-ranging consultative process will inform decisions on this new management strategy and is essential if we are to continue and build on the hard won consensus on future directions for salmon management which the task force achieved so admirably.</P>

      <Col N="1457" /> I have asked the Marine Institute, the Central Fisheries Board and the Salmon Research Agency to provide me with a comprehensive assessment of the impact and effectiveness of the salmon conservation measures taken this year.  I hope to have this shortly and will be glad to brief Deputies on the findings.  Initial reports available to me on catches and stocks highlight the need to continue at minimum with existing conservation measures.</P>

      <P>There are currently about 800 people employed in the extraction of those minerals which are within my area of responsibility under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1995.  This includes base metals, gypsum, dolomite and various other minerals referred to in the Schedule to the 1940 Act but does not include quarrying for stone, sand, gravel, clay or peat which do not come under my remit.  Approximately 150 people are employed in minerals exploration.</P>
      <P>An additional 200 direct jobs are anticipated at the zinc-lead mine at Galmoy, County Kilkenny when it reaches full production next year.  The Lisheen zinc-lead mine, for which I granted a State mining lease in October, is expected to provide over 300 jobs when it reaches full production at the turn of the century.</P>
      <P>There are 18 currently held State mining facilities in the State for development of minerals and 404 prospecting licences.  Details may be obtained in the statutory twice yearly reports which are presented to Dáil and Seanad Éireann under the Minerals Development Acts and which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

    <P>My Department is currently considering applications for six State mining facilities for minerals such as zinc-lead, calcite, gypsum, dolomite and <Col N="1458" /> fireclay.  The Deputy will appreciate that not all applications proceed to the issue of a facility and it would be inappropriate therefore to publicise details at this time.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that in accordance with standard practice, before any such facility is granted I will give public notice of my intention to do so and will allow ample time for consideration of any submissions in relation thereto.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 21 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am comprehensively reviewing the structures, services and organisation of the inland fisheries sector with a view to implementing the necessary degree of change, both legislative and organisational, to deliver as my strategic objectives for the inland fisheries resource.  My objective is to ensure effective and efficient delivery of service <Col N="1459" /> and best deployment of human and financial resources.  I have already announced my intention to move to a &ldquo;catchment management&rdquo; strategy for conservation development and management of fisheries.</P>
    <P>This will give better ownership of development strategies at regional and local communities level. This strategy will be combined with improved management delivery, resource deployment, quantified targets and greater clarity in the respective roles of the Department, the Central Fisheries Board and the Regional Fisheries Boards.</P>
    <P>Immediately on taking office I requested the Central Fisheries Board to draw up, as a priority, a five year inland fisheries development plan which I expect to receive shortly.  My decisions on future strategic directions for inland fisheries will be fully informed by this plan, with the Comptroller and Auditor General's helpful report on the management of inland fisheries, the Salmon Management Task Force report and successive consultancy reports into the organisation and management of the inland fisheries service.</P>
    <P>In light of this review I have concluded that it would be best to postpone elections to the regional fisheries boards for one year.  These would normally be due next month.  I am writing accordingly to the chairmen of the boards to advise them of my decision.  It follows that the elections to the fisheries development societies will also be postponed for one year which will allow me to complete the current review of their operations also.</P>

    <P>On 14 October last I brought the House up-do-date on the information I had received from the UK authorities on the dumping of radioactive material in the Irish Sea.  Since then my Department <Col N="1460" /> has received some further information from the UK authorities concerning the dumping of material in the Holyhead Deep in 1975.

    <P>All this information is now being examined by the task force which I established to advise me on the implications of all information becoming available and the measures necessary to ensure marine life and human health are fully protected.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 40, 41 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Research Centre has advised me that 39 fish kills have been reported to date in 1997, involving approximately 264,000 fish.  The comparable statistics for 1996 are 47 reported involving 33,400 fish.  I am sure that Deputies will share my serious concern that while the number of fish kills is slightly down on 1996, the destruction of fish due to several particularly appalling incidents was exponentially greater.  The main causes of the 1997 fish kills identified to date were enrichment agriculture practices, sewage-water-works and industrial.</P>
      <P>I am giving the highest priority to tackling pollution and the causes of pollution in fisheries and fish habitats.  My six-point action plan is designed to ensure that the resources of the fisheries service and of all relevant agencies are co-ordinated and deployed to best effect to deal with pollution, both by tackling its causes and by acting swiftly when it occurs.  I have asked the Central Fisheries Board to expedite implementation of the plan in consultation with the regional fisheries boards. The board is in the process of establishing a dedicated environmental co-ordination unit to advance this strategy together with progressing the other elements of the plan.</P>
      <P>My overall objective is to ensure that resources are effectively deployed in the crucial tasks of pollution prevention, monitoring and incident response.  To do this, we need a partnership approach across all the relevant agencies and sectors, to ensure that fisheries resources, and the habitats which support them, are protected and conserved; and I am confident that I will have the co-operation of all interested groups to achieve these goals.</P>

      <Quest>the bodies with which he will consult in relation to the Irish fishing industry before an Order is made redrawing Britain's fishery limits and measuring them from St. Kilda rather than Rockall; his views on this development; and the assurance, if any, he will give that fishery protection will be adequate to police a new agreement.</Quest>

      <P>The Deputy's question relates to the decision last July of the United Kingdom Government to accede to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  This decision was accompanied by an order restating UK fishery limits as required under the terms of the convention and which in effect removes any UK claim to a fishing zone around the island of Rockall.</P>
      <P>A full assessment, involving all relevant Departments, of the implications for Ireland of the United Kingdom's accession to UNCLOS is under way.  Any necessary consequential actions will be pursued as appropriate following this assessment.  My Department has had discussions with the fishing industry, on the implications of alteration of the UK fisheries limits.  There will be further consultation as required.</P>
      <P>The initial advice to me is that the redrawing by the UK of the fisheries limits should not have a significant effect on the Irish fishing industry. The Irish exclusive economic zone will continue to be efficiently and effectively policed by our own fisheries protection services.</P>

      <P>I received numerous requests this summer for extensions to the commercial fishing season in various regions around the coast.  Having carefully considered all the submissions made to me, the advice of relevant regional fisheries boards and the scientific assessments by the Central Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute, as well as the particular local circumstances, I decided, as an exceptinal measure, to grant extensions in just three specific areas: the North-Western Fisheries Region, the Rivers Cashen-Feale, and the Waterford Fisheries District &mdash; effectively allowing fishermen in the relevant areas up to five days' additional fishing time.</P>
      <P>My key policy objective is to secure the future for salmon in its own right and in the economic interests of the rural and coastal communities which it supports.  I am, therefore, working to conserve and enhance salmon stocks in the interest of all legitimate stakeholders in the resource.  In that context, as I previously advised the House, my immediate priority is to review the various salmon conservation measures introduced for the 1997 season, and I have asked the Marine Institute, the Central Fisheries Board and the Salmon Research Agency to provide me with a comprehensive assessment of the impact and effectiveness of the salmon conservation measures taken this year.  I hope to have this shortly, but I say that initial reports available to me on catches and stocks highlight the need at least to continue with existing conservation measures.</P>

      <P>My responsibilities under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1995, relate only to minerals as defined within those Acts.  This does not include sand, stone, gravel, clay or peat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By its nature the extent of the mineral wealth in the national territory is unknown until such time as all deposits have been discovered.  At <Col N="1466" /> present over 400 prospecting licences are held by companies or individuals conducting exploration work to identify and-or prove up mineral deposits in an effort to bring them into production.</P>
    <P>A number of significant deposits are currently in production or development, notably Tara Mines Ltd.'s zinc-lead mine at Navan, County Meath, Gypsum Industries operations in counties Monaghan and Cavan, Arcon Mines Ltd.'s zinc-lead mine at Galmoy, County Kilkenny and the recently permitted Lisheen zinc-lead deposit in County Tipperary which has just commenced construction.  It would be inappropriate to discuss monetary valuations of these deposits, which are commercially sensitive and based on confidential information.  However, the output from Irish mines, which obviously depends on prices, has fluctuated at around £80 to £100 million per annum in recent years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 42 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to the development of effective protection programmes for areas of the coastline which are threatened by erosion.</P>
      <P>Funding for coast protection schemes has improved considerably in the recent past, with some £5.1 million available under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99.  I recognise, however, that a significant programme of investment is needed in the years ahead to allow the problem of erosion to be tackled effectively.  I am currently reviewing the issues involved and possible solutions, and the development of coast protection strategies and priorities will be a key element in the definition of overall policy on coastal zone management in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Counties Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow have benefited considerably from the funding currently available for coast protection.</P>
      <P>Support was provided in 1996 towards emergency works at Cunnigar and Tramore, County Waterford and studies of the erosion problem at these sites, and a scheme at Tramore which will cost £150,000 has now been approved.</P>
      <P>Considerable funds have also been made available in County Wexford over the last few years. Funding for a £100,000 rock revetment at Courtown and a £75,000 scheme of rock armouring at Duncannon has been provided and a major scheme, costing some £1.5 million, has been completed at Rosslare Strand.</P>
      <P>In the case of County Wicklow, a major beach nourishment scheme is planned at Bray and will cost in the region of £2.5 million.  Aid was also made available to Wicklow County Council during 1996 to undertake a beach and dune management scheme at Brittas Bay.</P>

      <P>Ireland has been to the forefront in pushing for additional EU measures which will enhance control and monitoring of fishing vessels landing their catch into member states other than their state of registry.  I am glad to say that the Commission is currently preparing proposals for the enhancement of fisheries control measures and I will be pressing the incoming UK Presidency and the Commission for these to be expedited with a view to making substantive progress early next year.</P>
      <P>I will continue to press for all member states to show demonstrable commitment to their legal responsibilities to monitor and control the activity of their own fishing vessels, as well as of those other vessels landing into their ports.</P>

      <P>The Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, commits to modernising the fishing fleet, and since my appointment as Minister I have been working to deliver on that commitment as quickly as possible.  I announced two weeks ago a new round of Exchequer and EU supported investment of £11 million in the modernisation of the fishing fleet.  The package provides some £3.5 million in EU and Exchequer grant aid for 112 fleet modernisation projects under Ireland's Operational Programme for Fisheries. This investment is aimed primarily at the whitefish fleet to enhance safety, quality and competitiveness in the sector.</P>
      <P>In addition to my plans for a capital grant aid scheme for a number of new whitefish boats which are currently being finalised, I am pursuing other options to facilitate and attract investment in the fleet, in line with the Action Programme for the Millennium which gives a specific commitment to making the industry attractive to providers of capital by examining the provision of fiscal incentives.  My aim in progressing the various initiatives which I have outlined is to achieve a significant turnaround of the whitefish fleet.</P>

      <P>As Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources protection of the marine resource from pollution is one of my key objectives to which I am very much committed.</P>
      <P>Ireland is party to many important international conventions for marine environment protection and I will ensure that we will continue to play active roles in the operation and development of these measures including the adoption of as many of their provisions as possible as soon as practicable.  One of my first actions will be on Marpol 73/78 which provides for regulations for the control and prevention of operational pollution from ships.  I intend to have amended versions of the regulations pertaining to oil, noxious liquid substances carried in bulk and garbage in place shortly together with additional regulations for the control and prevention of pollution by harmful substances carried by sea in packaged form.</P>
      <P>As early as possible in the coming year I intend to put in place three further important measures viz.  protocols amending the current Civil Liability Compensation and Fund Conventions which will increase threefold the levels of compensation for oil pollution incidents in our waters; the Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention which will ensure that proper arrangements are in place to deal with emergency situations arising from spillages of oil at sea; and the HNS Convention on Liability and Compensation for pollution by hazardous and noxious substances which will complement the Civil Liability Compensation and Fund Conventions for oil pollution to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the task force on radioactive dumping which I set up some time ago.  I expect to receive the report from this group shortly and will take whatever action is necessary in the light of its recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the House last month, the salmon management strategies I am currently progressing do not include plans to terminate net salmon fishing.  My overall policy is aimed at maximising on a sustainable basis the value of the wild salmon resource.  A basic tenet of this policy's implementation is that the balance of advantage, on conservation, ecological and economic grounds should lie increasingly with redirecting salmon exploitation towards the rivers and estuaries.</P>
      <P>In that context, as I have previously advised this House, my immediate priority is to review the various salmon conservation measures introduced for the 1997 season, and I have asked the Marine Institute, the Central Fisheries Board and the Salmon Research Agency to provide me with a comprehensive assessment of the impact and effectiveness of the salmon conservation measures taken this year.  I hope to have this shortly, but I can say that initial reports available to me on catches and stocks highlight the need at least to continue with existing conservation measures.</P>
      <P>On salmon management strategies generally, I have already announced my intention to move to a catchment-based approach for inland fisheries management, involving and empowering all users and beneficiaries at local community level.  The catchment approach will address the specific and localised impacts of salmon management and conservation strategies, through ongoing review and consultation with all stakeholders in the salmon resource.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, the Marine Institute has recently forwarded to this Department its feasibility study on the introduction of a total allowable catch, quota and tagging regime for salmon which was a key recommendation of the Salmon Management Task Force.  In parallel with the Department's own examination of these proposals, I propose to disseminate the document very shortly to all relevant players in the salmon sector and invite their views.  This wideranging <Col N="1474" /> consultative process will inform decisions on this new management strategy and is in my view essential if we are to continue and build on the hard won consensus on future directions for salmon management which the task force achieved so admirably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is major potential for the development of natural resources in Ireland.  My role is to establish a workable development and regulatory framework within which that potential can be realised and which has the confidence of the public.</P>
      <P>Turning to specifics, I would note in regard to hydrocarbons that we have established potential for discoveries both offshore and onshore.  In the offshore we have a vast Continental Shelf and 13 major basins and troughs have been identified. Much of the shelf remains underexplored but from 1971 to date 129 exploration wells have been drilled and since 1965 a total of 348 separate surveys have been carried out from which approximately 316,000 line kilometres of seismic data which has been acquired.  Ten surveys have been carried out in onshore basins but none has been carried out since 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> Details of the various surveys carried out are contained in the half-yearly reports laid before each House of the Oireachtas in accordance with section 57 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 and copies of those reports are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>In relation to mineral resources, in addition to areas covered by State mining facilities granted under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1995, there are now over 400 areas covered by prospecting licences granted under those Acts, which have potential for development if commercially viable deposits are found there.  Considerable effort is directed by the private sector to finding such deposits and Ireland ranks high internationally as a prospective source of further commercially viable deposits of zinc and lead in particular.  While most promoting effort concerns zinc and lead, considerable prospecting activity relates to finding industrial minerals (such as gypsum) as well as gold and diamonds.  As the development (that is mining) of mineral deposits is entirely funded by the private sector, it will be appreciated that the decision to mine a particular deposit will depend on the ability of the entrepreneur to fund the development and comply fully with the permitting requirements (including mine site rehabilitation and proper mine closure, for which an up-front surety must be in place before mining starts).</P>
    <P>In relation to forestry, I would refer the Deputy to the strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector in Ireland which establishes a framework for the development of forestry well into the 21st century.  This is a detailed blueprint and I think the Deputy will find it of interest.</P>
    <P>In relation to marine resources, the potential for development is underpinned by a substantial research effort to which I am personally committed. The Marine Institute is now making a valuable contribution and is industry focused.  The extent and depth of the research is such that it would be beyond the scope of this question but it covered aquaculture development, fish stock assessment, exploitation of new species, new catchment technologies, environmental protection and many others.</P>

      <P>While Waterford County Council is also primarily responsible for development of landing and other facilities at these locations, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources provides aid for development works at fishery harbours. Funding for such works is limited and is being focused in the main on a small number of strategic harbours.

I will, however, keep the matter under review, in light of the resources available, in the drawing up of my Department's programmes for fishery harbours development in 1998 and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>A Commission of Inquiry established by the Maltese Ministry of Transport in January 1996 to investigate the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the aircraft has almost finished its deliberations.  It is waiting to receive from Tunisia a tape recording of the last conversations between the pilot of the aircraft and Air Traffic Control at Djerba.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the keen desire of the family of the Irish person involved that this investigation be concluded as soon as possible.  Through the embassy in Rome and the consulate in Valletta the Department of Foreign Affairs is keeping in touch with developments and is conveying the family's concerns to the Maltese authorities.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that my Department carries <Col N="1481" /> out sufficient inspectors to ensure the <i>bona fides</i> of those foodstuffs for which it has statutory responsibility.</P>
      <P>My Department implements some 62 pieces of legislation dealing with food safety and quality. Under that legislation various control functions including regular inspections and sampling which encompass meat, dairy products, veterinary medicines, zoonotic diseases, beef classification, pesticide control and the application of quality standards in the dairy produce, poultry and eggs, fruit and vegetables and animal feed areas, are carried out.  In addition, analytical and related activities are provided by the Department's various laboratories.</P>
      <P>As regards imported meat and meat products, the subject of Parliamentary Question No. 107 of 6 November 1997, extensive and widespread checks have been carried out by officers from my Department with the support of the Garda and Customs authorities on vehicles carrying animals and food products both at the Border with Northern Ireland and at the main ports.  Veterinary inspectors of my Department also carry out regular inspections of premises and establishments to ensure that the import regulations are being complied with.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the European Communities (Trade in Animals and Animal Products) Regulations, 1994 (S. I. No. 289 of 1994) all importers of animal products are required to be registered by my Department and a register of importers is maintained by my Department.  Under the same regulations, importers are required to provide 24 hours advance notice in writing of the details of every consignment intended for importation and a record is kept of the origin and type of product, intended destination, etc., of each consignment notified.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department to investigate any person or company suspected of flouting the import regulations and to institute legal proceedings against those who are subsequently found to be in breach of those regulations.  If the Deputy has any doubt about the authenticity of a particular product on sale here he should provide details to my Department where the matter will be fully investigated.</P>

      <P>The package is aimed at producers who had finished heifers and finished male animals slaughtered at licensed meat export premises or licensed abattoirs in the period 1 April 1997 to 10 June 1997.  Producers of finished heifers weighing not less than 450 kilograms sold through livestock marts within the same period will also be compensated. The rate of payment will be about £41 per animal.  Payments are expected to commence in mid-December.</P>
      <P>In addition, the overall package provides for the payment of a £2 top-up of the 1996 special beef premium covering all animals on which the 22 month instalment of premium was paid.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 85 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible children in the Dublin 3 area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.  I have been advised by the Eastern Health Board that the proposed regional orthodontic department at Beaumont Hospital could not be incorporated in the main building and it is now proposed to construct a free-standing building on an identified site.  The Eastern Health Board and the board of Beaumont Hospital have identified a site within <Col N="1485" /> the campus of the hospital as suitable for the construction of a second regional orthodontic department. Work is now at the planning stage and the board proposes to commence construction in 1998.</P>
    <P>The health board orthodontic services are currently being developed in accordance with the Dental Health Action Plan.  The action plan provides for the phased improvement of orthodontic treatment services through a consultant led orthodontic service in each health board.</P>
    <P>In September 1996 the Eastern Health Board established the regional orthodontic department in St. James' Hospital.  The orthodontic consultant and her staff based there provide orthodontic services for the Eastern Health Board region.  The board is consolidating and extending its orthodontic services under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant.  A primary task of the consultant is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to sub-consultant level for health board dental staff.  This enables health boards to provide a greatly increased volume of service and a service of high quality.</P>
    <P>Prior to the establishment of the regional orthodontic department in St. James' Hospital the Eastern Health Board provided orthodontic services on an <i>ad-hoc</i> basis partly by the employment of private practitioners working three hour sessions in North Strand Health Centre.</P>
    <P>As part of the service development the board intends to phase out sessional arrangements by private practitioners in North Strand Health Centre and assign patients on the waiting list to the regional orthodontic department at St. James' Hospital for assessment and treatment by the consultant and her staff.  Satellite clinics of the regional orthodontic department will be held at North Strand Health Centre.  The position regarding North Strand Health Centre will be kept under review as the services develop, particularly in relation to Beaumont Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of last August 9,753 people were in receipt of a carer's allowance at an estimated full year cost of £36.4 million.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of improvements in this payment since its introduction in 1990.  In this year's Social Welfare Act a change was introduced to the rule which required that the carer must provide full-time care and attention in order to cater for those situations in which recipients of care attend approved rehabilitation courses. Under the new arrangements, the person may attend a recognised non-residential rehabilitation training or day care centre.  Furthermore, an additional payment of 50 per cent of the basic rate, was introduced for carers who take care of more than one person.  Nonetheless, it remains a specific condition of the scheme that the carer provide the person being cared for with full-time care and attention and there are no regulations which exempt the carer from residing with the person requiring care.</P>
      <P>In this Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to: progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit; and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.  In line with these commitments, I will consider the further development of the scheme in the context of an overall review of the provisions for carers, which is being carried out by my Department and in the light of budgetary considerations.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to this matter is that the company involved approached the Garda Síochána with a proposal to co-locate their equipment on certain Garda radio masts or sites.  The Garda station at Ballymote was included on the list of sites of interest to the company.  In accordance with the desire to avoid a proliferation of such masts and to promote the sharing of masts by different operators, as recommended in the Department of the Environment guidelines for planning authorities concerning telecommunications antennae and support structures, the previous Government approved the proposal, subject to the company complying fully with planning requirements, health and safety legislation, the Radiological Protection Act and all relevant guidelines which may be set down from time to time by the International Radiation Protection Association.  There is a contractual agreement with the company in relation to the use of Garda sites by which I am bound.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that the application in respect of the person referred to in the question was received in my Department on 5 November 1997 and is currently under active consideration by our legal advisers in the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  As the Deputy may be aware, they must confirm that the offences for which the person referred to was convicted in the United Kingdom would also constitute offences if committed in this jurisdiction.  We are now awaiting their advice, on receipt of which, I will be in a position to make a decision on the application.</P>
      <P>Assuming this application is consented to, the United Kingdom authorities will be advised accordingly.  We will then have to await the consent of the Home Secretary and formal consent of the prisoner to the transfer.  There must be three-way prior consent from the sentenced person and from the authorities of both States for a transfer to take place.  On receipt of same, arrangements will be made to apply to the High Court for the necessary warrant authorising his transfer into this juridsdiction and his continued detention.</P>
      <P>I should point out that these procedures are as required under the convention and must be adhered to in considering any transfer application. Unfortunately, it is not possible to say how long it will take for this application to be considered.  However, I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to process this application as quickly as possible.
