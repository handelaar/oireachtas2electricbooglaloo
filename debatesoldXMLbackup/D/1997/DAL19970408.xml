      <P>The Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, provides that the commission shall consist of a president and four other members appointed by the Government.  The term of office of the current president will expire on 19 October.  The terms of office of the three former part-time members expired on 1 January and of the former full-time member on 28 February.  The Government is actively considering filling the vacancies which have arisen and an announcement on the matter will be made shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When I raised this matter with the Taoiseach on 29 January he praised the Law Reform Commission and expressed his appreciation of the valuable work done by it since its establishment in 1975.  I asked him when the members of the new commission would be appointed.  The terms of office of four members have expired.  Why have the vacant posts not been filled in the past three to four months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the posts to be filled within the next week.  The Law Reform Commission commissioned Deloitte and Touche to carry out a review of its operations.  We were hoping not to make the appointments until the report was to hand but it looks as if it will not be to hand for a little while.  We are proceeding to make the appointments straightaway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the Law Reform Commission were appointed on a non-political basis.  I hope the Taoiseach will confirm that the members of the new commission will be appointed on the same basis and that there will be female representation.  Given that the outgoing <Col N="210" /> commission was engaged in a review of its own legislative activities and many other issues, why did the Government not do what it did in the case of several other boards and extend its remit by three months to allow it to finish this work, rather than tell its members well in advance they would not be reappointed and then do nothing for three to four months afterwards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria for appointing the members of the Law Reform Commission will be the same as previously and there will be female representation of a significant proportion.  The reasons for the delay in making the appointments have been fully explained.  The outgoing commission was in office uninterrupted for ten years and the Government took the view that it was time to bring in new people.  Without adverting to the work of the outgoing members, in a matter of this nature there is a case for renewal after a period of ten years.  We are undertaking such a renewal.  This will improve matters and, at the same time, build on the good work done by the outgoing commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the excellent work done by the outgoing four members of the Law Reform Commission during the past ten years.  However, they were not allowed to complete the review in which they were engaged, which seems an extraordinary way for the Government to show its appreciation of their work.  This shows that the Government does not have much interest in the work of the commission. Will the Government announce shortly the work it would like the new commission to undertake or is this a matter that will be left unattended for another three or four months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission did not undertake a review; the Deputy seems to be under a misapprehension on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It commissioned a body to carry it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It commissioned an outside body, Deloitte &amp; Touche, to carry out a review. The Government considered not appointing the new commission until that report was to hand to see if there was anything in it which ought to be taken into account in the composition of the commission. However, as that report is not to hand the Government decided to proceed with the appointments.</P>
      <P>The work programme of the commission is a separate matter.  The commission has a substantial work programme in hand which will be continued by the new commission.  The question of requesting it to do further specific work will be reviewed by the Government in the very near future at the time of the announcement of the new appointees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I impress on the Taoiseach the need to ensure that the criteria used to fill the <Col N="211" /> vacancies on the Law Reform Commission are not the same as those used for filling the positions on the new harbour boards or the Garda Síochána Complaints Board to which the Government appointed party hacks.  Some members of the Law Reform Commission have, very unusually, expressed publicly their disappointment at being interrupted in midstream in terms of the extremely good work they were carrying out.  Will the Taoiseach agree a case can be made to allow the body which was working on a number of documents to continue?  I am somewhat suspicious of the decision by the Taoiseach and the Government to wait so long to reappoint four members of this body.  As a number of its members said, it is crucial that the Law Reform Commission is not politically aligned and that some people who are not lawyers are appointed to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's fundamental proposition that political alignment <i>per se</i> should disqualify people from appointment to boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party is a past master at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a considerable difficulty in attracting people into political life and if the Deputy takes the view that a person who joins a political party is, to use his term, a &ldquo;hack&rdquo; and, therefore, not worthy to serve on a public body he is showing very poor regard for our profession and is probably undermining his party leader's attempts to bring people into political life, which attempts I applaud, agree with and am engaged in myself.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw the term &ldquo;political hack&rdquo; in regard to appointees.  I know appointees to State boards who were chosen by the Deputy's party when in office and were open and honest members of that party and this in no way interfered with the work they did.  Rather it helped them understand a wider slice of public life than they might ever have understood if they had not become involved in active party politics. I do not agree with the holier than thou attitude of Deputy Dermot Ahern who wishes to make the point that people who have been involved in politics should not be appointed to State boards. When the Deputy's party was in office it appointed people from among its own supporters and I do not see anything wrong with that.</P>

      <P>As I said to Deputy Bertie Ahern, the same criteria will be used in choosing the appointees to the Law Reform Commission as we used in the past.  I do not have the slightest doubt that even the Deputy will not find grounds for criticism of any of the appointees we will make to the Law Reform Commission on any of the criteria he has put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach follow the normal practice so that the new members, who should have been appointed four months ago, are not politically aligned and, like previous members, hold positions of expertise?  Maureen Gaffney was the only non-lawyer on the commission, Professor Duncan was involved in family law and Mr. O'Leary worked in the Director of Public Prosecution's office.  This is the reason they worked very successfully and were reappointed by successive Governments.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will not tell the House why he will not appoint the members of the Law Reform Commission.  I thought he would have welcomed the opportunity to appoint the members so that the commission could continue its excellent work. However, for some reason he saw fit to tell these people some time last autumn that they would not be reappointed.  Normally the Government appoints people approximately six months in advance so that it can abolish the old board and put the new board in place.  However, for some extraordinary reason which he has not told the House, the Taoiseach told these people last October-November they were no longer needed, had served their term in office &mdash; which I accept if their tenure is up &mdash; and did not let them complete their work, which I do not accept.</P>
      <P>Their remit could have been extended until Easter which would have been the sensible course of action if they were not being reappointed.  We are asking if the Taoiseach will appoint people who are not politically aligned and who come from different walks of life, as has been the practice for the past 20 years.  One member is on record as saying, &ldquo;We were all politically non-aligned, that was the success, that was critical.  We were not political appointees and we all had experience in different areas&rdquo;.  Will the Taoiseach follow that 22 year-old principle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that question.  I told Deputy Ahern three times that we would apply the same criteria in regard to the appointments as were applied in the past.  I said there would be no grounds on which anyone, including Deputy Dermot Ahern, could criticise these appointees.  I can say this a fourth time if the Deputy wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the harbour boards, the Garda Síochána Complaints Board and the Civil Legal Aid Board, the only criteria for appointment seems to be affiliation to one of the rainbow parties.  In a recent reply to a parliamentary question the Taoiseach effusively praised the Law Reform Commission on its wonderful work. <Col N="214" /> If he is so satisfied with it why are the personnel being changed?  If he is satisfied with its operations, what is the reason for the review?  What are the terms of reference of the review body and what changes are envisaged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have also answered that question. The people who are being replaced had been on the board for ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

      <P>I take it these people were not invited to sit on the new board.  Will the Taoiseach outline the work in hand on the commission's books which must await the appointment of a full commission before it can be carried out?  The Taoiseach said three of the five members of the commission have not, in effect, been on the board since last January.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In a written reply to Parliamentary Question No. 33 from Deputy Callely on 11 March I indicated that the Government is committed to initiating a constitutional amendment on Cabinet confidentiality.  Work is proceeding on its drafting, having regard to the constitutional, legal and administrative issues I outlined in the House in reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 3 and 4 on 15 October 1996.  The Bill will be published as soon as it is available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the referendum will be held this year.  The work on it is fairly advanced. The text has been largely agreed.  There are one or two issues we need to look at in the drafting <Col N="215" /> of the Bill but it is substantially agreed at this stage.  Work is moving forward well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I think the Taoiseach is fudging the issue.  Can he give us an exact date for the referendum?  Will it be held in tandem with a general election?  Does the Taoiseach have a particular date in mind for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy an exact date for holding the referendum until the legislation is completed.  It is a matter of some importance that care should be taken in drafting constitutional amendments, as the Deputy will agree, with the experience the House has had of ill drafted constitutional amendments in the past. Considerable care and attention is being taken in regard to this amendment but work on it is proceeding well and I am happy with that progress. I hope we will be able to move forward quite soon on the issue.  The holding of this consultation with the people, in conjunction with any other consultation that might take place at any time during the year, is not excluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will legislation be introduced on this matter in the next fortnight?  In all the Taoiseach's replies on this issue over the past 12 months, he has hidden behind expert advice, legal opinion, committees, etc., and we are still talking about it.  For the past nine months the Taoiseach has been saying that one or two matters remain to be cleared up.  He made this matter a priority in the programme for Government two and a quarter years ago.  We are now at the end of the life of this Government and the issue has not been moved forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I have moved the issue forward.  This issue became a problem because Cabinet confidentiality was pleaded by a Government, of which the Deputy was a member, when it did not want to give certain information to a tribunal investigating an important matter and on which very substantial amounts of public funds were being spent to get the truth.  The Deputy's party did not want to co-operate adequately and pleaded the doctrine of Cabinet confidentiality as a basis for denying certain information to that tribunal.  I am putting that matter right now by introducing a constitutional amendment.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that Cabinet confidentiality was a key element of the programme for Government.  Is it not the case now that this Government will leave office without completing that key element, namely, Cabinet confidentiality about which the Taoiseach spoke so eloquently in the early part of his tenure of office?</P>

      <P>I deeply resent the suggestion by the Taoiseach that an individual at the tribunal hid behind Cabinet confidentiality.  I was the person in the witness box who was asked the question which led directly to the test case being taken on Cabinet confidentiality.  When I was asked the question I indicated that I was prepared to answer it, a fact acknowledged by the chairman of the tribunal.  It was the intervention of the Attorney General's representative at the tribunal which prevented me answering the question.  I then turned to the chairman and he again acknowledged the fact that I was prepared to answer the question put to me, but the Attorney General's representative prevented me from doing so.  I had nothing to hide at that tribunal and I am proud of my role on that occasion.  I am more proud of my role than that of the Tánaiste who forced the tribunal on us and got his brother to represent him in the tribunal.  He has not yet submitted his £1 million claim for expenses but he will as soon as the general election is over.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach should tell the truth and not try to damage reputations by innuendo. The Tánaiste refused to answer questions and substantiate allegations he made, and the Minister of State who made allegations in this House could not stand over those when he appeared before the tribunal.  The Taoiseach should ask the Tánaiste the reason his brother has not submitted his claim for expenses.  Is it because he does not want the people to know he is about to get £1 million in expenses?</P>

Many people have asked about this over a long period and they can cannot get clarification <Col N="221" /> of what legal obligation the Minister feels he is under.

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

      <P>I have an obligation under the law. I have been advised by the Chief State Solicitor that under the terms of the contract O'Brien Shipping Limited must be offered the contract for the next five years.  If agreement cannot be reached under the terms of the new contract, it may be offered by way of competitive tender.  If all of Deputy Ó Cúiv's complaints are real, I am sure the terms of the contract will be altered, and that can only be debated at the monitoring committee meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in doing that, provided the Department has the information. The Chief State Solicitor advised me, and this is something I have inherited.  The present position is covered by the terms of the 1946 Act.  While I sympathise with Deputy Ó Cuív in regard to the provision of a better and more frequent service to the Aran Islands and for islanders generally, I am advised by the Chief State Solicitor that the review of the terms of the contract with O'Brien Shipping will not take place for a further five years.</P>

      <P>The Minister is talking in riddles and not answering the question.  He alluded to the 1946 Act, but since O'Brien Shipping got the contract only five years ago I cannot understand how that contract is bound by the Act.  Will the Minister make available the part of the contract with O'Brien Shipping that seems to put him under an obligation to continue providing a service, the nature of which does not relate to the requirements of the islanders and which costs a huge sum of money?  A passenger service is not provided to the Aran Islands because, as everybody knows, islanders do not go from Galway to the Aran Islands.  Will the Minister provide, perhaps in written form, the information relating to the part of the Act and the part of the contract that seem to put him under an obligation, which he will not specify?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht</askee>
      <Quest>if he has noted the concerns of the Library Association of Ireland which has said his Department holds the National Library in such disregard that the advertisement for the job of director pegs the salary at the lowest point of the scale and does not require applicants to be professional librarians.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9042/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the suggestion that my Department holds the National Library of Ireland in disregard.  Indeed it is seen by my Department as one of its priority areas as evidenced by the increase in funding from £1.4 million in 1993 to £2.4 million in 1997.  When the previous director retired at the end of January no effort was spared to ensure that the post was advertised at the earliest possible date.  It was decided to fill the post on this occasion on the basis of a five year contract and the position was advertised on 20 February.</P>
      <P>The salary for the grade of director of the National Library is £39,043, rising after four years to £45,525.  The salary for the position of director to be filled on a five year contract basis is at the equivalent of the first point of that scale, £39,043, which is the normal position when posts are being filled on a contract rather than on a permanent basis.  The salary level for the post will, however, in accordance with normal practice be reviewed when the new director has satisfactorily completed two years' service and at the end of each subsequent year of service.  Accordingly, I expect the salary for the post will over time, reach the maximum for the grade.  It should be noted that the former director also started on the first point of the scale.  There is no change in the level of qualifications required for this position from those that applied when the position was advertised previously in 1988.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that in the advertisement to replace the former director <Col N="223" /> of the National Library, Dr. Pat Donlon, the Government is sending out the wrong signals in that there seems to be a downgrading of the status of the library?  Will he accept there is a great gulf between the reality and the rhetoric from the Minister of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Minister of State on this issue?  Will he agree that legislation such as that dealing with cultural institutions which was put through this House means little if staffing and resources are not available to fund institutions such as the National Library and National Museum?  Will the Minister accept that as the salary of director of the National Library is pegged at the lowest point of the scale, the position is to be filled on a contract basis and the advertisement states it is not necessary to be a professional librarian to apply for the job, it sends out the wrong signals in terms of the standards needed in the National Library, which is highly regarded, particularly throughout Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided to fill the post of director on this occasion on the basis of a five year contract because legislation to set up the National Library as a statutory body was going through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  When that legislation is enacted it will follow that a statutory board will be appointed.  The point is missed by Deputy de Valera that the statutory board should have an input to the appointment of director.  The appointment of a director in a permanent capacity when such change is imminent could, in these circumstances, be seen in an unfavourable light to the new board.  The qualifications for the position did not include a requirement for library qualifications on the previous occasion on which the post was filled.  Naturally the qualifications of candidates applying for the position, including professional library qualifications, are factors considered in the selection process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree the cultural institutions legislation deals with the structures while he has referred to the boards and their functions?  It is not helpful to have legislation in place dealing with structures if staffing and funding are not available to provide the service. That is what I meant by the gulf between the reality and the rhetoric of the Government concerning our cultural institutions.  Will the Minister accept the salary proposed for the Director of the National Library is half that of Secretary of a Department and two thirds that of a university professor?  Given the Minister's qualifications as a professor, surely he and the Minister of State agree that the position of the Director of the National Library warrants a higher salary scale than that currently proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not disagree with the Deputy in regard to the description of the post, the Department must accept the salary guidelines laid down by the Department of Finance which <Col N="224" /> are agreed by the entire public service.  The Deputy will be aware that funding for the National Library increased from £1.4 million in 1993 to £2.4 million in 1997, a substantial increase during the Minister's five year tenure.  He is also anxious that the post should be upgraded and given the status proposed by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept funding for the National Library has increased, as I have stated on many occasions, it started from a low base. Does the Minister of State accept that, having regard to the status of the Director and of the National Library, further funding should be put in place immediately?  There are 60,000 undocumented scripts in the library, it has shorter opening hours than any other national library in Western Europe and it receives only one-third of the funding provided for the national library in Wales.  Will the Minister of State be gracious enough to accept that Dr. Pat Donlon was badly treated before her retirement on health grounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to deal with the problems of the previous director &mdash; I do not have a brief in that regard.  It is regrettable if Dr. Donlon was discommoded.  The status of positions such as the Director of the National Library has increased with the evolution of the public service. The Deputy's party was in power when the low base, about which we spoke, existed in 1993. Fianna Fáil was in power with the Labour Party when £1.4 million was provided for the National Library.  A sum of £2.4 million is currently being provided, an increase of 80 per cent.  While I acknowledge we started from a low base, we must earn wealth before funding can be provided for such matters.  The Minister has provided substantial funding for the National Library and I hope he can provide more in the future.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, which has been made since the commitment was given more than two years ago in the Programme for Government entitled, Government of Renewal, on the establishment of a National Inventory of Architecture.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9043/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The following commitment was given in the policy agreement, A Government of Renewal: &ldquo; We will undertake a full national architectural audit&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The national inventory of architecture was commenced in 1991.  Initial surveys of the centres of 25 of the cities and towns have been completed. During this time also, a primary set of draft guidelines and criteria for the inventory has evolved to complement the survey work.  Computer text database and computer mapping database systems have been developed to store and manage the recorded data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> The immediate priorities in relation to the national inventory of architecture are to establish and publish criteria and standards, to publish survey work already carried out, and to continue the work on the full inventory.  As identification of buildings for protection is an essential prerequisite to the taking of action to protect the architectural heritage, the commitment to the completion of the national inventory of architecture is being addressed as part of a broad package of proposals based on the recommendations in the report of the interdepartmental working group on strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage. Specifically, the report recommended placing the national inventory of architecture on a statutory basis, constituting a national database for input to the local authority system of listing buildings for protection and that the inventory should be adequately staffed and resourced to allow for interim listing surveys of all Twenty-six Counties and accelerated progress on the full inventory.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Minister for the Environment will bring forward a detailed package of proposals on these lines to Government very shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State elaborate on what he means by the Minister bringing the matter to Cabinet shortly?  This matter requires urgent attention.  I am sure Members on all sides accept the need for immediate conservation and preservation of historical buildings. Deputy Eoin Ryan has introduced a Bill on the preservation of buildings and their interiors.  I am particularly concerned about the personnel and funding provided to catalogue and prioritise buildings and gather information for the national inventory of architecture.  When will the inventory be complete?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to recognise the amount of work involved in carrying out an inventory of such buildings.  There are approximately one million structures to be recorded which will require a long-term project.  We aim to have the project completed by 2010.  A period of ten to 15 years has been set aside to compile information on approximately 400,000 buildings in the North.  We are progressing at a somewhat faster pace than our counterparts there.  This is a huge task and I wish those undertaking it every success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the mammoth task facing those compiling the inventory.  As many buildings are under immediate threat, has the Government devised a short or medium-term strategy to deal with this matter?  By 2010 many buildings that should be listed may not exist.  Will the Minister of State outline the Government's intentions in that regard?  How will the law be enforced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many impediments to such undertakings.  We do not have enough <Col N="226" /> people with the skill to undertake much of the work involved, but the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, hope to produce an interim list of listed buildings in the Twenty-six Counties by the year 2001 from which buildings needing urgent attention can be prioritised. The problem is we have so many buildings and artefacts that it has taken some time to put it in place.  The Deputy should be satisfied that the interim survey of the Twenty-six Counties will be completed by 2001.  That will be a great achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly worried to hear from the Minister of State that the Government's interim or short-term strategy will not come into play for another four years.  I am concerned that buildings and artefacts could be lost to the nation due to the lack of action over the next four years.  Take, for example, the serious situation last night in the transport museum in Dublin in which there was a tremendous amount of voluntary work and commitment where a fire destroyed a number of old vehicles, which were valuable in terms of our heritage.  I am worried that other important buildings, which are already in danger, will not be dealt with for another four years.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State encourage his Minister and the Government to take a more active role in preserving our architectural heritage?  It is one thing to talk nicely in the Dáil and express platitudes with which we can all agree, but it is quite another thing to prioritise issues within Government.  This issue should be prioritised urgently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Following publication of the interdepartmental working group's report on strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage, an implementation committee was formed comprising officials from the Department of the Environment and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  It is looking at the question of implementing recommendations contained in that report as well as examining further submissions received following the report's publication. Action is being taken at present.</P>
      <P>When the proposal being put to Government jointly by the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is received, there will be immediate action by the Government.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concern of the IMPACT trade union at the placing by his Department of advertisements for new management posts at the National Museum while negotiations were ongoing; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that the union considers this a breach of trust; and whether it is over 15 years since the last normal promotion at the National Museum.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9044/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the contents of IMPACT's advertisement and press release relating to the six new management posts currently being filled in the National Museum of Ireland. My Department issued a press release on 27 February 1997 in response to IMPACT's statement which set out my Department's position and also addressed most of the specific issues now raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Referring to the six contract posts to be filled in the National Museum of Ireland &mdash; Head of Services, Head of Conservation, Head of Marketing, Registrar and IT Manager, Education and Community Outreach Officer, and Accommodation, Security and House Manager &mdash; my Department's statement pointed out that these posts are additional to the existing staff complement. It acknowledged that it has long been recognised that the National Museum's organisation and staffing needed to be strengthened.  A number of recommendations, including recommendations for new posts for key areas, were made to my Department.  Following formal approval for the posts now advertised, my Department had detailed and prolonged discussions with IMPACT and made many changes in relation to the duties involved.</P>
      <P>Despite the constructive nature of much of the discussions, full agreement could not be reached as IMPACT's final agreement to the actual placing of the advertisement was subject to certain conditions about other museum posts, to which my Department was not in a position to agree. At that point it was clear that further progress could not be made.  Given the critical staff needs of the museum in the areas in question, my Department was left with the choice of proceeding with the recruitment or deferring the filling of such posts indefinitely.</P>
      <P>As stated in its press release, my Department remains, as always, committed to free and open discussions with IMPACT.  It very much regrets the decision of technical and professional staff of the National Museum, who have given committed service in often difficult circumstances, not to co-operate with appointees to the posts advertised, and is convinced that such a course of action is not in the best interest of the development of the National Museum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that substantive promotions in the National Museum, as in any area of the Civil Service, can only be made where a fillable vacant post exists.  Due to the relatively small promotion pool for professional and technical grades in the National Museum such vacancies seldom arise.  However, where it is evident that an officer in the National Museum is carrying out duties above his or her grade, my Department has endeavoured to address such situations by way of temporary higher-duty allowances or <i>ex gratia</i><Col N="228" /> payments, which are the only alternatives where permanent promotions are not possible or appropriate. As a result, a number of professional staff in particular are in receipt of such payments. There is a valid, sustainable reason substantive promotion was not appropriate or possible in each case where such temporary payments have been made &mdash; a point which has been repeatedly stressed by my Department in our discussions with IMPACT.</P>
    <P>My Department is in consultation with the Department of Finance with a view to having some posts at present in receipt of higher duty allowances filled on a substantive basis.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State accept the fact that the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht advertised the positions in national newspapers, before the completion of consultations and negotiations on the vacancies with the union IMPACT, was inappropriate and anything but helpful?  Will he agree that this is not the true definition of consultation?  Will he also agree that a bit more sensitivity could have been expected from the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in dealing with this matter, given that one of his close advisers was a former trade union official?  Will the Minister of State also accept that it is over 15 years since the last normal promotion was made at the museum? Four curatorial departments are without keepers, some since 1988, and half the museum's curatorial staff are in acting positions or receiving <i>ex gratia</i> payments in lieu of substantive promotions.  The Minister of State referred to this in his reply but does he feel this is a satisfactory situation and, if not, what does he propose to do to alleviate the position?</P>

      <P>I understand that discussions are still ongoing with IMPACT.  As I said in my reply, it is also in discussion with the Department of Finance with regard to having some posts, at present in receipt of higher duty allowances, filled on a substantive basis.  I said that on the first occasion.  The Department felt there was a constructive nature to the discussions but they could not be concluded because IMPACT's final agreement to the actual placing of an advertisement was subject to conditions about other museum posts.  Unless the Department receives the agreement of the Department of Finance to have some of these posts, which are at present in receipt of higher duty allowances, filled on a substantive basis, there is a deadlock.  There are ongoing discussions on this matter and I expect it will be resolved fairly quickly.</P>

Most other sites with visitor facilities arrange to fly the national flag on occasions of visits by dignitaries, anniversaries and festivals having a substantial local impact.  Normally the flying of the flag would coincide with the opening hours of the sites or the duration of a specific visit.</P>
      <P>At present, the flag is flown during normal opening hours at the Garden of Remembrance but, as the Deputy was informed on 12 March, a review is being undertaken of the opening hours of the Garden of Remembrance which will include an examination of the flying of the national flag there.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note I tabled this question to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht some time ago when it was referred to the Department of the Taoiseach and it is now back on the Order Paper tabled to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Why was the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht not prepared to take this question when it was first proposed and tabled to his Department?  Will the Minister of State confirm if articles we read in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in December 1996 and in January 1997 and in a similar article published in <i>The Irish Times</i> about Government proposals for broadcasting were inspired leaks?</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister of State's frivolous reply.  I was amused to hear him say in his original reply that the Minister was so burdened by his legislative proposals. Everyone who considers his legislative performance to date in this House will note it is extremely poor and it could not have been that which prevented him from examining these serious leaks from his Department.  That is why I asked if they were inspired or other types of leaks.  I do not fault the media for printing interesting stories and I certainly will not put them under the microscope, but the Minister should be responsible for what happens in his Department.  The Minister of State and the Minister should answer to the House rather than to the media.  Will the Minister of State accept that the proper place for a discussion on legislation whether on broadcasting or on any other issue, should be this House rather than through inspired leaks or otherwise to the media?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 18 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The National Archives has accommodation needs both short-term and long-term which are in the process of being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The headquarters of the National Archives is located in premises at Bishop Street in Dublin, but at present not all of those premises is available to it.  The National Archives also still occupies the record repository of the former Public Record Office at the Four Courts in Dublin.  All <Col N="236" /> the storage space currently available to the National Archives in those two buildings is fully occupied.</P>
    <P>Under section 8(1) of the National Archives Act, 1986, Departments of State are obliged to transfer their departmental records to the National Archives to be made available for public inspection when they are 30 years old, unless exempt under other sections of the Act.  Due to shortage of space, the National Archives was unable to accept most of the records for 1966 which were due for transfer by Government Departments in 1966.  It is also at present unable to accept the backlog of older records which are overdue for transfer by the Departments of Education and Finance.</P>
    <P>The overall premises at Bishop Street are in principle sufficient to meet the storage requirements of the National Archives until well into the next century.  There are two needs to be addressed, however, before this position is achieved in practice.  The first and more immediate need is to acquire the space available on floor 1 in the front block of the existing premises which is at present occupied by a section of the Government Supplies Agency which is part of the Office of Public Works and, accordingly, the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  I understand the arrangements being made by the Office of Public Works to allow the vacation of this area have taken longer than envisaged but that urgent attention is being given to the matter to finalise the situation and facilitate its fitting out for National Archives purposes so that it may take in all overdue records including those up to 1967. The second issue relates to proposals for dealing with the longer term accommodation and storage needs of the National Archives.  In this regard the warehouse to the rear of the present building has been identified as offering the optimum solution.</P>
    <P>The immediate priority in this regard is the carrying out of planning and preparatory work for this adaptation.  It has been agreed that such adaptation should be undertaken and, in this context, the Minister for Finance announced in the recent budget that the necessary planning and preparatory work for this project will be undertaken by the Office of Public Works in 1997.</P>
    <P>On the basis of a feasibility study carried out for the Office of Public Works a total of four options were considered for meeting the future needs of the archives.  The option which would supply the maximum space to the institution has been costed provisionally as being of the order of £13 million at current prices.  The various options are currently the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline whether the Government feels there is a need to review the legislation on the National Archives which is now ten years old?  Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a former leader of the Minister's party, warned of the crisis which has arisen with regard <Col N="237" /> to the National Archives and the need for funding to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify how the Freedom of Information Bill, 1996, when enacted, and the 30 year rule will affect institutions such as the National Archives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the National Archives Act, 1986 is concerned, there is no specific statutory requirement on the National Archives to provide accommodation for storing archives. Section 8 requires Departments to transfer relevant records which are over 30 years old, and that is Deputy de Valera's point.  Perhaps this matter can be examined to see how the Act can be amended.</P>
      <P>As it stands, the Minister may, with the agreement of the director of archives, direct that the transfer of records is not proceeded with until he is satisfied that arrangements for such a transfer are adequate.  The provision meets some of the problems to which the Deputy refers.  Whether the Minister requires further powers should be examined also.</P>
      <P>I am unable to answer the Deputy's question about the Freedom of Information Bill, 1996.  I presume that when that Bill was considered the problems of the National Archives were also dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State would write to me on the last question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a question on the same topic. Will the Minister accept that the Government has made poor provision for storing and availability of the national archives despite all the moneys available to it?  The archives are a quintessentially important part of our heritage.  What is the time frame for making proper provision for, first, storage which is the most important matter and, second, ensuring that archival material is made available for research and other purposes on time and in a manner which makes it accessible to people who want to use archival material?  When will proper provision be made for the National Archives at Bishop's Street?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance made provision in this year's budget for preparatory work for the National Archive project and that is a first step.  It is ten years since that Act was introduced and there has been inactivity since then.  At least something is under way now.</P>
      <P>A feasibility study is being carried out by the Office of Public Works and a total of four options were considered.  The various options are being discussed by the Department and the Department of Finance and we await the outcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Public Works has been directed to have all preparatory work completed in 1997 so I am sure there will be a resolution of this matter late this year or early in 1998.</P>

      <Quest>if he will acquire for the State the historic site (details supplied) in Dublin 8 in view of its archaeological heritage and in due deference to the concept of natural justice for the owner of the site whose development proposals are prevented under the provisions contained in the National Monuments Acts, 1932-4; and his views on other approaches to the matter that might balance the requirements for preservation with the small inner city residential proposals.</Quest>

      <P>In general development of sites is subject to resolution of the archaeology and, in accordance with practice, the cost of this will continue to be met by developers.</P>

      <P>Is dóigh liom nár thuig an t-Aire an cheist.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil 18,000 gasúr ag dul chuig na Gaeltachta chuile bhliain agus go dtugann an Roinn cúnamh do chuile gasúr a théann go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  Ach duine ar bith a bhíonn ag plé le coláistí Gaeilge, tuigeann go dtagann bunáite na ngasúr a théann go dtí an Ghaeltacht as teaghlaigh meán-aicmeach nó níos airde.  An bhfuil i gceist cúnamh faoi leith a thabhairt do ghasúir ó theaghlaigh ar bheagán airgid ag dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht?</P>
      <P>Fadó, nuair a thosaigh an scéim seo, bhí coiste na bpáistí ann ag na ceardchumainn agus cuireadh deireadh leis sin.  Faraor gurb ag na páirtithe polaitíochta a chuirtear an t-airgead anois agus ní chun gasúir a chur chun na Gaeltachta.  Bíodh sin mar atá.</P>
      <P>Bhíodh na coistí gairmoideachais ag cur roinnt gasúr go dtí na Gaeltachtaí ach le blianta beaga tá titim air sin.  An mbeadh an tAire i bhfábhar airgead speisialta a chur ar fáil, b'fhéidir tríd na coistí gairmoideachais, le cúnamh speisialta a thabhairt do ghasúir nach bhfuil £200 nó £300 acu le dul go dtí na Gaeltachta: ciste mar sin a chur ar fáil chun na críche seo?</P>

      <P>During the short Easter recess the former Fine Gael Leader and Taoiseach and one of his leading backbenchers, Deputy Mitchell, have been taxing their minds and the country about telephone tapping.  On 21 January 1983 the then Leader of this party called for a judicial inquiry into telephone tapping.  On the same day the Government responded saying it believed a commission should also be set up.  As the Government is so concerned about this matter &mdash; in view of the briefing being given &mdash; will it set up a judicial inquiry or commission to deal with it or is this matter being held up for some ulterior motive?</P>

It is important that those who are charged with responsibility for protecting the public should have a measure of discretion, under proper control, to gather information in the most effective way possible to prevent crime.

      <P>Where stands the non-nationals Bill to deal with the citizenship and investment procedure?  The Taoiseach and several Ministers are probably aware that certain investors in several companies are in danger of not being able to complete investment decisions.  At least one large company contacted Government and Opposition in respect of a potential closure.  It seems unfair that some of these companies should be left on the wrong side of the line as a result of a procedure taken in the Attorney General's Office in September last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of a procedure taken in any office.  The position is that it is essential that any matter affecting citizenship, which is a valued right in any state, should be dealt with on the basis of a solid statutory footing. That is important in respect of any matter concerning the granting of privileges by any state. The relevant legislation is currently being prepared by the Minister for Justice on the basis of an agreed outline which was approved by the Government.  It is likely that the legislation will not come before the House until shortly before the summer recess or early in the autumn session.</P>

      <P>I received the same representations as the Government and, as I understand it, at least one major company, which has been a long-term employer in the State's textile industry for several decades, cannot carry out its business because its investor changed before 4 September when the Government decision was made and its closure is imminent.  I believe that is the procedure. It is not for me to decide individual cases but it seems the technicality involving one particular <Col N="246" /> company, which has lobbied several Ministers, should be considered sympathetically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that any matter concerning the granting of the privilege of citizenship in the State should be dealt with on the basis of a clear and transparent statutory foundation.  The Government is currently preparing legislation in this regard.  Dealing with such important matters without preparing the necessary foundation would be hazardous from the point of view of all concerned.  That is the basis upon which we are currently proceeding.  I have no doubt many companies could benefit from investments but it is important that this should be done on the basis of a solid statutory footing or foundation and the Government is making preparations in that regard.</P>

      <P>I would accept the Taoiseach's statement if 18 other companies had not got through on one basis and, because one investor changed, another did not.  If, as the Taoiseach stated, that is the position, it is fine.  No one will obtain citizenship for investment until legislation is introduced.  However, the Taoiseach is aware that this is not the case.</P>

However, for future cases, it is important that the matter be dealt with on the basis of a solid statutory foundation for the protection of all concerned. We do not want to be in a position where other interests, such as competitors, for example, might seek to unravel arrangements that have been made on the basis that due statutory procedure had not been followed.  The Deputy will understand that everyone wishes to achieve certainty in a matter of this nature.  That is why we are proceeding to establish a solid statutory foundation for it.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the third Finance Bill I have had the privilege to introduce to the House.  It will enable the Government to reward work, safeguard jobs, reduce business tax and stimulate enterprise.  The Bill gives effect to the biggest set of personal and corporation tax reductions in the past 20 years or more and its passage will secure a substantial increase in after tax income for the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Like all Finance Bills, this year's Bill also closes off a series of tax loopholes in indirect and direct taxes.  It includes a package of measures to further combat illegal tobacco sales thus safeguarding a revenue source for the Exchequer and cutting off a revenue source for many criminal gangs, particularly in Dublin.  It is important to eliminate such revenue losses to the State so as to manage tax resources more efficiently, thereby ensuring tax reliefs are properly targeted and that more resources are available for general tax reductions.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains a further series of pre-consolidation provisions which prepare the way for the Taxes Consolidation Bill.  This will be a substantial body of legislation containing over 1,100 sections and 29 schedules.  To assist the smooth passage of the consolidation Bill in due course, I will publish a draft of the Bill next week. This will include all changes to income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax since 1967 up to and including this year's Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Sections 1 to 3 provide for the substantial increases in personal allowances and exemption limits provided for in the budget as well as the reduction in the standard rate of income tax and the widening of the standard rate bands.  Section 4 meets a commitment in Partnership 2000 by exempting the first three weeks of disability benefit payments from income tax in 1997-98 and the first six weeks from the 1998-99 tax year onwards. The section also renews for a further year up to 6 April, 1998 the special exemption from unemployment benefit taxation introduced in 1994 for all systematic short-time workers.</P>
      <P>Section 5 and a number of later sections incorporate into the Bill the existing provisions on income tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, probate tax and stamp duty contained in the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  The provisions are being included here as is the normal practice in order to ensure that all tax provisions are to be found in the Finance Acts for the guidance of taxpayers and practitioners.</P>

    <P>Section 6 relates to tax relief for third level fees for undergraduates and confirms that fees paid for qualifying part-time third level courses by non-earning spouses can be set against their earning spouses' taxable income.  The section also allows for the retention of tax relief for those progressing from certificates to diplomas to degrees <Col N="250" /> within the same course.  It also extends relief to those pursuing approved distance education courses provided by colleges in another EU member state which meet certain codes of standards. This is designed to facilitate Open University courses which many people take.</P>
    <P>Sections 7,8,27 and 51 give effect to the package of tax reliefs announced in the budget to encourage the newly established developing companies market.  These reliefs cover access to the BES for DCM companies and a special increase in the investment limits on special portfolio investment accounts where DCM investments are concerned.  The SPIA increase, which is available for three years, is to help the DCM get off the ground.  I regard the package as a generous response to the case put to me for special reliefs. I will want to see the Stock Exchange and the investment community respond by supporting firms to establish on the DCM at a reasonable cost.  I will not wish to see these tax reliefs absorbed by excessive fees charged by brokers and others and the Stock Exchange has given me assurances on that point.</P>
    <P>Section 9 seeks to curb the growing use of the long-standing tax relief for scholarship income as a means by which companies can provide tax free income to directors, for example, under the guise of scholarship schemes for their children.  I have no wish to interfere with genuine schemes or with the tax position of the recipient.  For that reason, the section continues the current exemption in respect of the recipients of scholarship income.  It provides, however, for the taxation of the income as a benefit-in-kind in the hands of the parent if the scheme under which the scholarship is provided does not disburse at least 75 per cent of the scholarship income to persons not connected to the employer providing the scholarship.  The new rules apply to all new schemes from 26 March, 1997 and to existing schemes from 6 April, 1998. I have provided for this breathing space to allow some time for existing schemes to amend their rules if they desire.  This is reasonable given that certain ongoing arrangements for children's education may have been made on the basis of the current tax position.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a technical amendment to ensure that when certain severance or redundancy payments in the public service are put on a statutory basis they will not become automatically tax free. They will remain subject to tax under the same rules that apply to the private sector.</P>
    <P>Section 11 tightens up the withholding tax deduction system for sub-contractors by closing some loopholes in the forestry area, extending the time limits for prosecutions and ensuring that those not complying with the C2-C45 deduction procedures may be included on the list of tax defaulters published by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 12 introduces a new relief aimed at assisting certain firms to adapt to a change in their competitive environment.  It provides that where a company restructures its operations by <Col N="251" /> agreement with the workforce to secure its survival, income tax relief can be made available on certain lump sums paid by the company to employees both to achieve and compensate for a substantial pay restructuring.  The maximum lump sum to be tax relieved is £6,000 plus £200 per year of service up to an overall maximum of £10,000. The pay cut involved will have to be at least 10 per cent of average pay for the previous two years and the reduction will have to remain in force for at least five years.  The payment of normal general pay round increases and increments will not affect the availability of the relief.  It is important to stress that the union-management agreement providing for the pay restructuring will have to be registered with the Labour Relations Commission. The proposed restructuring will have to be certified by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, on advice from the Labour Relations Commission, as being both necessary and effective to meet the new situation.</P>
    <P>During the five year period of the agreement the company will have to confirm to the commission, on an annual basis, that the terms of the agreement continue to be complied with.  If the conditions for granting the relief are breached, any relief granted will be withdrawn.  Any tax relieved lump sum will be set off against any tax relieved redundancy payment made to the employee in that employment within five years of the lump sum being paid.  The scheme will operate for a period of three years.  I have been conscious of the need to target this relief on the essential function of saving jobs and to minimise the tax planning aspects and I am happy that this has been achieved.</P>
    <P>Section 13 closes a loophole whereby residents taxed on the basis of money remitted from abroad could avoid tax by using a loan or overdraft and repaying this in due course from foreign income.  This loophole, closed in 1971, was inadvertently reopened when the rules on residence were revised in 1994.  The section deems income used to satisfy a loan or overdraft taken out on or after 20 February 1997 as income remitted to the State and thus taxable where a person is resident or ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for tax relief on certain corporate and personal donations of £1,000 or more to publicly-funded third level institutions.  The donations must be in respect of defined projects in the areas of research, the acquisition of capital equipment, infrastructural development in certain specified institutions and the provision of facilities to meet defined skills needs.  Projects in these areas must be approved by the Minister for Education, following consultation with the Higher Education Authority, on the basis of guidelines to be agreed with the Minister for Finance.  The guidelines will deal with such matters as the approval process, the definition of &ldquo;skills needs&rdquo; and the specification of approved infrastructural developments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> The Finance Act, 1982 provides income tax relief on certain expenditure incurred on the repair, maintenance or restoration of approved heritage buildings provided that the property is open to the public for not less than 60 days in a year, at least 40 of which must be in May to September.  Section 15 of the Bill provides for this relief to be extended to include aggregate expenditure of up to £5,000 per annum on alarms, public liability insurance and the restoration of approved art contents on condition that the contents are kept on display for a minimum period of two years after restoration.  It also provides that any qualifying expenditure which is unrelieved in any one year can be carried forward for up to two subsequent years.  In addition, the public access requirement for the purpose of CAT relief is being reduced from 90 days to 60 days which applies in the case of income tax relief. This brings the access requirements for the purposes of the CAT relief into line with the income tax access requirements &mdash; sensible and useful simplification.</P>
    <P>A number of sections deal with farmer taxation. Stock relief for farmers will continue at 25 per cent for a two year period from 6 April 1997 to 5 April 1999 by virtue of Section 16.  Section 17 provides that stock relief at a rate of 100 per cent will be available to farmers under 35 years of age who, between 6 April 1997 and 5 April 1999, either qualify for the scheme of installation aid for young farmers or become chargeable for the first time to income tax in respect of profits or gains from farming and meet specific training requirements.  This special relief will be available to qualifying farmers for two years.</P>
    <P>Section 18 and the Third Schedule introduce a new 'year one' capital allowance of 50 per cent for expenditure incurred on necessary farm pollution control measures up to an expenditure limit of £20,000.  The balance of expenditure will be written off over the following seven years in accordance with the normal wear and tear allowance. The scheme applies for three years from 6 April 1997 to 5 April 2000.  The Third Schedule sets out the farm buildings and structures to which the allowances for pollution control will apply.</P>
    <P>Section 98 continues the two thirds stamp duty relief for young trained farmers in respect of agricultural land and buildings transferred to them for a further three years up to 31 December 1999.</P>
    <P>Sections 19, 20 and 21 relate to the capital allowances regime for motor vehicles, rented accommodation and the application of balancing charges in certain cases.  The first two sections give effect to improved reliefs announced in the budget and the third closes a loophole in the application of clawback provisions in the case of capital allowances generally.</P>
    <P>Section 22 deals with an abuse of capital allowances for hotels.  These allowances, which can be offset against all the income of investors, apply at the rate of 15 per cent of expenditure for the first six years and 10 per cent in year seven, i.e. 100 <Col N="253" /> per cent in total.  Under the scheme in question, the investors claim the capital allowances for the seven years and, at the end of the period, are each given ownership of a nominated suite in the &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;&mdash; in effect, privately owned suites for private use located in what had been until then a hotel building.  The section will deny capital allowances to investors in such cases with appropriate transitional arrangements for projects where contracts were signed or applications for planning permission were received by the local authority before 26 March 1997.</P>
    <P>Section 23 extends the deadline for tax relief under the general urban renewal scheme from 31 July 1997 to 31 July 1998 subject to certain conditions. The one year extension will also apply to leases which qualify under the scheme for the purpose of obtaining a double rent tax allowance.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains several important provisions in relation to the IFSC.  Section 24 allows me to extend, by order, the definition of the Custom House Docks Area for the purposes of the IFSC tax regime.  I propose to extend the area to include the block bounded by Commons Street, Mayor Street, Guild Street and the North Wall Quay, i.e. a block of land immediately to the east of the original Custom House Docks Area site which houses the IFSC.</P>
    <P>Section 28 continues the tax transparent treatment of collective funds managed by certified IFSC-Shannon companies after 2005.  Tax transparency involves exemption of income from tax at the level of the fund but investors may be taxed on that income in their home jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Section 32 amends the Finance Act, 1974 which provides that interest paid to a non-resident by an IFSC or Shannon company or collective investment fund in the ordinary course of IFSC and Shannon activities is not subject to withholding tax.  The section provides that this treatment will continue in the case of securities issued before 31 December 2005 with a maturity date of not more than 15 years from the date of issue.</P>
    <P>Sections 43, 44 and 50 introduce changes to the treatment to be applied in certain circumstances to policies issued by IFSC life assurance companies to policyholders while residing outside the State but who subsequently commence to reside in the State.  The provisions are designed to remove difficulties which might otherwise lead to the enforced encashment of such policies by the policyholder on commencing to reside here.</P>
    <P>For many years now and particularly since I established the Department of Enterprise and Employment, I have been keenly aware of the need to promote and encourage the creation and development of new businesses.  The following measures continue the many steps and initiatives I have taken in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for relief for pre-trading non-capital expenses which I announced in the budget.  Expenses which are wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of a trade or profession not more than three years prior to the commencement of trading, and which would have <Col N="254" /> been allowed in calculating trading income if incurred after trading commenced, will now be deductible.  This important new relief will be available for new businesses, whether incorporated or not, which commence trading on or after 22 January 1997.</P>
    <P>Section 26 amends the relief for investment in films which is known as section 35 relief.  It is proposed to increase the existing cap on section 35 investment in any one film from £7.5 million to £15 million where at least 50 per cent of the section 35 investment is made by corporate bodies.  The section will also increase the current £6 million annual investment limit for corporate bodies to £8 million in total and the individual limit for corporate investment in any one film from £2 million to £3 million.  In addition, it is proposed to allow an additional 10 per cent section 35 finance for films in respect of which post-production is carried out in the State.  This would include facilities such as editing, dubbing or mixing in the State.  I am confident that these enhanced reliefs will assist film production in Ireland while at the same time ensure that section 35 will remain a cost-effective and targeted relief.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 to 31 together with section 46 and 128 deal with strips of interest bearing securities. Section 128 allows the Minister for Finance to nominate Government securities which may be stripped.  The other sections provide the general tax regime to be applied to strips of interest bearing securities.  Strips are created when interest bearing securities are split into their component parts, i.e. individual yearly interest elements and final principal element, the rights to which can then be separately sold and traded in their own right as zero coupon securities.  The introduction of such a facility for Government securities has been recommended by the NTMA as a necessary step in widening and deepening the market in Government securities to match similar market developments in other countries.  However, within the present tax code, the creation of strips could open up the possibility for tax deferral and avoidance in certain circumstances especially in the case of individuals, non-trading corporates and life assurance companies.  The Bill sets out rules to deal with the creation of, and transactions in, strips to minimise the risk of tax planning.  This will involve taxing the growth in the value of these zero coupon securities on an annual basis rather than when the gain or income is realised on redemption.</P>
    <P>Section 31 and 46 also address a potential avoidance mechanism involving equity-Government security swaps in the case of certain taxpayers. Section 35 deals with the tax treatment of share buy-backs involving quoted companies. These changes affect the tax rules applying to a buy-back of its own shares by a quoted company, or by a subsidiary of a quoted company.  Under the new rules, a buy-back will not be treated as a distribution of profits so that a tax credit will no longer apply to the payments made by the company <Col N="255" /> to the shareholders concerned.  Consequently, the sale of shares to the company by the shareholders will be regarded as falling within the capital gains tax provisions.  This will protect the position of the Exchequer in such buy-backs.  It will also bring the treatment of share buy-backs involving quoted companies into line with that which applies to share buy-backs by unquoted companies in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 36 exempts from tax the employment grants administered by the National Rehabilitation Board under the employment support scheme and by the Rehab Group under the pilot programme for people with disabilities.  Similar exemptions have been granted for employment grants in other areas.</P>
    <P>Section 37 reduces the standard rate of corporation tax from 38 per cent to 36 per cent, while under section 38 the lower rate for the first £50,000 of taxable income is being reduced from 30 per cent to 28 per cent.  The reduced rates apply from 1 April this year.  Provision is also being made in section 33 for a reduction in the tax credit on dividend payments to shareholders in line with these rate reductions.  Section 38 clears up a technical problem with the formula for the application of the 28 per cent rate of corporation tax which recently came to light and which has already been addressed by Revenue.</P>
    <P>Section 39 provides for the removal of the VHI's exemption from corporation tax under section 80 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, with effect from 1 March last.  This is necessary to ensure a common corporation tax regime for all health insurers operating in the Irish market.  In this connection there is a fixed duty of £1 payable in respect of non-life insurance policies.  Section 100 removes this duty from policies offered by authorised insurers in respect of health insurance business covered by section 2 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>Section 40 deals with the tax treatment of the profits of harbour authorities which have been reconstituted as harbour companies under the Harbours Act, 1996.  These companies are now being brought into the corporation tax net in line with the general policy of subjecting commercial State bodies to tax in the same way as private concerns.  However, the Government has decided to afford the harbour companies an appropriate transitional period in which to adapt to the new position.  Such companies will retain the existing tax exemption until 1 January 1999.  They will then be subject to corporation tax with a two-thirds reduction in taxable profits in 1999, a one-third reduction in 2000 and full taxation from 2001.  A similar tax regime will be extended to privately owned ports in the transitional period 1997-2000, inclusive.  Harbour authorities which are not vested as companies will retain their exemption from tax for the present.  The harbour companies which are being brought into the tax net in this way currently handle more than 90 per cent of commercial port traffic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> Sections 41 and 42 extend the tax relief on corporate donations to First Step and to the Enterprise Trust until 31 December 1999 in both cases.  This is in recognition of the contribution to enterprise development and employment made by both bodies and the commitment to continued relief in Partnership 2000 in the case of the Enterprise Trust.</P>
    <P>Sections 47 to 53 deal with capital gains tax, principally the cut in the CGT reduced rate of 27 per cent to 26 per cent, a reduction to three years in the trading period for qualification for the reduced rate, the closing off of one particular CGT loophole and the treatment of free shares on demutualisation of life companies.  The application of CGT in family law cases and to the DCM is also dealt with in these sections.</P>
    <P>Sections 54 to 56 deal with a number of vehicle registration tax issues.  Section 55 ensures that an unregistered vehicle for VRT purposes includes a vehicle built up from either a chassis or a monocoque which is either new and unused or is derived from another unregistered vehicle.  Section 56 will amend the legislation to allow VRT documents which have been electronically imaged or otherwise copied, stored and reproduced to be admitted as evidence in court proceedings.  This will extend the principle already included in the Criminal Law (Evidence) Act, 1992, for the acceptance in criminal proceedings of documents produced by computer or other modern technological processes.</P>
    <P>Sections 57 to 68 relate to excise matters.  They confirm the budget day excise changes in tobacco and road fuels and deal with a number of other technical items.  More importantly, sections 60 to 67 provide considerably increased powers to support the increasingly successful fight against illegal tobacco sales.  The sections provide for increased penalties, new powers of arrest and detention, new offences aimed at illegal wholesaling as well as retail street vending of illicit tobacco products, improved seizure powers and more streamlined court arrangements in certain cases.  These new powers were drawn up by Revenue in consultation with the Garda and are an indication of the Government's determination to do all that is necessary to ensure that this problem is dealt with firmly and in an effective way. This is, of course, a European-wide problem and with my agreement, the Revenue Commissioners have taken up the issue at that level with a view to having all aspects of the matter examined.  The EU Commission has agreed with member states to establish a high level group for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Sections 69 to 86 include a series of important changes to the VAT codes in property and telecommunications. The purpose of these changes is to combat avoidance and to protect Exchequer resources.  The provisions on telecommunications also ensure that there is a level playing field between EU and non-EU suppliers with regard to VAT.  As the explanatory memorandum sets out in some detail the reasons for and the precise details of the new VAT regime in both property <Col N="257" /> and telecommunications I will not dwell at length on these aspects now.  However, some brief elaboration is required.  With regard to VAT on property, the Bill seeks to ensure that the tax cannot be avoided by VAT exempt bodies such as banks and insurers.  The amendment will close off loopholes which, over time, could cost significant amounts to the Exchequer.  In simple terms, the avoidance schemes usually involve the use of arrangements such as artificially broken leases, assignments and surrender of leases at low or nil value for VAT purposes.  These schemes will be countered in two principal ways.  First, the assignment or surrender of lease will be treated as an effective sub-lease of the property for the remaining term of the lease and a market value will be established on this basis.  Second, a reverse charge mechanism will apply to surrenders and assignments, that is, the person receiving the property will be liable to account for and pay the tax rather than the supplier, which is the norm in VAT law. This ensures that the exempt bodies receiving a surrendered or assigned lease must pay the tax.</P>
    <P>Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, the institution of a reverse charge mechanism requires European Union approval.  The Government has applied for this approval and the request is currently before the Union.  When granted, the reverse charge will apply from the date of publication of the Finance Bill, that is, 26 March this year.</P>
    <P>The telecommunications changes are aimed at eliminating a tax-based distortion of competition arising largely from the fact that non-EU suppliers of telecommunications services are not, at present, liable for VAT on services supplied within the European Union.  The Bill provides that, for the purposes of VAT, the place of supply of international telecommunications services will in general be shifted to where the customer is located rather than from where the services are being supplied.  A reverse charge mechanism will be introduced for business customers who will be obliged to account for the VAT.  Non-EU telecommunications operators who supply non-business customers in the State will be required to register and account for VAT on those supplies.  The change, which has European Union approval and is being implemented in all 15 member states, will come into operation in Ireland on 1 July 1997.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with a number of other VAT issues.  First, it confirms the abolition of the special end-year VAT advance payment as announced last November.  This measure, which was introduced in 1993, had required certain large firms to pay one month's VAT in advance in December each year.  The Bill also addresses certain problems in the operation of the VAT refund retail export scheme.  A number of agencies operate schemes whereby non-EU visitors may claim VAT refunds on purchases of goods which they take home with them.  Arising from a recent court case on the operation of one such scheme, the Bill will now permit traders and agencies to zero-rate <Col N="258" /> goods sold to tourists only when certain conditions are fulfilled.  These conditions concern, for example, the time limit for export of the goods, the exchange rate to be used when a repayment is being made and the information to be given to the visitor about fees or commissions being charged.</P>
    <P>Section 83 provides for an effective exemption from VAT for commercial child-minding.  This will be achieved in two ways.  First, by applying the exemption to childcare facilities covered by recent regulations made under the Child Care Act, 1991.  Second, by clarifying that the exemption for educational services applies to &ldquo;children's and young persons education&rdquo; generally to cover childcare facilities which might not be regarded as childcare within the meaning of the Child Care Act.  The exemption will be effective from 1 May 1997, the start of the next VAT period. It brings our treatment of childcare into line with many other member states and will comply with EU VAT law as recently clarified for Revenue by the European Union Commission.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill deals with a number of technical VAT measures to close off certain minor loopholes in the system, to simplify the administration of the system and to comply with EU rulings in the Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>Sections 87 to 94 enact the new stamp duty regime given effect to in the budget whereby three new rates of stamp duty have been introduced in respect of residential property valued above £150,000.  The budget measures provided for a transitional exemption from the new rates for contracts signed on or before budget day and executed before 1 April 1997.  This period is now being extended to 1 May 1997 in response to representations.</P>
    <P>Section 112 of the Finance Act, 1990 provides that stamp duty is payable on new houses of over 125 square metres on the greater of the site value or 25 per cent of the aggregate consideration for the site plus construction cost.  A number of appeals have been lodged with Revenue seeking to extend the application of section 112 to second-hand houses.  While the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the section does not apply to such houses, and this view was recently upheld by the Appeals Commissioners, it has been decided to put the matter beyond any dispute by means of an amendment contained in section 96 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>American depositary receipts, ADRs, are a means of facilitating companies raising capital in the United States.  Section 97 extends the exemption from stamp duty which ADRs enjoy to shares quoted on a recognised Canadian stock exchange.  Furthermore, this section removes a barrier to offshore funds relocating to Ireland by exempting certain financial instruments from stamp duty.</P>
    <P>Section 101 abolishes RPT with effect from 5 April 1997.  The existing tax clearance arrangements in the case of sales of houses above a specified value threshold are, however, being maintained <Col N="259" /> in order to assist in the collection of RPT arrears.  Under the legislation, the specified value threshold for clearance purposes is the actual RPT value threshold, that is, £101,000 in 1996. This threshold will continue to be adjusted annually by the increase in the Department of the Environment new house price index.  The new threshold, which applies to house sale contracts executed on or after 5 April 1997, is £115,000.</P>
    <P>Section 107 increases the rate of business relief for capital acquisitions tax purposes from 75 per cent to 90 per cent for all qualifying business assets, provided these assets are retained in the business for a period of ten years or more after the transfer.  In line with this increase, the relief in respect of agricultural land, buildings, livestock and machinery transferred by gift or inheritance is also being increased to 90 per cent in section 104.  Business relief is also being extended to situations involving the termination of a life interest in land, building, machinery or plant used for the purpose of a business but which have been held outside the business.</P>
    <P>The CAT code currently exempts Government and other public sector securities from CAT in the hands of foreign beneficiaries subject, in certain cases, to a minimum holding period of three years prior to the gift or inheritance.  The exemption is designed to encourage foreign investment in such securities.  Section 105 closes off the unintended use of this exemption in certain cases to avoid CAT where property is transferred out of a trust after the death of a disponer or on the change of domicile, or ordinary residence, of the disponer.</P>
    <P>Section 112 to 124 contain extensive pre-consolidation provisions which are intended to rewrite, simplify and codify existing tax measures in certain areas in a comprehensible way prior to consolidation in the forthcoming Taxes Consolidation Bill.  I wish to make clear that no substantive change is involved but, as the House will appreciate, it would not be unusual for some parts of the taxes legislation to need a good &ldquo;spring clean&rdquo; before they can be incorporated in a consolidation Bill.  Thus, in the case of mortgage interest relief and Temple Bar reliefs, the existing legislation has become complex and convoluted as changes were made over the years.  In the case of mortgage interest relief, for example, the transitional provisions for standard rating the relief are not needed in a consolidation Bill since full standard rating now applies.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill also includes numerous pre-consolidation provisions to amend incorrect or out of date references, update the wording of particular reliefs, for example, for gender-proofing reasons, and to repeal redundant or spend provisions.</P>
    <P>I realise that the consolidation of the income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax law is a major undertaking for which the Revenue Commissioners and their staff are to be commended. I have pursued the policy of publishing as much of the consolidation measures as is possible.  This <Col N="260" /> year and last year details of pre-consolidation provisions were published prior to the publication of the Finance Bill.  On 18 February this year, the Revenue Commissioners held a major and successful seminar for practitioners outlining the state of play on consolidation.  Prior to that, Revenue officials briefed Members of the Oireachtas. In keeping with this approach, I will publish next week the draft text of the Taxes Consolidation Bill incorporating this year's Finance Bill, as published, to assist in the ultimate and speedy passage of this major consolidating legislation, the first for 30 years.</P>
    <P>Sections 125, 126 and 127 deal with several tax administration measures.  Section 125 clears up a minor difficulty in the wording of the law to facilitate the local collection of tax.</P>
    <P>Section 126 relates to the publication of the names of tax defaulters.  At present, the list of tax defaulters is published on an annual basis in the Revenue Commissioners' Annual Report.  The list includes all those upon whom a fine or other penalty was imposed by a court and all those in whose case the Revenue Commissioners accepted a settlement in excess of £10,000.  Settlements are not published where the amount is less than £10,000 or where the taxpayer has, in advance of any Revenue investigation, voluntarily furnished complete information relating to undisclosed tax liabilities.  Section 126 proposes to drop this requirement to publish in the Commissioners' Annual Report.  Instead, the Commissioners will publish the lists on a quarterly basis.  Quarterly publication will ensure more speedy and up to date information.</P>
    <P>Section 127 provides for a new procedure for the issue of ID cards to Revenue field officers. These will, in future, be evidence of authorisation to use certain powers and not, as at present, the authorisation itself.  The new arrangements are designed to improve the control procedures and ease the administrative task in relation to ID cards.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are the standard provisions which appear in each year's Bill on the care and management of taxation, the capital services redemption account and the necessary citation clauses.</P>
    <P>I know the House will accept that this Bill delivers substantial personal and corporate tax reductions while also protecting the position of the Exchequer from tax loopholes and tax planning schemes.  At the same time there are important new reliefs to save jobs, stimulate enterprise, encourage new businesses and investment in education &mdash; an investment which has been shown to be a keystone in the economic success we are now experiencing.  I am confident that the House will support these measures and the programme of the Government in putting them forward.</P>

      <P>The 1997 motto of this Government must be &ldquo;Let us lie down in front of all pressure groups&rdquo;.  Demands from any and every <Col N="261" /> quarter must be acceded to, and to hell with any long-term damage to the economy.</P>
      <P>Like the officials in the Department of Finance, I see no special reason for Government complacency or self-satisfaction in the recent Exchequer returns with their various one-off factors.  If income has increased by 15 per cent in the first quarter of 1997 over the same period last year, it is because the Government is giving back so little of the revenue buoyancy.  The real story about the public finances is to be found in the revised Book of Estimates, published last week, which shows net spending up once again by 6.5 per cent in 1997, over three times the rate of inflation, with no guarantee that this will not be further exceeded as the year progresses.  For the three year period January 1995 to end December 1997, this Government will have increased current spending by more than 20 per cent as against a cumulative inflation figure of less than 6 per cent.  There is no justifiable reason or rationale behind such a policy and it will end in tears.</P>
      <P>There has been a complete failure of budgetary control by a totally incapable Government that happens to have fallen over a bit of luck, the foundations of which were well laid by their predecessors. The taxpayer has been left to pick up the crumbs under the table and is supposed to be delighted.  No shelter has been provided for the economy should the cold economic winds start blowing again.  This Government, far from being congratulated on its economic good fortune, should be indicted for its reckless improvidence and for passing up a magnificent opportunity to make Ireland an enterprise-based economy that will become one of the soundest and most competitive in the world.</P>
      <P>The Culliton report was presented to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, in 1992. The Minister subsequently went on to commission a further report on how the Culliton Report could be implemented.  This was followed by another report.  The Minister is not slow to demonstrate one of the great fortes of this Administration &mdash; classic fudge and indecisiveness coupled with a complete lack of focus, direction and result.  It is clear the Government did not like the initial report, the central theme of which is fewer taxes, less Government involvement and, consequently, less interference in people's lives.  Last year Forfás presented to the government a major strategic report on the economy. A central theme was again fewer taxes, less Government and less interference.  What has happened to this report?  Are we soon to witness a report on this report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Culliton and Forfás reports both argue the point that servicing the national debt is absorbing too much of our tax resources.  Last year more than half the taxes raised were spent in this manner. As a solution, Forfás and Culliton put forward the proposition of reducing the national debt, thereby freeing up tax revenues to allow tax rates to be lowered.  If only the Government had <Col N="262" /> heeded their advice.  It is obvious money is flowing into the Government's purse, but whose money is it?  It is taxpayers' money, my money, the money of people across the length and breadth of the country.  This money has been entrusted to the Government to utilise in a prudent manner.  Why then has the Government not controlled public spending and lowered taxes? We all know why.  The Government just cannot stop spending.  It has deluded itself and has become a spending junkie.  It is practising what it alone believes, that it can spend its way back into Government.  Why, when every major world economy is reducing spending and reducing taxes, do we in Ireland persevere in going in the opposite direction?</P>
    <P>We had to work extremely hard to get to where we are today.  Events did not just fall fortuitously into place.  Fianna Fáil had the vision to take necessary and painful steps to turn this country away from the brink of bankruptcy and set it on the road to economic and social survival and recovery.  Current growth is no accident.  It did not just happen.  Nor is it due to the spending excesses of this Administration.  The viable seed was sown long ago by prudent and wise Fianna Fáil Administrations.</P>
    <P>People outside this House are not fooled by the spin of the stories from across the floor of this House.  Those on the Government benches have long engaged in seeking to rewrite history.  Certainly we are in a golden age.  The economy is enjoying tremendous prosperity, but what if the Government had kept a tighter grip on the spending wheel?  What if it had curtailed its frenzied spending excess to a real level of 2 per cent as it promised?  What would have been the results of such a prudent policy?  More taxpayers would be paying tax at the lower rate of 26 per cent; the top rate of tax could have been reduced; incentives could have been put in place so that businesses could expand and much needed jobs be created; and pensioners and others who find themselves excluded from the benefits of the growth in the economy could have had their quality of life improved markedly.</P>
    <P>CORI put it rather nicely when they said:</P>
    <P>Sufficient resources were available to Government as it planned Budget 1997 to ensure that everybody received at least the 'minimally adequate' level of income recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare 11 years ago...the Government has again taken decisions which result in the better off getting more, while the poverty gap widens.  A couple will be £515 a year better off if long-term unemployed, £1,920 better off if earning £20,000 and £3,252 better off if earning £40,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Whatever happened to the policy of the Minister for Finance of a 2 per cent growth in expenditure levels?  No doubt many in the Department of Finance tried to keep spending in check, to no avail. However, our public servants have to contend <Col N="263" /> with the likes of Deputies Spring, Rabbitte, Howlin and De Rossa.  Little chance did these public servants stand of being listened to when the reports of both Culliton and Forfás, to name but two, went unheeded.  I have a few questions for the Minister for Finance.  Can the number of tough decisions he had to take in his two and a half years as Minister be counted on one hand or does he need to use both?  Who is accountable to the public for the gross overrun in expenditure since he became Minister?  Who is running the Department of Finance?  How do the provisions of this Finance Bill address the downside of economic growth, the widening gap between rich and poor?  Which provisions will plug the loopholes exposed in the recent Gilligan litigation, or will the drug barons have the last laugh?  Who proposed the abolition of water charges?  Did the Minister have the report on the system concluding that it was unenforceable and about to collapse under the weight of legal challenges and the high level of non-payment?  What will the Minister do with all the extra spare time he will have after the general election?</P>
    <P>I will deal with each of these questions in turn. The Minister took one tough decision, not to resign when the Tánaiste and Labour Party Leader publicly pulled the rug from under him when he sought to give the pretence of a negotiating stance in the public interest during the Programme 2000 negotiations.  That was certainly a tough decision.  I am sure the Minister is aware that his decision not to resign makes him singularly ill-suited to continue as Minister for Finance when the special pay claims start piling up on his desk.  No stance he takes will be taken seriously. Who will take the stance in the public interest?  It certainly cannot be the Minister and it certainly will not be his leader.</P>
    <P>All Finance Acts mark an acceptance of the existing tax code or a radical overhaul of it, and this Bill is the former.  There are no signs of tax reform and there is no grand strategy.  Fianna Fáil and Labour set out together in 1993 to &ldquo;broaden the standard tax band so that, as in other countries, only relatively high earners paid a higher rate of tax&rdquo;.  Was it a tough decision for the Minister to abandon that goal or to &ldquo;ensure equity between those on PAYE, the self-employed and those with substantial investment income&rdquo;? There is no sign of movement on that front.</P>
    <P>I will offer the Labour Party a new coalition pact with Fianna Fáil on exactly the same terms as those agreed in late 1992.  Have Labour's policies changed since then?  The voters will question that party closely on what I would call its loose political morals, hopping out of one coalition bed and into another without as much as a backward glance.  Can anybody on that side honestly say that it was a question of policy difference?  For the voters, the problem will be to discern measures in a Bill such as this which contain an echo of radicalism.  It has gone, as has the <Col N="264" /> capacity of the Government to take tough decisions.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if supporters of the Labour Party will applaud section 20 which provides a new capital allowance for apartment and house landlords in respect of furniture and fittings installed for tenants.  Which of Labour's newly acquired well-heeled friends pressed for that provision? Who is accountable to the public for the Government's failure to curb growth in public expenditure? The facts speak for themselves &mdash; there is complete abandonment of any attempt to keep to a pre-agreed limit of 2 per cent real increase each year.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to this irresponsibility. First, there is the clear loss of credibility to the Government preaching about value for money. Taxpayers do not buy that and on election day the voters will not either.  Second, there was a unique opportunity to reduce personal tax and PRSI to low levels not dreamt of even by the Progressive Democrats Party.  We are not talking about 1p off the standard rate, we are talking perhaps about 3p or 4p if only public expenditure had been capped at 1994 levels plus inflation.  The Government will find it difficult to explain why it has not reduced income tax in this way.  The voters will not be swayed by illustrations of the extra expenditure the Government undertook with taxpayers' money, as with the Foreign Affairs figure rising from £40 million to £60 million or the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht figure rising from £48 million to £128 million.  The Fine Gael Departments did not do quite so well.</P>
    <P>The real problem with these levels of public expenditure is that they are the base level for next year's figures.  No Government, certainly not this one, appears to be able to cut back on expenditure. The only option in times of recession if we are to survive without reliance on the current deficit is to increase taxation.  Nothing in the Finance Bill prepares the ground for fiscal flexibility, which economists say we will need as participants in Euro after 1999.</P>
    <P>The matter of broadening the tax base is under active consideration in the Department of Finance &mdash; that is in the Department's statement of strategy published last month, but perhaps the Minister did not know that.  Broadening the tax base is one of the Department's indicators of success, a yardstick by which we are to be judged in the future.  Will the Minister confirm that this document was not approved by him and is an insubordination of the role of Government in policy formulation?  If not, will he advise us of the new forms of taxation he is preparing to torture the taxpayer?  Will he further advise why this Bill contains no such changes and why he is unlikely to be specific about them until after the general election?</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the Strategic Management Initiative where each Department puts forward its own statements and objectives.  As someone who was on public record long before I became spokesperson on Finance as an admirer of the <Col N="265" /> Department of Finance and the way civil servants conduct their business &mdash; I said this when I was often critical of other Government Departments &mdash; I find the wording in the statement of strategy released last month by the Department amazing. I recommend that this document be read because, apart from the matter I referred to as an indicator of success, there is much merit in it.  I suggest with great humbleness to civil servants in the Department that they may have slightly overstepped the mark, the dividing line between what are legitimate political objectives for politicians and political parties and what should be the objectives of a Department of State.</P>
    <P>Perhaps times have changed since I was in Government, but when the SMI process, which led to the recent publication of the Public Service Management Bill, began under the direction of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, I do not think it was intended that a statement of strategy by a Department should coincide exactly with the views of the current Government.  There are matters in this document that are legitimate as put forward by politicians and political parties and there are matters with which it is legitimate for civil servants to deal.  I am sure it was not the intention of the Minister or his civil servants that the document should be so overtly political and that is why it is easy for politicians to criticise it. It is presented in an excellent manner and should be used as an example by other Departments when publishing documents.  However, such documents should not contain an overlap between political and administrative matters.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Taxation&rdquo;, the document outlines a number of indicators of success in expenditure policy, such as the reduction of the tax burden on employment, the reduction in the number of taxpayers on the higher income tax rate and broadening the tax base.  That would be an acceptable statement for the Minister, Deputy Quinn, or for Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats to make, but it should not form part of a strategy paper published by the Department of Finance.  It is legitimate, however, for the Department of Finance to maintain a cost effective relationship between public service pay costs and total public service expenditure and to include that in its mission statement.  Under the heading &ldquo;Expenditure and Co-ordination&rdquo;, it is also legitimate for the Department to ensure that arrangements are made for a comprehensive programme of expenditure, with reviews to be carried out by individual Departments.  That should be contained in a strategy paper published by the Department of Finance.  However, the statement &ldquo;to ensure that Government policy in relation to control of numbers employed in the public service is implemented on a sector by sector basis by the responsible Departments&rdquo; should not be included in its document.  Those matters should be covered in a general statement stating that it is the job of the Department of Finance to carry out the Government's objectives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> Under the heading &ldquo;Economic and Fiscal Policy&rdquo; the document states that one of the Department's objectives is &ldquo;to deliver a budget deficit close to balance to ensure that the burden of Government debt continues to fall at a satisfactory rate&rdquo;.  While I agree with that policy and have called for the publication of such a fiscal document since 1977, that is a political point and the Department of Finance should not publish such a statement as one of its objectives.</P>
    <P>It is important not to overstep the line between policy formulation, the job of the politicians, and administrative matters.  Irrespective of whether Civil Servants agree, we must represent those who elect us and they will have an opportunity to throw some of us out, if they wish, in the near future.  In preparing this strategy document the officials may have inadvertently believed the document should contain a statement on Government objectives.  That should not be the case.  If I were the incumbent of that office I would not like the civil servants to feel obliged to publish word for word in a policy document the objectives of the new Administration.  I admire civil servants for being able to draw the line between political and administrative matters, but I want to ensure the line is not crossed.</P>
    <P>Is anybody on the Government side aware of the widening gap between the rich and the poor? Apart from section 4, the Bill does not refer to a fresh look at the taxation of some social welfare payments or tax relief on créche costs or carers whose services are paid for by the families of the elderly.  There are no tax incentives in the Bill that would encourage the elderly to move to sheltered purpose built accommodation which would, in turn, increase the supply of housing on the market and calm the extraordinary house price inflation we recently witnessed.  There is no new tax deductibility for charitable donations.  In a previous budget the Minister introduced tax relief for charities specifically engaged in overseas aid. I am sure he has been inundated with representations from various charities and their umbrella organisation, the Irish charities tax reform group, to introduce changes in the Finance Bill, 1997.  As I believe in equity, I will table amendments to this effect on Committee Stage.  The cost to the Exchequer would be minimal.  As the Minister established the principle in a previous budget, home based charities should benefit from such relief.</P>
    <P>A scheme has not been introduced for tax allowances towards the cost of personal computers, which grabbed the headlines the day Fianna Fáil launched its drug policy document. Would it not be more equitable to provide relief for gifts of PC systems to primary and secondary school?</P>
    <P>This economic boom, for which the Government wrongly claims credit, has caused a significant widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.  Ostentatious consumption is evident all around us, particularly in Dublin.  It is when we make our way down country lanes and into local <Col N="267" /> authority housing estates in our towns and villages that we appreciate the true meaning of the concept of a two speed economy.</P>
    <P>Last year I tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill to the effect that there should be a threshold liability to income tax before higher earners seek the benefits of the BES, section 23 and other tax avoidance schemes.  That amendment was ruled out of order on the basis that it would involve a charge on the Exchequer.  That was not true.  I will table a similar amendment this year which I trust the Ceann Comhairle will not rule out of order without inviting me to his office to discuss the matter.  It is obvious the level of cynicism about tax equity is very high.  We cannot be seen to disregard the public's disaffection with these matters.</P>
    <P>My fourth question arises from the recent successful challenge by Mrs. Gilligan to the revenue provisions of the proceeds of crime legislation. The Minister must tell the House where he, the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Draftsman got it wrong.  He cannot blame Members on this side.  The Government continues to shove complex legislation through its various stages without giving us an opportunity to get good advice on it.  Even when we get good advice, as in the case of the legislation on the compellability of witnesses, it is rejected.</P>
    <P>Last month the Minister sent us an advance copy of the miscellaneous preconsolidation measures of the Finance Bill so that our experts could examine them.  Now, however, we find the Bill contains twice as many specific sections in the Seventh Schedule and we are left with literally a few days to have the extra provisions checked out.  This disregard for the Oireachtas has caused the ridiculous farce of the Gilligan case.  Provisions were rushed through by the Government in a reluctant response to the murder of Veronica Guerin.  The Government's primary concern was to accept the principles of Fianna Fáil's proposals and to enact them speedily to quieten further effective criticism on this side of the House.  More haste, much less speed.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister is now proposing to use tax revenue as a substitute for local authority water charges, he should identify who first proposed this idea.  I lay odds that it was not the Minister for Finance.  The water charge system was somewhat inequitable, not merely because it varied from one authority area to another but, even more crucially, because some people paid and others refused to do so.  The system was about to collapse due to the level of arrears and because of legal challenges.</P>
    <P>Where Fianna Fáil might disagree with the Progressive Democrats on this matter is that we recognise the structure of the water charges system has in a few short years become riddled with doubts, hard cases, evasion and patchy returns. We even had to have tax relief to encourage payment. Let us fact it, if a system is that far gone it cannot last.  We must get back to the drawing <Col N="268" /> board on the question of the allocation of general tax revenue to individual authorities to cover the reasonable cost of providing water to householders.</P>
    <P>The last question I put to the Minister concerned his holiday plans.  I suggest he should make provision for a second one this year; his normal sojourn to Connemara in August can be supplemented by an additional holiday next October or November because I predict that he will not have to worry about the second budget for 1997.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, his officials and those of the Revenue Commissioners, and the outside experts that were brought in, for the way they prepared the Consolidation Bill.  As a practitioner of the art of accountancy for a number of years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some accountant friends of mine were often tempted to claim exemptions under a section in the Finance Act, 1969, for artists on the basis of creative work.  Since the Income Tax Act was consolidated in 1967 a great deal of taxation legislation has been introduced. For many years at budget time I put down questions to various Ministers and during speeches on Second Stage asked when the Acts would be consolidated. The excuse always given was that it was too expensive and would involve a mammoth amount of work and expertise.  I can appreciate that.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be remembered politically for many things, both good and bad, but his initiative in driving forward the Consolidation Bill is certainly worthwhile and will be remembered for a long time after he has left the Department of Finance.  In his speech, the Minister said he would publish the text of the Consolidation Bill next week.</P>

      <P>The Minister said recently, either in his budget speech or in reply to question of mine, that he would publish a White Paper in May.  Has there been a change of plan?  Will he now publish the Bill without first having a White Paper?  A White Paper on a tax Act would be something unusual.  It would be the first time in the history of the State that such was proposed.  I am not too certain what will be in it.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to it.  There are some interesting sections of this Finance Bill to which we should pay more attention on Second Stage.  I will be more well read into it by the time Committee Stage comes around in a fortnight when we will spend 12 hours a day over three days in Kildare House going through the various sections.  Even though that debate is televised and open to the public, we will be the only people who will listen to it.  It is a pity it is not more widely reported.  The Committee Stage of the Finance Bill works well but it is not well reported. When people come to write about the work politicians do the Finance Bill is never mentioned, although it is a compliment to the Minister, his officials and all the Deputies who contributed to it.</P>
      <P>Section 12 is quite unusual and I suggest it has been slipped in.  I suspect there is a great political reason for so doing.  There are provisions under tax legislation to exempt part of the golden boot or golden handshake; that is a lump sum given to people when, for one reason or another, they leave a firm.  Special complicated tax provisions are used to compute the liability although the provisions are not as complicated now as they used to be.</P>
      <P>When it has all been done there is something called top slicing relief whereby going back over a number of years one can further reduce a person's tax liability.  In the past 20 years this has been often used by accountants as a tax provision for people concerned through redundancy, voluntary severance packages and other matters.  It is in order for the State to get some claw back on very large sums given to people as severance terms.</P>
      <P>Section 12, however, is in addition to this aspect of the tax legislation, which has been there for some time.  It is designed to give further tax exemption to people who, according to the section, will get a lump sum from their employers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The only reason I can think of for its introduction is so that people in certain semi-State companies can have some of their overtime bought out.  Such suggestions have been <Col N="270" /> made on foot of reports.  Interestingly enough, the definition of average pay includes overtime. Section 12 is clearly designed to facilitate the restructuring of a number of inefficient semi-States by allowing lump sums to be given to workers as tax free amounts.  The wording is a delightful con job.  It has been dressed up as granting compensation for loss of basic pay but I notice that the definition of basic pay includes overtime.  I cannot think where the demand for such a change came from unless it was from the organisations to which I referred.  There is no other reason because existing tax regulations relating to severance payments are adequate. They could be improved but I will return to this on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister promised me recently that he would announce the Government's position regarding its strategy regarding corporation tax for 2005 and 2010. There is considerable pressure on companies concerned about this as they have to make decisions now.  What will the position be on the 10 per cent corporation tax rate for companies in the IFSC and other companies on the lower corporation tax rate?  Multinational companies are making decisions and the Minister should announce Government strategy on this in the near future.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of standard rating reliefs, a policy which has existed for years.  We have standard rated nearly all reliefs on a gradual basis over the years.  I have no objection to this principle but I have always had doubts about standard rating VHI relief.  I put forward the notion in another forum that this might be shortsighted in that health costs would be transferred from individuals to the public sector.  It is the one area where the decision made years ago could be reversed.  I referred earlier to BES relief and the restrictions in that area.  I suggest to the Minister that it is a matter of reversing the decision on medical insurance relief &mdash; there are groups other than the VHI in the marketplace now &mdash; and allowing relief at the top rate of tax.  I want the matter considered further.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also been inundated with representations over a period of years on the question of cross border workers taxation.  This is a genuine grievance as the Minister will have learned during his visits to Donegal during the by-election.  Small changes were made regarding levies last year but this was not satisfactory and the issue should be clarified.  Border Deputies on both sides of the House have lobbied the Minister, none more so than my colleague, Deputy Cecilia Keaveney, who is probably more conscious of this debate than any other Member of the House.  Having been the successful candidate in the by-election her ear is more in tune with the concerns of the people in her area of Donegal North-East.  I will put down a reasonable amendment on Committee Stage which would alleviate the situation for a large number of affected people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> The Minister has made some changes regarding capital allowances on hire purchase transactions. A furore developed in recent months regarding this issue.  The Revenue Commissioners have attended to the various problems and everything has been sorted out.  I compliment officials in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners for their enlightened approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>There is no change in the Bill to benefit-in-kind for cars.  Changes were made years ago and many amendments have been made to them, but they still have not satisfied a number of people.  I suspect the reason legislative change was made originally was that a civil servant standing at a bus stop was splashed by a car and decided he would get revenge by changing the benefit-in-kind legislation.  However, it creates problems for commercial travellers or salespeople and further changes should be made to alleviate the problems.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Minister made significant welcome changes to inheritance tax particularly in regard to transfers of businesses.  One aspect of inheritance tax, which is an anomaly in the current legislation, has been brought to my attention recently.  Single brothers and sisters who live in the same house as the disponer are discriminated against.  The way out of it would be to allow a higher exemption threshold.  There have been cases where people found themselves in very difficult financial circumstances.  Will the Minister consider changes in this regard before Committee Stage?</P>
    <P>Having a high rate of capital gains tax does not necessarily produce as big a yield as a lower rate. Anyone involved in an accountancy or legal practice will know that the amount of time and effort that goes into devising schemes of tax avoidance in the area of capital gains tax would be more worthwhile if it was spent in another more fruitful area of activity.  I suggest there would not be a net loss to the Exchequer if the rates of capital gains tax were lowered.  Deputy McDowell agrees with this.  When Deputy Dukes was Minister for Finance, Deputy McGahon and I got into difficulty for suggesting that the reduction of off-course betting tax from 20 per cent to 10 per cent would benefit the Exchequer.  Former Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla pilloried us inside and outside the House but when Deputy Dukes took the courage to drop the rate, we were right about its effect.</P>
    <P>While the question of capital gains tax is different, I am certain from my extensive professional experience that the total yield to the Exchequer would be far greater if it were reduced to a lower level.  I suspect the Minister may be hamstrung by members of his party who would have great difficulty taking this route.  It is one of the unfortunate leftovers from the more doctrinaire socialist days of Labour and Democratic Left that even contemplating the reduction of capital gains tax might lead them to think they had given up all <Col N="272" /> semblance of socialist doctrine.  However, it is one they could easily give up because it would be far more beneficial to everybody.  Also, it would create a better business climate and increase economic activity.  Whatever about my discourse on capital gains tax, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Business and Services has proposed that a lower effective rate of capital gains tax should apply to the disposal of shares in small trading companies.  That notion harks back to the system of tapering relief which operated when the late George Colley was Minister for Finance and the current Minister should bear it in mind.</P>
    <P>I will raise other matters on Committee Stage. In the past the Minister has been more open to accept amendments than any other Minister in my 20 years in the House.  When he acceded to the request on education fees a Departmental official, with whom I have since become good friends, almost fainted.  I look forward to the same openness on this Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy McCreevy about capital gains tax.  I have lunch every week with a friend who left Ireland rather than pay this tax and came back some years later having avoided it.  If the rate of the tax had been 20 per cent he would not have gone through that operation, in which the Exchequer was the big loser.  As the Deputy said, a huge amount of time and effort is put into avoiding capital gains tax and the amount of such tax lost to the Exchequer through loan notes, overseas transactions and complex corporate deals is huge also.  If we had a simple system which differentiated between income and genuine capital gains on a commonsense basis, we could reduce it to 20 per cent and life would be much easier.  I realise that is difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to say a person disposing of a business should not pay a large amount of tax but 20 per cent is quite high.  Close to where I live, a family owns a house let out in flats.  They thought of selling it but realised they would have to pay 40 per cent capital gains tax and the purchaser would have to pay 9 per cent stamp duty.  Almost half the proceeds would go to the Minister's coffers.  The family decided to hold on to it and do something else.  Although their inclination was to sell, the tax consequences were such that the only person who would benefit was the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  If one considers the constraints which capital gains tax places on the quick transferability of property, the Minister would make more from stamp duty if the rate of CGT was lower.  At present people <Col N="273" /> think they cannot sell unless they want to make the Minister a 49 per cent shareholder in their property through tax payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that but it is not beyond the wit of human beings to devise a system which imposes a rational levy on realised capital gains.  Forty per cent is too high and people will not pay it.  They will emigrate or issue loan notes on Cypriot companies to avoid it.  They will not give 40 per cent of their property to the State just because they want to change the asset to something else. Unfortunately, that is the reality.</P>
      <P>This year is important because it is almost 25 years since Labour and Fine Gael went into coalition in 1973 and in that period Labour has been in office for 15 years, which is a not inconsiderable political achievement.  While it has been in power there has been a dramatic transformation in the Irish taxation system.  In 1973, 98 per cent of taxpayers paid the standard rate and only 2 per cent paid the higher rate.  In 1977 some 14 per cent paid the higher rate and the then leader of Fine Gael remarked that to index tax bands and allowances would be the end of all social progress.  I mention this to underline that the tax system is in its current state not through a calamity or a geophysical movement of the earth but largely because politicians have made it so, for one reason or another.</P>
      <P>Our tax system is still manifestly unjust and anti-employment.  The most recent figures show that seasonally adjusted underlying unemployment is increasing, in the middle of the Celtic Tiger's rampage.  What is happening?  How is a country translating record growth into rising unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the streets of our constituency, the Minister and I see restaurants, shops and businesses looking for staff.  Those notices remain there for a long time.  Why are employers finding it impossible to fill jobs in small businesses?  Deputy McCreevy made an interesting point when mentioning the Department of Finance's Strategic Management Initiative but the fundamental error &mdash; which is a Departmental error and not the legacy of Dr. FitzGerald or anyone else &mdash; is a viciously anti-employment taxation outlook. Employment, other than public service employment, is not regarded as good.  How can one think the Department of Finance favours employment when a person earning less than the average industrial wage pays 55 pence per pound in tax? It must be the case that Department officials do not value employment.  We value stallions and exempt the horse breeding industry from tax but are we interested in employment?  How is it that, while the Celtic Tiger is a roaring success, the underlying rate of unemployment is rising in this poor benighted country?  On one level this is difficult <Col N="274" /> to comprehend but on another it is easy to explain.  We have hammered employment.</P>
    <P>Anyone who subscribes to <i>The Economist</i> receives a weekly dose of sometimes cynical, sometimes stimulating reality from the outside. Irish postal rates are so high that it is cheaper for the magazine to arrange hand delivery to one's door.  That suggests something about an economy which is anti-employment and anti-labour intensive and the structure of our semi State sector.</P>
    <P>There is a very good series of articles in this week's <i>Economist</i> on the theme that Europe is not working.  The gist of the articles is that high welfare and high taxation have destroyed jobs across Europe.  It is interesting that the wheels are falling off the European model as a model for other parts of the world to follow.  The social market model used in Europe is not working.  The reason is that the combination of high tax on work and high welfare is a lethal anti employment cocktail.</P>
    <P>Employment is the cornerstone of social justice. There is no greater poverty fighter than a job.  Anybody who believes that transfer payments from those who apparently have to those who have not, from those who do to those who cannot do, is a secure foundation for social justice is deluding themselves.</P>
    <P>The SMI for the Department of Finance was revealing.  However, I am slightly more apprehensive about the SMI mission statement for the Department for Social Welfare.  Those two Departments are not pro employment; their ethos is anti-employment.</P>
    <P>In the next five years the marginal rates of tax must come down.  If I thought reducing the rates was just flashy politics I would be one of the first to concede that, but I believe marginal rates of tax must be low.  The average industrial worker should not pay more than 20 per cent of his or her earnings in tax.</P>
    <P>An interesting aspect of this year's budget was that it conceded the first change in PRSI in recent times of a reduction of 1 per cent.  When I asked the Minister for Finance whether that 1 per cent reduction was calculated in the £900 million tax deduction, he had to concede it was.  For the first time it has been admitted that PRSI is not merely a tax but a tax whose reduction can constitute a pro employment measure.  The logic of that is to hack away employee PRSI completely.  The logic of being pro employment is to convert employer PRSI, which is necessary from a budgetary point of view because so many companies are now at the 10 per cent rate, into a single digit levy on all payrolls.  We should aim for a tax regime with rates of 20 and 40 per cent.  There is no reason to hold out for a higher basic rate of tax than there will be in the United Kingdom.  There is no reason for us to have a higher top rate either.</P>
    <P>We should take on board what is in the Partnership 2000 document in relation to the examination of tax credits.  Cold water has been thrown on that idea for a long time by the Department of Finance.  I remember raising it informally on <Col N="275" /> many occasions with people who have walked the corridors of Merrion Street.  They all seem to think there is nothing right about tax credits. From a social justice point of view, if one is making very significant reductions in the top rate of tax, one of the compensating measures one can take in that context is to make the tax exemption system, in the form of allowances, worth as much in cash terms to a low paid worker as it is to a high paid worker.  In that context, we should look over the next five years at converting all the basic personal allowances into tax credits which are worth as much to low paid workers as to high paid ones.</P>
    <P>I tabled a parliamentary question recently, which Deputy McCreevy might not have seen, to which the answer was that the benefit to the Exchequer of standard rating all allowances, including personal allowances, would be in the order of £600 million.  If the 48 per cent rate was significantly reduced to 40 per cent there would be an almost unanswerable case for standard rating all personal basic allowances on a progressive basis, to give the benefit of the fairness quotient in our tax system to those at the bottom of the scale, and not simply to those who benefited from reductions in the top rate.</P>
    <P>There is also an unanswerable intellectual case for saying that if a sum of money is made exempt for a low paid worker it does not have to be doubled for a married worker or someone whose tax rate is twice as large.  I do not see any injustice in standard rating the mortgage interest allowance. If it is just to do it in that context, I cannot see how it is any less just to do it in the context of a personal allowance.</P>
    <P>Our present tax system is cruelly unjust to widows and widowers.  Although they get temporary relief in the year of bereavement and an increased tax allowance, it is cruelly unjust to say that a family which has lost one of its mainstays should suddenly suffer a tax imposition.  How does one get around that?  One starts by saying the decision made in the aftermath of the married people's tax judgment to simply double allowances and bands was not justifiable.  It is not justifiable to say that two people can live at the same standard of living at 1.6 times the single person's salary.</P>
    <P>The second injustice is that if one wants to do something for single workers, unless one uses the device of a PAYE or PRSI allowance, one must double it for a group of people whom one does not want to benefit from the tax relief.  If the aim is to get people, particularly single people, off the dole and into jobs it does not make sense that every tax concession made to people in that category must be doubled or quadrupled for married people, particularly those paying tax at the 48 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>The doubling up arrangement was not a necessary response to that decision of the Supreme Court.  It was administratively far more convenient for the Revenue Commissioners as it <Col N="276" /> allowed aggregation of income.  It was more beneficial in that respect and was capable of being dressed up as a pro family tax arrangement. However, it has not, in essence, turned out to be much of a pro family arrangement or one which was pro spouses working in the home.</P>
    <P>At a time when many spouses, particularly wives, are anxious to have easy access into the labour market, the doubling up of tax allowances and bands for married women is a very crude approach to pro employment tax reform.  It is a curious irony that John Major is now proposing to go somewhat towards the Irish system as part of his election manifesto.  However, doubling both bands and allowances is a misguided approach to structuring the respective tax affairs of single and married people.  We should take a different road and begin to consider a variable family allowance that can be shared by the spouses in a family where both want to, or one does not want to work.  It could also be varied in size by reference to the number of children.</P>
    <P>Given that child benefit is receivable by all, it is suggested that the present system effectively compensates people for the abolition of children's allowances for income tax.  However, if we want to provide people with an incentive to work it may be better to provide family instead of marriage allowances, which would vary, at least to some extent, with the number of children.  This would allow us to be fairer to widows and widowers: as head of the family they would be entitled to the family allowance.  If such changes were to be introduced to the tax system over a period we could end up with a more just and less rigid system than the simple two to one model which prevails at present.</P>
    <P>Significant recognition should be given to the cost incurred by those returning to work who must arrange for substitute child care.  In 95 per cent of cases women encounter this difficulty because they are usually the home makers.  In that context, steps should be taken to simplify the tax system.  A concession should be made to those who want to return to work but who must retain others to substitute for them in the home, partly or wholly during working hours.  If this matter was approached in a constructive and open minded way, many payments which are now effectively made in the black economy could be brought into the tax system on the basis of a reduced tax liability.  This may be fairer to women, especially if the tax inhibitions to their re-entry to the labour market were removed.</P>
    <P>In the context of the recent controversy regarding the abolition of water rates, there has been much jeering and finger pointing, especially at the Progressive Democrats, including myself, regarding the abolition of the residential property tax. The two are unrelated, indeed many people in parts of my constituency paid both.</P>
    <P>However, the abolition of the RPT has proved to be just because many of those who are now paying the increased rate of stamp duty have the wherewithal to do so &mdash; those buying houses <Col N="277" /> valued at £300,000 or £400,000 are aware of the amount of stamp duty involved.  The RPT was unfair because it applied to families with modest combined incomes, say three incomes totalling £50,000, who bought their houses 20 years ago in &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; areas and were exposed to tax liabilities because of spiralling house prices.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty rate of 9 per cent means that a considerable portion of increased property prices is now being taxed at a rate which is less like a stamp duty and more like a VAT rate.  While it is a heavy level of transaction taxation to apply to upmarket homes, it could not be argued that it is unjust because anybody buying a home which falls significantly into this category is aware of the situation.  In any event, many capital gains are being made tax free on the disposal of homes because of increased property values.  Those who argue that the abolition of the RPT amounted to a significant contraction of the property tax base should bear in mind that a low rate of VAT has been effectively imposed on the homes to which the RPT used to apply.  In those circumstances, the tax base has not been significantly narrowed.</P>
    <P>Little public attention is paid to the issue of tax harmonisation in the EU.  It is not in Ireland's interest to go down this road.  Nor is it in Ireland's interest to concede that income tax, corporation tax or any other form of taxation, apart from VAT, should be the subject of tax harmonisation. My view of the EU is not of an ever closer union in which fiscal powers are attracted to the centre and fiscal equality becomes a matter for determination by the rich and powerful member states.</P>
    <P>If we give up the &ldquo;independence&rdquo; of our currency &mdash; I am not sure to what extent it is an asset &mdash; we should never give up, in any significant measure, our own discretion regarding the taxes we wish to raise, other than VAT, which relates to the movement of goods.  It may be argued there is little point in having uniformity regarding the movement of goods when corporation, personal and capital taxation also affects movement of capital.  However, it is good for the EU that downward pressure on taxation rates is caused by competitive impulses to attract enterprise among the member states.  If the central, core powers of the EU &mdash; Germany, France and the Benelux countries &mdash; were to determine tax rates for the other member states, our interests would come last.</P>
    <P>In view of this, our policy on European economic integration should be that while we are enthusiasts for European Monetary Union it is against our interests to proceed with tax harmonisation and we are not interested in uniform corporation, income, and employment tax rates.  We should hold on to our tax autonomy as far as we can.  We have given up enough on VAT and will be giving up enough with regard to European Monetary Union.  Thereafter, we should draw a firm line against fiscal harmonisation.  It is not wanted by the people.</P>

      <P>Regarding water charges, there is no such thing as free water.  Gathering, purifying and distributing water costs money.  It cannot be free and the only issue is how the cost should be met.  There is no possibility in the long-term of unlimited quantities of water being freely available for an unlimited period to domestic consumers. That is not on in European, environmental or economic terms.  It is impossible to deliver. However, the impression is being created that, in the two years before European directives are implemented, we can have a break from paying water charges.  However, people understand there cannot be free water.</P>
      <P>As the Acting Chairman is aware, low water pressure in our part of the city is already having a significant effect.  People in our area must pay up to £400 for a pump &mdash; the installation of which is illegal &mdash; to bring water to the top of their houses.</P>

      <P>Water pressure throughout Dublin is falling.  The western suburbs do not feature the tall houses of Rathmines and Ranelagh but water pressure there is also falling.  The valves are throtted and many housing estates have no water pressure during certain hours of the day.  In January 1996 the Department of the Environment commissioned a report from joint French and Irish consultants to advise it on the future water crisis in Dublin.  It appears a capital investment of £0.6 billion is required to improve the water supply in Dublin.  This sum relates only to water and not to sewerage services.  Metering must be introduced in Dublin to conserve water.</P>

It would involve finance packages <Col N="279" /> for the installation of meters but it could probably be spread over 12 to 15 years.

      <P>It is astonishing that intelligent people could come forward at this stage of Ireland's political development with such facile, ignorant and childlike proposals.  In the last analysis they will be rejected.  As the public begins to focus its attention on what is happening, it is becoming increasingly disillusioned by those trying to peddle this stupidity.  Deputy Harney has been proved correct.  The volume of good wishes and congratulatory messages she has received is phenomenal.  The Deputies making so much noise now should reflect on the fact that the people are wise to the Government's nonsense in this area.  The House will probably be dissolved in a few months.</P>

      <P>I do not know when the whistle will be blown.  However, the next Government must deal with radical tax reform and matters such as the financing of the water system. Real politics will reassert itself.  Regardless of who is in Government or Opposition, reality will reassert itself in the foreseeable future in relation to public spending commitments and public sector pay.  This country needs a Government committed to a radical, pro-employment tax reform and to the proposition that, if an expenditure target of 2 per cent is fixed upon taking office, 6 per cent is unacceptable.  That Government should fix targets and tell the electorate what it will deliver. When it is before the electorate five years after that, it can show what it achieved in taxation reform.  Each Finance Bill should achieve this goal incrementally.  When this Government was formed, firm targets were not set for taxation reform.  As a result, nothing was achieved. Nothing can be achieved without targets, as the experience of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition proved.  It is embarrassing if targets are not achieved.</P>

      <P>If the Government had stuck to the targets given in writing to the people in December 1994, we would now have £600 million per annum more to relieve taxpayers.  The tragedy is that Deputy Quinn, who threatened to resign on the issue of public service pay, had no control over that issue.  What happened from 1982 <Col N="282" /> to 1987 happened again on this occasion; the Tánaiste's withering hand was on the levers of power.  The Tánaiste always tears up every effort at controlling public spending.  It is the Labour Party, led by Deputy Spring, that has driven public spending so high.  To be fair to Fine Gael, they would have stood by the spending commitments they made in 1994.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately that party is led by people intent on keeping office, like Dr. FitzGerald from 1982 to 1987 and the present Taoiseach.  Their one imperative is to keep office no matter what the consequences are for public spending.  The people have had that twice and will not have it a third time.  The next Finance Bill, which may be introduced in the autumn, will be the first step on the road to national recovery and fair taxation.  It will be the first occasion on which a Minister for Finance will say: &ldquo;One thing I will achieve before leaving office is that ordinary workers will never again pay 55p in the pound as they did under Fine Gael and Labour.  The most they will pay is 40p in the pound and most will only pay 20p in the pound.&rdquo;</P>

That will happen in the next five years and I am delighted that Deputies on the Government side are here to witness it being set out.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Is cúis áthais dom go bhfuil deis agam a bheith anseo i mbliana chun labhairt ar an mBille Airgeadais.  Cé go bhfuil toghchán ag teacht uair éigin i rith na bliana, tá súil agam go mbeidh mé ar ais agus go mbeidh deis agam éisteacht leis an Teachta Michael McDowell nuair a bheidh sé san áit chéanna sa Dáil.</P>
      <P>Tá áthas orm freisin go bhfuil feabhas ag teacht ar an tír agus go bhfuil saol na ndaoine ag dul i bhfeabhas agus go mór mór, in ainneoin blip beag inné, go bhfuil feabhas ag teacht ar na figiúirí fostaíocha. Bhí an-chuid raiméise ag an Teachta McDowell maidir leis na táillí uisce ach tá sé imithe anois agus leanfaidh mé ar aghaidh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Le fada an lá bhí an gearán ann go raibh ús aníseal againn sa tír seo, go raibh gach rud i gceart ach nach raibh fás ag teacht ar an fhostaíocht.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil sin athraithe anois agus go bhfuil saol na ndaoine ag dul i bhfeabhas agus go bhfuil 53 faoin gcéad de na daoine sásta leis an Rialtas seo.  Is figiúr íontach é sin agus is cuma cén gearán atá ar siúl ag an bhFreasúra, sin an figiúr is tábhachtaí ar fad.  Níor thárla sé riamh <Col N="283" /> cheana roimh toghchán go raibh an oiread sin sásta le rialtas.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy McDowell left the Chamber. He went to great lengths to say Ireland should not agree to tax harmonisation in Europe.  That is a marvellous statement given his argument that we would have to accept water charges if they came from Europe and that they were almost here already.  How can he insist on one hand we will have to accept the ruling from Europe on water and at the same time that we should not accept the ruling on taxation?  If he is talking about harmonisation, those two matters should negate any ambitions his party had for getting a gold medal at Dublin Feis Ceoil in the mixed choir section.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went to great lengths about the difficulties in pumping water to Dublin 4.  It is a pity they did not pay water charges over the years.  Dublin Corporation might then be able to provide a proper water supply to the city.  Dublin Deputies talk about equity while those in the countryside pay water charges.  I was interviewed on radio last weekend by a reporter who was very keen on the idea of paying water charges and who felt that it was only fair to pay those charges.  I asked him how much he had paid over the years in water charges and, foolishly, he admitted he had paid nothing.  I said that was a great argument for a Carlow person like me to hear: that we should pay water charges while Dublin people paid none.  There is a lot of silly comment about water charges.</P>
    <P>If Dublin people paid water charges I would back the idea of everyone paying for water. However, country people who pay their taxes should not subsidise Dublin.  Deputy McDowell said his area's water supply was poor.  That is a reflection of the lack of money for that supply. Deputies should have insisted that Dublin people paid water charges like those down the country. If we cannot have cothrom na Féinne do gach éinne, we should not have water charges at all.</P>
    <P>It takes hard neck for Deputy Molloy to offer £23 million on this issue, when it is three times the required rate.</P>

      <P>This Bill is important.  Its central aim is to protect sporting and cultural events <Col N="284" /> from satellite and television providers.  This is an important consideration, especially in view of the feast of sport planned for 1998.  This feast includes the usual spectacles like the All-Ireland series as well as rugby and soccer internationals. There is also the World Equestrian Games, the Tour de France and the Tall Ships race, which was such a spectacular success in Cork on its last visit there.  Because of the growing power and dominance of satellite television companies, there is a danger that the televising one of these three special major events in 1998 will fall into the grips of a television mogul.  People would then have to pay treble the amount to see an event of great national and cultural importance.  This already happens in relation to big boxing matches where the television viewer must pay their licence, a subscription to Cablelink and then an extra fee of approximately £9.25 to watch one event on the pay-per-view system.</P>
      <P>The necessity for this Bill is clear.  As well as the almost daily technological advances in broadcasting and telecommunications, represented by the digital television revolution, there is a parallel development in the manner in which those who control broadcasting present their service and product to the viewing public.  The most recent significant development is pay television, a new television service to which viewers may choose to subscribe either on a regular basis or for particular programmes. A sub-category of pay television is pay-per-view where subscribers pay for particular programmes.</P>
      <P>Subscription based television is big business.  It has resulted in one broadcaster having a disproportionate influence on those responsible for organising events which are to be televised.  The organisers of events are attracted by the huge financial gains on offer and are willing to yield to the broadcaster's demands.  The impact of this commercial relationship or open cheque book policy is apparent to those viewers interested in soccer, golf, cricket and boxing.  Some sports have gone so far as to reinvent themselves at the behest of the broadcaster.  Irish viewers have been denied access to such events as the Ryder Cup, live premier league football and to Stephen Collins's defence of his WBO super middle weight title.</P>
      <P>The change from traditional television services to satellite-delivered subscription and pay-per-view services for covering national and international events is not in the public interest. Organisers of events are in a seller's market which can result in public service broadcasters being outbid for the rights to cover events.  The increasing number of international satellite-delivered television channels has implications for public service broadcasting, given the importance of sports events, in particular, in attracting audiences of sufficient size to interest advertisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill aims to ensure that the public interest in broadcasting continues to be served.  That interest was served by the International Olympic <Col N="285" /> Council's decision to award the contract for the Olympic Games held in Atlanta to the European Broadcasting Union, of which RTE is a member, rather than Sky television.  This was a policy decision based on a view, which we support, that the greatest number of people should have access via television to one of the major sporting events in the world.  Public access to designated events by way of television cannot be left to the altruistic, or otherwise, nature of the organisers of those events.  Fianna Fáil believes the State has an obligation to ensure that the televising of certain events should, in the public interest, be available free of additional charge, irrespective of commercial interests.  This Bill achieves that objective.</P>
    <P>Despite the additional financial costs to the viewer of subscription based television, this Bill is not aimed at one broadcaster but is universal in its application and is predicated on the cultural importance to the nation of certain designated events.  It deals specifically with the exercise of the televising rights of an event only.  The commercial and technological reality of television in the 21st century cannot be resisted.  This Bill seeks to balance the rights of organisers of events and broadcasters on the one hand against the interests of the television public and the cultural significance of those events on the other hand.  It is designed to regulate this area and to address people's concerns about the untrammelled growth of pay-per-view television particularly as far as sport is concerned.  We have followed the EU Commission model in which certain events, mainly sporting ones, will be designated as being of national importance.</P>
    <P>Our proposals deserve support from all those who love sport and culture and believe in the right to free speech.  This Bill introduces broadcasting restrictions to ensure certain sporting and cultural events will be available to everyone.  It adopts the EU route and those taken in Britain, France and Australia where legal frameworks have been developed to ensure the universality of access to major events and to restrict the monopolisation of events by minority paid channels.</P>
    <P>This Bill, unlike the Minister's proposals, is not contrary to competition law.  The Minister proposed in mid-December that major sports bodies would be required to provide land based stations, such as RTE, with first option on big sporting events and at reasonable terms.  Under EU competition law, this would be open to challenge.  In his document on broadcasting, <i>Clear Focus,</i> the Minister gives another version of what he plans to do in this area but there is little detail.  A Bill will not be published for at least six months.  We have proposed an anti-siphoning system which overcomes the competition difficulty.  Our key is universality.  The listed events are not reserved exclusively for any one type of broadcaster but their <i>de facto</i> operation would mean that a pay-per-view system would have no commercial gain because exclusivity would be taken out of the equation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> We are introducing this Bill because of the Minister's inactivity in this area: there has been nothing but aspiration to date.  There is less detail in his document, <i>Clear Focus,</i> than there was in the Green Paper 18 months ago.  Fianna Fáil believes we cannot wait any longer.  The speed with which this matter needs to be tackled was clearly emphasised early this year.  On the same day as the EU Commission proposed new broadcasting restrictions to ensure certain sports events will be available to everyone, Mr. Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB announced profits of £130 million for a half year.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murdoch has built his global television empire by securing exclusive rights to sporting events.  His presence has changed the nature of both rugby union and rugby league and he was the driving force behind the formation of the English premier soccer league six years ago.  Last year, the premiership completed a four year £670 million deal with BSkyB.  With the onset of digital television, the potential for further profit appears virtually unlimited.</P>
    <P>Charging customers to watch individual matches on television is already in the pipeline. Research in Britain suggests that television subscription revenue will overtake that from advertising, reaching over £3.5 billion per year by the year 2001.  Against this background, any sporting event, no matter how venerable, can be enticed to &ldquo;pay television&rdquo; by the lure of Mr. Rupert Murdoch's deep pockets.  Such a development could have major implications for RTE.  If it lost coverage of major sporting events, it would lose significant audience and earning potential.  It would also be seen to fail in its public service remit.</P>
    <P>The remarkable growth in the popularity of Irish culture on a European and world-wide basis and the associated economic benefits is a development of which Fianna Fáil is proud.  We face the challenges of modern technological communications and the urgent needs of the mass media in the promotion of our culture among wider audiences.  We must also recognise that the control of television can give enormous political and cultural influence to a small number of wealthy individuals.  Whoever controls television is in a powerful position to shape thinking and ideas, especially when media education is only developing.</P>
    <P>We must face the reality of the expression of our culture in an economic environment where price increasingly dictates access and quality.  One has only to look at the problems faced by the Five Nations Championship and the dominance of Sky television in broadcasting English premiership soccer to ascertain the benefits and disadvantages of these developments in broadcasting sport.  The lifeblood of culture is participation.  Any developments which seriously threaten participation must be counteracted.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the financial gains to sporting bodies in negotiating exclusive broadcasting deals with satellite broadcasters and consequent gains <Col N="287" /> in investment in these sports are an unarguable benefit.  However, the opportunity cost of this exclusivity and financial gain is participation and the expression of our identity via our culture.</P>
    <P>This Fianna Fáil Bill sets out a course to maintain the expression of our unique culture and identity.  Arguably, there is a constitutional imperative to do this as Article 43.2.2º states: &ldquo;The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of said rights [private property rights] with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.&rdquo;  The rights of the Irish nation to share in the ownership and expression of its culture and the duty of the State to ensure the universality of access has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Our Bill is an anti-siphoning one modelled on a similar legislative initiative in Australia, the Australian Broadcasting Services Act, 1992.  To ensure that Australia's free-to-air viewers are not disadvantaged by the loss to &ldquo;pay TV&rdquo; of significant sporting or cultural events covered by free-to-air television, section 115 of the Australian Broadcasting Act enables the relevant Minister to specify a list of events, an anti-siphoning list, which should be available to be televised free to the general public.  The Minister is enabled to protect the free availability of certain types of programmes by way of a notice published in the Australian <i>Gazette.</i> An event specified in such a notice is deemed to be removed from the notice 168 hours after the end of the event unless the Minister deems otherwise.  The anti-siphoning list is not reserved solely for free-to-air television and does not guarantee exclusive rights.  The Australian Broadcasting Authority has a role to monitor and to report to the Minister every six months on the availability, acquisition and use of broadcasting rights to listed events.  In its report to date the Authority stated the anti-siphoning list has worked effectively.</P>
    <P>Britain has also moved in this regard.  In sections 97 to 105 of the English Broadcasting Act, 1996, the Secretary of State is given power to designate sporting or other events of national interest as listed events.  Pursuant to those provisions a contract entered into for exclusive rights to televise certain listed live events for reception in Britain is held to be void.  The Act also gives the Broadcasting Standards Commission, established by section 106 of the Act, power to impose penalties in certain circumstances.  The listed events under the terms of the Act, known as the &ldquo;jewels of the crown&rdquo;, are the FA Cup Final, the Scottish FA Cup Final, the FIFA World Cup Final, the Derby, the Grand National, the Olympic Games, Wimbledon and certain test cricket matches.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been slow off the mark despite many promises.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht promised legislation on this as far back as 28 November 1995.  However, nothing has materialised.  In the Seanad on 28 February 1996 the Government put forward a sinister <Col N="288" /> amendment to a Fianna Fáil motion calling for legislation.  The Government amendment stated that the solution to the problem &ldquo;can only be achieved in an international context&rdquo;.  In his speech the Minister said: &ldquo;it is futile to think of addressing such an issue in the context of national broadcasting legislation alone.&rdquo;  This does not inspire confidence that we will ever get legislation. The Minister wants to pass the parcel to other sovereign governments rather than face the issue head-on.  Throughout his term he has shown a preference for the soft PR focus rather than being known for tackling the tough issues.</P>
    <P>In the Clear Focus document, which gives the heads of a proposed broadcasting Bill, the issue of protecting sports events is lumped in with all the other matters.  It merits only three paragraphs in the document and this detail is very different from what was proposed last December by him. The question must be, which route, if any, he will go.</P>
    <P>The Minister also suggests that where sporting organisations are grant aided by the State,&ldquo;provision is made that the question of whether broadcasting rights are available to non-subscription channels can be taken into account in deciding whether to make the grant or not&rdquo;.  He fails to recognise that Irish sporting organisations realise that they have a social and cultural role that transcends pure commercial considerations.  His bald statement in this document insults the honour of Irish sporting organisations. Fianna Fáil is sure that all sporting organisations will want to comply with what is proposed.  They do not need the Minister, Deputy Higgins, waving a big stick at them.</P>
    <P>The Clear Focus document is very disappointing. Heads of the Bill and a glossy booklet are no substitute for the legislation.  It is like Hamlet without the prince.  It is unprecedented that a follow up document to a Green Paper would have less detail than the Green Paper. There can be no doubt that the object of the booklet is an attempt to build a defence against inaction.  There are oversights in the booklet.  For example, even though the Minister requires RTE to provide one hour of programming to TnaG each day, this is omitted from Clear Focus as circulated. The introduction of the Broadcasting Bill remains six to nine months away because of the lead time required by the parliamentary draftsman. The Government acknowledges this as the Broadcasting Bill is still on Appendix C of the list of promised legislation which means there is a promise, but it may not be introduced for some considerable time.  The Bill will not be introduced this side of an election.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Higgins, with the heads of a Bill is attempting to shape the political agenda without introducing legislation.  This is a cynical manoeuvre by him.  The Green Paper was published 18 months ago but there has not been a move to introduce a White Paper.  For the past year he has promised a Bill.  Now we are told that all he has is a few headlines of a Bill.  This is pure electioneering.  The Minister wants to give the <Col N="289" /> impression of action without doing anything.  It is amazing that he could produce a 33 page booklet but not a Bill.  Even though the Opposition has limited resources, Fianna Fáil introduced this Bill in the Dáil to provide a legal framework to ensure the universality of access to major sporting and cultural events and to restrict the monopolisation of events by minority paid channels.  Given that our Bill is ready long before the Minister's, we are asking the Government to support our legislation.</P>
    <P>On the detail of the Minister's proposals, his plan for a broadcasting super authority is opposed by Fianna Fáil as such an authority will only confuse the demarcation between public service broadcasting and the independent commercial sector.  The Minister's failure to consult RTE on these proposals is disturbing and reflects his attitude to office and his desire to impose rather than to discuss.</P>
    <P>Ireland is very much the exception in taking action on the protection of sporting events.  Many other countries have already attended or are attending to the problem, namely, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Britain, Australia, Spain, Italy, Germany, Finland, the USA, Austria and Denmark.  Ireland must follow suit and our Bill is designed to address the lack of activity so far. Fianna Fáil does not want millions of Irish people to be disappointed when they cannot see a major event because they do not have the gadgetry or the resources.  There has been much talk about listed buildings which was discussed during Question Time today.  Yet major sporting events are equally important to our culture and deserve protection. I hope that will be recognised by those sitting opposite.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in the Bill is close to the hearts and minds of our citizens.  People cherish sporting events, especially the Grand National, the Derby, Cheltenham, the All-Ireland hurling and football finals, the Tour de France, rugby and soccer internationals, big boxing matches and athletic finals.  The Eurovision, especially the voting section, is keenly viewed by our people, especially given our level of success.  The people expect to be able to see these events on terrestrial television, without having to pay a dividend to Rupert Murdoch's companies.  We envisage all these events on our hit list for protection.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as its long Title suggests, has a simple objective, namely to protect access by the public to the televising in this State of events, whether sporting or not, which are deemed to be of national and cultural importance or of value to the country's heritage.  In its approach, the Bill complements the recent attempts by the European Commission and its audio-visual affairs Commissioner to ensure, by way of proposed regulations and amendments to the television <i>sans frontieres</i> Directive, the free televising of major sporting events to the public of the European Union.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> In a country such as Ireland, where sport represents an integral part of cultural and leisure activities, Fianna Fáil, through this Bill, is attempting to ensure that certain designated events, which are deemed to be of central importance to the nation's culture, will be available without additional charge to the Irish television public.  Under the terms of the Bill, events to be free to the general public for television reception will be designated by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> Fianna Fáil envisages the events to be designated to include the all-Ireland football and hurling finals, rugby and soccer internationals, athletics finals, major boxing matches, the Grand National, the Derby, the Eurovision Song Contest, Cheltenham races, the Tour de France and major golf events. The Bill provides for penalties of up to two years' imprisonment, a five-year ban on television contracts and fines for those found guilty of offences under the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 1 sets out the definitions in the Bill. &ldquo;Free&rdquo; is defined in the Bill as without an additional charge or cost other than those charges or costs which relate to the regulation of licences made under the wireless telegraphy Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for a commencement date to be set by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Section 3 gives power to the Minister to designate events that should be available free to the general public for reception within the State.  The designation will be made through <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and, before making the order, the Minister shall consult with the person from whom the rights to televise an event may be acquired, the RTE Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  The Minister could also invite submissions from the public on the events that should be designated.</P>
    <P>Section 4 defines the type of events that will be protected.  These include sporting, cultural or heritage events of national importance.</P>
    <P>Section 5 prohibits any contract that grants exclusive rights to a designated event.  It also provides that contracts will be revoked if the Bill is infringed.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for penalties, including imprisonment, fines and bans on entering contracts in connection with the televising of any event.  The penalties are similar to those in the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>Section 7 gives the short Title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is worth accepting for a number of reasons, not least the fact that it was drafted with considerable legal advice.  I heard before I came into the House that the Minister is prepared to accept the Bill and I thank him.  In accepting the Bill, the Minister has recognised that such legislation is both necessary and urgent.</P>
    <P>I hope we will be able at least to protect the televising of sporting events with this Bill despite the fact that the Broadcasting Bill, the heads of which have been published, is still at the drafting stage.  The full text of the Minister's proposed <Col N="291" /> broadcasting Bill is not expected for up to six months but this issue needs to be addressed urgently.  That is why I, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, have introduced this Bill.  In accepting this Bill, I hope the Minister recognises the urgent need for it.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister, with all the expertise available to him, did not see fit to introduce such legislation in the broader context of broadcasting or on the specific issue of the protection of certain cultural and sporting events because Fianna Fáil believe that major sporting events should be recognised as part of Ireland's cultural heritage and that legislation should be forthcoming.  That is why we believe that a separate Bill brings about clarity of purpose in this regard.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary to ensure the State's commitment to the true nature and values of public service broadcasting.  It is a simple yet decisive Bill, essentially predicated on the principle of proportionality, the protection of the public interest and the urgent need of the common good.</P>
    <P>The current Minister has made a myriad of promises and delivered nothing in terms of broadcasting legislation.  This Bill, however, delivers to the Irish people a commitment to protect those designated events which are deemed by the Minister of the day to be of significance to the culture and heritage of the State.  Therefore, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy de Valera on introducing the Bill and I am delighted the Government has decided to accept it.  It is a Bill of major importance.  There is much talk of citizens' rights, the common good, ordinary people, the less well-off and poverty.  Access to sporting events has always been available to everybody as long as they could afford a television and a television licence.  One of the great developments of the modern era has been the availability of major <Col N="292" /> televised sporting events on television and the pleasure that has given particularly to those who have been housebound and unable to attend events.  If we were to stand back and allow any further incursion by television into this sphere, we would be depriving ordinary people, many of whom have limited means, of much enjoyment and entertainment.  Therefore, this Bill is about the common good.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy de Valera on the way she has approached this problem as it could have raised difficulties under Community competition law.  She has addressed this in a way which not only gets over that difficulty but is in line with the direction the European Union is taking.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned at the extent to which commercial forces can change or influence sporting and other activities than may be apparent at first glance.  For example, within a few years, a radical, fundamental change has been wrought in the ethos of Rugby Union, largely influenced by enormous investment in television.  I am convinced that many Irish people regret that inexorable, speedy change of direction leading to an overall loss of control.</P>
    <P>Two great national sports attract huge audiences and will attract even greater international audiences since they are action-filled, spectacular sports from a television point of view.  Nobody would wish to see the manner in which those sports are organised changed fundamentally, to an extent that players or administrators would lose control over their direction.  I have always favoured a relatively liberal view in terms of compensating players, in terms of travel and limited rewards, and I have lobbied continuously for the provision of facilities for sports people.  The Gaelic Athletic Association, like every other sporting body, will encounter radical changes in ensuing years.  Nonetheless I hope that its membership will retain autonomy in the implementation of any change.  Finance-backed television takes away that control, and vests it in various television companies.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for any sporting organisation to resist an unbeatable offer.  An organisation like the GAA, with such a huge amateur ethos, would find it very difficult to refuse, bearing in mind that the money would provide for extra facilities, pitches, stadia and support for its players.  Were it to accept such an offer it would undoubtedly lose control.  The large promoters would be interested only in big events and the manner in which the organisation is run would be totally altered. While change will inevitably take place, control must remain with the parent organisations.</P>
    <P>This Bill has wider, far reaching consequences than control of television broadcasting.  Its provisions safeguard a way of life, access for ordinary people, organisations' rights, ensuring that the benefits that accrue from televising sports are made available to as wide an audience as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> If the pay channels are allowed to siphon-off large events, Irish spectators will exert ever more pressure on RTE and Teilifís na Gaeilge to broadcast league, and county finals.  However if those channels do not have access to big events, they will be unable to support smaller, less significant ones.</P>
    <P>All of us would welcome greater television access to Irish sporting events.  I have argued consistently that one of the greatest mistakes of the GAA in the past decade was that up to a couple of years ago, it did not allow the live television coverage of major provincial matches in the course of the All-Ireland series.  That association always argued that such coverage would harm club matches whereas I always argued the opposite.  Now that it has witnessed the huge interest in such events, particularly among the young wrought by extra broadcasting, it recognises the need for additional coverage, the day being long passed when it would refuse access to or television rights to television companies to broadcast its matches.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, we shall look to those organisations to make more of these matches available to viewers nationwide but if we allow cherry picking of those events by international companies and ignore not so attractive events, it will not be to the advantage of the majority of our people.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé ag an tús is Bille tábhachtach é seo ar go leor bealaí.  Tá tábhacht leis mar deineann sé cosaint ar mhionlaigh, ar na rudaí nach mbéadh éileamh orthu chomh maith leis na rudaí a bhfuil éileamh an-mhór orthu.  Déanann sé cinnte go mbeadh ceart agus cosaint éigin ag an dream atá sásta chuile cineál imeachta taobh istigh den tír seo a chur ar fáil.  Ba chontúirt an-mhór é dá mbeadh deis ag na comhlachtaí móra rogha a dhéanamh ar na h-imeachtaí a thógfaidís agus go bhfágfaidís na rudaí nach mbeadh an oiread sin tarraingt orthu faoi na comhlachtaí náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>Tá an-saibhreas imeachtaí ar siúl sa tír seo.  Tá saibhreas do-chreite spóirt do thír chomh beag léi.  Tá fóirne maíthe idirnáisiúnta againn i réimse mór leathan spóirt idir rugbaí, soccer, cursaí capall agus mar sin de.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the important issues to which this Bill refers.  I and the Government have a great deal of sympathy with its broad objectives.  In this Bill Deputy de Valera is attempting to address one of the many issues confronting broadcasters in an increasingly <Col N="294" /> complex technological and entirely changed regulatory environment.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have operated an open skies policy <i>vis-á-vis</i> reception of television broadcasts from other countries, resulting in Irish viewers having the benefits of a national public service television station and, to some extent, of United Kingdom broadcasting with the same public service tradition offering what was and is still regarded by many as the best television programmes in the world.</P>
    <P>Viewers throughout Ireland have had access to programming provided by a range of broadcasters operating in the public service mould. Within that tradition broadcasters have sought to deliver a diversity of quality programming catering for minority and mainstream tastes, have sought to inform and educate public opinion, and have clear roots in the communities they serve and clear statutory responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In the 1980s the possibility emerged of providing broadcasting services by satellite, initially for delivery to cable systems, and very speedily thereafter direct to homes via satellite dishes.  Countries moved to deregulate broadcasting as the capacity provided by satellites lifted the constraints on the radio frequency spectrum in relation to the establishment of terrestrial broadcasting. Unfortunately, with deregulation, most of the satellite broadcasting services now delivered are purely commercial with no other motive than to maximise returns to investors.  We are now faced with an explosion of services through the potential of the application of digital broadcasting, often referred to as the next revolution.</P>
    <P>We have all seen reports of the imminent introduction of 200 or 500 channel services.  I must emphasise that &ldquo;channel&rdquo; used in this context does not mean the availability of 200 channels of the quality and diversity of RTE 1 or BBC 1. Rather we are talking about 200 opportunities to invite the general public to pay more.  We are talking about perhaps five or six so-called &ldquo;channels&rdquo; being devoted to a single football match, depending on how much one has decided to pay, or a host of niche channels offering very little in terms of diversity of services, such as shopping channels, which hardly fit into the concept of a television programme as understood by most people.</P>
    <P>I have yet to be convinced that the increased capacity brought about by satellite or the promised explosion of channels through digital compression will necessarily improve access to or increase the quality or diversity of programmes available to viewers in Ireland.  On the contrary, put simply, there will be more choice to see more of the same.</P>
    <P>The coverage of significant sporting events, while always an important part of television schedules, is just one of a number of broadcasting policy concerns which face us as we move towards the next century.  The concern underlying the Bill is not confined to sport.  The reality is this is happening in other areas with the exclusive acquisition <Col N="295" /> of film libraries and programme archives by the operators of subscription and pay-per-view services.  It would not be unreasonable to say that the assumption of a monopoly power in this area would be rather like securing the position of gate keeper to a form of communication.</P>
    <P>It will be obvious to Deputies that as the capacity for delivering different broadcasting services becomes almost infinite by today's terms and as the capital cost of providing that capacity is reduced, the competition for programme material of mass appeal is set to become more intense.  Many of those competing for audience share are entirely commercial operations without any shred of public service ethos.  Popular programming is seen by such organisations as something to be bought, protected and sold at a premium.</P>
    <P>Sport always has been an integral part of public service broadcasters' schedules.  It is a prime example of popular public service broadcasting. The coverage of hurling and football matches is, for many, a part of our broadcasting heritage.  The vast majority of viewers and listeners would feel an incalculable loss if they did not have access through our national broadcasting services to live coverage of the All-Ireland finals on television and radio.  There are important international competitions where the exploits of the teams and individuals representing Ireland are shared by substantial numbers through live coverage of the events on national television.  For many it would be unthinkable if coverage of such events was not freely available, or more accurately for the price of a television licence, on our national broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the complexity of this issue, Deputy de Valera, with whom I agree, referred to the importance of premiership soccer, the Steve Collins boxing title defence and the Ryder Cup. The legislation as drafted &mdash; I say this positively &mdash; would not cover any of the three events because premiership soccer is not an Irish event, the Steve Collins boxing title defence was not organised by an Irish body and the Ryder Cup is an international event.  I say this, not to score a point but because in making legislation work in this area one is facing challenges that are driven by the fact that the speed of technology has outstripped the regulatory speed in legislation as drafted previously under terrestrial conditions. That is why in my proposals for broadcasting legislation which have been cleared by Government and published in the document &ldquo;Clear Focus&rdquo;, the Government's proposals for broadcasting legislation, I have sought to strengthen and enhance the position of public service broadcasting and the broadcasting structures for this country into the next century.  In dealing with the specific issue of sports or special event coverage we must ensure, in order to give such attempts meaning and context, the ethos and values of public service broadcasting are safeguarded and restated.  In the context of the general shift <Col N="296" /> towards a consumer model of broadcasting, the value of public communication as a public good needs to be retained and reconciled with the increasing pressures that seek to treat it merely as a commodity.</P>
    <P>One approaches broadcasting legislation from entirely different perspectives.  On the one hand, one is speaking of potential pools of consumers of product within the entertainment industry and, on the other, the rights of citizens to communicate in conditions of increasingly rapid and complex technological change.  It is not a cliché to say &mdash; I do not think there is disagreement on it &mdash; we are left with the choice of being consumers of services or citizens in a communication order.  We have to try to see the relative levels of urgency and how to approach them.  The idea behind &ldquo;Clear Focus&rdquo; was that when we use the term &ldquo;public service broadcasting&rdquo; we speak about a broadcaster and a service carrying that full range to which I have referred rather than aspects of public service which are diffused in different systems.</P>
    <P>We all accept we will be living with a mixed model in the future.  Commercial services are here to stay.  Their task is to deliver the highest audience for the lowest price.  They have no concerns about equality of access nor have they stated that was their purpose for coming into existence or enhancing their power.  They offer one choice &mdash; to pay or not to pay.  One of the fundamental principles of the public service broadcasting ethos is universal access to transmissions.  It is through the retaining of this and other values we can ensure equality of access to quality and diversity of programming.  In this context I propose to introduce measures designed to ensure that the rights to broadcast coverage of major sporting and other events do not become the exclusive right of subscription or pay-per-view services but are available to all.  I propose the Minister of the day will be empowered, after consultation with the Minister for Education who has responsibility for sport, to designate certain events as part of cultural heritage and of national importance. Deputy de Valera's Bill would give the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht an extraordinary power, for which I would be criticised if I had aspirations to it.</P>
    <P>As with the European model under discussion, my proposals deal mainly with the activities of broadcasters as they are proposals for broadcasting legislation, which is where my emphasis lies, rather than the rights or operations of sporting organisations.  The process of arranging the television coverage will have to be licensed in advance by the Irish Broadcasting Commission which will be established under the proposals. The example quoted by Deputy de Valera referred to an equivalent commission in the jurisdictions from which they had research.  The commission to which I refer would have the power to place conditions on the licence requiring that the rights to broadcast the event must be made available <Col N="297" /> to a non-subscription, generally available television service or a free to air service.</P>
    <P>As well as placing moves to protect access to major events in a national context, it is important to create and work within a European context. When I first started to attend meetings of the EU Council of Ministers with responsibility for broadcasting policy, I was virtually a lone voice in my support of the concept of public service broadcasting.  People spoke about its days being numbered and it was referred to as an old fashioned concept.  The commercial services were in vogue and regarded as the flavour of the period. In the intervening years, many of my ministerial colleagues in other countries have expressed grave concern at the effect of the so called &ldquo;de-regulation&rdquo; of broadcasting on their public service broadcasters and the quality and diversity of television programming available to their citizens.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of Ministers which I chaired in Galway last September, there was considerable and strong support for the maintenance of the concept of public service broadcasting.  There was also a clear message that public service broadcasters must continue to have access to major popular programmes comprising, in particular, sports events and that pure commercialism cannot be the criterion.  I have today returned from an informal meeting of Ministers in Maastricht where these issues were debated and discussed further.  Broad support for the strengthening of the concept of public service broadcasting is increasing.  Following meetings this afternoon in preparation for the technical response to the concerns of the European Parliament, I hope to see great advances in respect of these matters being brought to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>The specific issue of access to television coverage of major sporting events is also being addressed in Europe through a proposed amendment to the television without frontiers Directive. Following an amendment, agreed unanimously by the European Parliament on the question of the exercise by broadcasters of exclusive rights to broadcast coverage of major sporting events, which I introduced for discussion by Ministers with responsibility for broadcasting policy at our meeting in Galway last September, there was a response from the European Parliament which is being followed through.  As late as today we were looking at the conclusion which is quite likely in European terms.</P>
    <P>The issue is being addressed urgently and comprehensively at European level.  The likely outcome of the European debate may be if particular events are designated at national level as being of such importance that it must be possible for viewers to follow them <i>via</i> live coverage on unencrypted, universally available television services, such designations must be recognised and reciprocated by broadcasters and national authorities in other member states.  Without international co-operation &mdash; this is an important dimension &mdash; it would be possible, regardless of <Col N="298" /> national regulations, for a broadcaster operating outside this jurisdiction to simply ignore such regulations.  This results from the gap between the regulatory environment, the jurisprudence behind legal measures and technological capacity, in terms of its commercialisation and changed ownership structure.</P>
    <P>The objective of the amendment by the European Parliament was to ensure that the viewing public would continue to have access to major sporting events live on universally accessible television services.  The Council of Ministers which took place last December during the Irish Presidency endorsed the objectives of the amendment in principle.  Work has continued at Council working group level to devise an acceptable wording which will effectively meet the objectives of the Parliament.  I instructed my officials to urge that the strongest line possible is taken at these discussions.  The European Commission met on 5 February 1997 and adopted a position which focuses on the exercise rather than on the acquisition of exclusive rights, with a view to safeguarding the public's right of access to the transmission of events of major importance for society.  The emphasis is falling on the exercise of the right to broadcast as opposed to focusing of acquiring rights to the sporting event.  The Commission will promote this approach in negotiations with the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the revision of the Television without Frontiers Directive is subject to the co-decision procedure.  It will be necessary for the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers to agree on the nature of any revision to the directive.  It seems at this stage that all parties are agreed on the objective and I hope conciliation procedure will lead to a successful revision of the directive on this topic in particular. When the directive is finalised, it will be a matter of transposing it quickly into national law.</P>
    <P>Deputies will conclude from my contribution that I have considerable sympathy for the broad objectives of the Bill and the Government is not opposing it.  From a legislative point of view, it is much better to agree that it is a matter upon which we share concern.  Therefore, our differences are of a methodological nature rather than of principle.  For that reason, I advised the Government of my intention to accept the principle of the issue to be addressed and we do not intend to oppose the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera's Bill addresses issues of significant importance and it should receive the detailed examination which can be provided on Committee Stage.  However, I have serious misgivings about the methodology in the Bill and the attempt to deal with the issue out of context.  My proposals are designed to address the question of broadcast coverage of sporting events in the context of establishing new structures for broadcasting into the future and within a European context. There is a danger in singling out one, admittedly urgent, topic and stretching it to the <Col N="299" /> point at which it must be treated separately and, in doing so, stitching it on to an already out-moded structure.  One should not pretend that this is a simple matter.  There are complex issues involving ownership, the rights of sporting organisations and competitors, competition, the rights of broadcasters and those of the viewing public as citizens rather than consumers.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill owe much to the United Kingdom Broadcasting Act, 1996, to which, with the Australian example, Deputy de Valera referred.  I acknowledge that the Deputy's approach has the advantage of simplicity. However, I am not convinced that the constitutional, legal and broadcasting environments are the same here as in the United Kingdom.  I have reservations about the practicability of the UK model in an Irish context.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom Broadcasting Act, 1996, which was referred to, is designed to deal with a situation where there is an abundance of broadcasters, both of the free reception and the subscription and pay-per-view variety.  The Broadcasting Act, 1996, defines two distinct categories of broadcasters.  One category includes free services such as those supplied by the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV, while the other includes all other services including subscription and pay-per-view services. The Act requires that any contract for televising live coverage of an event listed under the Act, which is entered into by a broadcaster, must state that the rights are available for showing the event on a service falling within only one of the two categories.  This means that a separate contract must exist for each category of broadcaster. A broadcaster providing a service in either category &mdash; including a broadcaster offering free reception &mdash; is prohibited from showing exclusively live coverage of the whole or any part of a listed event without the previous consent of the Independent Television Commission, unless a broadcaster in the other category has acquired the right to show live coverage of the event or the same part of the event.  I refer to the British legislation, the distinction between the multiplicity of players in that environment and the two categories identified in the 1996 legislation.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the UK Act, the Independent Television Commission is required to draw up a code giving guidance on the coverage of sporting and other events of national interest which are listed under the Act.  The code covers a number of areas, such as the nature of any invitation to express interest in televising an event; the process of negotiation; the nature of the package of rights &mdash; live coverage, highlights, delayed transmissions etc. &mdash; which are on offer and a requirement that the package on offer must not be more attractive to one category of broadcaster than another &mdash; this involves the requirement to which I referred to go to both sides of the house even though it might have different roof profiles; the conditions of, or costs attached, to the acquisition of rights; the fairness of the price sought for <Col N="300" /> rights and a host of other matters associated with the purchase of broadcast coverage rights. Account is also taken of the possibility of exclusive coverage of an event by a broadcaster in either category where there is no interest on the part of one category of broadcaster or where a broadcaster does not respond with a fair and reasonable offer.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt to some extent on the provisions of the United Kingdom Broadcasting Act, 1996, to illustrate two points.  In the first instance, the 1996 Act acknowledges the complexity and variety of issues associated with the acquisition of broadcast coverage rights.  If these issues are not dealt with in their entirety in legislation, there is a danger that any such legislation will be at best simply unworkable and at worst leave broadcasters and sports organisations in an impossible situation of uncertainty.  Second, apart from the different constitutional and legal environment, the Act illustrates the fundamental differences in both the broadcasting environment and the statutory structure in relation to broadcasting in the UK. This brings me back to my earlier point regarding the need, as I have proposed, to deal with this issue in the context of a fundamental revision of broadcasting structures so that any legislative steps taken will operate within a secure and workable context and stand the test of time.</P>
    <P>This Bill takes a direct approach.  It indicates to sporting and other event organisers that the public wants the major events; it expects that they will continue to be organised and it expects that RTE, as the only television broadcaster based in the State, must be allowed to transmit these events live without any guarantee of compensation if they are to be televised.  Offences and severe penalties are created for those who do not adhere to these provisions.</P>
    <P>It is not always easy to interpret the legal language of a Bill but I am concerned at the wording of section 5 (1) which seems to make a contract with RTE void unless it is offered to another person who provides television without charge for reception.  As no other such broadcaster exists at present, does this mean that if the Bill was brought into force today RTE could no longer enter the same contracts with, for example, the GAA or the IRFU?  This may simply be a question of drafting and no doubt Deputy de Valera will deal with the point when she responds to the debate.  I would be interested to learn if she has received any advice on the constitutional and other legal issues raised by her proposals.</P>
    <P>We owe a debt to the many people who organise sporting and other events from children's young persons' and senior competitions and leagues at the grass roots level to the most important and fashionable national and international events.  I have tried to respond to the Bill by concentrating on the positive agenda which we might adopt as we legislate in this area.  In the context of sport, for example, it is interesting to think of the distinction between those who focus on the <Col N="301" /> glamour events yet who turn their eyes away from the children's events which people organise voluntarily, often not supported sufficiently by parents. Sport is part of the lives of these people and comes from the community.  If people are interested in sport and their curiosity is encouraged it is part of their citizenship to expect to be able to have access to the culminating high points of the sports code in question.</P>
    <P>This issue is inextricably linked with the version of broadcasting which we wish to prevail in the future and the future of public service broadcasting. If there is an emerging consensus, which I hope is the case, that the future of broadcasting here and in Europe will be driven by citizenship rather than our future role as consumers, I welcome it whichever Government caries out the negotiations nationally or internationally.  I introduced many of the issues in this debate with the Green Paper on broadcasting and in the heads of legislation.  Internationally, the debate in parliaments, the response of jurisprudence and the future forms of possible or necessary regulation have lagged behind the changes in the concentration of ownership, the convergence of technologies and the international delivery of increasingly complex technological systems.</P>
    <P>The voluntary efforts of those who hold office in sporting and other organisations are the inheritors of a proud tradition of selfless and unpaid services to communities, participants and the public.  I am often moved by those who make the case, rightly, that for many people this may be all they have.  This is an opportunity to break many different forms of cycles of deprivation. Apart from that, the idea that a component of one's life should be defined entirely in commercial terms is not acceptable.  The issue is how to make certain we will have a system in place that can assure the future of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I hope people will share my view of Deputy de Valera's Bill as an important contribution to the debate on the serious issue of broadcasting coverage of major events rather than simply a threat because of the provisions of sections 5 and 6.  Her optimism allows her to say that her proposals will be seen as an invitation whereas if I made a fraction of the suggestions she makes to the sporting organisations it would be seen as a big stick, so to speak.  However, so be it.  The important thing is to do what is required, to do it well and in as certain and contextual an environment as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government will not oppose the Bill because Deputy de Valera's approach deserves the in depth consideration which it can be given on Committee Stage.  I look forward to the issues I have raised being thrashed out at that stage.</P>

      <P>I commend Deputy de Valera for the time and effort she has expended in bringing this important Bill before the House.  It is a significant achievement for any Deputy to produce such an in-depth Bill.  She deserves our thanks for the depth of research and analysis <Col N="302" /> which went into its production.  I thank the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for his generosity.  I would not have expected less from him because generosity has been a hallmark of his ministry.  I am sure I express my party's appreciation that he has taken a positive and realistic view of Deputy de Valera's proposals.  I commend him on his attitude.</P>
      <P>It is important that we take account of the fundamental importance of the Bill.  The present situation is nothing short of an outrage.  It is awful that an gnáth duine cannot access coverage of some of the most important national, European and world sporting events because of the need to pay a &ldquo;fat cat&rdquo; media baron who sits on a pile of gold in a remote part of the world and dictates the events that people may see on the basis of greed rather than the needs of the individuals who wish to view the events.  It is wrong that people are excluded because of the power and exclusive ownership of a particular medium.  My party strongly opposes this greed philosophy.  I am glad the Minister agrees with us.  This is deeply appreciated and I would expect nothing less from him.</P>
      <P>It is almost impossible to explain to my children and young people and Members of the House who were not born when people like myself were first elected, the Acting Chairman included, that there was a time when television did not exist.  Golden oldies like myself can remember the days when people listened attentively in the sittingroom, or drawingroom as it was then called, to the commentary on the wireless by the great Micheál Ó Hehir on the Sunday game between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.  It was an extraordinary occasion and it is difficult to contemplate that it happened, given the technological advances in the communications sector.  We gleaned information from the wireless and newspapers.</P>
      <P>Before the birth of RTE, those who lived north of a line from Sligo to Dublin enjoyed free access to BBC and Ulster Television broadcasts.  Those who were affluent and could afford the cost of a television set could switch on and enjoy whatever was broadcast.  Following the advent of RTE, those who owned television sets were suddenly charged a licence fee which gave them the right to view anything that was broadcast.  More channels appeared in the following years, the latest being Teilifís na Gaeilge which has my strong support. I commend the Minister for holding his nerve in the face of outrageous criticism from certain sections of the media to which he is entitled to respond.  Teilifís na Gaeilge is populated by people with the strongest of ideals and it is unfortunate that it has not been given an opportunity to get off the ground.  It was almost as if an attempt was being made to kill the baby at birth, but sanity and good sense prevailed.  Radio na Gaeltachta, after 25 years, is an outstanding success and I believe Teilifís na Gaeilge will achieve the same level of success once it is given an opportunity to resolve its teething problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> Developments in technology, including satellite relays and soon to embody digital transmission technology, have allowed access to hundreds of television stations to anyone with the technological wherewithal to receive them.  However, they come at a price.  There was a time when a broadcasting company transmitted all of its programming on one or two channels but we have now reached the stage where specialised channels, for example, sports, movie, history and news channels, have altered the fundamental character of broadcasting.  Cable television has allowed access to a greater variety of television channels to many more viewers for a weekly or monthly fee.</P>
    <P>The rights for many events of major interest are being &ldquo;bought up&rdquo; by multinational broadcasting agencies.  Anyone who wishes to see these events must first subscribe to the cable service. All but a handful of live sporting events have been removed from ordinary television channels to specialist satellite channels.  We will soon be left with minority events of minimal interest available free of charge.</P>
    <P>Some sporting events, in particular boxing matches, have been hived off into a sector known as pay-per-view television.  Sky Television has attempted to hoover up the Five Nations rugby matches.  Given the vast sums invested in sponsorship of major events of this nature and the increased demand for access to these events, the moguls of the broadcasting industry are ready to spend whatever it takes to control who can watch what and at what price.  Once they gain control they can dictate the fee to be charged.</P>
    <P>Let me give a simple example.  If Sky Television is allowed to buy the rights for the five classic horse races, all four home international rugby matches, the all-Ireland hurling and football semi-finals and finals, the four major golf tournaments and the Wimbeldon tennis championships and decides to broadcast these events on a pay-per-view basis, how much will it cost to view them?</P>
    <P>The viewer has to pay for their television set, say, £500; their television licence, £63; their satellite dish or decoder, say £200, and an annual subscription to the cable company, say £300.  The indications are that a fee in the region of £10 will be charged for pay-per-view events.  Talking this as an average and assuming that a viewer wishes to view all of the sporting events mentioned, he or she will need to come up with an additional £200 per annum.  Assuming that a television set will last for five years and excluding the cost of electricity, the annual cost will be almost £700.  A television set will soon become an expensive item. This takes no account of whether it is proper that market forces or, to put it another way, the power of money should be allowed to control what people can see on television.  Pay-per-view television is tantamount to censorship on economic grounds.  Many people can barely afford the cost of a television licence and the imposition of additional and punitive charges for viewing major <Col N="304" /> national and international events would be iniquitous.</P>
    <P>We have no control, unfortunately, over events which take place outside the country.  This means that Sky Television can and does exercise control over access to many events which used to be available free of charge.  This appears to have become acceptable in some countries, including the United States, yet I am not convinced that it is acceptable or proper that we should become hostages to Rupert Murdoch or his ilk, the so-called media fat cats.</P>
    <P>While the availability of more channels should allow greater viewer discretion, the effect will be to restrict viewers of a basic television service, those who do not have access to a cable service, satellite dish or are located in a multi-channel viewing region, to programmes or events which the multinational broadcasting corporations deem unworthy to buy.  This can hardly be right and would not be in the interest of viewers or the national interest.</P>
    <P>For the reasons outlined, I commend the Bill to the House.  It is unfair that people should be expected to pay more to watch a sporting event on television.  One has a basic right to watch whatever is available at a particular time.  The cost of viewing has increased following the advent of cable television which, to a certain extent, can be justified given the increased availability of television channels.  What cannot be justified, however, are the attempts to lure people into subscribing to a cable service on the basis they will have greater access to more channels and then, by a trick of the loop, close off access to the most popular events.  This is tantamount to fraud and blackmail.  It is a form of three card trickery &mdash;&ldquo;now you see it, now you don't&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Legislature has a duty to ensure public policy reflects the public good.  Fianna Fáil and the Minister are of the view that the Legislature must act quickly and decisively to fill what is a dangerous gap in the law.  This is where Deputy de Valera's Bill comes into play.  At present money can dictate what events are seen on television.  That is the law.  This legislation will limit the freedom of an individual to buy or sell the right to broadcast events of significant public interest or importance.  As a limitation on the freedom of the individual, this must be justifiable on the grounds of public policy, must not be exercised capriciously or arbitrarily and must not be used excessively.  This Bill provides for such controls.</P>
    <P>For this or any other legislative power to be effective it must be enforceable.  The Bill proposes a system of enforcement which would effectively punish any person or organisation who breaches its provisions.  It may be argued that the stakes are so high in the broadcasting business that the level of punishment or penalty should be higher than that proposed.  This matter can be discussed further on Committee Stage and if this is the wish of the House then I retain an open mind on this aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> The Bill accords with similar measures introduced in Britain, France and Australia.  It will not contravene any domestic or European legislation and, more importantly, will come into operation immediately and will not, as the Government proposes, be deferred until after the general election. I am not sure if this is the Minister's intention but if the general election intervenes then the Bill will automatically fall and will have to be introduced <i>de novo</i> by the next Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Government's inactivity in this area has been disappointing.  The Minister refused to introduce proposals to nip this issue in the bud but now proposes to put the matter in order by accepting this very worthy Bill introduced by Deputy de Valera.  He supports the Bill and I ask him to give legislative effect to our fundamentally important proposals.  Deputy de Valera has effectively done the job the Government failed to do. Members of the Government are perhaps more concerned with their imminent trial before the electorate.  However, to be honest, this is a matter about which we are all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government has the power to ensure that major cultural and sporting events remain accessible to all who wish to view them without the additional penalty of &ldquo;pay per view&rdquo;.  I hope major events such as the FAI Cup Final and All Ireland Final remain available to those who wish to watch them from Caherciveen to Clogher Head without any additional viewing fees or charges.</P>
    <P>I like to think that I am still a sporty person even at my advanced stage of decay.  I have been a sports fan all my life and last Sunday I attended a very important league match between my team, UCD, and Everton-Homefarm in Whitehall. Thankfully UCD won the match on a score to three goals to two.  The last time I visited this club was when I played in the Dublin school boys soccer league.  Clubs like Home Farm&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This also applies to rugby and boxing.  I have very strong views on boxing and the annual championships which are held in the Stadium are a must for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While many citizens can attend major sporting events other people are less privileged and depend on television to see them.  It is too bad if this service is provided by foreign broadcasters but that is the way of the modern television network. These broadcasts should be available to the poorest of the poor free of charge.  It is very important for the well-being of the nation that the public can watch Michelle Smith and other great athletes in action.  I am not sure if we had <Col N="306" /> television coverage of Ronnie Delaney's 1,500 yard race in Melbourne in 1956 but we have seen films of it.  It is very important that these events can be seen by those who can least afford to pay for their television sets and licences.</P>
    <P>I respectfully submit that this is what Deputy de Valera's Bill is all about.  She is to be highly commended and congratulated on this.  It is vital that we retain control of the broadcasting of events which are important both culturally and popularly to the public.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and compliment Deputy de Valera on introducing this Bill.  The protection of access for viewers to the televising on generally available services of major sporting and cultural events is one of the most important issues from the point of view of broadcasting policy.  The growth in broadcasting capacity brought about by technological change has led to increased competition for popular programming. Competition in this case has led to spiralling costs.  As even the most casual television viewer knows, quality television programming with mass appeal can be very difficult to find.  Sport, with its capacity to fire the imagination of a community or country, presents a major opportunity for broadcasters, particularly for those with no other motivation than the generation of profits.  Rupert Murdoch described sport as the battering ram for the establishment of his &ldquo;pay per view&rdquo; services.</P>
      <P>There is justifiable concern at national and European level that major sporting events which have an attraction and value far beyond that of the committed sports fan may disappear from the screens of traditional broadcasters who provide their services for free and be swallowed up by subscription or &ldquo;pay per view&rdquo; services and thus be available only to those who can afford to pay for the necessary receiving equipment and the ongoing fees.  Accordingly, I am happy the Government will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage.  This will give us the opportunity on Committee Stage to examine in detail the approach suggested by Deputy de Valera.</P>

I referred to the &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor and the results of a recent <Col N="307" /> survey which shows that 53 per cent of the public is very happy with the Government's performance. That makes it difficult for the Opposition parties who must come up with imaginary grievances against the Government when everybody knows it is doing a good job.

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> We would all like to have taxation at a minus level but, unfortunately, the country must be run.  Calling for low rates of taxation would be a good mantra if money was not needed to run hospitals, schools, etc., but it wears a bit thin when it is constantly repeated.  That is the case also in regard to the honesty of one particular party.  We all have our own sense of pride and I would like to think I am as honest as anyone in the Progressive Democrats. If I make a wrong statement, there is little point in pretending my honesty compelled me to make it.</P>
      <P>I welcome that three sections of the Bill deal with education.  Section 6 relates to tax relief for third level fees for undergraduates and confirms that fees paid for qualifying part-time third level courses by non-earning spouses can be set against the earning spouse's taxable income.  It also helps those doing Open University courses.  The Minister is to be complimented on that because people who spend money on education while working deserve a break.</P>
      <P>Section 9 closes off a loophole whereby wise accountants could present scholarships as a type of part payment for tax relief purposes.  Section 14 allows tax relief on certain corporate and personal donations of £1,000 per month to publicly funded third level institutions.  It is important that donations to third level institutions are encouraged.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of up to £5,000 for alarms, public liability insurance and restoration of approved art contents in houses of heritage. That is important because if we are to encourage people to open their houses to the public they must be given money towards the cost of installing an alarm.</P>

      <Col N="308" /> I welcome the allowances to cover the cost of expenditure incurred in farm pollution control. We cannot expect farmers to keep the countryside 100 per cent pollution free without giving them grants for pollution control.  I welcome also the continuation of farm stock relief.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that some people believe farmers are always complaining, but it must be acknowledged that those currently involved in beef fattening, for example, where prices have dropped to 78p in the pound, have reason to complain. Those farmers must be supported because they contribute a great deal to the economy.  If beef farmers are put out of business it will have an adverse effect down the line, particularly on local businesses if people do not have money to spend.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will be in a position to come to their rescue and that any money given will not be seen as buying votes.  It is unfortunate that grants have to be given to certain people in an election year because the cynics will say it is an attempt to buy votes.</P>

      <P>I welcome the curb on the illegal sale of cigarettes on the streets of Dublin.  It is ridiculous that these people can be filmed illegally selling tobacco on our streets.  Apart from the loss of revenue, this is an example of people openly breaking the law.  I am glad the gardaí are moving on this and that the EU Commission has agreed to establish a high level group to study this problem which appears to be a European phenomenon of a type we could do without here.  The open defiance of those selling tobacco illegally cannot be tolerated if we expect people to have respect for the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to residentail property tax.  While I am not affected by this in Carlow &mdash; that is not to say we do not have fine houses in Carlow and Kilkenny &mdash; it is a fact that geographic location decides the value of a house.  I have always believed that RPT was an unjust tax because a person who owned a four bedroomed bungalow in Carlow or north Kildare, which is very close to Dublin, would not be in the tax bracket even though the same size bungalow in Dublin would be worth a fortune.  It is unfair to require someone to pay tax because of where that person lives.  I do not begrudge the relief given in this regard to people living in Dublin or the larger cities, no more than the people in Dublin who <Col N="309" /> were not paying water charges should begrudge those of us in the country who will benefit from their removal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance and the Government on producing this Finance Bill which gives legislative effect to the budget and the various positive changes contained therein.  In the face of such positive news I realise it is difficult for Opposition parties to welcome the Finance Bill, following the Social Welfare Bill.  I listened with some amusement to Opposition speakers earlier this afternoon.  I was particularly amused by the dilemma in which Deputy McDowell found himself when he cast a very jaundiced eye on the Bill and the performance of the Government.  He downgraded the positive elements of the Bill and attempted to accentuate what he thought were the less positive aspects.</P>
      <P>My constituency colleague, Deputy McCreevy, was much more positive in his contribution and readily gave recognition to the Bill as being positive legislation coming at a time in the country's economy when it would be easy for a Minister for Finance to lose the initiative seized by virtue of careful financial management over the past number of years.  That would have been an opportunity lost.</P>
      <P>This Finance Bill comes at a time when it would be very easy for the Government to lose the run of itself, to go overboard and bend every which way in an effort to appease every lobby that appears on the horizon during an election year.  However, it is the Opposition that has lost its nerve.  It must surely be the first time in the history of the State that an Opposition has lost its nerve in the lead-in to an election and seems to wish to jump, lemming-like, over a cliff into the unknown.  The Progressive Democrats' reaction on the question of water charges was classical&mdash; they plucked a figure out of the air which bore no relationship to cost, and which turned out to be three times what would be necessary, in an effort to massage a section of the electorate into an appropriate state of mind before the election. That represents a clear flaw in what purports to be a potential Government.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Michael McDowell suggested that the Minister for Finance and the Government might not be in office for much longer, I was immediately concerned as to the state of health of members of the Government.  Perhaps Deputy McDowell is in possession of information of which I am not aware.  He should not presume that the people have any great desire for a change of Government.  The general consensus is that the Government has taken a positive and constructive approach to the economy and to looking after the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the main Opposition party because its forthcoming marriage is on shaky ground considering the prospective partners, although still in Opposition, do not agree on basic <Col N="310" /> fundamental fiscal policies.  Obviously such items would be ironed out within the confines of Cabinet, but since the question of Cabinet confidentiality is entertaining and occupying the minds of one or both the Opposition parties at the moment, I would be somewhat apprehensive about the sounds likely to emanate from the Cabinet room given that complete agreement has not been reached on fundamental issues at this stage.</P>
    <P>This Bill is constructive and positive.  It is drawn up in such a way as to respond to the needs of the economy at this time, given that the economy is performing better than ever before.  As to Deputy McDowell's assertion that the Department of Social Welfare is anti-employment, the live register figures are the lowest in five years and are going down, and every possible effort is being made to ensure that information is being made available to the people at whom the various schemes are targeted so that they are able to access employment in a way that previously was not possible.  On the Department of Social Welfare and the numbers on the live register, particularly the number of long-term unemployed, serious reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed will come only after long-term training specifically geared to prepare the people in question to take a place in the workplace.  It has not been easy for someone who has been out of the workforce for a considerable period, man or woman, to get back into the workforce and to be successful in obtaining and holding a position. Without doubt, we are in the unique position that there are jobs available; it is a matter of tailoring employees for the jobs.  In the future we will spend more time looking at how best to ensure those who happen to become unemployed through no fault of their own are pointed as quickly as possible in the direction of the scheme or training course most likely to bring them back into the workforce at the earliest possible date. My reason for so saying is that once the term of unemployment extends beyond six months the chances of getting back into employment without serious retraining are much slimmer.  In my dealings with the public I have found that most people are well disposed towards availing of every opportunity to get back into the workforce. Given that Government Departments like the Department of Social Welfare are willing to assist them at a vulnerable time in their working lives, they will respond positively, and tax inducements, social welfare provisions and various schemes combined make it possible and attractive for the person who is unemployed to get back into the workplace.</P>
    <P>Much has been said over the years about our tax base and the alleged uncompetitiveness arising therefrom.  Some elements of the Opposition seem to suggest that major tax give-aways are the answer.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Economies that followed such a policy over the past 15 years suffered nothing but disaster.  It is of no use for the Opposition to tell the public that <Col N="311" /> pursuing a fiscal policy that allegedly puts more money in people's pockets will do anything other than create serious problems in the long-term which will have to be paid for in future.  Given their supposed political sophistication, I am amazed that serious politicians of some standing in this House seem to want to go down that road. They know these policies have been followed before and have failed miserably.  In the final analysis this Bill, having run its course, will put into effect the legislative fiscal measures that will ensure the country is run on a straight and narrow course until the end of the year and the introduction of the next budget which will be brought in somewhat earlier than in previous years to comply with new trends in Europe and elsewhere, and benefit business and the economy generally.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, on introducing this Bill in an election year, which in the past tended to accelerate the degree of generosity of Governments and which on this occasion seems to have drawn great excitement from the Opposition.  I congratulate the Government on keeping its head at a time when it would have been easy to do otherwise, and acting in the long-term interests of the economy and the people.  It is easy to propose to do something in the interests of the country, particularly in the short-term, but it is different to follow a course of action geared at ensuring the country's economic health and well-being over the longer-term.  We will have to wait to see the outcome of an event that is often talked about in this House and allow the public to make its decision on that matter.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a favourable recommendation made by the Minister for Finance to the people for their perusal.  As a result of the Bill the economy will prosper and grow.  I have no doubt that in a year's time it will be possible to carry out a similar exercise to ensure the continued economic growth of the economy.</P>

      <P>I read with great interest the speech of the Minister for Finance earlier today and was somewhat surprised he devoted only the first page of his speech to outlining the strategy behind the Government's thinking on finance, the economy, planning and development in the years ahead.  The Minister said that he will think ahead three years or five years, but he did not do that in this Bill.  Those who wish to see how devoid of strategy the legislation is should look at the first page of the Minister's speech, in which no strategic approach is outlined.  The speech states that this is the third Finance Bill the Minister has had the privilege of bringing into the House and that it will enable the Government to, for example, combat illegal tobacco sales, which is welcome, and undertake consolidation, which is long overdue. There are pre-consolidation measures in the Bill.  The Minister then turns to the various sections of the Bill.  There is no indication of a strategy or plan, no preparation for the future or <Col N="312" /> what we will do in 1999 when European Union funding decreases.  That is the weakness in the Finance Bill and in the Minister's presentation.</P>
      <P>We are currently dependent on extraordinary growth in the economy, which we are fortunate to experience, a growth that was developed by the Government's predecessors.  Everybody is aware it was the hard work of 1987-89 and 1992-94 that turned the economy around.  In 1999 the moneys from Europe will be reduced, possibly significantly, but there is no strategy to deal with that.  This budget is designed on the basis of motoring on and using up available resources, spending more while making no provision for emergencies that could arise.  In this Bill we are dependent on continuing growth.  Let us hope it continues.</P>

If there is a reduction in growth we will be in serious trouble in terms of services such as education, health and social welfare and maintaining the forces which fight daily against crime. The approach adopted by the Minister in the budget leaves us dependent on the present growth and if there is a reduction in growth of 1 or 2 per cent we are in serious trouble.  The number dependent on social welfare will increase as growth decreases and we must be in a strong position to look after those people.</P>
      <P>Similarly, if there is an increase in interest rates we are in trouble.  Many young people are buying houses at present and depend on the Government to maintain stability.  They look to this Bill for assurance that spending is under control and that the present position will be sustained.  That will be done only if, in these good times, we reduce the debt, which the Minister has made no effort to do.  In the coming years it is expected the debt will increase further, from approximately £30 billion to £32 billion, putting us at greater risk.</P>
      <P>There is no control over spending.  Control of spending does not mean a reduction in benefits to people, it means better management. The Government is responding to pressure and seeks to fix any problem that arises by allocating the necessary money. Its current behaviour is in line with the economics of a drunken sailor, and the longer we have to wait for the election the worse they will be.  The Government is on the run and the Minister for Finance failed to put down a marker to show it will stand firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy McDowell state that the Government regards PRSI as a tax. That is a serious and sad development and spells <Col N="313" /> danger for workers, pensioners and those who depend on the social insurance fund.  Unless we maintain the stability of that fund, we will face major difficulties in the future.  Some people may claim the money can be made up from taxes.  The Government's approach in the run-up to the election is to make up all deficits from taxes.  It is designing a strategy so that the benefits workers receive in future can be means-tested.  If PRSI is regarded as a tax, it cannot be claimed that workers have a right to those benefits without being means-tested.  It is amazing that the Labour Party, in particular, agrees with such a policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell is correct in claiming the logic of the Minister's approach is to regard PRSI as a tax.  It is not a tax, it is a social security insurance, to which workers have a right irrespective of what Government or Ministers for Finance or Social Welfare are in office.  However, when it is regarded as a tax that will not be the case.  That is the reality of reducing the social insurance fund from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent and regarding it as a tax.</P>
    <P>When this Government came into office the social insurance fund was in surplus and was able to offer better security and support to workers. Many more benefits could be given to workers who contribute to the fund which is currently in a deficit to the tune of £138 million and which will probably double in a full year.  Future Ministers for Finance will have to make up that £138 million from taxation.  What will happen if there is a change in growth levels?</P>
    <P>Managing the economy is like managing a big complex business.  Good business people keep their eye on the various elements so that they can achieve the correct balance in future years.  They do not allow huge deficits to accrue in any area. The Minister for Finance referred to accrual accounting.  Sophisticated accrual accounting will not be necessary if certain measures are taken. Because of increased employment and the contributions of the self-employed, there is a good flow into the social insurance fund.  According to the latest figures, the self-employed contribute approximately £180 million per annum to the fund.  Very little of that funding is currently being drawn down, but there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth when those pensions are drawn down in future.  What is the Government doing with the money in the meantime?  Is it being frittered away or used to reduce our debts or to develop our indigenous resources to provide for the future? What strategy is in place in that regard?  These issues must be addressed and the public must be made aware of them.  Nobody wants to be a Job's comforter.  Of course we can all enjoy the current cashflow, but if business people sit back and enjoy their cash flows they will not be in business in a few years' time.  The difference in this case is that, unless there is good strategic management, the penalties will be imposed on the people.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is a key strategic instrument in the Government's approach to our further social and economic development.  That is why we <Col N="314" /> expected so much from the Minister, but we did not get it.  With the Social Welfare Act, the Finance Bill should set out the measures that will steer the economy through the troubles and challenges that lie ahead and ensure that workers, pensioners, families and those who are sick, disadvantaged or unemployed are properly catered for and adequately protected.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not present a strategic plan.  It is a confused and aimless reflection of a left-right coalition whose only objective in life is to stick together at any cost and to set aside any principle or decisive action in the interests of its own survival. The Taoiseach said Fine Gael does not have a policy of its own.  Its policies have vanished into the woodwork and become part of the glued together tripartite party.  Fine Gael pursues the lowest common denominator between the two left and one right wing parties and thanks the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, for keeping it in office.  The hapless Minister for Finance has no option but to accept the dictates of the Democratic Left, whose every wish the Taoiseach seeks to satisfy.  The Minister knows he must present a strategic plan, that his reputation is on the line and that history has a terrible habit of being savage when delving into one's past.</P>
    <P>When the shallow veneer created by the coalition's army of creative scriptwriters, ministerial handlers and public relations experts is stripped away, one is left with a reckless, irresponsible and indecisive Government.  Consequently, the Finance Bill is devoid of any real initiatives and is simply a collection of half measures and tidying up arrangements.  There are some measures which we obviously welcome, for example, the removal of VAT from commercial child minding, the abolition of residential property tax, various measures against the illegal trade in cigarettes and many other small measures.  There will be more time to discuss them on Committee Stage. Much of the Bill is technical and involves tidying up and filling in loopholes.  It is fine to do that but there is no real meat, drive, strategy or planning there.</P>
    <P>In previous years the Department of Finance had problems and that was why there was a suggestion there should be a separate planning department.  The Department of Finance cannot just become a sort of keeper of the purse; it must plan and show, in the major speech of the year, that there is a strategy and a plan.  This Bill is designed simply as a pre-election holding measure sprinkled with a collection of sweeteners to pacify the electorate.</P>
    <P>This is a fair-weather coalition drifting along on the rising economic tide which was created by their Fianna Fáil predecessors.  Let there be no mistake about it; Fianna Fáil laid the vital groundwork for the current success of our public finances and our economic development.  It took hard work, good strategic planning and a new social partnership to bring about our current prosperity.  It took great sacrifices on the part of <Col N="315" /> workers to create the economic environment we now enjoy, which has low inflation, low interest rates, rising employment and exceptional growth.</P>
    <P>In return we in Fianna Fáil promised lower taxes and we delivered them.  We reduced the upper rate of tax from 60 per cent to 48 per cent &mdash;a drop of 12 percentage points.  We reduced the low rate from 35 per cent to 27 per cent; a drop of 8 percentage points.  The rainbow coalition of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left stopped this reduction in taxes undertaken by Fianna Fáil and welched on the commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> In three years' budgets, in times of plenty, they reduced only the standard rate of tax by a mere 1 per cent commencing this week.  It is a wonder Deputies on the other side of the House are not turning their heads away in shame.</P>
    <P>In terms of tax reduction, Fianna Fáil beat the three party coalition by a cricket score.  We reduced income tax rates by 20 points in difficult times, while the two left and one right coalitions only reduced them by 1 per cent.  On the first key yardstick, the burden of personal taxation, this coalition has failed.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil achieved these dramatic reductions in personal taxation at first alone, later in association with the Progressive Democrats and then in partnership with The Labour Party.  One thing we know with certainty is that we can trust Fianna Fáil to deliver on the key objective of reducing personal taxes.  We can trust Fianna Fáil to do that because the party has already done it in large measure.  If Fianna Fáil says it will do it further, then it will deliver.</P>
    <P>In sharp contrast we also now know that we cannot trust the present rainbow coalition, two left, one right, to reduce the rate of taxation. They have not done it in three years' budgets and Finance Bills.  They are not doing it in this Bill and they will not do it in future.  As we line up for the general election let the voters beware. Deputy John Bruton has sold his party's soul to Proinsias De Rossa, and the Democratic Left Party will not allow him to reduce personal rates.</P>
    <P>One of the things that worries me is that we are going deeper into debt.  One of the main concerns of the electorate is our ability to maintain our hard won economic growth and development. Young people buying homes at inflated prices need the assurance that our economy will be stable and our low interest rates will be maintained so that they can continue to repay their mortgages.  With good management of our healthy economy we can continue our present progress, but the Government's lack of financial responsibility and their penchant for spending and borrowing in times of plenty must raise serious doubts about a future under rainbow coalition management.</P>
    <P>This Government is making no provision for the rainy day.  If the high rate of growth slows down, and when EU Structural Funds are reduced, we will come under severe pressure.  We <Col N="316" /> now have the opportunity to consolidate our position and our economic and social progress on a sound and sustainable footing.  We will not do that by plunging the country deeper into debt.</P>
    <P>In 1986 the Fine Gael-Labour coalition borrowed £2,145 million and ran a current budget deficit of £1,395 million.  By 1994 Fianna Fáil had reduced borrowing to £672 million and the current budget deficit was turned into a small surplus of £15 million.  This steady and prudent management of our economy must be maintained and Fianna Fáil can do it.  I call on all parties to agree in principle to cap our national debt at £30 billion and to begin the task of gradually reducing it.  In these times, which are very good, we must stop adding to our national debt.  We must protect our people against a reduction in growth and ensure that we can maintain our services, meet the needs of our growing number of pensioners and keep low interest and inflation rates.  This coalition is on a pre-election spending spree with no care for the future.  They simply see it as somebody else's problem.</P>
    <P>There has been slow progress in tackling unemployment. In December 1994 there were 272,000 people unemployed.  In December last the figure had only dropped to 270,000.  Yet, the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government had estimated an average rate of 266,000 for the year 1995.  Something went radically wrong when the rainbow coalition took charge in late December 1994.  With the number of jobs continuing to rise, the number of unemployed people rose again.  Something had gone wrong.  The outturn for 1995 was 277,000. That is 11,000 more people unemployed every week during 1995.</P>
    <P>The rainbow coalition set a less ambitious target of 275,000 for 1996 but overshot even this by 4,200 per week to end up with 279,200 people unemployed on average every week of the year in 1996.  This is rainbow reality.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is best illustrated by figures showing the average weekly number of unemployed people, the estimate, the outturn and the increase for 1995, 1996 and 1997.  In 1995 the estimate was 266,000; outturn, 277,000; and the increase over the Government's budget plan was 11,000.  In 1996 the estimate was 275,000; the outturn 279,200, which left an increase of 4,000.  After all that the Government tells us that for 1997 their unemployment estimate, on which the Finance Bill is based, will be 259,000.  We have heard from the Minister that to meet the needs of public service pay a further £25 million is to come out of Social Welfare.  That would reduce the figure to be catered for to somewhere between 252,000 and 255,000.  It would be a reduction this year of 24,000 to 27,000 &mdash; every week, not just in one week.  These are the Social Welfare figures on which we pay.  They are not the figures the PR men can play about with.  This is the reality of business.  It is what we pay for every week.</P>
    <P>The rainbow coalition failed to deliver in 1995 and 1996 despite all the hype and the PR misrepresentation. I am sure most people would think <Col N="317" /> that 1996 was a marvellous year with a wonderful drop in unemployment.  In fact, the figure exceeded by 4,200 the weekly average for the whole year, and more was paid out.  Somebody is trying to fool someone somewhere.  Those are the official figures that have now come out for 1996.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said the Government will save a further £25 million this year on unemployment payments to meet special wage increases.  This would mean a further reduction in the 1997 unemployment figures to 252,000 or 255,000.  Perhaps the Minister could give us an estimate of the number of people who will be unemployed in 1997.  He has budgeted for a reduction of at least 24,000 a week in 1997.  Given the experience of the past two years, does the Minister think a projected saving of between £85 million and £95 million in the Social Welfare Vote is realistic or does the rainbow coalition expect someone else to meet the deficit because it will not be in Government at the end of the year?</P>
    <P>The live register figures for the end of March are higher than expected.  They show that an average of 265,000 people were unemployed over the first three months, which is higher than necessary. They must improve significantly if the estimate of the Department of Finance is to be achieved.  It seems it will be difficult to achieve and it suggests that somebody is cooking the books for election purposes.</P>
    <P>There is no help in this Bill for drug and crime ridden areas.  It sets out the Government's plans for the next year and beyond but ignores one of the major issues facing society &mdash; crime and the abuse of drugs.  We know from experience and innumerable studies that drug barons prey on disadvantaged areas from where the vast majority of the inmates of our juvenile and adult prisons come.  We are entitled to expect that the Government will include solutions to these problems in its key planning instrument &mdash; the Finance Bill. However, they have been forgotten or ignored.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may say these issues should be tackled by other Departments. However, he is wrong.  Unless the Government regards a reduction in the level of crime and drug related activities as central to our economic and social development, it does not deserve to be in office.  The Minister, for example, could have extended the urban renewal scheme to projects in disadvantaged urban areas, which are well defined and quantified.  If he superimposed the drugs and crime incidents on these areas, their needs would become clear.  We need to encourage renewal and development in these areas by providing financial incentives and liberal investment schemes.  We need to recognise and financially support those who work in and serve these areas. The Government must take the lead, co-ordinate this work and draw up plans.  This Bill falls short in that regard.</P>
    <P>The rainbow coalition has been bad for families, pensioners, sick people and the unemployed. The Minister said he increased old age pensions <Col N="318" /> by £7 per week over the past three budgets.  This amounts to £2.33 per week per annum.  The increase for an adult dependant is £1.17 per week per annum.  The average increase for widows is £2.20 per week and it is £2.17 per week for people on disability allowance.</P>
    <P>Old age pensioners are bitterly disappointed that the 1 per cent relief in PRSI does not apply to them.  The Minister for Finance could have removed the 1 per cent levy which applies to pensioners. Why were they singled out for adverse treatment?  Why were their needs ignored?  Now that the coffers are awash with money, do we need to punish pensioners with this levy?  Surely they are among the people most in need?  This says much about the hard hearted men who lead this coalition and their disregard for old age pensioners. That trait runs deep in Fine Gael, back to the time when it reduced old age pensions from ten shillings to nine shillings per week.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I do not have time to deal with the provisions for the family, voluntary and community organisations and charitable lotteries.  As regards the live register, there is something radically wrong with the estimate of the Department of Finance which undermines the Government's figures.  An election is looming and the Government has compromised itself.  For that reason, I am not happy with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill and the budget are different from those described by Deputy Woods.  I recall Deputy Michael McDowell lauding the Minister for Finance on budget day for reducing PRSI by 1 per cent.  It is strange, therefore, for Deputy Woods to quote Deputy Michael McDowell in support of his argument that PRSI should not have been reduced, particularly when the Minister specifically stated on budget day that neither he nor the Government believed that PRSI was a tax, despite some jibes from Deputy Michael McDowell that it was.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives effect to the largest package of personal and business tax reliefs in the history of the State.  The full year cost of that package, which will be of significant benefit to the economy and the various sectors, is £490 million. However, that does not take account of further significant increases in child benefit which were announced in this year's budget.  Those increases are the best method of targeting people's needs and eliminating poverty traps.  In this Government's short lifetime, child benefit has been increased from £20 to £30 a month for the first and second child and from £25 to £39 a month for third and subsequent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This week people will begin to see the benefits of the measures announced in the budget.  A single person on an average industrial wage will gain approximately £9 per week and a married couple with two children on an income of £24,000 will benefit by approximately £10 per week.  When the elimination of residential property tax, the abolition of water charges and free third level fees, <Col N="319" /> which are worth approximately £3,000 to £4,000 to a family with two university students, are taken into consideration, the overall effect is a significant transfer of resources from the State to the individual.  Such benefits are beyond criticism.</P>
    <P>The idea that reducing personal taxation is a function of reducing rates is a gross oversimplification of the process.  In the three budgets introduced by the Government we have spread the benefits across a number of areas, including a reduction in rates this year, which effectively resulted in a reduction of 2 per cent in the standard rate, a significant widening of the bands and an increase in allowances.  I do not want to state the obvious, but if a person's income tax can be reduced from 48 per cent to the standard rate of 26 per cent, every pound for which the lower rate applies results in tax on that income being reduced by more than 20 per cent.  The notion that simply reducing rates, which is headline news, produces tax reform flies in the face of common sense and the facts.  To reduce the overall tax paid by individuals it is necessary to give high priority to widening the bands, increasing allowances and reducing rates.  That is what the Government has been concentrating on.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats, in particular, make much play about the benefits to be gained from radically reducing tax rates.  The Government's approach to tackling bands, allowances and rates, is more balanced and produces a better result.  That can be demonstrated by comparing the results of those two approaches.  In 1992, the Progressive Democrats when in Government with Fianna Fáil reduced tax rates from 29 per cent to 27 per cent and the top rate from 52 per cent to 48 per cent.  Those reductions were welcome, but the average rate of tax paid by a single person earning the average industrial wage under that Administration fell from 33.7 per cent to 31.36 per cent, a fall of little more than 2.25 per cent, despite radical reductions in the rates but little in the way of widening the bands or increasing allowances.  In contrast, this Government's more balanced approach has reduced the average tax for that taxpayer from 31.3 per cent to 27.16 per cent, a fall of more than 4 per cent.  I mention those figures to emphasise that an obsession with simply reducing rates, which undoubtedly is headline news, completely misses the point that if people can move from the higher rate to the standard rate there is a 20 per cent benefit as a greater amount of their salary taxable is at the lower rate.  That point is obvious but it seems to be constantly missed.</P>
    <P>Regarding the provisions in the budget and the Finance Bill which encourage business and enterprise, the rate of corporation tax on the first £50,000 of profits has been reduced to 28 per cent.  Bearing in mind that three years ago the rate was 40 per cent, it is a very significant reduction which will aid the development of the small business sector, one of the biggest potential engines of economic growth and job creation. <Col N="320" /> The standard rate of corporation tax has been reduced this year from 38 per cent to 36 per cent. The Government is putting down a marker that corporation taxes are reducing and this trend will continue.  Business, big or small, can make plans in the anticipation that corporation taxes will continue to be targeted downwards by the Government. In addition, the special 8.5 per cent lower rate of employer's PRSI now applies to salaries up to £13,500 and this reduces tax on employment in many of the exposed sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>For the first time, tax relief is being provided for pre-trading expenses.  In the past the tax code was very severe in that it penalised people who took risks, invested their money, time and effort in starting up a business and getting it established. No tax relief was given for such pre-trading costs and expenses.  This is a welcome relief which business interests sought.  Some of the best measures in Finance Bills or budgets are as a result of Governments and Ministers for Finance listening to the people at the coalface and the representatives of small businesses explaining the issues that make the difference between the successful development of enterprises and failure.  This is such a measure.</P>
    <P>One of the Government's great achievements in respect of family business and farms is its treatment of capital acquisitions tax.  It is now at a level where it is no longer a significant disincentive to the passing on of businesses and farms to the younger generation.  Ninety per cent of the value of assets transferred is exempted from tax, which is a major benefit to a sector that in the past has found it impossible to contemplate passing on assets because of the application of penal rates of capital acquisitions tax.  The Government has tackled that matter decisively over the past three budgets.</P>
    <P>These and other measures are widely seen as pro-enterprise and ones that will underpin further growth and job creation.  Deputy Woods said he saw no evidence of a strategy in the speech of the Minister for Finance.  He spelt out his strategy in great detail in the budget and, therefore, it was not necessary for him to spell it out again in the Finance Bill, which simply gives effect to that budget and the framework he eloquently outlined here on budget day.  There is a clear strategy to encourage enterprise and to underpin, in every way open to us, further growth and job creation. That is an objective on which there is no disagreement in this House.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some new measures in the Finance Bill &mdash; the incentives to promote donations to third level research institutions, universities, institutes of technology, regional technical colleges and so on. We have seen the beginnings of skill shortages in certain hi-tech industries.  It is ironic at a time when we have a high level of unemployment to hear employers say they cannot get workers with sufficient skill experience to take up hi-tech jobs in new industries.</P>
    <P>The fact that there are now serious efforts to <Col N="321" /> attract Irish emigrants back from the UK and the US is a sign of success.  There are advertisements in newspapers in those countries asking people to come back and take up high-skilled jobs in Ireland.  We can be happy with that in one way in that it provides an opportunity for people whose birthright is Irish to return and work here but we must, nevertheless, ensure that Ireland turns out a stream of young people with the necessary high-level skills to take up the jobs provided, not only by international investment but by indigenous industry which must develop high-tech skills if it is to survive.  This kind of measure, which provides tax incentives to individuals and companies which have resources which they are willing to invest in the development of research and high-tech skills in Ireland's third level institutions, is also part of the strategy to create more employment and growth and provide in particular for the greater numbers of graduates and highly skilled technologists necessary to take up the jobs of the future.  That is the background to that measure in the Bill and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of apprehension in the days leading up to the publication of the Finance Bill about what it might contain in relation to the construction of new hotels.  That apprehension was misplaced because, while there are some limited measures to ensure the correction of a number of abuses, there is no disincentive in the Bill to the investment which is necessary in the growing tourism industry and the resulting necessity for more hotel accommodation throughout the country.  I welcome that development also.</P>
    <P>The budget delivers on the Government's tax commitments in Partnership 2000.  By agreeing wage increases to the end of the decade in Partnership 2000, the Government has provided stability and certainty to companies, employers and employees about the future over the next two to three years.  Those years will be among the most momentous, not just because we are approaching the millennium but because that historical date coincides with a number of significant events in which Ireland will be a partner and participant.</P>
    <P>I refer in particular to European Monetary Union which will probably be the greatest factor of change to affect Europe's economy and citizens in 20 or 30 years.  The notion that member states could all share a common currency was little more than a dream a decade ago.  It is now very much in the grasp of many member states and it is certainly within Ireland's grasp.  There is a good deal of apprehension about it and that is understandable as it is a new territory but for a country, such as Ireland, which depends more on exports than any other member state by far, but the notion that currency risk can be eliminated, transactions can be simplified and business can be conducted within a common currency area must be to the benefit of Ireland in the medium and longer term.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that Ireland will not experience some anxious moments along the way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> The concerns expressed by some exporters, particularly those exporting primarily to the UK, are understandable.  I have heard some commentators say that Ireland should not enter this great new world without the UK.  Of course it would be more convenient and less risky if the UK joined European Monetary Union with Ireland on 1 January 1999.  However, the reality appears to be that the UK will choose not to do so.  That is a matter for the British Government and the Government has no control of that, but it would be a great step backwards if Ireland was to lose its self-confidence and step back 20 to 30 years to the day when the link with sterling was broken and Ireland commenced its move from economic dependence on the UK.  Ireland has built a strong export business and strong business contacts with the member states of the EU, such as Germany and France.  It would be a retrograde step and a sign of our lack of confidence if we were to falter simply because the UK decided not to join at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Ireland will meet the criteria for European Monetary Union and that is to the credit of the Government and, indeed, its predecessors.  This is not a criterion which is met in a year or two; it is something to which Ireland has been building up in the 1990s.  All parties which have participated in Government can share in the credit of Ireland's economic success story which will enable us to qualify and take part in the implementation of this great change in world and European currency and economic matters from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>I place some emphasis on this because it leads me to one conclusion, namely that Ireland will require a stable Government in the immediate future which is certain of survival.  The next three to four years will be critical.  The economy is in very good shape and European economies in general are in relatively good shape.  The future is bright but uncertainty will not assist the process toward European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition Government came into existence in rather extraordinary circumstances on the fall of its predecessor, it was not perceived by some as a stable, fundamentally sound association of three parties but has proven to be such, as it has demonstrated that its members can deal with any differences of opinion within its number in a rational manner and in a spirit of compromise.</P>
    <P>The alternative Government, comprised of parties opposite, when previously in office &mdash; while having achieved some of its objectives &mdash; ultimately proved unable to work together, which will be a factor in the weeks and months ahead. If ever there was a period in which instability and uncertainty will pose a stumbling block to our future development and economic growth it will be in the years immediately ahead.  This will be the case not only in relation to the uncharted territory of economic and monetary union but in the very tough negotiations we shall face post-1999 in regard to Structural Funds and so on when, inevitably, many other unpredictable events will <Col N="323" /> require a Government comprised of parties with a proven track record of working co-operatively together.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that stability, an essential prerequisite to low interest rates, low inflation, high economic growth and high domestic and international investment, emanates from stable Government and sensible economic management.  The provisions of the Bill demonstrate this Government's determination to work together constructively, to manage our economy prudently, allowing us to face into those testing years around the turn of the millennium with confidence, certainty and stable Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House I wish to share my time with Deputy Ó Cuív.</P>
      <P>I must take issue with the final argument of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney, when he said that this Government was comprised of the only parties that could coalesce and provide stable Government into the future.  There were earlier periods in our history when Coalition Governments comprising the party of the Minister of State and others did not last very long in office.  There is no reason my party cannot operate effectively in office in the future, either as a single party Government or one with minority support, to which I look forward in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>This is the third successive Finance Bill introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, who, two years ago, informed Members he would clean up the bureaucratic muddle enveloping our taxpayers, those paying under the PAYE system or the self-employed.</P>
      <P>There were some welcome changes effected in the Minister's preceding two Finance Bills &mdash; for example, direct payments of VAT, RSI, PAYE and other administrative ones, making it simpler for the self-employed to comply with our tax laws.  The Minister also promised to introduce a consolidation of taxes Bill which I note from the Government's legislative programme will be published prior to the summer recess.  Its introduction will represent a welcome progression for anyone constantly engaged in examining earlier tax Bills introduced since 1967, a time-consuming, costly exercise for many tax advisers and their clients.</P>
      <P>Some excellent allowances and schemes were introduced in the preceding two Finance Bills, such as the tourist resort renewal scheme, the film scheme &mdash; Deputy McCreevy's idea &mdash; apart from which minimal changes only were effected in tax bands and rates which, within the context of what could have been done, is my main criticism of this Government.  In this period of booming economy, the Government had indeed an opportunity to be more generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our taxpayers are still subjected to an array of taxes, many not recognised.  Examples are driving, television, dog, gun licences, rates, publicans' licences, Government duty on credit cards, bank <Col N="324" /> guarantee cards, cash cards and the many other licence fees imposed on businesses, of which many people might not be aware.  One must also pay a fee whenever one lodges an appeal, intends developing one's business or being connected to certain services, all of which have crept in in recent years.  The reason is that local authorities were not financed as heretofore to enable them to properly carry out their statutory functions and have had to devise other methods of raising funds, leading to the imposition of these costly fees used to shore up or bail out the excessive spending of Administrations over many preceding years.</P>
    <P>With the passage of time people cease to question but rather accept these impositions as part of everyday life.  It is opportune to question and review all of them but the Minister and his Government have failed to grasp that opportunity within this, the most favourable economic period in the history of our State.  It appears the Government of three heads is afraid to rock the boat and effect meaningful changes in our overall taxation system, the rock on which it will perish whereas there is an urgent need to revamp its economic and social policies to enhance the overall well-being of our people.  To achieve this belief the taxation system must be reformed.  There is a necessity to reduce significantly the high levels of taxation as they are damaging our competitiveness and growth. Reports from the Commission on Taxation, the task force on small businesses, Forbairt, Culliton and Forfás have called for tax reform.</P>
    <P>Our track record in Government shows we are the only party in recent history capable of controlling Government spending.  Too great a temptation confronted the coalition parties when put in charge of our finances.  After years in Opposition they went mad spending the hard pressed taxpayers money from their projected 6 per cent over-run to 20 per cent.  They are continuing to do this to buy votes to get back into power after the next election.  Were it not for the buoyancy of the economy this country would be near bankruptcy as it was in 1987.  There is no doubt current management of taxpayers' money is fundamentally fraudulent.  The people will have an opportunity to pass judgement in the near future on this miscreant Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the farm pollution control grants. Despite what many people think the net taxable income of most farms is £16,000 to £20,000.  Out of that farmers are supposed to rear and educate their families and reinvest in their farms by erecting new buildings or purchasing new machinery. On such an income there is great hardship in developing and maintaining the capital equipment which is necessary to provide for a decent living.</P>
    <P>The time has come to look at capital allowances for the struggling majority of farmers.  Some 10 per cent of farmers are in the top league, while in the medium league are the farmers who are suffering.  Due to falling milk and cattle prices <Col N="325" /> and chaos in the beef industry every sector of the farming community is under pressure.  When farmers are doing badly it affects not only the farmer but the factory, the co-ops and the shops so the spin-off effect is enormous.  It is important to provide the aids necessary to maintain the industry.</P>
    <P>We should examine the costs involved for a young farmer taking over a farm from a parent. Usually a deal has to be done with other members of the family and in many cases farm buildings and machinery must be upgraded.  The aids provided to young farmers are not sufficient.</P>
    <P>Corporation tax has been reduced but the 1 per cent reduction in the past year is derisory and will not make or break any individual.  There should be a greater reduction in corporation tax for small firms.  The cost would not be excessive and the figures produced by the Department of Finance, and available from the Minister, bear this out.</P>
    <P>I welcome the targeting of illegal tobacco sales. It is not acceptable that people flouting the law are portrayed on our television screens.  This is not a minor crime given that millions of pounds are lost to the economy through this illegal activity.  For many years I have made representations to the effect that pre-trading expenses should be allowed and I am pleased the Minister has seen fit, on this occasion, to introduce them. Capital gains tax must be considered and I am disappointed the Minister did not take it into account in the budget.  There is scope for developing and increasing activity in the indigenous industries in the treatment of capital gains.</P>
    <P>When examining the tax side of the budget it must not be forgotten that VHI and mortgage interest relief have been reduced to standard rate allowances.  While there have been many benefits there are also negatives.  For example, the increase given to pensioners, as outlined by Deputy Woods, was derisory and will not be forgotten in the next month or so.  Also the number of butter vouchers was halved.  This raises a doubt in the minds of many people as to how the Government views the less well off in society.</P>
    <P>A recent article in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Cathal MacDomhnaill, clearly indicated the change of emphasis by the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with taxpayers.  It indicated the Revenue Commissioners are no longer just trying to enforce compliance with the tax laws but are focusing on value for money and cost effectiveness, honing in on real corruption and evasion, providing a service mainly to smaller business people, advising and helping them with their returns and helping them overcome problems with payment.  The Revenue Commissioners no longer say returns should be in by a certain day and taxpayers will be subjected to all the powers at their disposal.  As a practising accountant I can confirm that what the chairman has stated in that article is true.  That is how the Revenue is operating today.  A survey of the satisfaction rating of many institutions, including the Revenue <Col N="326" /> Commissioners, showed that people dealing with the Revenue Commissioners rate them and their treatment highly.  This is a complete change from the 1970s and early 1980s.  The change of attitude by the Revenue commenced when self-assessment was introduced.  There is now a higher rate of compliance than at any time in the history of the State.  I particularly like the statement by the chairman that the Revenue Commissioners pay attention to &ldquo;Phoenix&rdquo; companies which rise from the ashes of failed predecessors, often operating from the same premises.  The approach now is to pinpoint &ldquo;Phoenix&rdquo; companies and ensure they are given no leeway in delaying tax payment.  This is an excellent policy.  Many &ldquo;Phoenix&rdquo; of companies go out of business without paying their creditors or subcontractors and start off again the following morning.  The history of many of them will show they have done it time and again.  I am pleased the Revenue Commissioners are moving to curb that.</P>
    <P>There are many other issues I would like to raise and hope to do so on Committee Stage.  This is another unimaginative Finance Bill which does little to further the growth and development of our economy or equity in the taxation system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Finance Bill.  I do not intend to refer to high finance and special schemes for people with large incomes, rather it is my intention to discuss those I represent, namely, people on low incomes.  I wish to highlight a number of basic facts which seem to have eluded the Government.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that this Government claims to include a left wing element.  The thresholds for tax are mainly determined by exemption limits. Members will not see comments in the financial or ordinary press about exemption limits because newspapers do not usually represent the interests of those who write or commentate for them or the people who are perceived to read them. However, there are large numbers of these people and they should have a voice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general basic tax free allowance was increased by £250 this year from £3,150 to £3,400. However, when the exemption limits for those on low incomes are considered, the increase in the allowance was a measly £100 from £3,900 to £4,000.  If we consider the case of pensioners over 65 years of age, their basic personal tax free allowance was increased from £3,350 to £3,800, which includes a personal allowance of £3,400 and an age allowance of £400.  However, when the exemption limits that apply to those over 65 years of age are taken into account, unlike those whose incomes are above the exemption limits the limit was increased by £100, from £4,500 to £4,600.  For those over 75 years of age, the exemption limit also increased by £100 from £5,100 to £5,200.  I apologise for quoting so many figures but, in simple terms, the increase in the exemption limit for those over 75 years of age was 1.9 per cent.  Why <Col N="327" /> was this group the most disadvantaged by the budget?  Why was it completely forgotten?</P>
    <P>It is amazing that, for a person under 65 years of age, the difference between the basic fundamental allowance of £3,400 and the exemption limit of £4,000 is £600.  However, if they receive a PAYE allowance the amount is zero.  Is there a recognition of the need to completely remove people on low pay from the system?  Does the Government realise that those whose incomes are in excess of those measly thresholds are dragged back into the full tax regime because they are obliged to pay 40 per cent on their taxable income?  Whereas the Government reduced the low rate of tax from 27 per cent to 26 per cent, it could do nothing to spread the burden for those whose incomes barely rise above these rather low exemption limits.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the exemption limits and the marginal tax rate are not pitched at approximately 10 per cent above the basic rate so that there would be a slow tapering in rather than people coming up against a stone wall at 40 per cent.  People on very large salaries complain about paying 48 per cent tax, but surely those on the lowest salaries have a legitimate case in stating that 40 per cent is too much for them to pay.</P>
    <P>Another issue which must be taken into account is that social welfare pensions are taxable. At £75 per week, these amount to £3,900 per year.  If the basic exemption limit is £4,600, a person receiving an occupational pension in excess of £700 per year will enter the various tax brackets.  Many old people find it a major burden to deal with the small amount of paperwork involved.  The amount of time and effort wasted does not justify their collecting this money in the first instance.  As stated on previous occasions, I cannot understand why single people earning less than £100 or married people earning less than £200 are obliged to pay tax.  Many schemes and systems could be brought to an end if people were allowed to keep what they earn without paying tax.</P>
    <P>If a person's income is over the exemption limit or they are operating on the exemption scheme, they are allowed mortgage relief but they are not allowed relief in respect of payments to the VHI, etc.  One of the extraordinary things in this regard is that relatively few pensioners pay mortgages because financial institutions will not lend them money if it is likely that they will be making repayments on reaching 65 years of age.  On the other hand, many people who are employed for the entirety of their working careers and receive a substantially reduced income at pension age continue to make payments to the VHI because it is the only protection they have in the event of illness.  If their incomes have decreased to a level where they must avail of the exemption limit, they discover they are not entitled to VHI relief. That is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>Another issue which must be tackled is whether social welfare payments are taxable.  If <Col N="328" /> the Government agreed with my argument that people whose incomes fall below a basic threshold should not pay tax, a uniform system could be operated and a decision could be made regarding whether to tax social welfare payments.  As far as I am concerned, the simple option is to provide a large basic threshold and make social welfare payments taxable, with the exception of child benefit.  The system currently in place is neither here nor there.  Unemployment assistance and disability allowance are not taxable or assessable for tax.  Unemployment benefit and disability benefit are 50 per cent taxable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, on the basis that the basic threshold would be increased.  Exemption limits were increasing at that time but, under the current Government, movement in this area has slowed down.  Every pension and lone parent's allowance is completely taxable.  Will someone explain the logic behind this?</P>
      <P>Most people like to be able to check their own tax affairs.  However, I doubt that between 30 and 40 Members could decide what is and is not taxable under the finance code as it relates to social welfare.  They might not be able to state the correct answers because in certain cases £10 of the amount people receive is not taxable.  In addition, their child dependant allowance is not taxable. However, other benefits are either taxable in respect of child dependant allowance or not taxable at all.  This creates confusion and people cannot double check if their tax affairs are correct.  I know a person who paid an accountant to deal with the complexity involved yet who ended up paying more tax than he should have because he did not clarify the nature of the social welfare payment he was receiving.</P>
      <P>The scrappage scheme for cars has an urban orientation and favours those with higher incomes who can afford to buy a new car.  It does not deal with the problem of cars being abandoned in rural areas and ending up as hen houses. The scheme was amended but it now favours two car families who can now trade in the older of the two cars for new car.  However, no incentive is given to the person who has an old car and can only afford to replace it with a secondhand car. No assistance is given to get those cars off the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the inception of the scheme I have favoured a universal lower payment for anybody who hands over a car of ten or more years old and the registration book.  The scheme should be universal and should not discriminate against those who cannot afford a new car or those in <Col N="329" /> rural areas.  In rural areas, particularly given the condition of the roads, people need bigger cars. However, most people would regard it as foolish to buy a new car even if they could afford it.  The idea of pulling a trailer with a bullock in it with an 800 cc or 1,000 cc car is so far fetched as to be unrealistic.  In the area of the country in which I live such a car would not last six months given the condition of the roads.  The scheme is wrongly based and does not give encouragement to people to ensure that no further cars disfigure the countryside and that when cars are no longer useful they are delivered to the local scrapyard.</P>
    <P>My colleague referred to the seaside resorts scheme.  The answer I received from the Minister for Finance when I asked why Clifden had not been included in the scheme still rankles.  He told me it was a booming town.  Other towns, such as Youghal and Westport, which have fewer problems of dereliction, or Salthill, which is on the edge of Galway city with a population of 90,000 people, are included in the scheme &mdash; although I am glad Salthill was included.  However, the one town in Connemara which urgently needs a face-lift and whose centre needs major development was excluded.  Clifden's geographic location 50 miles from Galway makes it one of the most isolated towns in the country.  However, for reasons I cannot understand it has been passed over for inclusion in the scheme.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the position of Clifden.  The town should not be penalised for the great efforts it is making on its own behalf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister's speech and with great interest to the contribution from Deputy McCreevy.  He always makes interesting and often provocative points.  He stated, as ever, that he is in favour of good management of the economy and put that forward as his party's policy, as one would expect given that he is the party's spokesman on finance.  He made the point that the Government is hostage to every interest group at present.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition visited my constituency last year.  He was brought to each area where there was a problem with a school, a blocked drain or a community hall needed.  At the end of Deputy Bertie Ahern's visit to County Roscommon I estimated that while away from the glare of the Dublin media he gave about £30 million worth of commitments to various communities. In each area he visited where there was a problem he had no difficulty in giving millions of pounds worth of commitments.  He moved on to County Longford and I estimate he made commitments of the order of £20 million.</P>
      <P>It was particularly galling to hear Deputy Ahern some time later make a speech in the House in a classic fiscal rectitude vein.  He upbraided the Government for excesses in public spending and exceeding the borrowing and spending limits in the financial year.  One cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Michael McDowell adopted a similar <Col N="330" /> line with regard to water rates.  His views were interesting in the light of the <i>volte face</i> of the Progressive Democrats on the issue.  Less than a week ago the Leader of that party appeared on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and was asked to comment on the results of an opinion poll.  Deputy Harney was not pleased with the results of the opinion poll and launched into a tirade on water rates.  She blurted out things she did not intend to say and hung her party out to dry.  Since then she has been trying to retrieve the situation.</P>
    <P>I submit that 75 per cent of the people agree with the abolition of water rates.  They see water rates as an inequitable tax, not related to consumption. I acknowledge that it was a Government led by my party which introduced water rates in the mid-1980s and the form in which they were introduced and implemented was a mistake. When the group water scheme representatives met the Progressive Democrats environment spokesperson, Deputy Molloy, he told them that his party would have no difficulty if in Government in providing £23 million or whatever it would take to solve their problem.  Against that background, his party leader has said that water rates should be reintroduced.  What hypocrisy. There is no support for such a policy.  I imagine that in Deputy Harney's constituency 95 per cent of people disagree with her proposal.</P>

      <P>It was reported on RTE this evening that a bus driver who has been attacked with syringes has received several requests from the Blood Transfusion Service Board to donate blood, even though it had advised him not to do so.  This latest revelation comes in the wake of the BTSB's apology in recent weeks to two women. In one case, the blood bank sought a donation from a woman infected with hepatitis C and, in the other, informed a donor last week in error that she was infected with hepatitis and no longer required to donate blood.</P>
      <P>These revelations raise a major question, that is, if the blood bank cannot be trusted to get donor communications right, how can people have faith in its more complex operations.  In its evidence to the tribunal of inquiry, the BTSB made much of its new system for donor screening. However, we saw yet again at first hand tonight that this system is not fail safe.</P>
      <P>The Minister needs to act quickly on the recommendations of the tribunal of inquiry on establishing a new blood bank.  A new culture needs to be introduced and more staff should be recruited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the continuing concern about the BTSB lies at the door of the Minister and the Government.  People do not have confidence <Col N="331" /> because there is no reason to have faith in the ability of the Minister and the Government to stem the haemorrhage of confidence in the BTSB.  This time the Minister cannot try to pass the buck and get into the despicable political blame game he has tried so often.  All these episodes at the BTSB have occurred on the Minister's watch.  He is the one who has told us things have changed under the new management at Pelican House.  He is the one who is accountable because it was during his tenure, management and supervision that these events happened.</P>
    <P>All that has happened at the BTSB has been compounded by the revelation that its former chief medical consultant is involved in a blood testing service and is being assisted by two of its employees.  This has angered many victims.  Was the Minister aware of this?  Did he approve the BTSB's payment in 1995 of a substantial golden handshake &mdash; I understand worth £600,000 approximately over 20 years &mdash; to Dr. Terry Walsh?  Did he insist on any conditions?</P>
    <P>The BTSB has to clarify its reasons for co-operating with the service Dr. Walsh is now offering and for allowing its employees to work for it. We will be told, no doubt, that the Minister has yet again hauled in the management of the BTSB which for days has been floundering around in its public comment on the issue.  We will be told, no doubt, that the Minister has ordered that the two employees involved must stop assisting Dr. Walsh but why must action always follow media reports or Dáil criticism?  The Minister must have been aware of this operation.  Why did he not take action without being forced into it?</P>
    <P>There is a further serious issue that will not be resolved by stopping some staff from doing some work.  The Minister and the BTSB have to specify the terms on which the paternity testing service was transferred from Pelican House some years ago.  Was there a tendering process?  How could BTSB staff be its directors, for example?  Why is it listed in the 1996-7 Irish Medical Directory that the BTSB offers a blood and tissue typing service when it does not but Dr. Walsh does?  Why is it that this listing for the BTSB appears in the 1996-7 directory but not in the 1995-6 one?  Is the listing connected with Dr. Walsh's departure from the BTSB in 1995?</P>
    <P>The Minister has to be aware of this concern about tendering as a controversy was reported in April 1995 involving another BTSB executive who was a director of a medical supplies company which traded with the board.  Did the Minister investigate this issue and what were his findings? Did the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, give him information on the matter given that he raised it in the Dáil in 1990?</P>
    <P>I reiterate my demand that the Government come clean on its involvement in the despieable legal strategy used in the case of the late Mrs. Brigid McCole.  We are told the Tánaiste is set to <Col N="332" /> make a major speech at his party's conference this weekend.  Let him use the opportunity to divulge what he knows about this episode and to confirm that he spoke to the Minister in early summer 1996 about the McCole legal action.  It is clear from the revelations so far that the Tánaiste acquiesced in the legal strategy employed and the attempts to force the late Mrs. McCole to go to the compensation tribunal rather than admit liability in the courts.  If the Government continues to refuse to divulge in full the circumstances in which the legal strategy was devised and to lay before the Oireachtas all the documentation, including the documentation from the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Tánaiste can rest assured that Fianna Fáil in Government will investigate the matter in full.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> For the information of the House, I wish to set out the background to this matter.  Prior to 1984, I understand a paternity testing service was provided by Professor Masterson, Pathology Department, UCD.  The blood samples taken by Professor Masterson were sent to technologists employed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board who were paid a personal fee for the work done.  I understand the number of cases each year was limited and no charge was made by the BTSB for the use of its facilities.</P>
      <P>Following the retirement in 1984 of Professor Masterson, the Department of Health raised with the BTSB the question of providing this service as part of its overall tissue typing work.  In response later in 1984, the Department was informed by a staff member of the BTSB that a group of staff members had formed a limited company, Paternity Testing Services Limited, to provide such a service.  The Department was informed that a suitably equipped laboratory outside of Pelican House would be used by the company. It was also the Department's understanding that any work involved for staff members would be done outside of normal working hours.</P>
      <P>In December 1991, I understand the board of the BTSB considered the involvement of staff members in the work of this company.  While the laboratory facilities of the BTSB were not used by the company, it appears that the then chief medical consultant, who acted as medical consultant to the company, took a small number of blood samples in Pelican House each week.  The board decided in December 1991 that samples should not be taken on its premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the retirement of the chief medical consultant in April 1995, I understand two current staff members at the BTSB have continued their involvement as directors of the company. The BTSB has informed me that, while this is not in breach of its code of conduct for employees or their conditions of employment, both of them <Col N="333" /> have indicated they are resigning as directors of the company and dissociating themselves from it.</P>

        <i>The Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> provides for an expansion of the Youthreach programme and contains a commitment to review the arrangements for those employed as teachers under the programme which is a worthwhile one in that it provides young people who do not succeed in the normal schooling system with an opportunity to undergo training.  Four years since that commitment was made those employed by vocational education committees throughout the country have still not had their pay and conditions reviewed.  This is extraordinary.  To my knowledge, most are well qualified.  They would not have been employed if their qualifications had not been equal to those of teachers employed in normal vocational education committee schools.  Yet, their hourly rate of pay is a disgrace.  It is very wrong of the Government to ask the people who took up these appointments to continue to work in the Youthreach programme without regularising their rates of pay.  I ask the Minister to address this issue specifically given that the commitment made during the discussions which led to the inclusion of this clause in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> has not been fulfilled more than four years later.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to reply to this debate on behalf of the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>Arising from the commitment in the PCW to review the staffing arrangements for the Youthreach programme, a consultancy study was commissioned of the staffing structure, qualifications profile and employment conditions of the staff in the programme.  The consultants completed their report in April 1996 and copies were supplied to the relevant interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following receipt of the consultants' report, discussions and negotiations on pay and conditions for Youthreach commenced between the Department of Education and the union representing staff in the programme.  Facilitation and arbitration under the terms of the Government-ICTU PCW statement of 15 May 1996 were offered to the union in November 1996.  The union referred the matter to the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> for determination on the question of the applicability to Youthreach of the terms of the &ldquo;Chairman's Minute concerning New Companies or Newly Organised Employees in Employments where no unionisation already exists&rdquo;.  This matter having been resolved, the Teachers' Union of Ireland has agreed revised terms of reference for the facilitation and arbitration process submitted to it on 14 February last.  In this connection the Department of Education <Col N="334" /> confirmed to the Teachers' Union of Ireland that it is prepared to enter further negotiations with the aid of a facilitator, if necessary, in an attempt to reach agreement on as many issues as possible.  The Department also confirmed that it is prepared to refer any outstanding issues for adjudication to the Public Service Arbitration Board on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  A provisional timetable for the arbitration process has been discussed with the TUI.</P>
    <P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the Department is committed to reaching an amicable solution to the issues involved in this matter and thereby recognise the contribution which the Youthreach instruction staff make to enabling the educationally disadvantaged participants in the programme to enhance their prospects in the labour market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister for coming in to reply.  This matter relates to the announced take-over of Quinnsworth-Crazy Prices by Tesco.  Like I did, the Minister met representatives of Tesco.  I received correspondence from Tesco but I am very disappointed the Minister has not received written commitments from the company on a range of issues.  The letter I received from the company today contained no written commitments in regard to the main issues of concern about the take-over.  I have written today to the EU Competition Commissioner, Karel Van Miert, to express my party's concern about the deal and the absence of written commitments. I call on the Minister to use his powers to refer the deal to the Commission under the EU mergers regulations.  Up to now we have not heard if the Minister intends to do this and I ask him to say if this is his intention.  Tesco has engaged in a massive public relations exercise.  By making a joint statement with Tesco, the Minister tied his hands in the matter and nobbled himself in terms of any future intervention he may make on the matter in Europe.  I ask him to refer the take-over to the Commission under Article 9 of the EU mergers regulations.</P>
      <P>Tesco notified the EU Competition Commission of the take-over yesterday and a case handler has been appointed to examine the matter. The EU appears to be indicating that it has no problem with the take-over as it has not received any objections from the Minister or the Department.  If the Minister refers the deal to the Commission under the mergers regulations this will stand as an objection and he will then be in a strong position to extract written commitments from Tesco.  When these commitments are secured the objection can be withdrawn and the take-over can proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> When I met the representatives of Tesco I received a commitment in regard to the staff of Quinnsworth.  While I am concerned about this matter it is not my main worry as the company will require good staff, which Quinnsworth has, if it wants to give a good service.  My main concern relates to Quinnsworth's Irish suppliers who have been very loyal to Quinnsworth, which in turn has been very loyal to them.  In the UK Tesco carries 50 per cent own brand products, while Quinnsworth-Crazy Prices carries 15 per cent own brand products.  I could not get a commitment from its representatives that Tesco would continue to buy the same quantity of products from Irish suppliers as Quinnsworth currently buys.</P>
    <P>I made the relevant point that our economy is buoyant and growing and there is high consumer spending.  One does not have to be Cassandra to know that during the next two years there will be changes and a decline in the level of growth.  It is interesting to note that today's edition of the <i>Financial Times</i> states that if our growth rate falls by 1 per cent next year we will not be in a position to meet the Maastricht guidelines.  If this happens Tesco will want to cut corners.  Yet we will not have extracted any commitment from it in regard to this issue.</P>
    <P>The company must also give a commitment to locate its buying offices in Ireland, to maintain the Quinnsworth distribution system for at least three years and to comply with the fair trade provisions. When a new store sets up in a foreign country it cuts prices.  While this may seem to be of benefit to consumers it is of only short-term duration.  I am concerned that the entry of Tesco to the Irish market may lead to predatory pricing. It is, therefore, vital that the fair trade provisions of the groceries order be retained.  We all remember the collapse of H. Williams and the consequent loss of a significant number of jobs. Given that Tesco needs the Minister's support to secure EU approval for the deal, if he lodges an objection he will be in a strong position to seek such written assurances.  I ask the Minister to use his clout to obtain written assurances from Tesco that it will continue to buy from Irish suppliers in at least the same quantities as Quinnsworth.</P>

      <P>Given the scale of the transaction, the proposed take-over of Quinnsworth-Crazy Prices and Stewarts-Crazy Prices in Northern Ireland by Tesco was notified by the parties to the European Commission on 1 April and copied by the Commission to all member states in accordance with EU Merger Regulation No. 4064/89.  Under the terms of this European regulation the Commission has until 5 May to decide whether to initiate proceedings or to declare the proposed acquisition compatible with the common market.  Given the importance of the matter to the economy, officials from my Department will discuss it with the European Commission this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> I met IBEC and its Food, Drink and Tobacco Federation on 26 March 1997.  At a subsequent meeting on the same day I discussed the proposed acquisition with the chief executive of Tesco plc. and the managing director of Power Supermarkets, which trades as Quinnsworth.  I had a full and fruitful discussion of all the issues relevant to the proposed merger.  As a result of the discussion, the following commitments were made by the Tesco representatives: to grow the business; existing commitments to employees in terms of pay and conditions would be honoured; sound relations would be maintained with employees and their representatives and there would be ongoing consultations with recognised trade unions; they would adopt a partnership approach to employment relationships; the level of beneficial resources on purchasing and technology in Ireland available to Irish suppliers will be enhanced with a view to ensuring that the amount purchased will be maintained and increased; they will adopt a developmental approach to foster new and emerging Irish suppliers involving, for example, mentoring, quality enhancement and support for SMEs for the Irish and European market for own brand and branded products. There will be consultation with Forbairt and An Bord Bia concerning the development of supplier existence and recruitment programmes; as business requirements in Ireland evolve there will be ongoing consultations with distributors and they will honour the obligations set out in the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, including those related to credit terms and below cost selling. Hello money applies there also.  Tesco has since written to me confirming the above arrangements.</P>
    <P>As regards the Article 9 procedure to which the Deputy referred, this is one of the issues officials in my Department will be discussing this week with the European Commission.  Under that provision the Commission may decide to refer a case for consideration by a national authority if it believes there is a distinct market and that there is a threat to create or strengthen a dominant position, as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded.  There are a number of issues on which the Commission would have to decide before the matter could fall to be considered by a national authority.  This is an issue of which I am very conscious and the Article 9 procedure is one I am exploring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the serious problem of the outbreak of Newcastle disease in my constituency which could devastate the local economy and adversely affect 1,000 workers and producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serious questions must be answered.  How many hatcheries supplied the 2,000 infected birds?  Were the birds inspected by Department officials on arrival at the farm?  Were any checks made on the health of those birds?  What was the <Col N="337" /> time span between the delivery of the chicks and the visit by Department officials?</P>
    <P>The importation of those broiler chicks was an act of gross irresponsibility which demands a clear explanation from the Minister of State.  If an individual imported diseased poultry, the Special Branch would be called in.  The poultry industry is one of the greatest examples of self-help.  Producers have invested millions of pounds of mostly borrowed money in the industry.  No grant aid is available and there is little recognition from the Department or at EU level for primary producers.</P>
    <P>When Newcastle disease first broke out in Northern Ireland I raised the matter with the Minister and highlighted the inherent danger to the industry.  I suggested at that time that an operation similar to Operation Matador, launched in the BSE case, should be put in place to ensure poultry from Northern Ireland was not brought across the Border.</P>
    <P>I tabled a question on 26 March to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the proposals, if any, he had to ensure County Monaghan is self-sufficient in the production of chicks for the broiler industry in view of the danger of importing disease.  I was told that of the three plants, one processed broilers and production from that firm's hatchery was more than sufficient to meet existing requirements.</P>
    <P>Inquiries made by me revealed that there was no need to import those broilers.  Some weeks ago the Department issued a licence to import 20,000 broiler chicks.  Those chicks were so badly infected 80 per cent died within days.  The infection was not related to Newcastle disease or any other disease but to the feed.  That is the reason I want to know the time span between the arrival of the chicks and their examination by Department officials.</P>
    <P>The increasingly health conscious customer regards poultry as good value for money.  The confidence of the customer is based on the vigilant protection of our avian health status and the stringent measures in place at the premises of all primary producers, in hatcheries and processing plants.</P>
    <P>Poultry production is very important to the economy of my constituency.  Satellite growers operate in most parts of the constituency with a heavy concentration in my area of north Monaghan where we have approximately 60 per cent of broiler production, 60 per cent of egg production, 80 per cent of turkey production and all of the duck production.  The industry employs 1,000 workers in processing plants.  Hundreds of people are employed by growers, in the feed mills and by hauliers who offer steady employment.</P>
    <P>Inquiries made in the Department since this <Col N="338" /> episode reveal that the Department has no control over the importation of chicks from Northern Ireland.  We are entirely dependent on the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture in that regard.  There was no excuse for the importation of those 20,000 broilers because plants in counties Monaghan and Cavan process 300,000 broilers every week in their hatcheries.  The importation was criminal because it was so unnecessary.  I ask the Minister of State to answer the questions I put to him.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  He raised a number of questions to which I am unable to reply.  I suggest that he raise them with me afterwards and I will seek the answers for him as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties caused by the recently introduced temporary ban on imports from Northern Ireland of live poultry and hatching eggs other than live poultry for direct slaughter.  As the Deputy will be aware, Newcastle disease is highly infectious and can cause large-scale losses in any poultry enterprise, although it does not pose any public health risk to the consumer.  At least 22 cases of a very virulent form of the disease have now been confirmed in Northern Ireland resulting in a massive number of compulsory slaughterings in that region.</P>
      <P>Since the outbreak of the disease in Northern Ireland, extra precautions have been introduced here, including requirements for additional health certification and the introduction of voluntary vaccination against the disease.  However, despite these additional precautions, a case of Newcastle disease was confirmed in County Cavan on 4 April on a holding where two consignments of poultry had been recently imported from Northern Ireland.  This involved the death or slaughter of some 20,000 birds on the premises and the introduction of a control zone of at least 10 kilometres around the holding.  These restrictions have already caused hardship for those poultry producers within that area.</P>
      <P>The confirmation of the disease outbreak in County Cavan has also raised serious issues as to the possibility of further threats to our health status.  For this reason it was decided to temporarily ban the importation of further consignments of live poultry and hatching eggs until Thursday, 10 April to give the Standing Veterinary Committee in Brussels the possibility of discussing the matter at its meeting on 8 and 9 April.  The ban will be reviewed following the outcome of these discussions.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 9 April 1997.</P>

      <P>The Government, at its meeting on 11 March 1997, agreed to the Minister's proposals for new broadcasting legislation.  The proposals were published on 18 March 1997 in a document entitled Clear Focus &mdash; The Government's Proposals for Broadcasting Legislation, nó sa leagan Gaeilge, Fócas Géar &mdash; Moltaí an Rialtais do Reachtaíocht Chraolacháin, copies of which were placed in the Oireachtas Library on that day.  The Minister's intention in publishing the proposals was to assist further debate in this area.  The scheme of the Bill proposed has been referred to the Attorney General for drafting.  However, the Minister will take further suggestions and comments on the proposals into consideration during the drafting process and before Government approval is secured for the formal text of the Bill to be introduced in the Oireachtas in due course.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>In its letter of 26 February 1997, the European Commission stated that, as only a small proportion of the work on the Mullaghmore project was completed and that as this work failed to achieve the purpose envisaged, a significant change had occurred which was in contravention of the conditions for which the moneys were granted.</P>
      <P>DG XVI of the Commission has made a recommendation to its commissioner that, as the moneys granted under Decision C (89)2258/7 of 21 December 1989 were not used for the purpose originally applied for, the Commission is bound under its own rules of procedure to reclaim said moneys.</P>
      <P>Ireland's contention is that no reduction of assistance should be effected pursuant to Article 24 on the grounds that Ireland did not act in bad faith, committed no irregularity and received no funds unduly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>In the early 1990s the Irish film industry was at an historically low ebb, with only two to three feature film productions being produced here each year.  Nonetheless, the success of productions such as &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo; indicated the potential which existed for an Irish film industry and for the creation of substantial employment in such an industry.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, the Government has introduced a package of measures designed to develop the industry and to provide the necessary capital investment for film production.  The measures include: the re-establishment of Bord Scannán na hÉireann-the Irish Film Board and its funding under the EU Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1994-1999 to provide development and production loans to film producers; the enhancement of the section 35 tax relief scheme to favour a substantially increased level of private investment in film production; the statutory provision for RTE to allocate a specified and increasing proportion of its resources to programming commissioned from the independent production sector, reaching a plateau in 1999 of the greater of £12.5 million or 20 per cent of television programmes; the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge which is an important new source of commissioning from the independent production sector; the establishment of STATCOM, a grouping of the relevant Government Departments and State agencies involved in different aspects of the promotion of the film and independent television production sector, whose remit is to remove all remaining obstacles to the full development of the sector over time; the establishment, on foot of a major report commissioned by STATCOM, of a national training committee for film and television production, to implement the strategies of the report; participation by Ireland in European funding and support strategies such as the EU MEDIA II Programme and EURIMAGES, the Council of Europe's Film Co-Production Fund.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these considerable policy interventions in support of the industry, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Government is constantly reviewing its policies in this area and has only recently announced significantly new improvements to the section 35 investment incentive scheme.  The Finance Bill, 1997, provides for the following improvements: an increase in the ceiling levels of investment for higher budget film productions from £7.5 million to £15 million; a 10 per cent top-up for post-production in Ireland; and a greater participation by corporate investors in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> All the foregoing measures are designed to increase employment in the industry, while also acknowledging the strong cultural significance of film and television production.  To illustrate the employment impact of the measures I have cited, I should inform the Deputy that employment figures produced by IBEC in its annual reports on the economic impact of film production in Ireland from 1993 to 1995, the latest year for which figures have been compiled, show a dramatic increase in employment levels in the industry.</P>
    <P>Whereas in 1993 there were 3,772 placements in feature film and animation production, comprising 480 full-time equivalents of employment, in 1995, the number of placements had risen to 14,329, comprising 1,088 full-time equivalents of employment.</P>
    <P>Membership of the cinema and broadcasting branch of SIPTU also gives a good indication of the increasing level of activity in the industry.  In December 1991, I understand that the branch had 496 members; that at the end of 1994, this number had increased to 815 and that, at present, membership totals 1,449.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware from replies to previous parliamentary questions on this matter that the Minister has long been in favour of the introduction of a formal scheme to encourage people to donate paintings and works of art to the State.</P>
      <P>Section 176 of the Finance Act, 1995, provides for a scheme under which tax relief is given for the donation to national collections of pre-eminent heritage items up to an aggregate limit of £500,000 in any one year.  This limit was subsequently increased to £750,000 in the Finance Act, 1996.  Under this scheme an independent assessment committee, comprising the directors of the National Library, Irish Museum of Modern Art, National Museum, National Archives, National Gallery as well as the director of the Arts Council and the chairperson of the Heritage Council, was established to decide whether an object (or objects) would qualify for tax relief. The donations must comprise an archaeological item, archive, book, record, manuscript or painting (or collection of these) valued at more than £75,000 and be deemed by the assessment committee to be pre-eminent in its class.</P>
      <P>The committee has processed successfully a number of cases, resulting in substantial donations to our national cultural institutions.</P>
      <P>As required by the Finance Act, 1995, the outcomes of applications made to the committee were detailed in the Revenue Commissioners report for 1995 and details of future applications will be published in future reports of the commissioners.</P>

      <P>It is expected that the Inland Waterways Boat Rally will arrive in Dublin on 19 April 1997.  The Grand Canal festival will start on 17 April with an angling tutorial to be organised with the assistance of the Dublin Angling Initiative through local schools and the event will concentrate on the stretch of canal near the eighth lock.  A canals seminar will be convened in Ballyfermot library on 18 April to provide a forum for local interests to air views on the future development of the canal in their area.  On 19 April, music, children's activities and water activities will be organised in the area between the M50 bridge and the sixth lock after the incoming boating rally has passed through.  There will also be a presentation of awards for a poster competition which will be held at Killeen House, Ballyfermot.  The posters will then be put on public display in Ballyfermot library for a week.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that a 100 metre timber jetty will be built at the ninth lock.  The existing bank will be slightly excavated to allow the structure to be inset into the bank.  The estimated cost of the works, including excavation, will be £65,000, and the estimated time for completion will be eight to ten weeks.  It is proposed that the work will commence at the end of the current boating season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> A planning application for the proposed national distribution park at Clonburris, Clondalkin is at present under consideration by South Dublin County Council.  The waterways service is examining the proposal in relation to the impact of the development on canal property.  However, I can say that the proposed development will not affect either the canal festival or the jetty proposal which I have outlined above.</P>

      <P>I have been privileged, as chairperson of the Government's Famine Commemoration Committee, to have co-ordinated or attended numerous ceremonies commemorating the Great Famine in Ireland and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> Events in Ireland included the following: launched women's archive exhibition on women, famine and emigration; launched Teagasc famine exhibition in Derry, Ballina and Galway; presented schools famine essay competition prizes; organised famine commemoration concert, Dublin; attended ceremony in National Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin; launched the Famine Commemoration Committee/RTE TV documentary on the Great Famine; organised ecumenical service of remembrance in Tuam, County Galway; attended a number of famine commemoration Masses and ecumenical services organised by local groups, including a Mass for the victims of the Famine in Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Ballinasloe, County Galway; attended ceremony at the Paupers Graveyard in Fermanagh; opened the Cork archives famine exhibition &ldquo;Our Dark Legacy&rdquo; in Cork public museum; launched publications on the Famine, including &ldquo;Transactions of the Central Relief Committee of the Society of Friends during the Famine&rdquo; in the Irish Film Centre, Dublin; opened conferences and summer schools dealing with the theme of the Famine, including the Douglas Hyde and Parnell Summer Schools; unveiled famine memorials and plaques in many parts of the country, including Ballygarrett, County Wexford and Dungarvan, County Waterford.</P>
    <P>Events abroad included the following:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Britain</i>
    </P>
    <P>&mdash;Organised and attended Liverpool commemoration concert.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Australia</i>
    </P>
    <P>&mdash;Famine commemoration concert and lecture tour in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.</P>
    <P>
      <i>USA-Canada</i>
    </P>
    <P>&mdash;Famine commemoration lecture tour in Chicago, South Bend Indiana, San Francisco, San Diego, Washington, New York, Boston and Montreal.</P>
    <P>Further ceremonies-events being planned by the Government's Famine Commemoration Committee include: organising a major international conference on the Famine in Dublin Castle in May; attending Great Irish Famine event in Millstreet, County Cork in June; unveiling of national memorial to the Famine at Murrisk, County Mayo in July and opening famine photographic exhibition in Guinness Hop Store in August.</P>
    <P>The Irish famine of 1845-50 was the greatest disaster of modern Irish history.  The potato blight took the lives of over a million of our people and drove a further million into exile.  The emotional scars of this tragedy are still with us. Until recent years the pain of the Famine was too close to allow us to confront the memories of those days.  We need to mourn our dead and <Col N="350" /> grieve for our loss.  This commemoration has offered the opportunity to complete the grieving and healing process that was not possible at the 100th anniversary as the Famine was still too close, the pain still too acute.</P>
    <P>The Government's commemoration programme, together with the thousands of voluntary community groups at home and abroad, has offered the opportunity to the Irish to learn and understand the Famine in all its pain and complexity.</P>

      <P>The annual labour force survey (LFS) provides statistics for regions but, unfortunately, does not give results at county level.  The latest LFS results relate to April 1996.  The estimated number of persons at work in the Border region (which includes Cavan and Monaghan) was 127,200 in April 1994, 132,900 in April 1995 and 131,700 in April 1996.  These figures are based on the principal economic status classification.</P>
      <P>The latest corresponding county figures are based on the 1991 census of population.  In the April 1991 census, 17,268 persons in Cavan and 16,474 persons in Monaghan were classified as at work.  Corresponding results from the 1996 census will be available in the first half of 1998.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's consistent support for the principle that, wherever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families.  He will also know that it has repeatedly been made clear to the British authorities that we stand ready to receive republican prisoners under the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  Six prisoners have so far been transferred from prison in Britain to prison in this jurisdiction and it is hoped that the transfer of other prisoners, including those referred to by the Deputy, will follow in line with the humanitarian objectives of the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the length of time taken to process applications, the Deputy will appreciate that operational responsibility for the Convention on <Col N="353" /> the Transfer of Sentenced Persons between Ireland and Britain lies with the Department of Justice on the Irish side and with the Home Office on the British side.  In this context, I would refer him to the responses given my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, to Question No. 239 on 15 October 1996 and to Question No. 217 on 19 March 1997.</P>
    <P>On my instructions, the status of individual prisoners' requests for transfer continues to be pursued with the relevant British authorities by the Irish Embassy in London as part of its ongoing contacts on a range of matters of concern to Irish prisoners in Britain.  While we have so far received no definite indication from the relevant British authorities as to when a decision can be expected on the applications for transfer made by the two individuals to which the Deputy refers, I would assure him that our pursuit of the transfer issue, and these particular applications, will continue in the period ahead.</P>

      <P>The Cuban authorities have indicated on a number of occasions, most recently in the course of a bilateral meeting at official level last September, that they would welcome the establishment of diplomatic relations with Ireland.  Our response has been that, because of the small size of our foreign service and the limited resources available for its expansion, we are not in a position to respond positively.  However, the establishment of diplomatic relations will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>The absence of diplomatic relations does not prevent the development of friendly and co-operative links between our two countries through other channels.</P>

      <P>Ireland's position, and that of the EU as a whole, regarding US legislation with extraterritorial effect is well known.  To provide a comprehensive, effective and EU-wide protection for citizens and companies within the EU whose economic and financial interests are or are likely to be affected by such legislation, the Council of the European Union has adopted legal measures protecting against the effects of extraterritorial legislation adopted by a third country and actions based thereon or resulting therefrom.  The Council regulation is binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all member states.  Each member state is responsible for determining penalties to be imposed in the event of breach of the regulation's provisions.  Arrangements are in hand with regard to the preparation of the necessary measures.</P>

      <P>The Joint Commission for Economic, Industrial, Scientific and Technical Co-operation between Ireland and the Islamic Republic of Iran last met in Dublin in 1994.  There have been some scheduling difficulties on both sides in fixing mutually convenient dates for the next meeting, which is to be held in Iran.  Meanwhile, I have spoken a number of times to my Iranian counterpart who is co-chairman of the joint commission, most recently at our meeting last autumn in New York.  I also met the Deputy Speaker of the Iranian parliament who led a visiting delegation to Ireland on 14-15 November, and the Secretary of my Department had a meeting with the Deputy Foreign Minister of Iran on 29 November.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to visit Libya, but the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry made a visit there in July 1996.</P>
      <P>I visited Egypt and Russia in 1996 and have had numerous contacts with their Governments in relation both to European Union business and to specifically Irish interests such as beef and cattle exports.  For example, I expect to see the Foreign Minister of Egypt at a meeting in Malta next week, and the Foreign Minister of Russia at a meeting in May.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to change the regulations governing the PAYE tax system in relation to employees in receipt of short-term disability benefit during and after absence from work due to illness in view of the fact that in some instances, but particularly in circumstances where employees are not paid directly by the company while out sick, employees are having difficulties paying periodic payment during their absence from work, mainly because their tax allowances are not apportioned during that period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Finance Bill, in line with the commitment in Partnership 2000, provides for the first three weeks of disability benefit payments in the tax year 1997-98, and the first six weeks from 1998-99 tax year onwards, being disregarded for tax purposes. Child dependant additions payable with disability benefit are already disregarded for tax purposes since 6 April 1995.</P>
      <P>The exemption period should cover the majority of absences by employees.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that during the tax exemption period no adjustments for tax purposes are required and the cumulative system of PAYE continues unchanged.</P>
      <P>If an employee is out of work due to illness after the exemption period expires the cumulative basis of PAYE can be maintained either by the employer including the disability benefit as notional earnings on the tax deduction card and continuing the normal cumulative basis of PAYE or by the employee notifying the tax office to have his-her tax-free allowance restricted by the taxable amount of disability benefit.  The revised tax-free allowance will then be issued on a cumulative basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have conducted a review of all aspects of the operation of the customs mobile task units (MTUs) with particular regard to staffing, organisation and overall effectiveness.  At present MTU teams are distributed across 25 centres, of which 17 are single MTU centres.  The consequences of single unit centres are diffused management of the service, the associated problems of underdeveloped <Col N="357" /> resource allocation and performance management.  The objective is to transform the MTU service into a more effective operation where staff activities are better targeted and directed.  A key element in the new MTU service is the development of its wider potential in tackling tax evasion generally.</P>
      <P>In relation to County Donegal, it is proposed to centralise three of the four existing single MTU centres in Letterkenny.  This centralisation will assist in the modernisation and development of the MTU service in the area, in which upgraded information technology and risk analysis techniques will play an important role.</P>
      <P>A unit of the Customs National Drugs Team (CNDT) is also located in Letterkenny with responsibility for the Donegal area.  This unit has built up many contacts both inside the county and amongst the coastal communities.  The wide distribution of the coastal and airfield reporting packs under the Drug Watch Programme, which enlists the assistance of coastal communities, maritime personnel, people residing in close proximity to airfields and other members of the public and encourages the reporting of unusual occurrences in their areas to customs by freefone or freepost, has played an important role in this regard.  Coastal observations in County Donegal will continue as a priority for the Letterkenny-based CNDT staff who can call on the assistance of the Sligo-based maritime unit and sniffer dog unit, as required.  MTU staff will, of course, continue to support the CNDT staff in the normal course of day-to-day operations.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I am satisfied that the centralisation of the MTUs in Letterkenny, with the resultant loss of one unit, will not adversely affect the role of customs in County Donegal in the battle against the illegal importation of drugs.</P>

      <P>The position regarding VAT rates is governed by European VAT law with which Irish law must comply. Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, member states may retain the zero rates that they had in place on 1 January 1991, but they are prohibited from introducing new zero rates.  As hurleys were not zero rated at that time, it is not open to the Government to apply such a rate.</P>
      <P>As regards a reduced rate, goods and services to which reduced rating may apply are listed in Annex H of the EU Sixth VAT Directive.  In addition, items not on this list, but which were at a reduced rate on 1 January 1991, may, if a member state so decides, be placed at a &ldquo;parking rate&rdquo;, i.e. a rate not less than 12 per cent, for the duration of the transitional regime.  As hurleys are not listed in the Directive, nor were they at a reduced rate on 1 January 1991, the standard rate, currently 21 per cent, must be applied.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is especially keen to encourage enterprise development. I am particularly conscious that small businesses such as private nursing homes which operate within the services sector have the capacity to provide employment and generate significant income in local areas throughout the country. Accordingly, much of this Government's tax policies have been geared towards easing the tax burden on businesses which operate in the services sector and creating a suitable environment which will encourage entrepreneurs to develop and expand their businesses.  The introduction of a reduced rate of corporation tax, now at 28 per <Col N="360" /> cent, on annual profits up to £50,000 is a case in point.</P>
      <P>For a nursing home starting up, capital allowances are available for plant and machinery used in the course of providing nursing home facilities, for example, beds, furniture and other equipment, at a rate of 15 per cent per annum for the first six years and 10 per cent in year seven. Unused allowances in any particular accounting period may be carried forward and offset against future profits.</P>
      <P>I should mention that relief for pre-trading expenses will now be available to new businesses such as nursing homes which commence trading on or after 22 January 1997.  I introduced this relief in this year's budget to promote new business development.  Under the relief, expenses which are wholly and exclusively incurred for the purpose of a trade or profession not more than three years prior to the commencement of trading and which would have been deductible had they been incurred after trading commenced will be deductible against the trading income of the business. Examples of expenses which would be deductible are feasibility studies and wages.  Staff training costs incurred prior to the commencement of trading are also deductible.</P>

      <P>Whether an individual is engaged under a contract of service (employee) is a question of fact and law.  The decision by the Revenue Commissioners to treat meter readers as being employed under a contract of service (PAYE) rather than under a contract of service (self-employed) was confirmed at an appeal commissioners hearing (in another similar case) on 5 June 1986.  A change in the designation of such workers is not contemplated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had inquiries made of the Southern Health Board in the case mentioned by the Deputy and I understand that there was a resident general practitioner, in the village in question, who retired from the GMS scheme in 1995. At the time of his retirement, the board was in favour of allocating the small list of medical card patients among the 19 general practitioners who practised within a ten mile radius of the village. However, in response to requests from the local <Col N="363" /> community, the board agreed to provide a surgery service in the village on a daily basis and to monitor the position.  In early 1996, the board carried out a survey of patients attending the surgery and the response was that the service was satisfactory.  Over the past year, the number of patients attending the surgery was small, with as few as one or two patients attending on some days and in the circumstances, the doctor providing the service felt that four surgeries per week would be adequate.  The Thursday surgery was cancelled and the other four were extended.</P>
    <P>The doctor concerned has her main surgery some three miles from the village in question and is available there and for house calls on Thursday. I understand that no complaints have been received by the board from patients about the level of service in the village and the board is satisfied that the service being provided is adequate for the needs of the area and utilises the doctor's time in an efficient and effective manner.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The administration of the civil registration system is a matter for An tÁrd Chláraitheoir (Registrar-General) of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for local registrars who act under his general direction.  The provisions governing marriage in front of a registrar of marriages are contained in the various Marriage Acts, 1844 to 1995, including the Marriage (Ireland) Act, 1844 and the Registration of Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1863, and also in regulations made in 1892 under those Acts, which are binding on registrars.  Paragraph 34 of these regulations provides that where notice is served for the marriage of a divorced person the register should at once refer the case to An tÁrd Chláraitheoir and not proceed further until authorised to do so.  The powers for the investigation of the freedom of the parties to marry derives from the provisions of the 1844 Act and the 1863 Act referred to above.</P>
      <P>The provisions of section 5 (1) of the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986, apply to the divorce in question, and accordingly the divorce would be recognisable in Irish law if either party to the divorce was domiciled in the jurisdiction in which the divorce was granted on the date of institution of divorce proceedings. The burden of proving that a person has relinquished his-her domicile of origin is an onerous one and where this question has arisen it is necessary to have regard to the circumstances surrounding a foreign divorce to establish whether a lawful impediment exists in relation to a particular proposed marriage.  An tÁrd Chláraitheoir has advised that, in the case in question, the evidence furnished to his office did not clearly and unequivocally point to the relinquishment of the domicile of origin and the acquisition of a domicile of choice in the relevant jurisdiction in respect of either party to the divorce.  Accordingly, it was advised that the proposed marriage should not take place.</P>

      <P>I hope to make arrangements in the near future for the publication of an assessment of the need for services for persons with a mental handicap as identified by the national intellectual disability database.</P>
      <P>However, my understanding is that the database indicates that the number of persons with a mental handicap who have not got a service is considerably less than the figures quoted by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Additional funding amounting to £12 million has been made available for the further development in 1997 of services to persons with a mental handicap.  This is being used to meet identified needs in existing services, to provide additional residential-respite places and day care places, to improve services for persons with autism and to continue the ongoing programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from inappropriate placements to more appropriate care settings.</P>
      <P>Details of the precise services to be put in place in each health board region are agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees in line with the priority needs which have been identified for each region.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The primary responsibility of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is to ensure that all <Col N="366" /> legal requirements and best industry practices are being observed in respect of food safety and hygiene.  This will include ensuring that the labelling of foodstuffs complies with the standards prescribed in the relevant EU legislation and in the national legislation giving effect to the EU measures.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the importance which those suffering from food allergies attach to information on, for example, food labels and menus and I know this is among the issues being considered at EU level as part of an examination of how allergy sufferers could be afforded better protection.</P>
      <P>However, in view of the wide range of circumstances which can give rise to allergic reactions and the difficulties this could present in ensuring a standard that would be adequate in all circumstances, it may be some time before the EU Commission is in a position to come forward with proposals to amend the existing EU legislation in this area.  Nevertheless, given the importance of the matter, I will encourage and support any proposals which would provide better information to food allergy sufferers about ingredients that are likely to cause allergic reactions.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 82, 83, 84, 85 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>Domiciliary care allowance is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 years who are so severely physically or mentally disabled that they need care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.  The allowance is not intended to cover the cost of aids and appliances.  However, separate funds are available to health boards for aids and appliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is knowledge about spina bifida and hydrocephalus among relevant personnel in the <Col N="369" /> health services, acquired from education, training and clinical experience.  I understand that the Irish Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus has produced an information pack on various aspects of the conditions and how to manage them.  In addition, the association has been in contact with my Department seeking funding for the publication of other information leaflets.  This request will be considered when drafts of the leaflets are submitted to the Department.</P>
    <P>It is part of the remit of social workers employed in hospitals to provide a service for any patient &mdash; whatever their illness or disability &mdash; where that need is seen to be appropriate for social work intervention.  The provision of further social work services for people with disabilities was discussed in the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, as part of a range of services for people with disabilities. Officials of my Department are in discussion with the health boards about the implementation of the report.</P>
    <P>Incontinence wear is provided to children from the age of two to three years throughout the health boards.  Regarding the criteria for the provision of incontinence wear, I understand that health boards assess applicants on an individual basis taking account of their particular medical requirements and supplies are provided according <Col N="370" /> to need.  Accordingly, there is no specified quantity supplied on the basis of a particular condition.</P>
    <P>Standard aids and appliances are provided free of charge to children suffering from spina bifida and hydrocephalus on foot of a recommendation from a medical practitioner or health professional following an assessment of the child's particular needs.</P>

To that end, the ministerial committee on Sellafield has sought and received from the North-Eastern Health Board a proposal for a <Col N="371" /> comprehensive programme of research.  The proposed programme would include studies of the possible health effects of ionising radiation on the population in the area, the establishment of a surveillance system for congenital malformations in the area, and a research programme to determine the epidemiology of cancers in the region and to report on the risk factors for the population.  This proposal is being examined at present.</P>

The duration of the registration-diploma programme is 156 weeks spread over three academic years.  Successful completion of the programme leads to registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais and the award of a diploma in nursing from the associated third level institute.

      <P>After completion of the diploma programme, a one academic year programme leading to a degree in nursing will be available from third level institutes.  The Department is currently engaged in consultations with a number of third level institutes in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes which will be open both to nurses who successfully complete the registration-diploma programme and to nurses who have qualified or will qualify under the traditional model of education and training.  As the degree programme will be an optional post-registration qualification, registered nurses wishing to undertake the programme will be responsible for making their own arrangements and for meeting the associated costs.</P>

The number of those apart from permanent established civil servants was provided in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 420 of 10 February 1993.  Approximate full year staff costs for that year for unestablished staff were as indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 267 of 8 February, 1994, vol. 438, col. 991 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The estimated staff costs for these offices for 1997 are, in respect of salaries of unestablished staff, as indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 172 of 25 March, 1997.  In this context I would like to correct the reference in that reply to an increase over the figure supplied in response to Parliamentary Question No. 33 of 19 February, 1997, which was intended to read as a reference to an increase over the figure supplied in response to Parliamentary Question No. 83 of 19 December, 1996.  The approximate figure for other staff costs of unestablished staff (PRSI) is £12,000.  The figure for staff costs for established staff is approximately £170,000, which compares with a full year cost figure for established staff in 1993 of approximately £198,000, i.e. a reduction in established staff costs of approximately £28,000 in 1997 as compared with 1993.</P>

      <P>Fiscal reliefs available include tax relief under section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982, as amended by section 18 of the Finance Act, 1994.  This provides for full relief from income tax or corporation tax to the owner or occupier of a building of significant historical, architectural or aesthetic interest in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance, or restoration of such a building, subject to the provision of public access to the building.  This relief also extends to any garden or grounds of an ornamental nature occupied or enjoined with such a building.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Council which is a statutory, autonomous body under the Heritage Act, 1995, has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, to persons and bodies in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of, <i>inter alia</i>, the architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>The conservation and restoration of urban architecture and heritage buildings has also been addressed by the Minister for the Environment, in the context of the urban and village renewal sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Local and Rural Development which was launched on 2 February 1995 by the Taoiseach. This sub-programme, <i>inter alia,</i> provides support to civic trusts, conservation groups and local authorities to promote various urban conservation measures in towns throughout the country.  The scheme involves giving grant aid to local authorities and other bodies on the basis of matching funds from local sources.  The objective is to rehabilitate the built environment, in city-town centre areas, through the conservation and restoration of urban architecture and heritage buildings.</P>
      <P>Under the urban renewal schemes, operated by the Department of the Environment, the full construction costs incurred in the refurbishment of an existing building in a designated area for residential purposes can be offset against the owner-occupier's and-or lessor's tax liability over a period of ten years.  In the case of existing buildings which are refurbished for certain approved commercial uses, excluding offices, half of the construction costs can be offset against the owner-occupier's and-or lessor's tax liability over a period of ten years.  These incentives apply to heritage buildings in the same way as to other buildings. In general, the urban renewal tax incentives schemes favour refurbishment over new construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the interdepartmental working group on strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage contains a number of recommendations for the introduction of a package of financial incentives <Col N="379" /> for owners of listed buildings (Recommendations 45-54), based on a dual approach of fiscal incentives or direct grant aid (Recommendation 45). Work on the preparation of a package of specific financial, administrative and legislative proposals, based on the recommendations in the report and taking account of any observations received on those recommendations, is at a very advanced stage.  I and my colleague, Deputy Howlin, Minister for the Environment, will be bringing this package forward to Government very shortly for consideration.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply to today's Questions Nos. 23 and 30.</P>
      <P>The integrated package of incentives which have been introduced by the Government to develop the Irish film and television production industry are in place until at least the year 1999. These measures provide the industry with the opportunity to build on progress and success to date, and to build a commercial and competitive approach and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The film industry is dependent on specialist skills, talent and creativity.  Forward looking training measures are being implemented by the National Training Committee for Film and Television, based on a comprehensive analysis by STATCOM of the future needs of the industry. These courses will also address the need for business skills and competences to support the creative and technical know-how in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the increase in the number of outlets for audiovisual production and with rapid technological <Col N="380" /> advances, this is a key growth area and one in which we need to see the emergence of strong Irish companies.  It is for all sides of the industry to avail of the opportunities presented by Government supports and developing market-place. Competitiveness will be central to a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>It is my firm belief and conviction that the film and television production industry is a key area for employment growth with the potential for a continuing and sustained increase in employment levels in this country.</P>

      <P>The National Gallery receives funding on an annual basis from Vote 43 of the Estimates for the Public Service.  It has in recent years benefited significantly from increased Exchequer funding.  The annual Vote for non-capital operating expenses has increased from £1,044,000 in 1993 to £1,840,000 in 1997, an increase of 76 per cent over the period.</P>
      <P>As regards new acquisitions, the National Gallery receives an annual grant-in-aid for the purchase and repair of pictures, also from Vote 43. The art acquisition budget has increased from £100,000 in 1993 to £215,000 in 1997, an increase in excess of 100 per cent over the period.</P>
      <P>Recent purchases by the gallery with the acquisition grant include works by Jack B. Yeats, Hugh Douglas Hamilton, Francis Danby, Augustus John and George Mullins.  The gallery makes annual requests for increased funding in the context of the multi-annual budget framework submissions and the annual Vote Estimates process, as do all the cultural institutions within my Department's remit.  Of course I would like to see significantly greater resources available for all these cultural institutions but Government funding is finite and must be tailored to competing needs.</P>
      <P>The gallery has access to other funds in addition to the voted amounts already referred to for the purchase of pictures, namely, the Lane Fund and the Shaw Fund.</P>
      <P>In addition to these funds the gallery is one of the cultural institutions to benefit from donations made with the benefit of tax relief under section 176 of the Finance Act, 1995.  In this regard, the Jack B. Yeats archive valued at £400,000 by the Revenue Commissioners, which was owned by Ms Ann Yeats, the artist's niece, was donated by her to the gallery in 1995.</P>

      <P>Natural heritage areas (NHAs) are still only at the proposal stage and no designation will take place until an amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1976, is passed by the Oireachtas. This amendment will be introduced in the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The proposed NHAs place no formal conditions on these lands and have no affect on the pre-existing use of these lands pending whatever provisions are made in the amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1976.  They do not affect ownership rights, including access, grazing, sporting or turbary rights, or existing land use.  It is intended to protect these sites by obtaining the co-operation and goodwill of land owners and farmers who are asked not to engage in activities likely to damage these areas.</P>
      <P>Even after the Wildlife Act, 1976, is amended, it is intended that the formal designation of NHAs will not involve any compulsory restrictions on the use to which land can be put.  Consequently it is anticipated that the matter of compensation will not arise as a result of NHA designation.</P>

      <P>A proposal from An Chomhairle Ealaíon for the development of a national centre for the performing arts was submitted to my Department, and to a number of other Government Departments and statutory bodies, on 21 March 1997.  The proposal will be given full consideration, and, in so doing, consideration will also have to be given to the arts infrastructure needs of the regions in allocating scarce capital resources.  I should point out, however, that all the capital funding presently at my disposal to support the development of arts and culture infrastructure under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 had been committed prior to the emergence of this proposal.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the importance of the Drumanagh Promontory Fort at Loughshinny, County Dublin, which has been afforded the protection of a preservation order, made under the National Monuments Acts.  Archaeological excavation and any subsequent presentation of the site would be dependent on taking it into State care, which would require very significant Exchequer outlay.  In previous negotiations with the land-owner concerned, agreement could not be reached on the terms of acquisition.  If, in the future, satisfactory terms can be agreed, the question of acquisition would then be reconsidered.</P>

Air quality monitoring results indicate that there have been no exceedances of the relevant limit values since 1 January 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with section 54 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, monitoring is carried out where <Col N="386" /> air pollution is likely to be greatest and where standards may be approached or exceeded.  Monitoring for smoke levels is carried out at 64 mainly local authority managed sites covering the major urban areas of the country.  Monitoring results for the 1996-97 heating season to date continue to demonstrate satisfactory air quality in all monitored areas, with no exceedances, or threatened exceedances of the statutory standards occurring.</P>
    <P>In the case of tropospheric or ground-level ozone (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;summertime smog&rdquo;) the population information threshold (180 microgrammes per cubic metre for the mean value over one hour) under Directive 92/72/EEC was exceeded on 13 occasions since 1 January 1995.  Full particulars of the locations concerned and of the exceedances recorded are set out in the Environmental Protection Agency's report entitled Ozone Monitoring Results and EU Threshold Exceedances for Ireland in 1995, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library.  I have recently made regulations, effective from 1 April 1997, which give statutory effect to the existing administrative procedures regarding the measurement, public information and reporting of tropospheric ozone by the Environmental Protection Agency, with the assistance of Met Éireann.</P>

      <P>Car testing will be carried out at dedicated test centres established and operated by a franchisee to be appointed on a national basis, following an open competitive tendering process.  It is envisaged that test centres will be strategically located in an integrated national network to minimise the distance motorists will be required to travel for a test; in addition, consideration will be given to the use of mobile test centres in more remote areas. The franchisee will be responsible for providing suitable premises for test centres and will not have the authority to appoint agents to carry out testing on its behalf.  The proposed system will be based on dedicated testing centres and will operate independently of commercial garages where servicing and normal repairs are carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose shortly to invite proposals from consultants <Col N="390" /> who will advise and assist the Department in relation to the drawing up and finalisation of tender documents, the evaluation of tender proposals and the drawing up of appropriate legal-contractual arrangements for the appointment of the franchisee.  The tender competition for the testing franchise will follow and the testing system will be introduced as early as possible in 1998.</P>

      <P>In the context of the transfer of ownership of Dublin Corporation housing in the county areas, it was envisaged that a limited level of capital funding would be authorised to meet the cost of necessary once-off works to upgrade the houses and the environment of the transferred estates, and to provide necessary supporting infrastructures.  Fingal County Council has been advised that it is not possible to authorise expenditure to meet a programme of works on the scale submitted by it.  The council has now been requested to submit revised proposals which have regard to the levels of expenditure initially envisaged.</P>
      <P>Additional resources have accrued to the council's revenue account arising from the transfer of houses and these are, and will continue to be, available to contribute to the upkeep of the transferred stock.  The council also recently received an allocation of £500,000 over two years under the estate improvement programme in respect of houses in the Corduff area.</P>

I understand that, following extensive consideration and discussions, Fingal County Council decided that a regional works would not be feasible in this case, due to the difficulty of identifying a suitable site, and that an approach based on extending the existing treatment plants at Swords, Malahide and Donabate-Portrane was preferable.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161, 175, 178 and 191 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the cases made by the schools in question for a remedial teacher service.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
      <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>I understand that, following her departure from the training centre at the end of the three year programme, she secured local employment and is viewed by the centre as having made excellent progress.</P>
      <P>At this stage, I would suggest that the needs of the person in question could best be addressed through availing of an adult literacy programme. Application to participate in such a programme can be made to the local vocational education committee.</P>

      <P>The vocational training opportunity scheme was established in 1989 to cater specifically for people over 21 years of age and classified as being long-term unemployed.  It was on this basis the EU financial support was obtained.</P>
      <P>The main aim of the scheme is to provide a second chance education opportunity to long-term unemployed people who have demonstrated through the signing on process that they are unemployed and seeking employment.  In this context the EU is most anxious that the older segment of the unemployed population should be catered for.</P>
      <P>Because of the focus of the vocational training opportunity scheme on the long-term unemployed, it is regretted that it is not possible to reduce the minimum age requirement.</P>
      <P>The position regarding eligibility for the scheme will, however, be kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 and 188 together.</P>
      <P>Of the 55 additional remedial teacher posts allocated to primary schools for the 1995-96 school year, three were appointed to schools in County Meath.  No additional posts were allocated during the current school year.  A total of 34 remedial teachers are currently in place in primary schools in County Meath.  The number of such posts in County Donegal is 37.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to indicate whether additional remedial teacher posts will be made available to primary schools for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any year is determined by resource availability in that year and the level of competing demands from other special needs areas.  The position regarding the 1997-98 school year has not yet been decided.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wide range of special needs, including the need for additional remedial teacher posts.  I am satisfied that, since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <Quest>if the increase in fees for university students at UCD was notified to her Department; if so, if she agreed to such increases; her views on whether the increased disparity between these fees and the fees of other third level institutions is warranted; and the action, if any, she proposes to take to rectify the position.</Quest>

      <P>I assume that the fees referred to by the Deputy are fees, such as deferral fees for examinations and for late payment of fees.  These fees arise in the main from the needs of the institutions to meet the administrative and other costs involved in making the necessary arrangements and providing the various services to students.  As such, these fees fall within the day to day operational arrangements in the institutions and it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister for Education, to seek to interfere in this area.  The governance and management of universities is primarily a matter for the institutions within the broad constraints of the effective and efficient use of resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to developments envisaged under <i>A Government of Renewal</i> which sets out the agreed programme of the present Government.</P>
      <P>In terms of educational provision for special needs children, a key element of that programme was the commitment to the completion and early publication of the White Paper on Education and the introduction of subsequent legislation.  The Deputy will be aware of the very significant progress which has already been made in honouring this commitment.</P>
      <P>The fundamental objective of the White Paper is to ensure to the maximum possible extent that all children with disabilities will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own areas and within the ordinary school system.</P>
      <P>The White Paper sets out a range of proposed strategies for the achievement of this objective, including the establishment of a national data base to facilitate the planning of provision for all students with disabilities; the designation of a number of ordinary primary schools as centres where children with particular disabilities may be educated; an expanded role for existing special schools in dealing with a variety of disabilities; and the setting up of curriculum development projects for students with special educational needs.</P>
      <P>The White Paper envisages that, following their establishment, education boards will have statutory responsibility to ensure that adequate educational provision is made for all students with disabilities in their areas.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has already been made in the development of provision across the entire spectrum of special needs.  In the particular area to which the Deputy refers I have already reduced the pupil-teacher ratio from 11:1 to 10:1 and am committed to further reductions as resources permit.  I have also significantly improved the rate of special capitation funding payable in respect of children attending special schools and classes.  In the case of children with moderate learning difficulties I have increased the capitation rate per child from £92.70 to £307 for children under 12 years and from £92.70 to £372 for children of 12 years or over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> I have also increased the number of classroom assistant appointed to special schools and classes including those catering for children with moderate learning difficulties from 82 to 232 during my period in office and remain committed to further improvements in this area as resources permit.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education I have to determine priorities and seek to allocate available resources to best effect.  I am satisfied that since my appointment I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy wishes to provide details of a specific case she has in mind I assure her that the needs of the children in question will be given every consideration when I am next in a position to provide additional classroom assistant support.</P>

      <P>The present system for funding choirs and orchestras in secondary schools consists of a scheme of grants towards the cost of the purchase and repair of equipment and bonuses payble to schools on the basis of the standard attained by individual schools in the Department's examination for choirs and orchestras.</P>
      <P>The conditions for the payment of the equipment grant include the prior notification to the Department of the intention to form an orchestra or military band, vouching of expenditure and the progress made by the school in developing the orchestra or military band being subject to inspection by the Department.</P>
      <P>Ninety pounds was paid to three schools in County Donegal during 1996 under the bonus scheme.  No application for equipment funding was received during the year.</P>

      <P>In October 1994 a revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training was introduced on a pilot basis.  This programme is operated by the Western Health Board and University College Galway at University Hospital Galway.  It consists of a three year course which leads to a diploma in Nursing Studies.  Operation of the new diploma programme has been extended to a number of other colleges of nursing in association with local higher education institutions. Successful completion of the programme leads to registration with an Bord Altranais.  The programmes are being funded by the regional health boards.</P>
      <P>Dublin City University is in the current academic year providing a one year course which enables holders of the three year diploma to obtain a degree of Bachelor of Nursing Studies. For registered nurses who qualified before the diploma was initiated, access modules are available to enable them to qualify for entry to the one year course.  Courses are provided on a part-time basis and it is proposed to provide a distance education programme leading to the same award with registration in May 1997.  These courses are self-financing.  No other proposals have been received from colleges in this regard to date.</P>

      <P>There are now of the order of 18,700 participants on PLC courses.  Significant investment has been made in recent years in enhancing the quality and accessibility of these courses through the introduction of national assessment and certification under the National Council for Vocational Awards in 1994, the abolition of fees in 1995, increased investment in in-career development of teachers and the establishment of TEASTAS in 1995 to provide a single unified structure for all extra-university vocational training in both the education and training sectors.  As part of the overall strategy to develop a range of alternative routes through which people can progress to higher education a scheme has been introduced under which students with NCVA Level 2 awards can progress from PLC courses to selected courses in Dublin Institute of Technology and regional technical colleges.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional resource teacher posts to primary schools.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate such posts in any year is determined by resource availability in that year and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wide range of special needs including the resouce teacher area.  I am satisfied that since my appointment I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs including the resource teacher area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
      <P>When I am next in a position to allocate additional resource teacher posts the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have a centralised record of individual projects carried out in the years in question.  I cannot justify assigning scarce resources to examine all primary school building files to ascertain the information.  The task would be further complicated by the fact that the rate of grant aid for capital projects was standarised at 85 per cent in 1991.  Prior to 1991 the rate was negotiated on each individual project.  Records of projects which were grant-aided from 1994 onwards are maintained centrally by my Department's building unit.</P>

The NCCA superseded the Curriculum and Examinations Board (CEB) which was established in 1984 by Deputy Gemma Hussey, Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The task given to the NCCA can be summarised under five main headings: to improve the quality of education by keeping the school curriculum and the arrangements for assessing pupils under regular review; to advise the Minister on the curriculum in primary and second level schools; to advise the Minister on how a pupil's progress in school should be assessed; to advise the Minister on in-service training for teachers; and to advise the Minister on the standards reached by pupils in public examinations.</P>

      <P>Initially, according to my Department's records approval for a regional technical college for the Tallaght area was announced in 1981 by the then Minister for Education, former Deputy J.P. Wilson. Subsequently in June 1985 the then Minister for Education, former Deputy Hussey, made the announcement that five major building projects would go ahead which included a regional technical college at Tallaght.  Following a period of deferral, the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, in June 1989 announced that the building of a regional technical college at Tallaght would commence that year.</P>

For this reason I included the school in my Department's 1996 programme to plan a replacement building to house the amalgamated schools.</P>
      <P>My Department's architectural staff have carried out an inspection of the proposed site for the project and are of the opinion that the site is unsuitable, subject to the results of ground tests. My Department will be in contact with the school manager shortly in relation to the appointment of a structural engineer to carry out these tests.</P>
      <P>Planning of the new building will commence when a suitable site has been acquired.</P>

      <P>The Auctioneers and House Agents Act, 1947, as amended, provides the statutory basis for the <Col N="423" /> regulation of entry to the auctioneering profession. Amending this Act would not be the appropriate way to regulate property transactions.</P>
      <P>I do not have proposals at this time for statutory intervention of the kind envisaged by the Deputy.  If, however, there are abuses capable of being addressed by means of such intervention the matter can, of course, be examined.  However, amendment of the law in this area, depending on what is proposed, may be a matter for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform rather than the Minister for Justice.  The Deputy will appreciate that any proposed changes to the law regulating such transactions would require detailed and careful consideration.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that within the Dublin Metropolitan Area all calls for Garda assistance received are recorded on a computer aided dispatch system.  The Garda authorities believe that this is a necessary and extremely beneficial procedure, first, to ensure maximum speed in responding to priority calls and, second, from a management information perspective in assessing demands and optimum resource allocation.</P>
      <P>They also point out that calls received through the &ldquo;999&rdquo; system are answered by designated call takers at the control room and details are recorded as the caller speaks.  The system prioritises calls on a scale of one to four and automatically transfers the details to the appropriate divisional dispatcher.  Calls are dispatched to units in accordance with the priority afforded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outside of the Dublin Metropolitan Area, emergency calls for Garda service on the &ldquo;999&rdquo; system are routed by Telecom Éireann operators <Col N="424" /> to the nearest Garda station.  I am informed by the garda authorities that time is taken to accurately record the details of these calls so that the necessary information is available to determine the appropriate Garda response.  I understand that any delay as a result of this requirement would be minimal.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available from Departmental records.  There are about 500 applications in the State per annum in recent years for naturalisation and post-nuptial citizenship. Having regard to that, it would require a disproportionate amount of time and effort to divert staff from processing such applications to compile the information sought.  Quite apart from that, I am of the opinion that it would not be appropriate of me, in response to a parliamentary question, to disclose details of private arrangements between applicants for naturalisation-citizenship and their representatives in such proceedings.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas.  They have informed me that a van <Col N="426" /> in Store Street Garda station was equipped with a mobile video system for use in that district some years ago.  There are no plans to provide other units with such equipment at present.  I understand that when requested by local Garda officers, mobile video units are set up at special events such as football matches and rock concerts for policing purposes.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are not aware of any trials with mobile video units in Tralee at present. However, the Deputy may be referring to an urban CCTV system which was tested in Tralee approximately one year ago and which has since ceased operating.  As part of the additional funding made available to me for the anti-crime measures which I announced in July 1996 for the extension of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing, I have provided funding for a Garda CCTV system in Tralee.  Preliminary work has already commenced on this system.  I am not aware of an application for a similar system in respect of the location referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The person referred to in the question is serving a number of life sentences in the UK.  The administration of the sentences is a matter for the authorities there. All persons serving life sentences in the UK have a tariff in their case determined by the Secretary of State of the day.  The tariff is the period to be served by the offender in order to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence.  In the case of the offender referred to in the question it is my understanding that no tariff has yet been set by the Home Secretary.</P>
      <P>I have no comment to make on the question of visiting arrangements as these are a matter for the Home Secretary and the prison authorities in the United Kingdom to determine and administer. I can only suggest, if the Deputy has not already done so, that he might raise this matter with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, whose responsibility it is to look after the interests of Irish citizens imprisoned abroad.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy submitted applications for a certificate of naturalisation in 1987 and 1989.  These applications were refused and the applicant's solicitors were informed in writing of these decisions in February 1988 and August 1991.</P>
      <P>Following further correspondence in 1994 the solicitors were informed that it was open to their client to make a new application and a new application form was sent to them.  My Department's records do not indicate that another application has been received to date.

      <P>I expect the Garda Commissioner to forward his recommendations in the matter to me in the near future.  However, I should point out that the extension of Garda CCTV systems to other areas will have implications for Garda personnel and resources and must, of course, be viewed in the context of overall policing operations.  These CCTV systems must be carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures. These will be among the factors which the advisory committee will take into consideration.</P>

It is then a matter for the UK authorities and for the offender to decide if they will also consent to the transfer.  There must be three-way prior consent from the sentenced person and from the authorities of both states for a transfer to take place.  If the UK authorities and the offender consent to the transfer, an application will then be made to the High Court in Dublin for the necessary warrant authorising the taking of the offender into custody here and his continued detention.  The Deputy can be assured that there will be no delay on the part of the Irish authorities in processing this application.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any anomaly which would preclude the payment of full maternity benefit to a woman by virtue of the child being born prematurely or where the child is born less than 12 months after a previous birth.  However, if the Department can supply details of a specific case I will have it examined.</P>
      <P>Maternity benefit is payable to an employed woman where it is certified by her employer that she is entitled to maternity leave under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994; and she satisfies the relevant PRSI contribution conditions.</P>
      <P>Maternity benefit is normally payable for 14 weeks.  At least four and not more than ten of these weeks must be taken before the baby is due and at least four weeks must be taken after the baby is due.</P>
      <P>The weekly rate of maternity benefit payable is 70 per cent of the woman's average reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant tax year subject to a minimum weekly payment of £75.70, increasing to £82.30 from June, and a maximum payment of £162.80.  However, in any case where the woman would be entitled to a higher rate of payment on disability benefit if she was absent from work through illness, then the rate of maternity benefit payable is equal to the higher rate of disability benefit which would be paid in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Average reckonable weekly earnings for the purposes of maternity benefit are calculated by dividing the woman's gross earnings in the relevant income tax year by the number of weeks she has worked in that year.  Where a woman has had a previous period of maternity leave, that period of absence from employment is discounted in determining her average reckonable weekly earnings for maternity benefit purposes.  Accordingly, a previous claim for maternity benefit in <Col N="431" /> the recent past will not affect the woman's future entitlement to benenfit.</P>

      <P>I am convinced that access to educational opportunities is a crucial element in enabling unemployed people and lone parents to improve their chances of securing employment and also to enhance their self-esteem and confidence.  There are, accordingly, a number of schemes available to people who wish to participate in full-time or part-time educational courses while continuing to retain their social welfare payments.  The schemes administered by my Department are: the second level allowance; the third level allowance and the part-time education option.</P>
      <P>The second level allowance scheme is available to unemployed persons and lone parents attending full-time second level education courses at any community, comprehensive or vocational school.  Their entitlement to social welfare payments is not affected while attending such courses.  Improvements in this scheme will be announced shortly.</P>
      <P>Unemployed people and lone parents wishing to pursue a third level education course may participate in the third level allowance scheme.  To qualify under the scheme a person must be aged 21 years or over and be unemployed for at least six months.  As a result of improvements to the scheme which I introduced in October 1996, participants now receive an allowance equivalent to the full standard rate of unemployment benefit while attending a full-time third level course at any university, third level college or institution provided that both the college and the course involved are approved by the Department of Education for higher education grants purposes. There are also opportunities available to pursue courses at post-graduate level provided the person is aged at least 24 years and is the holder of a primary degree.</P>
      <P>An annual book allowance of £100 for participants has been introduced.  Furthermore, a separate arrangement is being introduced this year whereby participants will be paid for a full 52 weeks while engaged in the third-level course and they may work during the holiday periods.</P>
      <P>An unemployed person or lone parent who fails to qualify for a full-time education course may attend a part-time education course and retain their entitlement to unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>However, unemployed persons availing of this option must satisfy my Department that they continue to be actively seeking and available for full-time work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education operates the vocational training opportunities scheme through the network of vocational education committees. This scheme provides an opportunity to pursue a <Col N="433" /> second level education course which can lead to qualifications such as junior certificate, leaving certificate and certain city and guild certificates. To qualify under the scheme an unemployed person or lone parent must be at least aged 21 years of age and have been unemployed for at least six months.  Participants are paid the equivalent of their unemployment payment directly by the vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>Over the years, the qualifying conditions applying to the various educational opportunities have been eased so as to include not only long-term recipients of unemployment assistance but also other categories of unemployed such as recipients of unemployment benefit and lone parents.</P>
    <P>I will continue to seek to improve the opportunities for people in receipt of social welfare payments to gain access to educational opportunities.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was awarded disability benefit at the rate of £74.20 a week from 1 November 1994 in respect of herself and one child dependant.  She was subsequently awarded lone parent's allowance at a reduced rate of £32.20 a week from 24 November 1994.</P>
      <P>The relevant legislation provides that where a person is receiving lone parent's allowance at a reduced rate by reason of means, disability benefit at the maximum appropriate rate may also be paid.  The person concerned was therefore paid disability benefit at the weekly rate of £74.20 to 30 October 1995 after which she was certified fit to resume work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a revised decision on 20 February 1996, lone parent's allowance at the maximum weekly rate of £76.20 was awarded for the period from 24 November 1994 to 30 October 1995.  As <Col N="434" /> a result the maximum weekly rate of disability benefit allowable to her under the relevant legislation was £30.50, half the personal rate.</P>
    <P>The relevant legislation also provides for the offsetting of the excess disability benefit paid against any arrears of lone parent's allowance due.  The excess amount of disability benefit paid in the period from 24 November 1994 to 30 October 1995 was £2,146.80 which is equivalent to the arrears of lone parents allowance due.</P>
    <P>Accordingly there is no outstanding liability in respect of the overpayment in question.</P>

At a medical examination conducted on 7 January 1997 the medical assessor considered that the person concerned did not satisfy the medical criteria for receipt of disability allowance.</P>
      <P>The person's appeal was received at the social welfare appeals office on 12 February 1997 and he was examined by a different medical assessor on 12 March 1997 who also considered that he did not satisfy the medical criteria necessary for receipt of the allowance.  The person concerned has been notified of the result of the latest medical examination.  In the light of the evidence available the appeals officer will decide whether or not an oral hearing will be held to determine the case and the person will be notified accordingly at an early date.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to amend the terms of the scheme of PRSI for self employed people to allow them a pro-rata pension for the contributions paid or to buy the necessary contributions to allow them to qualify for a pension.</Quest>

      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age. This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to all insured people.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, self employed people who become insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension. They are covered for widow's, widower's and orphan's pensions subject, of course, to satisfying the normal qualifying criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, self employed people in that age group who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 could qualify for the old age contributory pension as <Col N="436" /> such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  In this year's budget I provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that self employed contributors who entered insurance in 1988 but were already over the age of 56 at that time and who had previously paid social insurance as an employee will now be able to receive a refund of the pension element of their self employed social insurance provided, again, that they do not qualify for an old age (contributory) or (non-contributory) pension. Heretofore, their earlier contributions precluded them from receiving such a refund.</P>
    <P>Detailed consideration has been given by my Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  In this regard costings done in 1989 estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self employed contributors who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned.  These costings are currently being reviewed in the context of the actuarial review.  The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self employed contributors generally to finance such an extension was estimated at 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.  Allowing self employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years contributions in order to qualify for an old age contributory pension would also be very costly to the Exchequer unless the payments made by the individual self employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis.  The cost to an individual contributor of buying rights on this basis would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to relax the requirement that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>

      <P>Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years or over and also to certain people with disabilities under the age of 66.  The other free schemes are available to people usually aged 66 or over who are in receipt of a welfare <Col N="437" /> type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition. In addition, widows between the age of 60 and 65 whose late husbands had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
      <P>The free schemes were extended in July 1996 to low income pensioners who were not in receipt of a social welfare type payment.  The weekly income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age (contributory) pension, currently £75 per week, plus any increases for dependants, plus £30.</P>
      <P>Extending the free schemes to categories who do not qualify under the current conditions would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The Western Women's Link is one of five women's networks which was funded by the Combat Poverty Agency from 1993-95 as part of a pilot programme.  My Department took over funding of four of these networks in 1996 at the levels recommended by the agency.  The women's networks resource and support women's groups in their area through information and advice, joint training, sharing of experiences and considering the policy issues arising from their work.</P>
      <P>The Western Women's Link experienced a number of difficulties during the course of the pilot programme mainly surrounding the geographical spread of the network and ability to provide the level of support needed by the women's groups in its area.  The group's development worker post became vacant in mid-1996 and has not been replaced.  The Department has agreed to provide funding of £15,000 to Western Women's Link for 1997 on submission of a satisfactory workplan.  I am satisfied that this is sufficient assistance from the Department to this group for now, having regard to the funding available to women's groups and networks generally and the current level of activity.  The position for future years will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Following the failure of the open tendering competition to produce an acceptable private sector proposal to develop the centre the independent management board&mdash;Bord Fáilte Area&mdash;under whose aegis the competition was run recommended that the strategy be reviewed. They suggested as an alternative the possibility of developing the centre through a public sector option.  As a result the Royal Dublin Society (RDS), as a voluntary body potentially eligible for consideration for the higher rate of European Regional Development Fund assistance normally reserved for public/similar bodies was invited to submit a proposal on this basis.  A similar invitation subsequently issued to a public/private joint venture who failed to submit an initial application within a twice extended deadline.  The Tourism OP requires that the conference centre be located in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> Upon completion of their examination of the RDS proposal, Bord Fáilte, on the recommendation of the management board, commissioned an independent cost/benefit analysis which is required under the Tourism OP in the case of all large projects.  This was undertaken by an experienced UK consultancy firm who were selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure.  The results were favourable to the RDS proposal.</P>
    <P>The Government, having taken into account a number of factors including the recommendations of the management board and Bord Fáilte and the results of the cost benefit analysis agreed on 5 November last to make a submission to the European Commission as required under the OP for projects of this scale recommending formal approval of the proposed development by the RDS on the basis of 75 per cent capital grant aid. The Commission is still considering the submission and has yet to reach a final decision on the proposal.  In the meantime, the question of considering an alternative location does not, therefore, arise.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the European Commission has recently communicated details of a complaint lodged with them on the subject of the selection procedures.  I am currently finalising my reply and expect to have it with the Commission shortly.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government at present has no plans to introduce legislation for casino gambling, a position which was reconfirmed when the issue was most recently considered last June.</P>

      <P>The CORI part-time job opportunity programme is a three year pilot programme which was scheduled to end in June 1997.  Given that there will be wind down issues and that some individual projects did not start on time it will be the end of September before the programme is completely finished.  CORI's involvement with the programme will cease at the end of May, as is their wish.</P>
      <P>An evaluation of the pilot programme has been completed and considered by the Government. The evaluation points to a number of positive outcomes from the proposal such as allowing participants to remain in projects for three years and the introduction of spousal swops.  These aspects have already been mainstreamed into community employment.  Other innovations of the CORI concept such as the &ldquo;rate for the job&rdquo; approach are under consideration and discussions are ongoing with CORI to explore the feasibility of absorbing further elements of the pilot programme into mainstream programmes.  The rate for the job approach has already been adopted in the pilot whole time job initiative programme.</P>
      <P>With regard to the existing sponsors and participants in the pilot programme, the Government has decided that: all suitable CORI sponsors who wish to convert to community employment will be allowed to do so; participants receive special guidance and counselling before the project comes to an end to help them get employment in the open labour market and that the option of allowing participants a further year on community employment be maintained if it becomes necessary.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make FÁS schemes and courses available to women who are not on the live register but are anxious to return to the workplace via training and community employment programme schemes and who have been working in the home for a considerable length of time.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Training programmes run by FÁS, the Employment and Training Authority, are open to all persons who are unemployed and seeking work.  Priority of access is, however, given to persons on the live register regardless of their gender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="442" /> With regard to community employment, this scheme is geared primarily towards those long-term unemployed who are in receipt of unemployment compensation payments.  However, it may also be availed of by certain categories not on the live register such as persons in receipt of lone parents allowance or other special categories such as those registered with the National Rehabilitation Board.  A major initiative was taken in April 1996 which enables adult dependants of persons on the live register, who are eligible to participate on the community employment programme, to adopt their partners eligibility and participate in the programme in their place.</P>
    <P>Providing priority of access to persons on the live register ensures that those most likely to be in need of the various programmes receive priority attention.  Due to budgetary constraints, I consider it unlikely that there will be any alteration to this arrangement in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Since 1990, FÁS has administered an Action Programme for Women to maximise the participation of women in all of its programmes and as a result there has been a significant growth in the level of participation by women in FÁS programmes. In 1996, 43 per cent of those who completed a FÁS training programme or a community employment programme were women. FÁS has also been providing courses such as Return to Work and Enterprise Training which have a high proportion of female participation particularly among home makers.  In 1996, 1,083 women participated in the return to work scheme and 732 women participated in the enterprise training scheme.  In a further response to the need for flexibility in this area, FÁS has advised me that they are currently undertaking a pilot initiative aimed at developing and testing new ways of delivering training for women.  This initiative, which is being piloted under the NOW, New Opportunities for Women programme, aims to provide locally-based training in partnership with community groups.  This training is delivered in a flexible manner to suit the needs and circumstances of participants.</P>
    <P>FÁS is also very conscious of the need for childcare facilities for women returning to work and contributes over £5 million per annum to community based childcare provision by way of support for community employment projects. Over 130 community employment projects have such a childcare dimension.  Many of these facilities provide community based childcare for women undertaking training or education and for participants on community employment.</P>
    <P>The Partnership 2000 agreement provides for the establishment of a working party representative of Government Departments and the social partners to examine the question of equal access by women to labour market opportunities, including training, education and employment programmes. As a party to the Partnership 2000 agreement the Government recognises that <Col N="443" /> women should not be penalised with regard to the availability of employment supports, including training, and that they should have equal access to all labour market opportunities.  It is expected that this working group will be established in the near future.</P>

      <P>There are presently 32 insurance <Col N="444" /> undertakings authorised to underwrite motor insurance business in the Irish market including the provision of motor insurance cover for motorists in the age groups mentioned by the Deputy. The number underwriting the young driver market would, in practice, be less than that because of the associated high risk profile.  This is a worldwide trend, although the Irish market suffers in this context from the small-scale size of the market relative to the UK motor insurance market, for example, in terms of numbers of companies.</P>
      <P>The Irish Insurance Federation has indicated that, given that many young motorists may be named drivers on their parents' or other policies, it is not possible to provide a statistical profile of the current numbers of insured motorists under 25.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the major unemployment problem in Balbriggan, County Dublin; and the proposals, if any, he has to increase employment opportunities in the area.</Quest>

      <P>There are a substantial range of measures and projects in the Balbriggan area or accessible to its residents being provided by the agencies for which I have responsibility.  These are all geared towards increasing both employment opportunities and the skills of unemployed persons in the area.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland's client companies have delivered 5,793 jobs in Fingal in 1996 making it one of the fastest growing areas in Ireland for IDA job creation in recent years.  With the completion of the northern cross route of the M50, all the main IDA business parks are within a ten to 15 minute commute of each other, making the major job creators readily accessible to residents of Balbriggan.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has a four acre serviced site available at the IDA Business Park in Balbriggan, and combined with the adjacent new IDA secured investments in Swords, the Balbriggan catchment area will continue to experience substantial net jobs growth from IDA clients.</P>
      <P>Fingal County Enterprise Board (CEB) has been working with IDA Ireland and the Development Department of Fingal County Council to attract a project to the Stephenstown Lands, Balbriggan. Arising from this, a site has been identified in the town for an enterprise centre, the preparatory work for which is now under way.  To develop this facility Fingal CEB in conjunction with FÁS has employed an enterprise worker under the auspices of the Balbriggan enterprise group, who is currently based in Balbriggan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date six projects have been approved by Fingal CEB in the Balbriggan area to the value of £1.9 million in grants.  These projects, which <Col N="445" /> include manufacturing and services companies, have generated 18 jobs to date.</P>
    <P>Fingal CEB has been working closely with a working group seeking urban renewal status for Balbriggan.  I understand that the group's strategic plan, which will be submitted to the Department of the Environment, is now almost complete.</P>
    <P>Forbairt provides a wide range of services and customised programmes targeted at the more rapid development of the indigenous sector in north County Dublin, including Balbriggan.</P>
    <P>FÁS has a 400 place training centre located at Baldoyle which is serviced by commuter train from Balbriggan.  The centre runs 30 courses which are designed to meet the needs of job-seekers and industry in the area.  The range of courses is constantly being reviewed and updated to assist job-seekers to obtain employment.</P>

      <P>Under the BSE/Agrimonetary compensation package which I announced recently, the person concerned will qualify for top-up payments of approximately £10 per head in respect of 50.66 animals which qualified for payment under the 1996 special beef premium scheme.  It is expected that these top-up payments will be made during May 1997.</P>
      <P>The person concerned may also qualify for additional top-up payments on these animals under the 1996 BSE compensation package.  The amount payable will depend on the amount of money recouped from farmers who, having been paid top-ups last October in respect of suckler cows and steers which qualified for premia in 1995, had fewer animals qualifying for these premia in 1996.  These adjustments will be made later this year.</P>

      <P>This appeal has been examined in detail by the headage and premia appeals unit. The ewe premium scheme is governed by EU regulations which set down severe penalties for breaches of the terms and conditions of the scheme.  The applicants failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the 1995 ewe premium scheme and, therefore, payment could not be made.  However, in the light of the exceptional circumstances of the case, the Department is now making contact with the EU Commission in the hope of gaining some concession on behalf of the applicants.  The applicants will be contacted as soon as there are any developments.</P>

He was paid his 1996 cattle headage entitlement of £1,463.40 on 23 January 1997.  He was paid his 1996 ewe premium entitlement of £897.03 in three instalments.</P>
      <P>The person concerned will be entitled to a payment of £1,262.07 under the 1996 EU suckler cow scheme and a balancing payment of £90.17 under the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme.  These payments are dependent upon validation of all the data supplied on the 1996 area aid application form against the maps supplied to the applicant. This is a requirement under the land parcel identification system the purpose of which is to provide the Department with a data base whereby land parcels being claimed for area aid purposes can be located, identified and have area values and land use attributed.  Furthermore, the system ensures that parcels of land are not over-claimed by farmers or that the same parcel is not claimed by more than one farmer in any given year.  Certain problems arose in identifying all of the land parcels being claimed by the person concerned against those parcels outlined on the maps supplied to that person.  The person concerned was written to on 12 December 1996 with a view to resolving the problem.  No reply has been received to date.  As soon as a reply is received his case will be processed for payment of the outstanding amounts.</P>

      <P>The new cattle tagging and birth registration system is, in general, operating efficiently.  As in 1996, herd owners have received supplies of plastic tags for 1997.  Some operational aspects are being refined, in part to address concerns expressed by herd owners and others.  These include improvements in the quality of the identity card-administrative document and in the processing of applications for additional tags.  Information available at this stage indicates that the tag fall-out rate for the new tags is low but a more detailed survey will be carried out shortly by the Department on this aspect.</P>

      <P>Under the REP scheme a random 5 per cent pre-payment check of applications is carried out.  This check involves a detailed assessment of all aspects of the plan and includes an on-farm inspection.  The applicant's plan has gone for such a check and an inspection will be carried out shortly.  Assuming that everything is in order payment will issue as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>In the reply in the 19 March Adjournment Debate, there was no suggestion that my Department had introduced a new traceability procedure for reinforcing steel in grant-aided farm structures.  Indeed, the Minister of State explained that, as there is no national or industry scheme for certified traceable steels, it was not feasible for my Department to introduce one unilaterally.  Moreover, there does not seem to be any necessity for such a move: the Department, as was stated, has no evidence that inferior steel is being used, and no failures have been recorded in any structure where reinforcing steel has been correctly installed.</P>
      <P>The Department's specifications for grant-aided structures require that reinforcing steels comply with British Standards BS4449.  Any applicant farmers in our grant schemes may request, if they wish, written confirmation from their contractors or suppliers that all reinforcing steel conforms to that specification.  If a national or EU scheme is introduced, then my Department will, of course, co-operate in the necessary procedures.</P>

At an inspection it was discovered that eight of the animals listed on the application were absent.  There were eight other undeclared animals presented in place of these.

      <P>He appealed this decision.  The evidence put forward by the herd owner in support of his appeal requires detailed examination.  This is now being done.  The herd owner will be notified of the outcome of the appeal as soon as his case has been fully examined.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid his 1996 cattle headage entitlement of £1,013.68 on 12 December 1996.  He was paid 80 per cent advances totalling £5,626.59 under the 1996 special beef premium scheme as follows: £288.54 on 16 November 1996, £3,246.12 on 25 November 1996, £1,154.17 on 27 January 1997, and £937.76 on 18 February 1997.  A 20 per cent balancing payment of £1,406.67 under the 1996 special beef premium scheme is dependent upon validation of all the data supplied on the 1996 area aid application form against the maps supplied.  This is a requirement under the land parcel identification system the purpose of which is to provide the Department with a database whereby land parcels being claimed for area aid purposes can be located, identified and have area values and land use attributed.  Furthermore, the system ensures that parcels of land are not over-claimed by farmers or that the same parcel is not claimed by more than one farmer in any given year.  Certain problems arose in identifying all of the land parcels being claimed by the person concerned against those parcels outlined on the maps supplied.  The person concerned was written to on 12 December 1996 with a view to resolving the problem.  No reply has been received to date.  As soon as a reply is received his case will be processed for payment of the outstanding amounts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 298, 299 and 305 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of land-milk quota leases have been requested from the co-operatives-dairies as part of the annual report for 1996-97.  It is expected that these reports will shortly be submitted to my Department, thus enabling national statistics to <Col N="457" /> be compiled.  It is estimated that 28,000 producers applied for additional quota under the 1996-97 temporary leasing scheme and that the volume of quota available amounted to 60 million gallons approximately.</P>
    <P>While it is not possible at this stage to quantify the beneficial effect, on the temporary leasing scheme, of the introduction of a 10 per cent claw-back on land leases, it is generally accepted that this contributed positively to the amount of quota offered under the third stage of the scheme.  It is not possible either to estimate the amount of quota which will be available in the 1997-98 temporary leasing scheme because of the many factors outside of the scheme itself which can have an influence.</P>

      <P>A submission to establish a new category of extremely disadvantaged areas in Ireland was formally presented to the Commission on 9 October 1996.  The Commission is carrying out a technical examination of the submission, and I expect that discussions with the officials of my Department on the proposals will commence in the near future.  However, since the proposal envisages additional payments to farmers in the new areas, the implementation of the measures will not involve a separate application from farmers but rather a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; on the normal application in respect of the relevant schemes.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of Directive 92/46/EEC as implemented by S.I. No. 9 of 1996, all Irish dairy farms were initially deemed to be registered and thus approved to supply milk.  A programme of farm inspections to ensure compliance with the prescribed standards is ongoing and producers are being informed of the improvements required.  The scheme of grant aid to assist farmers with investment necessary to achieve the required structural standards on their farms had to be closed when the funding was exhausted.  Should further funds become available following the mid-term review of co-financed <Col N="465" /> structural programmes, I will consider re-introducing a similar scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 310 and 311 together.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of the Kearney report on the compensatory allowances scheme, I put a number of proposals to the European Commission to provide for amendments to the headage schemes in 1997 and following years. The intention was that two of the proposals (i) implementing a ceiling of £3,000 on payments to individual farmers and (ii) reducing the higher rate of grant for Freisian cows and in-calf heifers would come into effect in 1997 and the remaining two in 1998 &mdash; (iii) disallowing headage payments to farmers over 66 in receipt of a contributory retirement pension and (iv) paying headage to farmers in areas designated as degraded under the rural environment protection scheme (REPS) only if they were participating in REPS.  As part of Partnership 2000, it was provided that proposals (ii), (iii) and (iv) would come into effect from 1 January 1998 and that proposal (i) would also come into effect on that date unless agreement was reached between the Government and the farm organisations early in 1997 on a workable alternative which did not involve exceeding the total OPARDF allocation for compensatory allowances.  I have not yet received any submissions in that regard from the farm organisations. Formal negotiations with the Commission services have commenced on the four proposals but I am not yet in a position to indicate when this process will be completed.</P>

      <Quest>the number of animals which reverted to the national suckler quota in each of the years from 1995 to date in 1997 under the 70 per cent rule; the projections, if any, of the impact on farmers of the 90 per cent rule; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under EU regulations applicable in 1993, 1994 and 1995, producers holding suckler cow quota rights had to make use of at least 50 per cent of those rights in any one of two consecutive years.  Otherwise the part not used during the second year reverted to the national reserve where it became available for distribution to priority categories of producer identified by the Quota Review Group under the 1995 and 1996 national reserves.  Use in this context included making application for premium payments in respect of those rights or leasing out the rights or a portion of the rights.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the EU regulations required that holders of suckler cow quota greater than 7 use at least 70 per cent of that quota every year.  Farmers with quotas of 7 or less had to use at least 70 per cent in any one of two consecutive years. Otherwise the part not used reverted to the national reserve where it will become available for distribution to priority categories of producer identified by the Suckler Cow Quota Review Group under the 1997 national reserve.  Distribution of quota rights from the 1997 national reserve is currently under way.  The exception to these rules were farmers who joined the farm retirement scheme or famers who could demonstrate that they could not make the required use of their quotas because of exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In late 1996, the EU Commission decided that, for 1997 and 1998, farmers with quotas greater than 7 must use at least 90 per cent of their quotas each year, and farmers with quotas of 7 or less must use at least 90 per cent every second year. The part not used will revert to the national reserve but will not be available for distribution to priority categories for a period of two years.  In 1995 a total of 32,068 suckler cow quota rights were returned to the national reserve because of non-usage in 1993 and 1994.  The following year, 13,901 suckler cow quota rights were returned to the national reserve because of non-usage in 1994 and 1995.  The position in relation to usage of quota rights in 1996 under the 70 per cent rule is that some 1,920 farmers with quotas greater than 7 who applied for the suckler cow scheme in either May 1996 or October 1996 did not make the required use of their quotas.  The total number of rights involved was 20,128.  Eight hundred and eighty nine of the farmers concerned were able to demonstrate that they could not make use of their rights because of exceptional circumstances and they have been allowed to retain their quotas amounting to 8,367 rights.  In the final <Col N="467" /> analysis 11,761 rights reverted to the 1997 national reserve because of non-usage in 1996.</P>
    <P>It is impossible, at this stage, to predict what impact the 90 per cent usage requirement in 1997 and 1998 will have on the 1998 and 1999 national reserves.  Producers who have surplus quota can of course protect their quotas either by buying additional suckler cows, or by leasing or transferring any surplus quota.  Earlier this year, my Department wrote to all producers advising them of the new arrangements for 1997 and 1998. Those farmers who can demonstrate that they could not make the required use of their quotas due to exceptional circumstances will be allowed retain the rights in question.</P>

      <P>The storage facilities at the Whiddy Island Oil Terminal comprise approximately one million tonnes, 7.5 million barrels of crude oil storage and associated tankage.  At the time of the Gulf crisis in 1990, the Irish National Petroleum Corporation was instructed to purchase 1.5 million barrels of crude oil for strategic stock purposes and these stocks are still held at the terminal.  These stocks represent 12 days of Ireland's national oil reserves and the National Oil Reserves Agency proposes to increase stocks to 20 days once the terminal is in operation.</P>
      <P>The reactivation of the terminal was announced in March 1995.  Since then a single point mooring has been installed together with associated pipework and ancillary services.  Discussions are continuing between Bantry Terminals Ltd., the operator of the facility and statutory bodies regarding the issue of permits and licences.  It is hoped that these will be finalised shortly and that operations at the terminal can be re-established in the near future.  There are no firm proposals for third party commercial use of the terminal at this stage and the terminal will continue to be utilised for the storage of national oil reserves.</P>

Scheduled air services between Ireland and Canada are governed by the terms of the Ireland-Canada bilateral air services agreement.  This agreement provides that Irish airlines may provide scheduled services between Shannon and Montreal and Gander, and that Canadian airlines may provide services between Montreal and Shannon.</P>
      <P>It is a matter in the first instance for air carriers, having regard to their own commercial interests to decide whether to operate particular air services.  However, I am aware that airlines on both sides have cited the lack of direct access to Toronto and Dublin as factors in their reluctance to operate scheduled services.  This is not to say that if direct access to Toronto and Dublin were permitted, airlines on both sides would necessarily start up services immediately.  Commercial considerations would always be paramount for the airlines.</P>

      <P>No capital grants were provided by my Department in 1996 for airport development in Galway and there is no provision in 1997 for Exchequer funding for that purpose. An Exchequer grant of £40,000 was, however, provided for Galway Airport in 1996 towards the cost of marketing and promoting the airport.  A similar amount has been included for Galway in the regional airport marketing grants subhead of my Department's Vote for 1997.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above mentioned grants, an Exchequer funded essential air services programme, which includes the Galway-Dublin link, is in place.  This programme commenced in January 1995 and will continue in 1997.</P>
      <P>In addition I have agreed to promote the introduction into the operational programme for transport of a new measure in respect of residual works at certain regional airports, including runway extension and widening at Galway Airport. This proposal is, of course, subject to approval by the relevant EU monitoring committee.</P>

Provision is made in contract documentation to enable the resident site engineer to test for this quality of materials on delivery to site.  Any materials not complying with current relevant standards or failing to comply with the tests, are immediately rejected and removed from site at the contractor's expense.

      <P>The Chief State Solicitor acts for Government Departments in the conduct of civil legal claims alleging personal injury due to negligence, including claims from former members of the Defence Forces for alleged hearing impairment.  As I said recently in the Adjournment Debate of 4 March, the position in the case of loss of hearing claims is that liability is an issue in each claim.  It cannot be assumed that a plaintiff's loss of hearing is attributable to his service in the Defence Forces or that the military authorities were negligent in any particular case.  Ear defenders have been provided to military personnel for very many years past.  The plaintiff may have been exposed to some other source of acoustic trauma, e.g. as a member of a gun club, or there may be medical evidence to suggest some other cause of his deafness, e.g. a previous illness or ear infection.  Most of the claims to hand are for hearing in the High Court in due course.</P>

      <P>At present the Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying patrol vessel, four off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  The Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone.  These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed at all areas of Irish waters as necessary.  Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
      <P>As I outlined previously to the House, the EU has introduced a five year programme of financial aid towards the cost of measures to enforce the Common Fisheries Policy.  Approximately £1.35 million was committed by the Department on EU-funded projects in 1996.  The position in relation to the programme for 1997 is that Ireland's submission provides for a downpayment on an additional naval patrol vessel.  Requests for proposals for the supply of an additional vessel were advertised in the official journal of the European Community.  The proposals received are currently being assessed with a view to developing a shortlist of suitable tenderers who will be invited to submit definitive tenders for the supply of the vessel.  It is anticipated that the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the latter half of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the implementation of the five year programme the Naval Service will continue to <Col N="475" /> carry out its fishery protection duties using the existing seven patrol vessels.  Two of these vessels were refurbished in recent years and another is currently undergoing a major overhaul to replace and refurbish obsolete or deteriorated equipment and extend its operational life.  A further vessel will undergo similar refurbishment commencing in August next.  The question of the resources required by the Naval Service to enable it to fulfil its fishery protection role is kept under continual review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely concerned about the flagship problem from a number of perspectives, notably the very serious difficulties of control and enforcement arising from their activities in our waters and the fact that flagships benefit from national quotas without providing real economic benefits for the fishing communities of the flag State.  There are approximately 150 flagships operating in these waters.  The majority are registered in the UK, there are 12 on the Irish register and some registered in France and Germany.  They are owned, crewed and operated by companies or individuals in other EU member states, mostly Spain and their catch is mainly landed into other member states, which imposes particular enforcement problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> Flagships fish against the quota allocations of the member state of registry and the management, control and access to national quotas by such vessels is a matter for the flag State concerned rather than the coastal State where fishing activity is carried out.  Ireland has consistently pressed the UK authorities to co-operate more closely with us on the monitoring and control of the fishing activities of UK registered flagships in these waters and the Spanish authorities to improve the policing of landings into their ports. The initiative taken during the Irish Presidency to improve practical co-operation between member states on fisheries control and enforcement was designed, among other objectives to bring about substantially improved scrutiny by other member states of flagship activity and better information exchange.</P>
    <P>Noting the general treaty provisions relating to right of establishment and freedom of movement, under which the operation of flagships is legitimate business, I am however, concerned to ensure that there is the necessary link between the economic benefits of national fish quotas and the national coastal areas dependent on fishing.  I will continue to explore actively with the Commission, the UK and other member states, ways of securing that objective, in addition to pushing all relevant member states to ensure that the activities of flagships are adequately controlled both at sea and in port.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to tolerate flouting of fisheries law by flagships or any fishing vessels, irrespective of nationality, operating in these waters. European fish stocks are under severe pressure and the activities of flagships have to be recognised as one of the dimensions of the overall problem.  Enhanced control by the flag states and the member states into which flagships catches are landed is essential to our efforts as a coastal State to rigorously enforce the rules.  In relation to catches by flagships, the information currently available relates to direct landings into Ireland. My Department is currently compiling information concerning landings into other member states and I will communicate with the Deputy as soon as possible in this regard.</P>

    <P>The total number of vessels in the current Irish fleet amounts to 1,246.  This represents a net reduction of 106 vessels since May 1996.  This reduction is due to a number of factors such as the scrapping scheme which was introduced in 1996 and to the ongoing trend of rationalisation which has seen numbers of smaller less economically viable boats being replaced by larger safer vessels.</P>

      <P>A Department of the Marine inquiry into the collision is being carried out by two marine surveyors from my Department under section 465 of the 1894 Merchant Shipping Act.  As part of the inquiry, the marine surveyors interviewed the crew of both vessels involved in the collision and <Col N="484" /> two other Irish fishing vessels who were in the vicinity at the time.  As a result of depositions taken and evidence gathered, an opinion was formed by my Department that offences may have been committed under the international collisions regulations.</P>
      <P>On Friday, 14 March 1997, three summonses were served on the skipper of <i>The Sea Horse</i> in respect of alleged breaches of Rules 5, 13A and 18(A) (iii) of the Collisions Regulations (Ships and Watercraft on the Water) Order, 1984 (S.I. No. 29 of 1984), as amended.  These rules are concerned with the keeping of a proper look-out, overtaking procedure and the responsibilities of a power driven vessel under way to keep out of the way of a vessel engaged in fishing.  The summonses are returnable to the District Court, Bantry on Friday next, 11 April 1997 at 11.00 a.m.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that a report on the accident will be made available, subject to normal legal considerations, as soon as possible after completion of the investigation.</P>

      <P>As I explained in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 6 answered on 13 March last, Donegal County Council is disputing the rent included in a draft lease issued to them on 15 July last.  An official from the Valuation Office recently visited the site and met with Donegal County Council.  I understand that agreement on a rent was not reached and the Valuation Office will be sending a report to the Department of the Marine shortly. That report will form the basis of further discussions with Donegal County Council.</P>
