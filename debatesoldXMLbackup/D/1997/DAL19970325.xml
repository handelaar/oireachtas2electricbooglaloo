    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My visit to the United States over the St. Patrick's Day period was very successful in terms of promoting Ireland's economic and political <Col N="1410" /> interests.  The programme for my visit included meeting US political leaders, people centrally involved in developing the Ireland-US trade relationship and many Americans who are deeply interested in Irish affairs.</P>
    <P>My main substantive engagement was a meeting with Vice-President Gore who was deputising for President Clinton.  I did have brief discussions with the President.  Both leaders remain firmly committed to the aim of political agreement in Northern Ireland and indicated strongly their continuing readiness to assist in advancing matters towards that aim.  They emphasised that negotiations on a settlement stand the best chance of success if all elected parties are at the table in conditions free of violence or of the threat of violence.  I called for the reconstitution of a really honest peace process in Ireland where there would be no place for the continued targeting of victims, for continued kneecappings, punishment beatings or for veiled threats of any kind.</P>
    <P>Referring to the forthcoming marching season, Vice-President Gore, speaking on behalf of the President, urged restraint and tolerance.  It is my Government's sincere hope that these words will be heeded.  The people of Northern Ireland, from both communities, have suffered too much already.  A heavy onus rests on all sides to minimise the prospects for heightened tensions and violent confrontations.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the leaders of a number of the Northern Ireland parties were also in the United States for St. Patrick's Day.  While I did not have formal discussions with them, due in part to each leader having his or her own programme of engagements, I met each of them informally and had useful discussions.  I would welcome formal meetings with all the leaders during the talks interval between now and 3 June. The Government has been engaged in frequent and intensive contact with all the participants in the course of the talks in Belfast.  In addition, the British Prime Minister and I reviewed the Northern Ireland situation generally on 13 March, though I do not wish to go into the details of ongoing contacts of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken careful note of Senator Kennedy's call on the British Prime Minister and the British Labour Leader to make clear that if the IRA restores its ceasefire unequivocally, immediately and unconditionally, Sinn Féin will be admitted to the talks when they resume on 3 June.  The Government fully supports Senator Kennedy's views which are entirely consistent with the position adopted by the Irish Government at the December summit in respect of the Christmas break and since then.</P>
    <P>In the course of my visit, Speaker Gingrich announced the re-establishment of the US-Ireland Interparliamentary Group.  I very much welcome this development.  Not only is the re-establishment of the group a strong indicator of the depth of the Ireland-US bilateral relationship but it will also facilitate a structured process of <Col N="1411" /> exchange between Congress and the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>On the economic aspects of the Ireland-US relationship, one of my principal engagements was a meeting in Washington with the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board, which was attended by the chairs or chief executives of a number of important US companies.  Their expertise, experience and contacts provide invaluable assistance to the advancement of Ireland's economic interests.  Another key engagement was a meeting with the Deputy Commissioner and other officials from the Food and Drugs Administration of the United States.  There is a separate question tabled on this matter which I will answer tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I also visited the states of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia where I had a number of meetings with local political and business leaders.  Several of these meetings included visits to the headquarters of, and discussions with, potential US investors in Ireland.  For obvious commercial reasons, and in accordance with well established precedents, it would not be appropriate to give details of these discussions on this occasion.  However, I believe my discussion with the various business interests have the potential to yield considerable business investment and job creation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>While in Atlanta, Georgia, I attended and spoke at a lunch for Irish exporters and existing and potential US trade partners, hosted by An Bord Tráchtála.  In that city, I also delivered an address to the Southern Centre for International Studies, in the course of which I dealt with the future evolution of the European Union, global environmental issues, Irish economic development and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In South Carolina, I met the Mayor of Charleston, Mr. Joseph Riley, whose grandfather was involved in the reception given there for the former President, Mr. Eamon de Valera, in 1920.  I also attended a reception hosted by the Hibernian Society of Charlestown, founded in 1799, and thus one of the oldest Irish societies in America. Overall, I am satisfied that my visit to the United States was very successful in terms of promoting Ireland's economic and political interests, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Regarding compilation of the Government's assessment of new evidence on Bloody Sunday, very good progress has been made on this work. While the Tánaiste has primary responsibility for the assessment, our respective Departments are working very closely on this matter and I envisage that the work will be completed in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government intend to call unequivocally for a new inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday?  Will the Taoiseach agree the main aspects of the new evidence, as presented in the <i>Sunday Business Post,</i> the Channel 4 programme and other interviews, are the <Col N="1412" /> premeditated nature of the murders, the forensic evidence that has been presented, the use of dumdum bullets against international law and, most importantly, data that should have been presented to the Widgery tribunal was suppressed, doctored or ignored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's first priority, and that of the relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday, is that the full truth about what happened in January 1972 should be established once and for all to the satisfaction of all.  It appears that was not done in the case of the Widgery inquiry.  At this stage we are assembling the evidence.  It is probable the evidence will warrant further full inquiry, but if another more expeditious way can be found of establishing the truth to the satisfaction of all, another approach is not ruled out at this stage.  In my contacts with the British Prime Minister, I impressed upon him the importance of an open approach by the British Government to the examination of any new evidence it received.  I am satisfied, on the basis of what the Prime Minister said to me, there will be an open and unprejudiced approach to the examination of the evidence we are currently assembling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach is not yet in a position to state unequivocally that the Government is seeking a tribunal, perhaps he will elaborate on the other methods that might be used to establish the truth about the events of January 1972 in Derry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One possibility would be a judicial review of the findings of the Widgery tribunal in light of the new evidence.  Another possibility is that the British authorities would state unequivocally that they accept the new evidence without further inquiry.  If the evidence is sufficiently convincing and proves the case with sufficient strength, there may not be a necessity for going through a process of inquiry, if that evidence is so strong as to be self-vindicating.  It is probable that a new inquiry will be necessary but I, the Members of this House and the people are concerned about getting the truth as quickly as possible so that the relatives who have suffered a sense of injustice for so long will have that lifted from them in the most expeditious and comprehensive way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said it was the Government's view that if there was an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire, Sinn Féin could be at the talks when they resume on 3 June. In the light of his conversation with the British Prime Minister on 13 March, is that the position of the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is an unequivocal, unconditional and immediate IRA ceasefire, there is no reason Sinn Féin should not be at the talks on 3 June.  That was my view also when I <Col N="1413" /> met the British Prime Minister in December last and urged that if there was a ceasefire at that stage, the British Government should indicate that Sinn Féin could be in the talks when they resumed on 30 January, if the ground rules were complied with in the interim period.  As the House is well aware, and as I told the Deputy on that occasion, the British Government did not agree with the precise mention of a date.  It wanted to emphasise that the requirements of the ground rules had to be complied with and, once they were complied with and on whatever date that process was gone through, Sinn Féin could be in the talks, whereas the Irish Government preferred to work back from the date, so to speak, and comply with the requirements within that time frame rather than put the emphasis on what has to be done in the time frame without having a precise date.  There is a difference of position between the Irish and British Governments which is publicly acknowledged and well documented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What we all want in relation to Bloody Sunday is the truth.  The two issues raised by the Taoiseach are, first, the question of a judicial review and, second, acceptance by the British Government of the new evidence that has so far been uncovered.  That might not necessarily get to the truth of Bloody Sunday because we would be taking up only a small amount of what is in the public domain.  The only real way to deal with the matter is by a full judicial inquiry.  Otherwise issues that are still matters of speculation, such as whether dumdum bullets were fired, will not be dealt with.  Such actions are in violation of international law and the Geneva Convention. Forensic experts in the US who have no contact whatsoever with this country believe, based on the evidence, that these matters should be fully investigated.  The only way to prevent such things ever happening again in any country is for the Government to be unequivocal and clear in pressing for a full judicial tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be right.  I would prefer, however, before making a formal final statement on this matter, to see all the evidence assembled, to show that the assembly of the evidence is not being done with a preordained conclusion in mind.  It is important that when the Irish Government presents evidence to the British Government it is not open to the British Government to say that we had already made up our minds as to what course of action should be taken and that the evidence is simply being assembled to bolster a decision we have already made.  My anxiety not to be as unequivocal as the Deputy would wish is simply in order that that argument cannot be advanced to sweep aside the evidence we will be presenting, and to show that we are presenting the evidence in the same unprejudiced and open way on our side as we want it examined by the other side.  If we expect the British Government not to have made up its <Col N="1414" /> mind in advance of receiving the evidence as to what the conclusion will be, we cannot be in the situation of having made up our minds before we have finalised our examination of the evidence. That is the only reason for my reticence in the matter.  The Deputy may be right in saying that a judicial inquiry is the only way of resolving the matter and obtaining the truth, which is mine and the Irish people's overall objective in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned a number of alternatives to a tribunal.  Have all the alternatives, including the setting up of a tribunal, been actively discussed in the recent past between the Irish and British Governments?  Have there been any formal or informal contacts with Sir Patrick Mayhew who recently closed his mind to the idea of an apology in relation to this issue?  I want to know whether the Irish Government is speaking to itself and the general public as to its preferences.  Are those preferences being actively discussed between the two Governments in considering how best to proceed on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are proceeding in a sequence.  First, we want to assemble the evidence. We are not discussing with the British Government what is to be done with the evidence until it has been assembled.  It would be premature to discuss options for dealing with new evidence before it has been assembled.  We have not, therefore, engaged in a discussion of the options open to the British Government to vindicate the rights of those who have been wronged.  We have not gone into that sort of detail because we think it is proper to go through a process of first assembling the evidence and presenting it, and then discussing the steps that are necessary to vindicate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the Irish Government alone is endeavouring to put together the evidence in this regard, or is it getting active co-operation from the British Government, including Sir Patrick Mayhew?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I did not respond to Deputy Ahern in regard to Sir Patrick Mayhew. However, I did respond in the House the day after the Secretary of State made his remarks when I indicated my surprise at the remarks he had expressed on the matter.  There would be no great advantage in going over that ground again. It is important to make the point that subsequent to that I had a discussion with the British Ambassador, and subsequent to that a detailed statement was issued clarifying the British Government's attitude to this matter which deals with any misunderstanding which might have arisen from Sir Patrick Mayhew's original remarks.  All of that is already on the record of the House and has been dealt with by me in response to questions from Deputies, including Deputy Ahern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> As to whether the only assembly of evidence in this matter is the one being conducted by the Irish Government, the answer is no.  The British Government is carrying out its own assessment of the evidence, and there is co-operation between the Irish and British Governments in regard to this matter in an ongoing operational way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any outside views been sought in relation to this evidence or is all the assessment being done by the Government and its officials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage all the assessment is being done by the Government and its officials on the basis of information that is available, some of which originated from outside sources, for example, public records, inquiries and studies that have been done on the matter.  When we come to look at the legal implications and the evidential requirements that might apply in regard to particular matters, and at aspects of international law as referred to by Deputy Ahern, the possibility of using external expertise is not excluded and may well be the appropriate thing to do.  At this stage we are doing an internal study of the matter which I expect to be complete in a matter of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In a letter to John Hume the British Prime Minister indicated that the victims of Bloody Sunday should be treated as having been innocent.  Surely an apology from the British Government would not correct the record and cover-up of Widgery.  The only way the memory of those who were murdered on that day in January 1972 can be vindicated and that their families can be at peace is by having a public international tribunal.  Would the Taoiseach accept that an apology would be far too convenient for the British Government and that what is required is a public airing of the circumstances of the horrible murder of those people on that day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know from my discussions with the relatives of the victims of Blood Sunday that they do not regard an apology as the primary issue, nor is retribution a primary focus of their concern.  They simply want the truth to come out and the reputation of their deceased loved ones vindicated beyond all doubt and in the most public way possible so that they, as relatives of the victims, will be able to move on in their own lives without the gnawing sense that they and their loved ones have a continuing question mark over their reputations when they were entirely innocent victims of an appalling series of acts. However, we should bear in mind that there are many people in all parties on both sides of the Irish Sea who are anxious to see the truth come out.  We should not present the issue in an antagonistic way that might make it more difficult for people whom we want to influence in ensuring <Col N="1416" /> there is maximum openness and truth-telling in this matter.  That is the only quibble I have with the phraseology chosen by the Deputy.  It could conceivably be counterproductive to its purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has accepted that an apology would not meet the wishes of the families, that they want a public airing of this matter. Will he accept that a judicial review would be similar to an apology and a proper public inquiry with an international dimension is the way forward to finally clear the good names of those who were murdered?  Surely, with the evidence already available and being assembled, the good-will of people on the other side of the water is not needed.  The names of those people should be cleared so that their families can get on with the rest of their lives.  Since the British Prime Minister accepted that the people were innocent, surely the next logical step is to hold a judicial inquiry with an international dimension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that a judicial review of the matter and an apology are the same thing.  A judicial review is a public inquiry, and I am surprised the Deputy should suggest an equivalence between the two.  An apology is simply a form of words whereas a judicial review is an examination in an open way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are asking others to wait for the evidence and examine it in an open and unprejudiced way before deciding the case, we probably should adopt the same approach and should not decide on the appropriate action before we have looked at all the evidence.  I have indicated publicly on a number of occasions that I regard some of the new evidence that has come to public knowledge as very serious and persuasive. It is important that we wait until all the evidence is presented to draw the appropriate conclusions. That is the best way of approaching the matter from the point of view of getting the outcome we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene on this matter, but the Taoiseach is adopting a softly softly approach in that he does not want to disturb the British at any cost, despite the discord that has existed for many years.  An inquiry is demanded by the people along the Border to clear the names of the people involved.  Further lily-livered apologies will not be acceptable to the people of Derry and along the Border.  The Taoiseach should insist on an inquiry and put an end to the softly softly approach to a problem that is obviously of the making of another Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want a result and I want the truth.  I want the victims to be vindicated and I <Col N="1417" /> propose to follow the course I believe is the best one to obtain a result in this matter.  I have listened to what the Deputy has to say, but do not believe that deciding on the evidence before examining it is the best approach.  The Government should assemble the evidence first and, having examined it, decide on the next step.  If I were to take the Deputy's advice there is a risk I would be accused of being as prejudiced as we wish others not to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach meet the Northern party leaders in Washington or elsewhere during his St. Patrick's Day visit?  There are a number of differences between Senator Kennedy's statements and the Government position of last December.  Is the Taoiseach saying those differences are not significant and that he generally supports, as I do, what Senator Kennedy stated?  Does he agree with what former Senator Mitchell said, that what is needed is good faith in negotiations?  Will the Taoiseach agree with those in the North who say that when the talks resume on 3 June two new Governments are badly needed at that stage to move the position forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Deputy was inattentive when I replied to his question about the leaders of Northern parties.  I had informal meetings with all the leaders of the Northern parties who were in Washington. Very useful discussions took place and I expressed the hope that I would have further meetings with them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Trimble, Mr. Hume, Mr. Ervine and Lord Alderdice.  In regard to Sinn Féin's involvement in the talks, the Government has set out its position on that matter.  There is no great divergence between what Senator Kennedy said and the pre-stated Irish position on the matter. Our policy is set out in our own statements, not in statements by anyone else.  The issue of good faith in negotiations is very important &mdash; I agree with what Senator Mitchell said in that regard.  On the last part of the Deputy's question as it applies to this country, that certainly will not occur, and in regard to the other jurisdiction, I am surprised the Deputy is seeking to interfere in the political decision made on another island by offering advice to the British electorate.  I have no intention of following that unwise route.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the optional HIV testing programme announced in 1996 following the revelation of another scandal involving the Blood Transfusion Service Board and was due to begin three months ago, has not commenced.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have already informed the House that following the introduction of HIV donor screening test by the Blood Transfusion Service Board in October 1985, no lookback was undertaken between 1985 and 1989 in respect of earlier <Col N="1422" /> donations made by donors who are now screening positive for HIV.  A lookback procedure was in place from 1989 onwards for newly presenting donors.  As the House will be aware, the BTSB has intensified its HIV lookback to trace all recipients of potentially HIV infected blood issues.</P>
      <P>Because there is no guarantee all or, indeed, any of the untraced issues will be traced, and also because of the possibility some donors who were HIV positive prior to the introduction of HIV donor screening in October 1985 did not donate after October 1985 and cannot, therefore, be identified, I decided to introduce an optional HIV testing programme to offer screening to blood transfusion and blood product recipients who may be at risk, however small that risk may be.</P>
      <P>Before commencing such a programme it is absolutely essential that the risk, if any, involved for recipients must be determined as far as possible to enable each recipient to make a fully informed decision, in consultation with his or her general practitioner, in relation to availing of screening.  The element of risk for recipients will vary according to the year in which they received the transfusion or blood product, and according to the product they received.  I hope the preparations for the HIV testing programme, which are well advanced, will be completed in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the BTSB targeted lookback is continuing and the following is the up to date position as of today.  A total of 25 blood donors have tested positive for HIV since screening was introduced in 1985. Eight of those were first time donors and accordingly, no risk of HIV transmission to recipients was involved.  In the case of ten of the remaining 17 donors, recipients of potentially infected issues were traced and none of the recipients tested positive.</P>
      <P>Tracing recipients of the issues from the remaining seven donors has been rendered difficult by the absence of the BTSB despatch records for the period prior to 1986.  Of the 33 issues from those seven donors, 15 were donated prior to 1981 and are not regarded as a potential source of infection.  The residual problem relates to tracing the recipients of the balance of the 18 issues derived from the potentially infected blood donations made prior to 1985.  Seven of these issues have been traced leaving 11 issues of concern outstanding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for information on this aspect of the contamination problem.  On 17 December last, the Minister indicated testing would commence in January 1997 as a result of a problem which had arisen where a person had been contaminated with HIV after receiving a transfusion.  On 28 January, the Minister said it would start shortly and he was referring the matter to the Attorney General for advice.  Given that when the hepatitis C crisis arose a screening programme was up and running <Col N="1423" /> in a matter of days, would the Minister not agree that the question of a HIV screening programme is as, if not more, urgent?  Although he said on 17 December last testing would commence in January, it is almost April and it has not yet started. Would the Minister agree that is not the type of response people who have had transfusions and who would like their situation clarified should have to contend with?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I assure the House I am proceeding as quickly as possible. The BTSB is continuing with its rigorous programme. As the Deputy pointed out, I sought legal advice on this matter.  The nature of the legal advice is that the risk, if any, involved for a recipient must be determined as far as possible to enable them to make a fully informed decision on availing of screening.  Since there are different categories of risk, albeit small risks, this must be presented to persons who might be involved so that they may make an informed decision on screening. As I informed the House, I hope the task will be completed in the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In an optional testing programme, I do not understand the reason &mdash; perhaps the Minister might elaborate further &mdash; a person cannot be allowed to make a decision to avail of a screening programme, if available, without it being necessary for the level of risk to be assessed for them so that they make a fully informed decision.  Surely, the quickest way a person can come to a decision on this matter and clarify his situation is to allow him access to an optional HIV screening programme immediately?  Is it not a matter for the person concerned to decide if he wishes to be screened rather than first having to establish the level of risk, which available legal advice suggests?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I appreciate the Deputy's point which, at first glance, appears valid.  However, I am advised it would not be proper from the point of view of effective optional testing or fulfilling legal obligations to advertise that persons who received blood or blood products between specific dates should come forward for testing, if they so wish. This would not precision persons at potential risk to make an informed decision.  The nature of the information provided to persons at potential risk must be more refined for the optional testing programme to be effective and for the BTSB to fulfil the obligations required. The danger is &mdash; putting this in non legal terminology &mdash; that if we tell people who feel they need a test to get one, it will not indicate those who may be at risk rather than those who may not.  We would not be appropriately focusing on persons who may require the test above those who do not require it.  Give the <Col N="1424" /> Deputy's legal background, he will understand what I said.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's point and will study what he has said and table further questions rather than pursuing the matter at this stage.</P>
      <P>On a related matter, given that people have been told they have a month to decide whether to accept the damages given by the <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal, will the Minister indicate if the Bill placing the compensation tribunal on a statutory basis will be ready by 5 April?  If that is not possible, will the heads of the Bill be published before 5 April so that people can make an informed decision as to whether they should accept the damages offered to them by the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal or wait for the statutory one?  Undertakings were given that they could make that informed decision within a month of the publication of the tribunal report.  Will the Minister indicate that he will enable people to make that informed decision by either publishing the Bill or its heads before 5 April?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is a different question and, although I will be replying to the debate on this matter later this afternoon, I will facilitate the Deputy.  Those persons who have not made a decision to accept or reject an award of the compensation tribunal already communicated to them will not be disadvantaged by the statutory tribunal when it replaces the existing informal one.  As I indicated in the House on Thursday, one of the elements assured by Government in respect of a statutory tribunal is that any benefit it may confer on existing applicants whose cases have not been heard or on future applicants will not operate in a manner which disadvantages anyone who has already had an award made or anyone who processes their claim in the meantime.</P>
      <P>I want the tribunal to continue.  It has set dates for hearings for several months ahead.  I know people who have dates for hearings and who are anxious their cases be heard and awards made. The process will be geared in a manner ensuring that any benefit conferred after the statutory tribunal comes into place will be retrospectively conferred on those who have already had their cases heard or whose cases will proceed to hearings in the interim.</P>

A sum of £27 million was set aside in the post-budget Estimates for supply services to meet the cost of the deal.  That was the original portion of the cost for 1997.  That leaves a shortfall of £49 million.  In accordance with Government policy on public expenditure, the Government decided on 19 February to levy each Department on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to make up the shortfall.  The Department of Health must pay approximately £8 million. In Estimates terms, it is a yield of £8 million in cash which is the equivalent of £8.7 million in expenditure terms.  The savings will be achieved through the most efficient and effective use of resources and through marginal adjustments spread over a number of programmes.  The reduction will be reflected in the major Votes in presented.  The Deputy is aware that, with an approximate budget of £2.5 billion, it is possible for health boards and voluntary hospitals to show savings when they have an indication early in the year of what is expected of them.  While there will be adjustments in expenditure on various programmes, the hospitals and the health boards will be expected to maintain services.</P>

      <P>The media should note that, as we approach an election campaign, a cutback now becomes a marginal adjustment.  Can the Minister confirm that, in making these marginal adjustments to expenditure on programmes, he will not impinge upon mental handicap services?  The resourcing of the community care programme for people with a mental handicap must now be bolstered <Col N="1426" /> given the recent tragic double murder in Grangegorman.  I am informed that, less than a fortnight previously, a break-in occurred at the residence where those dastardly murders took place and that the nurse in residence on that night was informed. Does the Minister agree it is important that no cutbacks take place in that service and that there should be a bolstering of resources, given the public outcry at the savage nature of those murders?</P>
      <P>In terms of the marginal adjustments in expenditure, what part of the special budget package of £25 million announced on budget day will be affected?

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Throughout 1996 my colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for child care, Deputy Currie, hosted a consultative process on mandatory reporting.  The process examined, not only the issue of mandatory reporting, but also other aspects of our child protection services.  In response to the views expressed by child care professionals and others who participated in the consultative process, a series of initiatives were published to best promote and protect the rights of children in &ldquo;Putting Children First &mdash; Promoting <Col N="1427" /> and Protecting the Rights of Children&rdquo;.  The proposed initiatives are: (i) designated officers in the health boards to co-ordinate inter-agency approaches to child protection at community care level; (ii) Regional and Local Child Protection Committees, operating at health board and community care level, to enhance inter-agency and inter-professional approaches to child protection; (iii) multi-disciplinary training, under the aegis of the Regional Child Protection Committees, to increase inter-agency and inter-professional approaches to child protection; (iv) The new Social Services Inspectorate to review the 1987 Child Abuse Guidelines and the procedure for the notification of suspected cases of abuse between health boards and gardaí; (v) a public information campaign to heighten public awareness of child abuse and of the system to respond to cases of child abuse; (vi) the provision of support services by health boards for victims of past abuse; (vii) funding of voluntary agencies dealing with children to be conditional on procedures being in place to deal with allegations of child abuse, and (viii) evaluation of the impact of the above measures on the reporting of child abuse.</P>
      <P>My Department is also developing proposals on the establishment of a body to promote and protect children's rights, such as an ombudsman for children.  The Minister of State has given a commitment that he will evaluate the impact of these measures on the reporting of child abuse. If, following this evaluation, it is clear the introduction of mandatory reporting would be in the best interests of children, or that some form of statutory basis to ensure co-operation between agencies is required, then the necessary legislation will be introduced.</P>
      <P>My paramount concern and that of my colleague, the Minister of State, has always been what is in the best interests of children.  I was heartened that this was also the paramount concern of all those who participated in the consultative process on mandatory reporting.  However, it was suggested in a number of submissions that sight should not be lost of a person's right to his or her good name in dealing with the reporting of child abuse and the Minister of State was conscious of the need to maintain an appropriate balance in developing the initiatives outlined.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  In light of the Government's decision against mandatory reporting, following a long consultative process, will he accept that following the Department of Health's guidelines to which he referred is discretionary and has resulted in less rather than greater protection for children? The guidelines state it is incumbent on health professionals to report suspicious of child abuse to the gardaí.  Will he accept that because that obligation is discretionary and not mandatory, it has permitted bad practice among health professionals?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The protection of children is not discretionary.  The Minister of State, Deputy Currie implemented the Child Care Act.  Even though it was passed in 1991 it was only implemented during 1995 and 1996.  The protection of children enshrined in that Act is a statutory provision.  For the first time in that Act the protection of children is guaranteed in a modern way by statute.</P>
      <P>On the question of indicative guidelines, the Deputy will be aware that mandatory reporting is rather like the concept of mandatory sentencing; under law there is an obligation to report at pain of criminal sanction.  That decision has not been taken by the Government, but it does not impact in any way on the obligations of health professionals to do what they are supposed to do under the regulations and Protocols issued by the Department of Health through the health boards.</P>

      <P>What sanction will be applied to a health care professional who does not comply with the provision in the guidelines to report an allegation of child sexual abuse to the gardaí?  Is the Minister aware that we embarked on this major consultative process because of the key recommendation of the Kilkenny report, that the guidelines had been breached because they had been used in a discretionary fashion?  Will the Minister agree that because the Government has decided against mandatory reporting a health care professional is not under any legal obligation to report allegations of child abuse to the gardaí? Will he also agree that because of that there is less protection for children than there was previously? Will he accept that the key recommendation of not only the Kilkenny report but the Kelly Fitzgerald report and the Law Reform Commission report has been set at nought by the Government?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy is aware of the long consultative process and that persons involved in child care on a day to day basis were consulted.  Her view on the practice of child care is a minority one, but there is merit in it and in the view of those who advocate mandatory reporting.  That debate is also taking place in other jurisdiction.  I remind the Deputy and other Members of the Government's decision on this matter.  I read out the series of eight initiatives implemented by the Minister of State, but the Government decision also provides that if, following the implementation and evaluation of those initiatives, a clear case can be made subsequently that mandatory reporting is in the best interests of children, or that some form of statutory basis to ensure co-operation between agencies is required, then the necessary legislation will be introduced.  That is a reasonable position.  We have very good child care professionals who work extremely well.  They want strengthened their powers and the framework within which they operate.  The Minister of State has proceeded to strengthen that framework and he has also talked <Col N="1429" /> about establishing a body, such as an ombudsman for children, to further strengthen the position, but he stopped short of introducing mandatory reporting at this time.  That was a consensus view of those involved in the day to day care of children. That decision was not made in the interest of the professions, it was made in the interest of the protection of children.  The Deputy is aware there is major potential downside to mandatory reporting, as experienced in the United States. The Minister of State has brought the professionals along with him.  He has introduced a series of initiatives, said they will be evaluated after an appropriate time and if the mandatory route is deemed to be necessary we can reconsider the position with a view to taking that route. That is reasonable in the context of the major progress made by the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, who implemented the Child Care Act and secured the necessary resources through me from the Government to do so.  He has a good deal of credibility on this issue and the House should support him on the major improvement he has made in the care of children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

      <P>The Minister said his junior Minister has brought child care professionals along with him in so far as they are represented by the agencies that represent health care workers in the health boards, but he has not brought along with him those independent agencies that are interested primarily in the welfare of children rather than the practice and conditions of work of the social workers and health professionals concerned.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of mandatory reporting is that those who, in the light of their knowledge, made reports to the gardaí of allegations of child sexual abuse would have needed a statutory indemnity against being sued for libel.  Will the Minister agree that if such statutory indemnity does not apply to those people who want to report an allegation, they will be afraid to do so because of a fear of litigation by alleged abusers?  Will he agree that is a key area that needs to be considered given that many people, to whose attention it is brought that matters should be reported to the authorities, fear of making matters known to statutory bodies, sporting organisations or school management because of the fear of litigation by persons against whom allegations are made?</P>

    <P>The Deputy's question refers to immunity for anyone who reports child abuse.  However, that would be too broad a measure.  One can see the <Col N="1430" /> potential for complaints to be made with total immunity without evidence.  Immunity for professionals will continue to concern us.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Under the Voluntary Health Insurance Act 1957, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board was established as a body corporate with perpetual succession in respect of which the Minister for Health was given specific powers.</P>
      <P>Following on the measures taken by me under the VHI (Amendment) Act, 1996, to enable the board to better equip itself for the changed competitive business environment in which it must now operate, I am of the opinion that a change in the board's legal status should be examined.  I have requested the board to examine and report to me on this matter, that I may consider what further steps, if any, should be taken in the interests of the VHI's members.  I emphasise that it is a matter for the board, in the first instance, to propose to me any measures regarding a change in its legal status that it considers appropriate and beneficial to its effective operation as a modern insurance undertaking.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, with the recent commencement of competition in our private medical insurance business, the Minister for Health must fulfil the role of independent regulator of the market. Accordingly, I am anxious that this new reality should be taken into consideration as regards the Minister's statutory relationship with the VHI.</P>

      <P>Given the situation of the VHI, every statement the Minister made at the dinner was made with intent.  The Minister suggested that the VHI may have to cut loose.  He suggested the company should enter a strategic alliance with one other international partner.  It is interesting that the Minister, the Government and the Department direct policy for the VHI.  However, the Government believes strategic alliances are a matter for body corporate.  Who directs the future policy of the VHI?  Is it the Minister or the VHI? Will he confirm that he suggested a strategic alliance for the VHI at that dinner?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I did not have a script to circulate but I spoke with intent.  There were certain ideas I wished to promote and there was a suitable audience present.  The VHI board members present were not surprised as I had already communicated my ideas to them.</P>
      <P>The question of separating the VHI from the Department raises three issues.  First, is the status of the VHI the most effective vehicle for the operation of a modern health insurance company in a competitive market.  When I introduced the first amending legislation since the 1957 Act, I stated that it was a legislative instalment and not the final word in the structure which the VHI would need to move into a competitive environment.</P>
      <P>Second, the VHI may be of the view that it requires flexibility in its legal status to enable it to take on the challenges of a competitive market. Alternatively, it may feel that a joint venture would be preferable.  If it feels either of these arrangements would benefit its members it will have to examine its legal position.  The legal basis of the 1957 Act is unusual and has no parallel in the State sector.</P>
      <P>Third, the Health Insurance Act, 1996, stipulates that the Minister for Health is regulator of the competitive health insurance market.  This sits uneasily on the shoulders of the Minister as long as the VHI operates under the aegis of the Department.  Any Minister is capable of wearing a regulator's hat on one set of issues and a ministerial hat on a different set of issues.  This may present a difficulty for competitors.  If legislation is being introduced the regulatory function should be removed from the Minister.  Perhaps it should pass to the Department of Enterprise and Employment which regulates the insurance market and cash plans in the health insurance market. Alternatively, if the VHI is removed from the aegis of the Department it would be appropriate for the Minister to retain the regulatory function. These were the issues I discussed informally at the VHI dinner.  They will face any future Minister and so it is important that there be a public debate.</P>
      <P>The Government will make the decision regarding a strategic alliance for the VHI.  The VHI must bring forward a strategic plan for its future.  If I am advised that the strategic alliance route is the preferred option I will present this idea to Government.  That is preferable to giving the VHI <i>carte blanche</i> to examine any arrangement.  The board of the VHI runs the company through its acting chief executive and board members and we all know there are foreseeable difficulties, which must be confronted, resulting from current competition in the marketplace.  Consequently the board, management and I consider that change is necessary.  Under its new chairman I have asked the VHI to submit a strategic plan to me.  If that involves recommendations for legislative change, I will examine them and take them with my views on their proposals to Government.</P>

      <P>I am glad of that detailed reply from the Minsiter which appears to suggest the direction in which he is thinking but I must remind him we are in the real world, each of us having served in Government.  The Minister mentioned policy ideas, maintaining that the board of the VHI would be aware of them.  Were his Cabinet colleagues aware of or did they approve these ideas?  If this Government wishes to contest the next general election as one coherent unit &mdash; endeavouring to achieve some degree of coherence as it faces the electorate &mdash; will it indicate to the electorate and VHI policyholders whether it is in favour of a strategic alliance which could be appropriately pursued?  Are there ideological differences within the Government on this question? Is the Minister not seeking to suggest that he was giving some personal musings at the anniversary dinner on the direction he considered should be followed henceforth?  Is he not aware, as he suggested, of the views of the board of the VHI, under its former and present chairmen, as to which direction the board should go?  Will the Minister indicate whether this Government will implement a proposal to allow the VHI enter a strategic alliance?  Why must the Minister couch his language in such careful terms if there are not other members of the Government very displeased that he brought these issues into the public domain at what they regard as a politically sensitive time?</P>
      <P>While I have sympathy with the Minister in his difficulty in getting his Cabinet colleagues to agree on a certain policy direction which would enable him and the VHI to perform their rightful functions, that will be impossible and the uncertainty of direction of the VHI will continue until such time as the Government refuses to delegate its responsibility and to set the policy direction to enable its chairman and board to proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Since the publication of the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community, the health boards have taken a number of initiatives in relation to travellers' health.  These include the establishment of a pilot project by the Eastern Health Board in training travellers for jobs in primary health care, the appointment of an officer by the Western Health Board to co-ordinate health services for travellers and the setting up by the North Eastern Health Board of a broadly-based advisory committee on travellers' health.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department, in consultation with the health boards, have been working on a draft policy statement on travellers' health.  The policy statement will set out a number of specific steps to be taken to increase the level of uptake of health services by the travelling community.</P>
      <P>I propose to take steps in the immediate future to set up the traveller health advisory committee recommended by the task force which will comprise officials of my Department and representatives of the health boards, travellers and traveller organisations.  The first function of this committee will be to consider the draft policy statement.  I expect to be in a position to publish this document within the next few months.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the policy statement, a traveller health unit, as recommended by the task force, will be established in each health board area.  This will bring together travellers, health service providers and other relevant statutory bodies, such as local authorities, to identify developments most likely to achieve greater takeup of health services by the travelling community. Another crucial development I will pursue will be the replication in all health boards of two pilot projects in the Eastern Health Board involving the training of travellers to participate in the delivery of health services.</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind that the report of the task force was published in July 1995 and contained 33 recommendations in regard to travellers' <Col N="1435" /> health, the Minister's reply is disappointing in the extreme.  Has any of those 33 recommendations been fully and properly implemented?  Can the Minister confirm even now that each health board has established a traveller health unit, as recommended by the task force?  I have carefully examined their recommendations in the health area but cannot ascertain, from the Minister's reply, that any one has been fully or properly implemented.  Does the Minister agree this is similar to what is happening in all other Government Departments with responsibility for implementing such recommendations?  Does he agree that the Government's commitment to the recommendations of this report is seriously lacking, primarily because there is no co-ordinated attempt to implement them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Some health boards have already taken initiatives in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force.  At Pavee Point the Eastern Health Board has established a primary health care travellers' project, where eight traveller women are being trained in primary health care.  Again at Pavee Point the Eastern Health Board has undertaken an EU project &mdash; under the NOW project &mdash; providing new opportunities for women, with 15 traveller women participating, leading to qualification for jobs in primary health care.  The Eastern Health Board is also forming traveller committees, and a central committee, in each community care area.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board appointed a superintendent, a public health nurse, to co-ordinate health board services for travellers in that region. The North-Eastern Health Board recently established an advisory health committee on travellers' health which includes representatives of other statutory bodies such as local authorities.  The Mid-Western Health Board has issued discussion documents on travellers' health.  The Eastern Health Board, the Midland Health Board, the South-Eastern Health Board and the Western Health Board have specialist public health nurses for travellers.  Much has been done.  I have indicated to the chief executive officers of the health boards I expect travellers in their functional areas will get health care services as good as those of the settled community and they have an obligation to fulfil in respect of the travelling community. It is a disgrace that over many generations, as can be seen from the statistics, life expectancy among travellers not only relates to their socio economic position in the community but also to the lack of health care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it is a disgrace health boards have not implemented a key recommendation of the task force report, namely, the establishment of a traveller health unit in the Department?  Surely it is possible to set up such a unit in each health board region.  We have heard from the Minister about a number of initiatives, <Col N="1436" /> none of which addresses the responsibility of individual health boards to establish a traveller health unit in each health board and to get on with the task of implementing the 33 recommendations in so far as they affect each health board.  Will the Minister agree his Department has been remiss, in view of the fact that in 1994 in a national health strategy a commitment was given to address the particular needs of the travelling community? Obviously, progress has not been made because the unit in his Department has not been properly established.  This is an indication of the weakness of the commitment not only in the Minister's Department but by Ministers with responsibility for health, social welfare, employment, equality etc.  I agree with the Minister the health status of travellers is disgraceful by comparison with that of the settled community.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree what is needed is real action rather than endless pilot schemes and reports, of which we have had many, in relation to the health, status and rights of the travelling community?  Will he agree the most visible manifestation of the neglect of some children of the travelling community is they are allowed to beg on our streets?  If the Government could take action against that practice it would go a long way towards protecting the rights of those children who are being abused by their parents. Will the Minister agree there is no ethnic right in the travelling community to allow their children become beggars?  Will he agree this is a criminal offence and that no action has been taken by the Government?  Despite promises and given that the matter has been raised by me and other Members on several occasions a blind eye is being turned to this practice.  It is child abuse to allow children continue to beg on our streets, with the permission of their parents.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Since 1993 over 300 additional social worker posts have been approved for child care services.  Approximately 70 additional social worker posts were approved for 1995 and 1996. In addition to these posts, significant numbers of other additional posts, such as child care workers and family support workers, were created to improve the delivery of child care services. The number of child care social worker posts to be approved in 1997 is still under discussion with the health boards.  The further development of in-service and multi-disciplinary training is also the subject of on-going discussion between my Department and the health boards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been question and answer sessions under successive Governments on less significant issues in the past five or six years.  The fact that the two Ministers have contributed to the debate means there are still questions that require clarification <Col N="1440" /> or have been left unanswered.  My colleagues would like to put questions on their own behalf and on behalf of others who are not Members of the House.  The Ministers are <i>au fait</i> with the issues and have the answers.  They are confident enough to answer questions in the national media every day.</P>
    <P>It seems incredible that a 30 minute question and answer session cannot be facilitated following a significant debate in the House.

    <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i>, on Thursday, 20 March 1997:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann,</P>

      <P>Even though the House has debated hepatitis C on approximately 30 occasions certain problems still remain to be resolved, for example, the procedure for taking blood and from whom.  The Minister reassured us that he has reorganised the BTSB, yet there is no evidence of this.  Computers are only as good as the information fed into them.  The Minister should start with the basics and ensure a proper questionnaire is used when taking blood.  This questionnaire could include simple questions such as whether donors have received blood, a blood product or anti-D, whether they are on medication or suffering from a disease and whether their occupation or lifestyle puts them at a risk in terms of being a donor.  This type of information has not been sought or correlated by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  The media is uncovering new problems every week.  While most of these are clerical in nature, nevertheless they highlight the problems in the BTSB.  This does not enhance the good name of the BTSB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it necessary to change the management structure of the BTSB?  Would an executive chairman solve the problems?  We should not downgrade the product of the BTSB.  I am happy from a safety point of view that we have a reliable product, be it whole blood, blood product or anti-D. <Col N="1451" /> We should not scare people who must have operations or need blood products.  Neither should we politicise certain aspects of this issue.  It is the job of the Opposition to criticise and ensure improvements and not to criticise and damage a good service. This service is based on voluntary donations from a pool of blood which has a low incidence of any serious type of infectivity and, therefore, it should not be a major problem to deliver a safe product of which we can all be proud.</P>
    <P>There are other issues which need to be addressed and perhaps the Minister will deal with these in his reply.  What type of aggravated damages does he have in mind?  The language he uses in relation to same is still somewhat equivocal. Will there be an appeals mechanism?  How will the people who have already received settlements from the compensation tribunal be brought into the reckoning at this stage?  What is the position of the dependants of those people who have unfortunately died?</P>
    <P>Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, haemophiliacs and transplantees have said this is not solely a matter of compensation.  Money cannot buy health, which is what we are primarily concerned about here.  An apology from the services and those who let down these people and then tried to cover up the issue should have been forthcoming long before now.  I wonder if we would be talking about aggravated or punitive damages today if the plight of these people had been addressed differently during the initial stages by Ministers.  I think not.</P>
    <P>The services for those affected need to be improved.  The hepatology services provided under a medical card are satisfactory.  It is unfortunate that affected patients needing rheumatology services, bronchoscopies, etc., have to queue with other public patients.  Their medical services card should entitle them to priority treatment in those areas.  These people have been hard done by and should be recompensed.</P>
    <P>The recommendations for improving the service need further elucidation.  The development plan, previously referred to, does not appear to be in place despite the fact that it is some months since it was first mooted.  A biannual review of the Blood Transfusion Service Board by the National Drugs Advisory Board is not sufficient. A better monitoring system must be put in place. The reporting of abnormalities and reactions must be put on a proper basis.  The establishment of a blood services consumer council would give the BTSB a much needed boost in regard to maintaining confidence.  A procedure for recalling products should be implemented immediately.  If the proper systems are put in place, the recall of products will not be necessary in future.</P>
    <P>If best practice had been implemented at the outset, this problem would not have arisen.  The BTSB was negligent at that time because jaundice is hepatitis until proved otherwise.  If that had been recognised by the people operating the service <Col N="1452" /> at the time, we would not have the problems we are facing today.</P>
    <P>It is important that people using the transfusion service have confidence in it.  We have a good product and I hope people will not be unduly concerned about using it in future.  From reading today's newspapers, it appears that people with leukaemia and others requiring transfusions and other blood products are concerned, but they should not be frightened to avail of existing blood products.</P>

      <P>As Members of the House, we owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Justice Thomas Finlay for the comprehensive report produced by him in a short period.  Arising out of this tragedy, we know that over 1,600 women were mugged and poisoned by a State agency charged with the duty of protecting their health.  We know Brigid McCole died because of that failure of duty.  We do not yet know the number of women who died during the 1980s or early 1990s due to being administered contaminated blood products because the look-back programme has not yet fully investigated that issue, and we may never know the true number.</P>
      <P>We know that what occurred was not a result of medical ignorance or lack of scientific knowledge but a failure by the BTSB to adhere to its own procedural guidelines.  We know that each time the alarm bells rang, somebody switched off the alarm and played deaf.  We know that when what occurred was made public, the full story was not told, inadequate counselling was provided for the victims of this scandal and some were asked for intimate details of their sexual lives, giving rise to the suggestion that their health difficulties may have been caused by promiscuous conduct.</P>
      <P>We know that the Hederman-O'Brien committee was not furnished with all information relating to this scandal by either the BTSB or the Department of Health.  We know that successive Governments failed to provide adequate resources over a period of 20 years to ensure proper inspection by the National Drugs Advisory Board of the BTSB, and that the need for resources was constantly made known to the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that when the late Brigid McCole took the State and the BTSB to court to establish who was responsible for the tragedy that destroyed her life, she was treated like an enemy of the State, and legal defences were fired on the basis that the BTSB and the State had no responsibility for what occurred.  We know that no effective mechanism was put in place to allow into the public arena the full story of this awful scandal going back over two decades, and to establish full responsibility, until the Finlay tribunal <Col N="1453" /> was, rightly, established by the present Minister for Health.  We now know as a result of the Finlay report that both the BTSB and the State are culpable.</P>
    <P>The victims of the scandal were forced to fight a legal and political battle for three years to get the truth.  Too many political, legal and bureaucratic obstacles during those three years obstructed progress.  In 1994, again in 1995 and subsequently, I called for the Garda Commissioner to initiate a criminal investigation and for a file to be submitted to the DPP.  One newspaper reported nine days ago that the Garda have finally commenced an investigation.  Is the Minister in a position to confirm the accuracy of this report?</P>
    <P>Upon the publication of the Finlay report, the Cabinet forwarded it to the DPP.  Without a Garda investigation and file being submitted to the DPP containing evidence to warrant the bringing of prosecutions, I do not believe the DPP will be in a position to bring criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the report has been furnished to him.</P>
    <P>I have asked previously that the manner in which the State and State agencies treat citizens of this State who litigate, alleging a serious wrong done to them by the State, be examined and new structures put in place to ensure no one is again treated in the manner Brigid McCole and her family were treated.  To date, nothing has happened in this regard.  It is a problem that must be addressed in the future.</P>
    <P>Reading the Finlay report led inescapably to the conclusion that the victims of this dreadful scandal are entitled to aggravated damages. While extra damages paid cannot make good the dreadful wrong done to them, justice, decency and humanity demand that aggravated damages be forthcoming as an acceptance by the State and the BTSB of their responsibility and liability for what occurred.</P>
    <P>Last Friday week I publicly stated that I believed aggravated or exemplary damages should be paid.  I also said that I hoped and expected colleagues in Cabinet would take such a view.  The women affected by this scandal and their families have been put through more than is humanly acceptable.  Mary Quinlan, whose High Court proceedings are to be heard shortly, should not have to litigate the issue of aggravated damages and be put under the strain and pressure of a court hearing.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the announcements last Thursday by the Minister for Health on the changes proposed to the workings of the compensation tribunal.  The Minister was correct to establish the compensation tribunal, under the able chairmanship of Mr. Justice Egan.  It has proved a most appropriate forum to facilitate the victims of this tragedy to process claims for damages without being under the type of additional pressures that normally fall on the shoulders of those who have to litigate in the High Court.  He is correct <Col N="1454" /> to agree to allow the tribunal to make awards of enhanced or aggravated damages.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify whether the BTSB will automatically accept that victims of this scandal are entitled to be awarded such damages, and that it will merely be the function of the tribunal to determine the amount of damages to be awarded, or whether liability for the payment of such damages to individual applicants is, in any application, to be contested in any way.  I would also like the Minister to confirm that aggravated damages will be paid into the estate of the late Brigid McCole, and that liability to pay such damages will not be contested in Mary Quinlan's proceedings.</P>
    <P>I have long been of the view that the tragedy that has befallen the victims of the BTSB scandal transcends party politics.  It is not an issue for crass party-political point scoring and game playing. The victims of this tragedy deserve more.  At all times they deserve to be treated with insight and sensitivity and not turned into a political football.  I deplore the statement by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Health, Deputy Brian Cowen, announcing triumphantly some victory for Fianna Fáil arising out of the Government's decisions and criticising the Government for making a U-turn.</P>

      <P>On various occasions inside and outside the Dáil over the past three years I have <Col N="1455" /> expressed concern at the manner in which successive Governments have dealt with the consequences of the BTSB scandal.  I share the anger of many at the manner in which the BTSB has failed in its duty and destroyed people's lives.  My views in this regard have also been expressed privately to Fine Gael Party colleagues.  Upon its publication I was entitled to express a public view on RTÉ on the consequences of the Finlay report and, as a Member of Dáil Éireann, I had a duty to do so.  The views I expressed last Friday week reflected the views of a great many people throughout the country and, were welcomed by many.  The decisions now made by Government have been equally welcomed.</P>
      <P>At the time when I called on the Government to agree aggravated damages no Cabinet decision on the issue had been made.  I assume that was the reason no reference to the payment of aggravated damages or to any changes being made to the compensation tribunal's terms of reference was contained in the statements issued at the ministerial press conference held by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and the present Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan, on the publication of the Finlay report. At the time of my broadcast, Positive Action had called on the Government to agree to the payment of aggravated damages and to amend the terms of reference of the compensation tribunal. I felt it was entitled to both political and moral support in the call it was making.  I was anxious that it should not feel it was entering a new phase of yet another long drawn out political battle.  I believed that these women and men who have been through so much were at least entitled to that.</P>
      <P>I was astonished to read of the despicable personal attack subsequently launched on my alleged motives by an unnamed source as reported by some members of the media.  I do not believe that the Taoiseach or any Government Minister is responsible for the comments made.  I regard as contemptible the suggestion that my expressing support for the payment of aggravated damages to the victims of the BTSB was motivated by some perceived personal electoral gain.  It is unfortunate that on occasion credibility is given to cowardly political spin doctors hiding in the shadows of the corridors of Leinster House who lack the courage to publicly identify themselves and say openly what they have to say.</P>

      <P>Having said that, I acknowledge this particular minor storm in a tea cup is of no significance when compared with the fate of those whose lives have been blighted by the failures documented in the Finlay report.  It is the victims of this scandal and the future safety of blood products which should be of central concern in this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>Even in the past few days the situation within the BTSB has continued to be problematic.  There is no doubt that Mr. Liam Dunbar has a difficult task and that, at one and the same time, he must try to regain confidence in the blood supply service while dealing with continuing administrative errors.  It is critical for the people who need blood, for their families, and for all of us that there should be confidence in the blood service. Mr. Dunbar faces such a difficult task because it is the very agency which he is trying to change that lies at the root of this major scandal.  He is right to call for confidence, but he needs to realise just how difficult it is for people to hear his message now that there is such a well documented explanation of the series of the blunders in the board.  Full trust has to be earned.  Confidence has to be earned, and it will only be fully earned when every woman and man who has had contact with the Blood Transfusion Service Board has the fullest information about their own case and when the wider community has full belief that the systems in place are as efficient and as well managed as any blood transfusion service can be, given the state of our current technical and medical knowledge.</P>
      <P>As the Ministers, Deputies Michael Noonan and Brendan Howlin, said, the tribunal of inquiry laid blame fairly and squarely.  Its report is an analytic document showing clearly where the mistakes were made.  There were mistakes made by all Administrations, by people from all political parties.  Of that there is no doubt, but party-political wrangling is not the way forward.  The way forward is a critical analysis of and reflection on the issues that remain to be addressed and of the underlying sets of beliefs that allowed this scandal to develop in the way it did.</P>
      <P>Positive Action's current demands should be met in full.  They include the right of appeal to the High Court with anonymity guaranteed.  That is a fundamental right which should be built in. The question of aggravated damages should be dealt with on an individual basis, and each claimant should have the right to have the circumstances of his or her claim fully examined.  As Ms Jane O'Brien of Positive Action says clearly, each woman is taking the report and linking it to her individual circumstances and wants to see justice. It is also clear that a second tribunal will have to be set up to deal with the huge number of cases. Otherwise the waiting times will be intolerable.  I hope that ongoing consultation with Positive Action will ensure that all these concerns are met in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Government motion on the tribunal of inquiry into the board.  It is of the utmost importance that the Government accepts the recommendations of the report and fully understands the anguish and distress experienced by victims and their families.  I wholeheartedly welcome the changes announced by the Minister, and I believe the benefits of any adjustment to the <Col N="1457" /> compensation scheme should be made available to all victims, including those whose cases have already been determined by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>There is widespread public outrage at the matters disclosed in the report.  We have to reflect on the mistakes made and on how different judgments and decisions might have been made. The series of appalling events affecting over 1,500 women is almost overwhelming.  It is the worst health scandal ever.  The limitation of activity and capacity that has affected so many parts of victims' lives, personal relationships, work and financial security is enormous.  Inexcusable mistakes have been made.  The betrayal of public trust is shocking.  The trust of the public was betrayed. Trust of some was betrayed when they were given infected products.  The trust of all donors, the conscientious men and women who gave blood for the service, was betrayed.  It will take time to get their confidence back.</P>
    <P>To ignore explicit warnings in the way we now know they were ignored within the BTSB raises enormous questions about professional arrogance and about standards in public services.  To have hoped that a potentially lethal problem would go away is breathtaking.  The basic principle of respect for clients was absent.  Had patient X been told that her blood was being used, her own good judgment on the issue would have led her to realise the dangers involved, but did any of us ever imagine that the professionals in charge would not have made that decision first?  General practitioners made reports of patients who had adverse reactions and they were ignored.  There is something truly appalling in the disregard of women and women's health throughout this saga. An arrogance towards and a marginalising of women is constantly evident.  Positive Action was always concerned with the truth, and in the report it has got the truth at last.  In accepting the report and its recommendations the Government is acknowledging the wrong that has been done.  I do not intend to go into detail on the recommendations which include the relocation of the board, inspections and the setting up of a blood consumer council, but these are all very important Changes.  These recommendations are welcome but many of them are procedures that should have been put in place before this scandal ever had a chance to begin.</P>
    <P>It is also shocking that so many years after the scandal broke what would seem to be basic procedures would, in some instances, need to be spelled out still.  When I first spoke on this issue in the Dáil in 1994 I said that this was the most major and serious health problem ever to face Irish women.  I said that the women should be empowered to get the treatment, information and response from the health service that they needed.  I said that a policy of containment was not needed but a policy of empowerment with the support of the health services.  I said that the women who had been diagnosed needed information regarding the consequences of a positive test.  They needed information on the focus of the <Col N="1458" /> illness and possible treatment alternatives.  They needed information on the implications for their families and partners, on the effects of this diagnosis on their VHI and their life insurance.</P>
    <P>I called for funding to give these women accurate information and support and I called for a comprehensive health package.  I said that there was a controlled anger in the women at that stage and that it had to be addressed comprehensively. I said that the women deserved the fullest backup from the State, top-class medical care and attention to treatment.  I said I was not being alarmist but that it was critical, that this was a major health crisis that called for a major response.  I said what was being said by ordinary women watching how the State was handling mistakes by the State, which had health and life-threatening consequences.  We did not learn fast enough and change our structures quickly enough to deal with this crisis.  At a public meeting in Liberty Hall two and a half years ago a consultant visiting from England asked the women present who had had a liver biopsy to put up their hands, and he told me afterwards that he had never seen so many women gathered in one room who had had a liver biopsy.  The scale of the crisis has been apparent.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the political system all of us in this House must apologise.  The BTSB must apologise and act to ensure it means that apology. Everybody affected by the hepatitis C scandal deserves and must be treated with exceptional sensitivity and a new approach to consumers of health services must be adopted as a result of this debacle.  The professional approach to consumers of health services must be based on civility and respect, partnership and information.  An important beginning is setting up the Blood Service Consumers' Council.  By keeping this council informed of relevant matters concerning blood and blood products and giving it the right to make representations to the BTSB and the Irish Medicines Board, a more advanced approach to consumers of health services seems to be emerging. The people entrusted with the role of managing those services must listen and be able to respond.</P>
    <P>Women's experience of the health service has not been good despite the technical quality of the service.  I welcome the consultation that has been carried out extensively under the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in the past year in developing a new model of involvement for women in the health services.  That is extremely important.  Positive Action has been professional, competent and clear.  Its demands were always appropriate, as the outcome of the tribunal and the Government's decision today affirms.  I hope the women's new health strategy will begin to meet women's health needs in a comprehensive way. The Government's approach to liability in cases such as this needs to be examined.  We cannot just go along with the assumptions made in this regard in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> The Government's commitment to partnership comes under intense scrutiny in the light of this report.  If listening to consumers of the health service had been a principle in practice, Positive Action would not have had to overcome such huge obstacles before it got the hepatitis C scandal on the agenda.  Positive Action was too often seen as another marginal interest group making an unnecessary fuss, and the need for a model of consumers' rights which incorporates the process of consultation, empowerment and partnership. must be a priority.</P>
    <P>The Government and those who work on our behalf administering State services must learn that consumers are people who know what they need, are more than capable of understanding and whose demands and concerns must be taken seriously.  A sophisticated concept and understanding of consumer rights and partnership must be developed.  I hope it will be possible for trust, which has been undermined by this scandal, to be rebuilt in the health service and that the experience of the women affected, as well as the men and children, in dealing with the health service in the future will be a positive one.</P>
    <P>Positive Action has been reasonable and informed and, in justice, its request should be accepted.  I hope everyone in this House will acknowledge that without the determination of Positive Action we might never have known the truth, a possibility that is worthy of reflection.</P>

      <P>Many words have been spoken about hepatitis C since this major health scandal first came into the public domain two years ago. Because of the complexity of the issues, the full extent of what was involved and the trauma inflicted on so many victims only came to public attention with the death of Brigid McCole.  The complexity of the issues involved &mdash; hepatitis C and anti-D, terms not in common usage &mdash; allowed Governments to get off the hook at a very early date.  I join others in paying tribute in particular to Positive Action.  If it had not been for its commitment and dedication and particularly the leadership shown by Jane O'Brien, its chairperson, the truth would never have come out.  If it had not been for the great personal courage of Brigid McCole and her family, we would never have had a tribunal of inquiry.  It is a tragedy that it took three years, with determination, courage and hard work on the part of a dedicated group of women, for the truth to emerge.</P>

    <P>I very much regret there will not be an opportunity at the end of this debate to put questions because I would like to put several questions to the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin.  For example, I would like to ask them one simple <Col N="1460" /> question: why did it take so long for the truth to be revealed?  Why did the Minister, Deputy Howlin, not inform the House or apparently his Cabinet colleagues, or Positive Action that there was a certain source of contamination in 1991?  Why, for example, were some of the women who were contaminated by anti-D products in 1991 put through the most appalling questioning by the Blood Transfusion Service Board?  Why was one woman asked in the presence of her husband about her sexual behaviour and whether she was a drug abuser?  Any State that treats people who are victims as a result of its incompetence, as a result of a gross dereliction of duty, in such a way should be ashamed of itself.</P>
    <P>Who decided on the strategy in the late Brigid McCole's case?  Why was she denied an opportunity to protect her anonymity &mdash; there is nothing more private than health matters?  Why was she forced to come into the open?  Why was she told that the statute of limitations would be used against her?  As I said before, it is a fraudsters' charter, when the State has no other moral defence it simply has a case thrown out on a technicality. Why was Brigid McCole told that if she pursued her case for aggravated damages the State would take her through the courts for all the costs?  History will judge the State very cruelly as a result of the way it treated that woman.  No Irish citizen has ever been treated so shamefully by the Government.  Why was part 5 of the McCole family letter not the subject of the terms of reference of the tribunal?  Who in the Blood Transfusion Service Board constantly denied liability?</P>
    <P>There are many questions one wishes to ask, but the tribunal did not include in its terms of reference political accountability or political responsibility.  Politicians must be made accountable in Dáil Éireann.  In a democracy three things are very important: a vigilant Opposition, good Government and a free press.  If any of those pillars is eroded or damaged, democracy suffers.  It is the job of the Opposition to make Governments accountable.  The manner in which victims have been treated since 1994 when we became aware of the scandal is as great a tragedy as the scandal itself, and that may seem extraordinary.  If anybody had told me that Ministers, the Department of Health and the blood supply service knew the truth but had gone out of their way to conceal it, tried to fob off the women, hounded them into a compensation tribunal where the truth could never come out and told them that if they went to the tribunal they could not then go to the courts, I would have been astonished, yet that is what happened.</P>
    <P>It is a pity more emotional feeling was not shown for the victims of this dreadful scandal.  It seems every effort was made to spare the State finance.  I am very committed to fiscal rectitude, but when a grave injustice has been done to so many citizens in that they have contracted a life threatening illness through the fault of the State that is supposed to protect them, regardless of the <Col N="1461" /> financial implications, those people must be recognised and told the truth and should not require lawyers or tribunals to get the truth from the Government.</P>
    <P>The priority all along has been the protection of political careers, saving money for the State and protecting the reputation of the Department of Health and the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  I paid tribute earlier to Jane O'Brien, Brigid McCole and the many other women who are the sad victims of this dreadful scandal, but I also pay tribute to some of the journalists, such as Emily O'Reilly, Fintan O'Toole and Feargal Bowers who did not take no for an answer and continued to pursue the story.  They played their part in ensuring that the truth came out.  They explained the scandal in as simple a way as possible to the public who have become very confused.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any of us can fully understand the misery hepatitis C has caused to its victims. Two weeks ago a man talked to me at length over the telephone about what his wife and children are going through and, even though I could sympathise with him, I found it difficult to understand what he was really going through.  The State is responsible for this scandal and, as politicians, we must ensure it does not happen again.  Words are not sufficient, we must take action.</P>
    <P>A file on the matter has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, but we should not hold our breath.  Three years ago the file on the beef tribunal was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions after the publication of the report, but nothing happened as a result.  When it comes to systematic abuse of our laws and institutional incompetence, we move at such a snail's pace that it would appear to some that certain sections of our society are free from the full rigours of the law.  We should remind ourselves that the golden handshakes to officials of the Blood Transfusion Service Board exceeded the awards received by many of the women concerned.  What does that say about our society?  More taxpayers' money was used to give golden handshakes for incompetence and gross dereliction of duty than was used to compensate people who have been given a life threatening illness by the State.</P>
    <P>I have been accused of scaremongering because of my lack of confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  The column inches devoted to my comments would give the impression that it was me and not the Blood Transfusion Service Board that was responsible for infecting 1,600 mothers with hepatitis C.  It is pointless shooting the messenger in this society. The public's lack of confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board predates my comments. The same was said when questions were asked about the BSE crisis and the Urlingford drugs debacle.  Any time the State is in difficulty the first port of call is to accuse those who raise questions of being irresponsible and damaging the national interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" /> It is time we stopped burying our heads in the sand.  We should confront the issues and tell the truth.  The public lacks confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board because of the revelations, the wrongdoings and the delay in disclosing the extent of the scandal and accepting culpability. The public also lacks confidence in the board because of the strategy adopted, particularly in regard to the late Brigid McCole and Mary Quinlan from Carlow.  People lack confidence in the board because it has not been proactive. Even though it knows who received the contaminated supplies, those people have not been contacted.  Screening has been done only when people have come forward on a voluntary basis as a result of advertising campaigns.  Why does the State not write to all the people who received the contaminated blood product?  Why are we afraid to do that?  Surely the least people deserve is to be told they received contaminated blood and given the opportunity of screening.  When a nurse was infected with the HIV virus last summer and the Blood Transfusion Service Board wrote to more than 40 hospitals to check the batches, why did it not tell them to check for HIV?  What did the board do when only 16 hospitals had responded after three months?  Why was a clerical error, which could have had fatal consequences, made when evidence was being given to this tribunal?  Those are some of the reasons the public has lost confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  We can either ignore the public's message or do something about it.</P>
    <P>Some people have argued that to voice concerns about the public's lack of confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board damages confidence in the blood supply.  That is not the case. Apart from anything a public figure might say, public confidence has been seriously eroded. There is much evidence to suggest that even the procedures for gamma globulin testing for people travelling abroad have been refused in many cases.  The letters &ldquo;BTSB&rdquo; no longer command public confidence.  We need a new agency to manage and develop blood products.  Moving the Blood Transfusion Service Board to St. James's Hospital is not sufficient.  We need a new institution to go with the new location, the central value of which must be therapeutic patient care. The central characteristic of the new institution must be full personal and professional accountability at every level.  Never again can anyone working with blood products expect to avoid personal responsibility for serious personal errors, not to mention breaches of duty.</P>
    <P>Some people may hope that public confidence will slowly return by physically moving the Blood Transfusion Service Board and closing the file on this succession of scandals.  The surest way to guarantee restoration of public confidence is to rebuild a new blood products institute at St. James's Hospital with the values and standards to which I referred.  That is not to say people employed in the Blood Transfusion Service <Col N="1463" /> Board would not have a future role to play, but everyone who wishes to join the replacement agency must accept from the outset that they are in a new era in which new standards apply and they must also accept new levels of personal responsibility and accountability.  This will be an era in which the interests of blood recipients and donors will come first and in which the pursuit of excellence will be the watchword of the blood supply.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about openness, transparency and accountability.  We need a blood supply service that is open, transparent, accountable and proactive.  Those who are concerned about their careers or smarting from words that I have expressed should think first about the victims and the great injustice done to them.  The one thing we can do for all victims is to make a fresh start and put in place a new blood transfusion service board.  It is pointless holding inquiries and sending files to the Director of Public Prosecutions if the finger is not pointed and nobody pays the price.  The standards that apply in the private sector, where incompetent people are made accountable, must also apply in a system of public administration. What is the point in being a competent, diligent and careful public servant if those who are incompetent and are responsible for inflicting a life threatening disease on 1,600 people get golden handshakes which in some cases exceed the amounts paid to the victims?</P>
    <P>For many years we have buried our heads in the sand and held inquiries that have let us off the hook.  Governments that have been in office since 1977 must take responsibility for this matter, but we must learn that problems do not go away.  It is a pity it took the death of Brigid of McCole and the determination of a small group of victims to get at the truth in this case.  This should not happen again.  1 I hope we will learn a lesson from this and put in place a blood supply in which the public will have confidence and to which the highest possible standards apply.</P>

      <P>Everyone speaking in this debate will be conscious of the damage done to the unfortunate women and men who have contracted hepatitis C. Most speakers are conscious of the physical disability and mental anguish these victims, who have been dishonoured through a State mechanism, have had to endure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Theresa Ahearn spoke about the political elements of the debate.  If she had studied Deputy Cowen's speech she would have noted our concerns for the victims which were ably and respectfully incorporated in a thorough and incisive speech.  Of course we must examine the background to this tragedy and ensure the truth wins out.  We must also ensure that aggravated damages are paid, but we must always be conscious that the State can never compensate fully the victims and their families.  One must be also conscious of the determination of the victims to get at the truth.  We must also be mindful of the circumstances <Col N="1464" /> which brought out hepatitis C, the actions and attitudes of those in charge of the BTSB and the lack of control mechanisms put in place by the political masters who were ultimately responsible.  Of necessity, the terms of office of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and the present Minister must come under close scrutiny so that we may determine how each handled their portfolio in relation to the matter. Even a cursory examination shows that the attitude of both was that if they ignored the problem, it would go away.  The frustration of the Minister that he eventually had to set up the tribunal was evident in the choice of words used when he insulted the victims who took the unprecedented step of showing their outrage by walking out of the Public Gallery.</P>
    <P>The decision to agree aggravated damages was wrung out of the Government because of pressure from Positive Action and Fianna Fáil.  A continuous stream of pressure was necessary to move this tragedy to its logical conclusion.  Is it surprising that the victims of hepatitis C are angry, bewildered and distraught by the insipidness and insensitivity of the Minister who had to be dragged bellowing to a situation where the truth could at last be extracted?  The openness, transparency and accountability so espoused by this Government when it came to power have been left shattered in keeping with the frosted glass upon which it was based.</P>
    <P>The tribunal uncovered something which we suspected all along, that the triumvirate of the BTSB, the Department of Health and the Minister would club together to cover each others' tracks, stymie investigation and embellish the outpourings of the Minister by his public relations gurus with no concern, remorse or basic humanity for the unfortunate people who suffered as a result of the most serious maladministration the State has experienced.  The victims of hepatitis C must cynically view the exclusion of question No. 5 of the McCole family letter.  It is extraordinary that political accountability should be omitted from the terms of reference of the tribunal report. It raises many questions and leaves many unanswered.  Does it of necessity fall to the Opposition to highlight inadequacies, mismanagement and political posturing for what it is and to look for accountability and redress?</P>
    <P>The Ministers involved claimed they were exonerated.  The Minister went on a flight of fancy when he received the report.  He did not start by apologising for paying off the blood transfusion management, who were condemned by Justice Finlay, or by promising aggravated damages to the victims.  He began by claiming exoneration.  In that one petty move, the Minister replayed the essence of his performance on this issue since he took over the portfolio &mdash; he took care of himself first.  He did not even ensure the victims were each given a copy of the report before he came out with his self-serving pronouncements. This was the Minister's chance to prove himself bigger and better than the paranoia <Col N="1465" /> reflected in his performance to date, but he rejected that chance.</P>
    <P>The second interesting thing about the claim of exoneration is that for a man of subtle intellect, the Minister missed a crucial point.  To be found not guilty is not the same as being found innocent, a point which the Scots have long recognised. They have in their courts the verdict of not proven, which means that although something cannot be proven, a person will not commit the same offence again and they will always be surrounded by a shroud of doubt.  At best, this warrants a verdict of not proven.</P>
    <P>Justice Finlay did not praise the Minister for paying more than £0.5 million of taxpayers' money to the people who led the Blood Transfusion Service Board at the time it poisoned patients.  It is difficult to imagine what he thought he was achieving by such a pay-out.  He could not have believed it would dampen down the problem and prevent it going to court.  If he had grasped the enormity of the outrage, he would not have taken that action.  If he did not want faith in the Blood Transfusion Service Board to diminish, then he bluntly has no judgment.  We have already established the Minister does not have compassion, and he is not alone in that regard.</P>

      <P>The hepatitis C affair is the worst medical scandal to hit the State since its foundation. A saga of unbelievable incompetence left about 1,600 infected with what could be described as a medical time bomb.  Sadly, one victim, Mrs. McCole, has died.  As we debate this issue, we should remember her courage and persistence in seeking the truth.</P>
      <P>A safe blood supply is a fundamental public health requisite.  That safety has been undermined by bureaucratic bungling of monumental proportions.  The task facing us is not to cast stones but to ensure the mistakes made are not repeated.  That was the intention behind the tribunal and Justice Finlay's recommendations will go a long way to ensure future generations will not experience the trauma suffered by those infected with hepatitis C and their families.  No tribunal will undo the grave damage which has been done or will restore the health of those infected or the peace of mind of those who fear they may have been infected.  No tribunal can repair the pain which has been inflicted on the families of victims or potential victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal told us what happened and the picture painted was one of unbelievable incompetence, sloppiness and bungling.  It is right that we should be outraged by what happened in the past.  We must, however, ensure that outrage results in constructive proposals which will <Col N="1466" /> guarantee the health of those dependent on the blood supply in the future.  The victims of this debacle or patients dependent on blood or blood products will not be helped by the type of opportunistic scaremongering we witnessed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  Despite the fundamental differences in our policies, I have always had the height of respect for Deputy Harney as a woman of stead-fast principle who, like us all, brought the courage of her convictions to bear on the political process. However, in the run-up to a general election, politicians often utter statements which are ill-considered. I have rarely heard a senior politician make as irresponsible a statement as that which we heard on radio last week.</P>
    <P>I am appalled that hospital patients and their families listening to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; could have had their confidence in the blood supply undermined to the point that they may have been reluctant to accept a clinically indicated transfusion. I am a member of the Eastern Health Board and the board of the children's hospital in Crumlin and St. James's Hospital where hundreds of people are dependent for their lives on a supply of blood.  I was astounded and shocked at the words of Deputy Harney, a senior politician.</P>
    <P>The great fear and anxiety patients have before operations and transfusions would have been compounded by these irresponsible statements which are cheap, pre-election scandalmongering. The hepatitis scandal mainly affects women. Speaking in the Seanad last week, Senator Mary Henry reminded us that, during the 1960s, the major cause of death among women of child bearing age was haemorrhage.  Due to the availability of blood transfusions, this was ended.  Deputy Harney should consider the possible effects of her remarks on another generation of women.</P>
    <P>I urge all those currently faced with a decision whether to accept a blood transfusion to heed only the advice of their doctors who are the people qualified to give clinical advice.  I am especially concerned at the revelations in a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that patients are increasingly reluctant to accept blood products, even for life saving procedures, because of the hepatitis C scandal.  Patients' concerns are understandable, especially in view of the recent tragic and scandalous report of a woman infected with hepatitis C being approached to give blood.  I condemn the Blood Transfusion Service Board whose structures allowed this to happen.  I accept its word that the procedures in place would have isolated that blood and that, were it given, it would not have made its way into the bloodstream of another human being.  However, it has compounded the fears of many people dependent on a blood supply and transfusions in hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the standards of the BTSB must be radically improved.  That was made clear when it emerged that the woman infected with hepatitis C was contacted by the board to give blood.  The recommendations in former Chief Justice Finlay's report and the measures outlined last week by the Minister for <Col N="1467" /> Health, Deputy Noonan, will improve standards and increase public confidence in the BTSB. Closing it down, as suggested by Deputy Harney, would make a bad situation worse.  The blood supply could not be administered in the absence of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Its suspension or closure would result in a health catastrophe equal to, if not surpassing, the hepatitis C scandal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's decision to reappraise and amend the compensation scheme to provide for the possibility of victims receiving additional special damages.  It is their human entitlement and right.  I also welcome the decision to place the compensation scheme on a statutory basis.  This reflects the gravity of the issue and it is a logical response to the appalling catalogue of errors resulting in the unimaginable suffering of those infected with hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>Despite the criticisms levelled at him, the Minister for Health has handled this complex and delicate issue with sensitivity, care and a full appreciation of the intensely personal issues involved.  Last week he called on all Members of this House to choose their words carefully not to undermine the voluntary blood supply, one of our great national assets.  I hope Members heed that in the interests of us all because any one of us may find ourselves dependent on the blood supply.</P>
    <P>I congratulate and praise the dedication and humanity of those men and women who voluntarily make themselves available to donate their blood to the Blood Transfusion Service Board. They are deserving of applause, medals and certificates. They should be given a higher ranking as heroes of society because of their voluntary contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join others in welcoming this report.  Former Chief Justice Mr. Finlay and his team have rendered an important public service in conducting the hearings and producing the report in such a short time.  The report is cogent, to the point and easily understood.  Mr. Justice Finlay does not hesitate to reach conclusions, or to make judgments and recommendations.  In common with many others, I had begun to doubt the value of tribunals of inquiry.  Mr. Justice Finlay has restored my faith.</P>
      <P>The most important task given to the tribunal was to ascertain what exactly happened and to allocate responsibility.  The response comes on different levels.  First and most importantly, the report sets out clearly the events of 1976 and 1977 from which the conclusion is clear: the primary cause of infection of anti-D with hepatitis C was the use of plasma from patient X.  The report goes on to state that the use of this plasma was clearly in breach of the BTSB's standards for donor selection.  It further states that the use of plasma from donor X without her knowledge was unethical and has since undoubtedly caused her considerable trauma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> Mr. Justice Finlay proceeds to assess the responsibility of various named individuals and does not hesitate to point the finger.  I do not want to discuss the issue of individual responsibility in any detail as I know the Government has asked the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate the matter.  I hope the DPP will expedite his consideration of that matter as it is of considerable public interest.</P>
    <P>Had matters stopped there, things would have been bad enough, but they did not.  The BTSB stubbornly refused to face up to the fact that something had gone badly wrong.  It decided to ignore the fact, of which it was aware, that a form of non-A, non-B hepatitis virus existed which was capable of being transmitted by transfusion and for the presence of which no proper tests had yet been developed.  The response to the letter from Middlesex Hospital in December 1991 can only be construed as &ldquo;a blank refusal either to contemplate the consequences of what had been done in 1977 and a vague hope that, by ignoring the problem, it would go away&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These conclusions are appalling.  It shows a public body and some of its officials largely preoccupied with their reputations and that of the board.  This is understandable up to a point.  Individuals involved with the board in the 1970s were justifiably proud that an independent transfusion service had been established.  The bottom line is that the preoccupation with the standing and reputation was at least partly responsible for the pain and trauma which hundreds of women and men continue to suffer today.</P>
    <P>The BTSB is a public service operated by and on behalf of the State.  To that extent, the State is responsible for the injury caused to the people infected.  It is also responsible in that the National Drugs Advisory Board, the body which was supposed to supervise the actions of the BTSB, was hopelessly underfunded and scarcely even attempted to discharge its duty.  It is extraordinary that not even one on-site inspection was carried out during the course of the relevant period. The State is responsible for this failure and we must not shirk that responsibility, which is primarily to deal with the consequences of what happened.</P>
    <P>The first and most important thing to do is to ensure infected people have access to the care and counselling they now need or which they may need in the future. The report points out that there were hiccups in the initial phase of doing this but my understanding is that the system of care is now working well.  Our next response is to put in place a system of compensation fair to all concerned.  I strongly argued in favour of a compensation tribunal at the time it was contemplated.  I spoke in the debate in this House when the terms of reference were being considered.  I still strongly believe a compensation tribunal has many merits to recommend it.</P>
    <P>The last thing we should do, even now, is oblige any man or woman to go through the cost and <Col N="1469" /> trauma of an adversarial court hearing to establish the exact reason they were infected.  Some of this difficulty could be avoided if the State were to accept liability in all cases.  In the light of the tribunal report surely careful consideration must be given to doing that.  If we simplify the court hearings by taking out any dispute in relation to liability, there are still significant benefits in going the tribunal route.  On the face of it, the tribunal should be less demanding in reducing the duplication which would otherwise occur, there should be more consistency in awards than might otherwise be the case and the cost to all concerned would be reduced dramatically.  However, for the tribunal to succeed it is vital that the applicants should be confident they will be dealt with in a fashion no less favourable than they would expect in a court of law.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the Minister's announcement in relation to aggravated or exemplary damages. The case for amending the terms of reference in that regard is overwhelming and there is no need for me to repeat it.  Any fair reading of Mr. Justice Finlay's report leads straight to the conclusion that the State, through the BTSB, is responsible for an appalling wrong.  The case for exemplary damages literally leaps off the pages.</P>
    <P>The third element of the State's responsibility is to ensure that nothing of this kind ever happens again.  The judge sets out his recommendations very clearly in Chapter 16 of the report.  He recommends that the Dublin facilities of the board be very substantially upgraded and I join with others in welcoming the fact that this is under way.  The judge recommends a process of inspections and reports and the Minister has agreed this will be done.  The report recommends procedures for the reporting of abnormal patient reactions and for the recall of unsafe or suspect products.  The Minister has told the House that all of this is under way.  The tribunal recommends a Blood Service Consumers' Council should be set up.  That is a fine idea, in principle, and I am happy the Government has accepted the recommendation.</P>
    <P>All of these moves are needed to restore public confidence in the blood supply.  It is easy for those of us who are in good health to forget there are very many who rely on regular transfusions of blood.  There are also many more who rely on transfusions in cases of emergency.  It is absolutely critical that all of those people should be reassured that the blood products in use in this State are of the highest possible quality.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Finlay is effusive in congratulating the new management of the board put in place in 1994 and 1995.  It is important that the public should know and appreciate that the reorganisation and restructuring of the BTSB is under way. There is a particular onus on public representatives not to do or say anything which would or could inhibit the provision of the best possible patient care.  I do not intend to labour this point because it has been well made.  I will say only that I listened, with concern, to Mr. Dunbar on the <Col N="1470" /> radio this morning when he suggested a patient or patients may have refused blood in circumstances where it was needed.  To say the least, it would be a gross dereliction of duty if any Member through his or her utterances were to contribute to that situation.</P>
    <P>I listened with some care last week to all of Deputy Cowen's speech on this matter.  It was well rehearsed, well researched and detailed.  He clearly followed the proceedings of the tribunal with some care, for which I commend him, but there the plaudits must stop because he hardly dwelt at all the major issues in his lengthy contribution. He concentrated instead on those minor issues where he thought he could gain some element of party political advantage.  It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Deputy Cowen and his party read the report not with the interests of the infected people but with those of Fianna Fáil in mind.  They were and are sadly attempting to exploit the plight of the unfortunate victims of this scandal for their narrow party political advantage.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Finlay subjected the actions of the Ministers, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, to a measure of scrutiny which is almost unprecedented. In Chapter 13 of the report alone the tribunal considers the adequacy of the Department's response and, directly or indirectly, the response of the Ministers concerned.  The response is considered under seven separate headings and 18 conclusions are reached.  The Ministers are considered to have reacted appropriately in 15 of these 18 conclusions.  That includes all of the more important ones, which I do not have time to go into in detail.</P>
    <P>Some mistakes were made and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has accepted that.  Deputy Cowen in his contribution last week reserved much of his bile for Deputy Howlin.  He is more than capable of speaking for himself but I will share with Deputy Cowen and other Members something to which they would not have had previous access.  I attended the parliamentary Labour Party meeting which I believe took place on the same day as the Cabinet meeting to which Deputy Cowen referred last week and my clear recollection is that the complete focus of the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, that day was on dealing with and catering for the infected women.  He was anxious to bring matters into the public arena as soon as possible so that the measure of the problem could be ascertained. He moved immediately to put a screening and information process in place.  He was actively criticised by some professionals because he moved too quickly.  It may well be that Deputy Howlin did not focus immediately on the business of allocating blame.  He focused immediately on the provision of proper care for the women concerned.</P>
    <P>This has been an appalling episode in the history of our health services.  Those responsible must be held accountable.  Those affected must be cared for and compensated fairly, but above <Col N="1471" /> all we all have an overwhelming duty to ensure nothing like it happens again.</P>

      <P>I join other Members in thanking Mr. Justice Finlay for his work, the manner in which he dealt with the presentations and witnesses before him and his speedy delivery of the report to this House.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the comments made by the chief executive of the Blood Transfusion Service Board who claimed that the debate about the blood supply has gone beyond reasonable debate. He made accusations of scaremongering against politicians, but Fianna Fáil has not participated in any scaremongering.  Any comment we made was reasonable and balanced.  As pointed out today by the president of the Irish Medical Organisation, many matters need to be exposed if there is to be change, and I would have thought everybody would agree with that.  Fianna Fáil is interested in ensuring we have the best blood supply system possible and that we will not cower from that task, which is a matter of major public importance.</P>
      <P>The chief executive of the BTSB suggested in his radio interview this morning that there was something underhand in the way the woman infected by anti-D who was asked to give blood had sought an apology.  I felt her credentials and motivations were being questioned in a most unfair and unjust way.  He also said a spin had been put on the story, as if the facts were not extraordinary in their own right.  The BTSB may not have liked what it heard which was all backed up by facts.  Shooting the messenger will not solve the problem.</P>
      <P>We were informed last week that following the revelation of this episode involving a hepatitis C infected woman being called to give blood, the Minister called the chairman and chief executive of the BTSB to his office, gave them a dressing down and an error was acknowledged.  Based on this morning's interview it does not appear the Minister gave any significant dressing down to the people involved.  Even though the BTSB apologised last week, this week it appears to have returned to a defensive stance and it continues to display an arrogance in the face of bungling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also appears to be warning patients who come forward that if they complain they may be criticised in public.  Did the Minister authorise that course of action?  Is he in charge?  It was only last Friday, more than three months after the incident, that the woman received a written apology from the BTSB, despite requests from her and her family.  It must also be noted that, despite everything, the BTSB still does not ask donors if they have received anti-D.  The Minister for Health has claimed on many occasions that the new management he has put in place in the blood bank has reformed it.  However, it is clear from this episode and the one at the end of last year in relation to HIV infection of blood that the BTSB has a long way to go before it is a model of public <Col N="1472" /> accountability, which is what we all want to see it achieve.</P>
    <P>The judicial inquiry into hepatitis C concluded that the actions of the Minister for Health in reforming the BTSB were quite adequate. However, there must be doubts about those conclusions and the adequacy of the political response to reforming the BTSB.  It is ironic that those charged with maintaining confidence in the blood supply are most likely to damage that confidence. Through the media, they have attacked politicians for prolonging the story.  Once again the Minister for Health has failed to take charge of the situation and left the BTSB to its own devices.  Surveys have indicated public concern about the BTSB.  The Government has failed to allay that concern.  The lack of confidence is not helped by the Government saying that the recipients of potentially infected blood or blood products were not a priority.  These people have a right to know what happened and to seek treatment if necessary.  They should be told the truth. The Minister should insist that the BTSB contacts these people as a priority.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and the victims have called for a national study of the true incidence of hepatitis C.  Will the Minister address this matter this evening?  The BTSB should come clean on how many people received infected blood or blood products but have not presented for testing.  Last week's <i>Sunday Business Post</i> alleged that the BTSB knew that some people who have only now presented for testing had received suspect anti-D batches.  The BTSB is also aware of at least 335 deceased people who received these products.  No relatives have been notified, even though the BTSB has known the names since 1985.  The Minister should instruct the BTSB to inform the relatives.</P>
    <P>One of the key elements of our amendment is our condemnation of the Government's failure to allow an investigation into who authorised the despicable legal strategy in the McCole case.  It was a disgrace that the Government did not allow the tribunal to address this issue.  That strategy was designed to intimidate victims under the false guise of the BTSB having a defence.  The BTSB did not have any defence for its actions.  However, the Minister for Health allowed the board to block the victims' legal actions even though he knew it had no defence since the 1976 file was discovered.  There are aggravated damages claims today because of this outrageous bully boy defence directed by the Minister for Health.  Justice demands that these damages be paid.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has argued that the 1976 file clearly showed that the BTSB had no defence.  That file is crucial because it showed the BTSB's state of mind when the anti-D was made.  The Minister claimed that the expert group supported his insistence on fighting the McCole case and his refusal to establish a judicial inquiry.  Both these assertions were shattered by the Finlay findings.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday the Minister engaged in selective quoting from the tribunal report in a vain <Col N="1473" /> attempt to justify his behaviour.  He had the nerve to suggest that we withdraw our charges about the significance of the 1976 file.  We will not do so because there is nothing to withdraw.  The tribunal report supports this view.  The Minister should stop attempting to apply a veneer of vindication to himself.</P>
    <P>The investigation into who authorised the McCole legal strategy remains a matter of public policy.  The Minister has resisted all attempts to allow the tribunal consider this matter.  He even refused to admit question No. 5 as put by the McCole family.  The Minister has been aided and abetted in this cover up by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  They have a duty to protect the public interest and ensure that citizens are treated fairly and honestly.  They promised higher standards in Government so that no one would ever mislead this House.  This has not happened.  Both men stood idly by while the Cabinet was briefed by the Minister on how Mrs. McCole would be dragged to every possible legal extreme.</P>
    <P>There were times when the Minister was under pressure in this House because it was beginning to be known that the BTSB had no defence.  However, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste directly participated in ensuring that the cover up would not be exposed. They shored up the Minister for Health and Deputy Howlin even though their behaviour was unjustifiable. The hepatitis C affair is a clear example of where the people should have come before politics. This has not happened under the rainbow Government. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have not been held accountable.  They have been invisible during this affair.  The only leadership shown has been by the groups representing the victims.  Despite the lip-service paid by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste they are culpable in this cover up.  They turned a blind eye to the way the scandal was handled.  They put politics above the rights of the victims to the truth and justice. They ignored the calls of victims and allowed terrible things to be done in the name of the State. Their indifference in a scandal of this magnitude displays a moral bankruptcy and a contempt for the public and the victims.  The spoils of office have made them cavalier and arrogant.</P>
    <P>Had the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste not supported the Minister for Health's handling of the affair, how could scandalous tactics have been used to browbeat the late Mrs. McCole?   How else could there have been approval for the stone-walling, the barracking and the blocking?  How could the Government shore up the BTSB in the full knowledge that it had no defence?  For that reason alone the Minister should explain the matter in this House.</P>
    <P>As a former colleague of Deputy Howlin, I was outraged when the facts emerged about his mishandling of the controversy.  He was wrong to withhold information from his Cabinet colleagues, the Dáil, the public and the medical profession. Deputy Cowen has outlined his failings. Deputy Howlin failed to follow through on any <Col N="1474" /> of the seven goals he set himself at the beginning of the controversy.  The most telling revelation was that he never called in anyone from the BTSB and kept the controversy at arm's length. It is impossible to imagine a Minister failing to call in the BTSB to see what it was doing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin's worst hour was when Positive Action told him of its concern regarding the questions being asked by the BTSB about the private lives of women who received anti-D after 1977. The Minister knew of the 1991 infection yet he never informed the women and allowed the outrageous BTSB behaviour to continue.  He has tried to defend himself from Fianna Fáil's criticisms. In the process he has misrepresented our arguments.  He has claimed that we called for people to be sacked from the outset.  We never said this.  We said that when he knew that the BTSB was facing down his authority and not co-operating with the expert group he should have done more than he did.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin has tried to defend his role in the recall of the anti-D products.  He accused Deputy Cowen of many things.  On &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;, Deputy Burton tried to write this off as sour grapes over 1994.  What spin doctor dreamed that up?  It will not carry much weight. When the Labour Party tries to write this off as a grudge from 1994 this indicates how out of touch it is on this issue.  It is trying to minimise a very tragic matter.  As Opposition we are highlighting this tragedy and seeking to get answers.</P>
    <P>Ninety-five per cent of what offended Deputy Howlin were things which were said at the tribunal. The Minister's subjective view is that he did his best.  However, his best is not good enough.  Those of us who thought he was a hands-on Minister have been shocked by his incompetence on this issue.  It was low of him to use Positive Action as a defence.  The chairperson of Positive Action pointed out on Radio Ireland that the victims do not think that the Ministers did a good job.  Deputy Howlin's defence shows that he is grasping at straws.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health is now promising to help hepatitis C victims.  No doubt his object is to keep the focus off his failures in this scandal. However, he has a poor track record in delivering on promises made to the victims.  For example, the promises in the programme of this rainbow coalition Government to pay fair compensation may only now be fulfilled, two years on.  Another victim remembers the Minister's promise to consult them before publishing the health care Bill; that never occurred.  Victims also remember that he announced the <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal while negotiating with them about it.  He needs to give legislative effect to his promises and introduce a Bill as a matter of urgency and, if that is not possible, he should follow the example of his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, who has just published the heads of a Bill on broadcasting.  When replying he should clearly state whether that is his intention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> There has been much confusion about what the Minister proposes.  He must spell out whether the State is admitting liability or whether that is to apply only to the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  He must also state whether the compensation tribunal will have exactly the same powers as the High Court in relation to awards and whether a right of appeal will exist.</P>
    <P>Victims in every category, including anti-D and transfusions, must be treated fairly by the Government, as must the families of those already deceased, such as the late Mrs. McCole. It would be an outrage if she, who exposed all of these matters, did not have her case reappraised in the light of the findings of the compensation tribunal she was instrumental in establishing.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity to listen to some comments of the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, on the RTE &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme today.  Would the current Minister clarify the position, since those comments appeared to be totally at odds with the line he has been adopting to date?  In the course of that interview the former Minister for Health disclosed, in relation to the conduct of the State in the handling of the Brigid McCole case, that: &ldquo;The legal strategy was decided by Government and that is a question that needs to be answered.&rdquo;  When asked whether he had taken that decision he said, &ldquo;Governments made a decision as to how all these things happen.&rdquo;  He further admitted: &ldquo;I now see that that did not suit certainly the McCole family and that they were right to go the course that they went.&rdquo;  That explains why the fifth question in the McCole letter was excluded from the terms of reference of the hepatitis C tribunal. That is the first public admission by a Minister that collectively this Government was responsible for the strategy adopted in the McCole case, a damning indictment of all its members from the Taoiseach and Tánaiste down.</P>

      <P>I might also refer the Deputy to a question that I contend rightfully arises relating to comments contained on page 51 of the report of that tribunal when it examined the events of 1991 during a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition Government.  If the wisdom of hindsight must be attributed to Members on the Government side of the House, then it is also in order to ask what was done during the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats' watch.  The report specifically states:</P>
      <P>Unfortunately evidence adduced before the tribunal indicates the problem that a number of persons may have been affected with hepatitis C from the transfusion of blood or blood products between February and October 1991 who might have avoided infection had screening been introduced at the earlier date.</P>
      <P>How does Deputy Cowen account for that comment? In terms of his recollection of the Fianna Fáil-Labour coalition Government in the period 1994 to 1995, if he has so many questions to ask now, it is quite legitimate to ask him and his party leader where their questions were when members of that Government.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On Thursday last, I commented on the recent incident in the BTSB involving the contacting of a victim infected with hepatitis C with a view to obtaining a blood donation.  I have been asked to explain the circumstances surrounding this matter.  Mistakes such as these, even when there is no risk to the blood supply, are unacceptable.  The background to the incident is as follows.  The BTSB has a statutory obligation to ensure an adequate supply of blood.  When there is a shortage of blood or a particular blood group is needed urgently a comprehensive list of all donors containing relevant information, including their donor status, is produced for the donor organising department.  This list is used by the clerical staff to make telephone contact with the donors in the local clinic area to boost the clinic attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a list was produced by the BTSB for the evening of 3 December for the local clinic because the BTSB needed to increase donations. The clerical officer who telephoned this particular donor, who had been diagnosed positive for <Col N="1480" /> hepatitis C, did not note the deferral information on the list.  During the telephone call the error was identified and the clerical officer apologised to the donor at that time.</P>
    <P>The following day, 4 December, the donor's husband telephoned the Blood Transfusion Services Board and complained about the matter.  It was investigated by one of the doctors on the staff and the donor's husband was telephoned on 6 December.  An explanation of the error and an apology was given.  The donor's husband telephoned again on 11 March 1997 requesting a written explanation of the incident.  The BTSB responded on 21 March expressing regret to the family.</P>
    <P>The staff in the BTSB have been urged yet again to be extra vigilant when checking lists so that all relevant donor history is noted.  As a result of a meeting I had with the chairman and chief executive officer of the BTSB that organisation is implementing necessary changes to its computer system.</P>
    <P>I have been asked also about the donor selection procedures operating in the BTSB and whether these procedures ensure public safety and confidence.  As a result of this incident last week, the public is understandably concerned about the safety of the blood supply.  There was never any risk to the safety of the blood supply arising from this incident.</P>
    <P>Approximately 170,000 blood donations are collected annually by the BTSB.  There are well defined steps taken by the BTSB in relation to donor selection and donor eligibility.  Blood donations are on a voluntary, non-remunerated basis.  Only donors in good health are accepted and the decision as to whether a potential donor is suitable rests with the medical officer who evaluates the donor on the day of donation.  The donor questionnaire must be satisfactorily completed after the donor has read and fully understood the specific notice concerning transmissible diseases.  Where there is doubt about the suitability of a donor the donation is not taken.</P>
    <P>The first step in ensuring that all those receiving blood are not put at risk at any time is to take maximum care when selecting persons who donate their blood voluntarily.  The guidelines for donor selection by BTSB medical officers are revised regularly in line with the UK National Blood Authority guidelines for medical assessment of donors and the Council of Europe Guide for the Preparation, Use and Quality Assurance of Blood Components Blood Collection.  These guidelines have a dual objective to protect the recipient from any ill effect through transmission of disease by blood transfusion and to protect the volunteer donor from any harm to his or her health.  In applying these guidelines the BTSB is among the most stringent transfusion centres in the world, a fact that is attested by all objective commentators internationally.  The standard of testing which the BTSB applies to the testing of blood donations is fully in line with best practice in Europe.  The average annual deferral rate of <Col N="1481" /> donors attending clinics is between 13 per cent and 15 per cent, which is among the highest in the world.</P>
    <P>I turn to an issue that has arisen since the publication of the report of tribunal of inquiry.  It relates to 74 recipients of 1977 anti-D who had an episode of jaundice.  Appendix G of the tribunal of inquiry report states:</P>
    <P>We the BTSB are thus aware of 74 recipients of 1977 anti-D who had an episode of jaundice at that time which is most likely to be related to exposure to Hepatitis C.  As these persons do not show any reaction on laboratory tests for Hepatitis C an epidemiology study is planned to investigate transient infection which has subsequently cleared.</P>
    <P>The BTSB has confirmed that the 74 women referred to in the tribunal's report have all been contacted and tested and all are antibody negative. An epidemiology study in relation to transient hepatitis C infection will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The issue has been raised as to whether a national epidemiology study to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C in the population should be undertaken.  This would be a major logistical and organisational undertaking.  Given that the majority of the population have no known risk factor for hepatitis C infection, that there is no constructive intervention such as a vaccine which can be used and that there exists no satisfactory cure for hepatitis C, the ultimate value of the information produced by a national survey would be limited.  Apart also from those who contracted hepatitis C through infected blood or blood products and apart from other groups with wellknown risk factors, I am reliably informed there is no evidence to suggest the prevalence of hepatitis C is any higher than in other comparable countries.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals at present to conduct a national survey to establish the prevalence of hepatitis C in the population as a whole.  It is an issue which requires further examination and I propose to seek the advice of the statutory Consultative Council on Hepatitis C which I established last November and which recently held its first meeting.  The remit of the consultative council includes the monitoring of matters relating to research and it has a broad spectrum of expertise, including nominees of the four main representative groups, namely, Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, the Irish Haemophilia Society and the Irish Kidney Association.</P>
    <P>Concern has also been expressed that all recipients of potentially infected blood and blood products should be traced in the targeted lookback programmes.  The BTSB has a substantial duty of care to trace each and every one of these recipients. In order to fully comply with this duty, an experienced and professional team has been put in place with a view to achieving the objective of the targeted lookback programme &mdash; TLP.  This dedicated team comprises medical, nursing, clerical and administrative support.  The TLP's <i>modus</i><Col N="1482" /><i>operandi</i> is to identify the infected issues and trace the issues to a named recipient.  The person is then located and arrangements for testing are made in as sensitive a manner as possible.  Extensive efforts are being made to trace all the issues of blood and to locate the named recipients.</P>
    <P>Specific concerns have been expressed as to why the BTSB has not contacted persons who it knows received potentially infected blood or blood products.  In a number of cases the BTSB has only the name of the recipient and no other information.  In other cases the name and date of birth are known and the person's GP has been contacted but no current address is available. Every conceivable effort is being made to identify and then locate such recipients.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that a number of persons who received anti-D in 1977 have not come forward for screening.  In 1977 and 1978 a total of 17,214 vials of anti-D, made from plasma which included that of patient X, were issued.  Of these, 4,062 vials of anti-D were issued from the 12 batches which were prepared after patient X became jaundiced.  The Finlay report has summarised various efforts in relation to the targeted tracing of those persons who have received these infected vials at the request of the tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>At the request of the tribunal of inquiry the medical consultants at the BTSB prepared a document which is summarised in Chapter 5 of the tribunal's report and reproduced in full at Appendix G.  In relation to recipients of infected 1977 anti-D, the document states: &ldquo;We have previously directly invited known recipients of infected 1977 Anti-D for hepatitis screening. However, a number of recipients have not yet presented for testing and we the BTSB are therefore following this up with individual recipients and hospitals with specific attention to recipients of PCR positive batches&rdquo;.  All recipients of potentially infected blood products are, as far as possible, being traced under the targeted lookback programme.</P>
    <P>Finally, to ensure that no one escapes the net and to ensure that all recipients of blood transfusions and blood products are given the option of being tested for hepatitis C, I announced the national optional testing programme on 12 September 1995.  Testing is free of charge to all and has been regularly advertised in the national media.</P>
    <P>On 17 October last, during my reply to the debate in this House on the motion establishing the tribunal of inquiry, I responded to Deputies who asked during the debate if I could assess the impact of the tribunal of inquiry on the compensation tribunal.  I stated: &ldquo;The inquiry tribunal will establish the facts and there will be no immediate consequences for the compensation tribunal that I can forsee at present.  However, if there are consequences, I will be prepared to amend the terms of reference.&rdquo;  The Finlay tribunal established the facts in a clear and deliberate fashion.  As a result, the acknowledge which we <Col N="1483" /> now have of events at the BTSB and of those responsible has been altered considerably.</P>
    <P>In the light of the commitment which I gave on 17 October, I am changing the terms of reference of the compensation tribunal and I am putting the tribunal on a statutory base.  This will take some time and, in the meantime, I am determined the operation of the compensation tribunal will not be disrupted or delayed.  It will continue to operate as normal under the direction of Mr. Justice Egan and all of those who have already applied for a hearing will get that hearing as arranged.  I will seek to ensure that everyone who has either gone through the tribunal, who is currently before the tribunal or who will be before the tribunal in the near future will benefit retrospectively from any changes which may be made.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks last Thursday night, I referred to other elements of the tribunal. However, one issue of fundamental importance has arisen and I wish to confirm that it is my intention that the terms of the compensation scheme should provide for an appeal to the High Court on the amount of awards made by the compensation tribunal.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On Thursday last, I also indicated the Government's intention to reappraise and amend the terms of reference of the compensation scheme following consultation <Col N="1484" /> with the representative groups and the chairman of the compensation tribunal.  I am hopeful this consultation process can commence with the groups at an early date.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputies will appreciate the extent of the efforts which the Government is taking to implement the recommendations of the report of the tribunal of inquiry and to set up the compensation tribunal on a statutory basis.  More than possibly anyone else in this House I am acutely conscious of the deep sense of anger and betrayal felt by the victims and their families on foot of this unprecedented scandal in our health system. I also fully appreciate the genuine concerns of Deputies regarding both the extent and the impact of the tragedy on the lives of the victims and their families.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to indulge in political recrimination. This would be a futile exercise.  Not only would it not contribute one whit to the alleviation of the suffering of the victims, but it would also be a luxury no party in this House could afford. My main concern is to ensure that, where possible, I can contain the damage which this appalling human tragedy has visited upon innocent victims. This I hope to do as a result of the House endorsing the terms of the motion which will now be put before it.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have heard in the past few hours that the Government has accepted the Bill on which we have been working for some time.  This is a victory for workers in the retail sector.  It is an opportune time for the main Opposition party, Fianna Fáil, to table legislation.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, the opening of retail stores on Sundays was largely confined to newsagents, small grocery and neighbourhood shops.  Since the early 1980s high street retailers, suburban centres and small independent supermarkets have commenced trading on Sundays.  During the 1980s and the early 1990s supermarket chains such as Dunnes Stores and Quinnsworth confined their Sunday trading to the period immediately prior to Christmas.  Department stores such as Arnotts and Switzers also confined their Sunday openings to the Christmas season.  In the summer of 1994, however, Dunnes Stores and Marks and Spencers opened their doors to the public on Sundays in Grafton Street, Dublin.  Others have followed suit.  Given the current trend, it is conceivable that Sunday will become a normal shopping day in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent ruling by the European Court on the UK challenge to the EU working time directive means that Sunday is no different from any <Col N="1487" /> other day.  In recent years the increasing commercialisation of Sunday and changing lifestyles have placed shop workers under pressure to work on Sunday which, traditionally, has been a day of rest and a family day.  A worrying free-for-all has developed, as highlighted by the recent decision of some retail stores to open on Easter Sunday. This development met with an understandable negative reaction from a large section of the public, small retail outlets and the trade union movement representing retail shop workers.  The continuance of the present trend is detrimental to the creation of well paid, secure jobs, both full-time and part-time, in the retail sector.  The increasing casualisation of the trade in the absence of legislation will consign a further generation of workers, usually young females, to the uncertainty of temporary and casual employment for the foreseeable future.  The broader issue of controlling and regulating Sunday trading is complex. My party has been examining how best to deal with it taking account of what is happening in other EU member states.</P>
    <P>This is a labour protection measure.  When it becomes law, protection will be provided for those employed in retail outlets which trade on Sundays so that Sunday working will be optional as opposed to obligatory for those employees. The Bill will go some way towards bringing the level of protection here for Sunday working into line with the level among our European partners and provide some regulation of employment on what, traditionally, has been workers' one day off each week.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, despite promises made by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, that until tonight both he and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, have been sitting on their hands, reneging on commitments to provide the necessary legal protection for employees in this sector.  The Government, which claims to be concerned about workers' rights, has turned its back on thousands of workers in this sector who under existing legislation are obliged to work on Sundays and, only under extreme pressure from Fianna Fáil, has finally agreed to this necessary legislative proposal.</P>
    <P>The legislation is drafted with a view to balancing the rights of employees while at the same time allowing employers sufficient flexibility to run their businesses efficiently and without undue constraint.  It will not apply to a relative of the proprietor or owner of a shop and allows the Minister to make regulations under any section to ensure small corner shops, etc., are not affected.  It is the united view of all the Members of the House that the corner shop should be protected. This point has been made time and again, especially by those who represent rural constituencies.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are: a shop worker will not be obliged to work on a Sunday without his or her consent; an employee who works on a Sunday <Col N="1488" /> will be paid no less than time and a half; for those employees who opt to work on a Sunday the employer shall give the employee notice of the work schedule not less than four days before any Sunday &mdash; this aspect of the Bill deals with the unacceptable use of zero hour contracts where workers are given little or no notice in relation to working time.  I am delighted that MANDATE and RGDATA representing small shop owners have welcomed the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sunday working in the retail sector is synonymous with casualisation in the workplace.  The Bill gives us an opportunity, as legislators, to put down a marker in relation to the dangerous drift towards casualisation and part-time employment. MANDATE, which represents the vast majority of retail workers, rejected the new partnership agreement because it failed to deliver on the issues of low pay and increased casualisation. With 12 per cent of workers employed in the retail sector, a lowering of standards in that sector will in the long term lead to a lowering of standards for all workers.</P>
    <P>The majority of shop workers are female and many of them are married.  Figures show that at the end of 1994 45 per cent of those employed in shops worked on a part-time basis.  This compares with the European average of 26 per cent.  The Bill will provide a considerable degree of protection for these workers in terms of Sunday work. Given the massive invasion of multinational retailers, it is clear that such legislation must be enacted as a matter of urgency.  I hope the Government follows through on this legislation and ensures that this is done.</P>
    <P>In its submission to the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy on the working time legislation, MANDATE stated:</P>
    <P>When Sean Lemass was introducing the 1938 Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act in the Dáil he stated that the whole purpose of employment legislation was to institute machinery in relation to occupations where exploitation of labour might occur, for the regulation of working conditions which would prevent abuses and which would enable the State to exercise a general supervision over those conditions of employment.  Sixty years later in the retail trade in Ireland Lemass's sentiments are just as relevant for Irish shop workers.</P>
    <P>From the days of Seán Lemass to the present day Fianna Fáil has continually provided for workers' protective legislation where it is required.  This Bill, which has the support of MANDATE, is in line with my party's historical solidarity with workers since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The public utterances of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on this issue are worthy of comment. Having been centrally involved in the complex debate on Sunday trading over the past two years, I share the Minister of State's view that Dunnes Stores and other major retail outlets should not trade on Easter Sunday.  However, I am deeply suspicious and sceptical about his inap- <Col N="1489" /> propriate and ill-informed intervention in this debate.  If he was genuinely concerned about workers' rights in the context of Sunday work why did he not intervene to ensure that a Fianna Fáil amendment to the Organisation of Working Time Bill was given serious consideration?  This amendment would have allowed shop workers in the retail sector to opt out of Sunday work.  I do not recall any comment by the Minister of State at the time of that debate.</P>
    <P>Last week on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; the Minister of State conceded that the multifaceted issue of Sunday trading was complex.  He further suggested in his usual cavalier manner that I should apply my ample brain to devising a solution to this problem.  This off-the-top-of-the-head comment again shows his ignorance of the true position. This Bill was published some months ago and has been on the Order Paper since then.  The reality is that when it comes to matters ample the Minister of State wins the rosette for the most ample neck in this House.  He consistently presents himself as a person of superior knowledge who has all the answers, yet like a cowboy he came galloping into town last week Clint Eastwood style and rode roughshod over the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, who has responsibility for labour affairs and who had told me for two years that nothing could be done to protect Sunday workers in the retail sector.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, agrees with me that something can be done about this issue and I have given him the means to resolve this ongoing problem.</P>
    <P>This hijacking of the labour affairs portfolio is another opportunistic solo run by the Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology, Deputy Rabbitte.  Does it not demonstrate that at Cabinet the high chair Minister now sits on the throne?  Public pronouncements about Government cohesion, responsibility and partnership belie the true position, particularly in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, where annoyance, jealousy, jostling and confusion reign.  During the short period they have left in office the three Ministers involved should get their act together and give a measured and coherent response to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 excludes hotels and pubs from the provisions of the legislation and defines &ldquo;shops&rdquo;, &ldquo;relative&rdquo;, &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, etc.  Section 3 excludes a relative of the proprietor or owner of a shop from the provisions of the Bill.  This provision and section 11 have been included in the Bill to allow for the exclusion of genuine family businesses, corner shops, etc.  Section 4 contains the main provisions of the Bill and provides that an employee shall not be obliged to work on a Sunday without his or her consent.  The Bill clearly allows employees to consent to work on Sundays if they so choose.  The provision of this voluntary opt-out from Sunday work which is available to <Col N="1490" /> retail workers in the United Kingdom will meet one of the key demands of the MANDATE trade union which represents the vast majority of workers in this sector.  This is a basic demand and should be provided for in legislation without delay.</P>
    <P>Section 5 prohibits discrimination against an employee who does not wish to work on Sunday for religious, family or other reasons.  Section 6 recognises Sunday work as exceptional and different and provides for pay for those who engage in such work of not less than time and a half.  It also provides for corresponding holiday entitlements.  Under section 7 an employer will give an employee notice of the option to work not less than four days before any one Sunday. There will also be obligations on the employee to give an employer not less than three days notice of his non-availability to work the following Sunday; otherwise the employer may assume consent is being freely given.  The Bill is very carefully balanced in terms of the obligations on employers and employees.</P>
    <P>Section 9 allows aggrieved employees to apply to the rights commissioner if they believe their rights under the legislation have been breached. The rights commissioner may order the offending employer to pay the employee a maximum of ten weeks salary.  Under section 11 the Minister may make regulations in relation to any section of the Bill or may, by order, suspend the operation of the Bill in particular circumstances.  This section gives protection to small shop outlets and retailers within a defined geographical area, taking account of seasonal variations.</P>
    <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to introduce this Private Members' Bill on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is an honour to be given the opportunity to do this.  I sincerely thank all the people who helped me in carrying out research and drafting the Bill.  If a Bill is to be accepted by the Government it must be framed in the correct way, and this legislation has been drafted after careful and lengthy consultation with all those involved in the retail sector.  The Bill may not please everyone but I know it pleases those who represent the workers in this sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill was published last November and launched at a press conference attended by my party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and deputy party leader, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, our spokesperson on enterprise and employment.  It is specifically focused on protecting workers in the retail sector.  As legislators, we have a duty to bring to an end the exploitation of those workers who are forced to work on Sundays.  The Bill addresses this specific issue.</P>
    <P>Each member state has its own way of dealing with this issue.  Many European countries do not allow Sunday trading in the retail sector for historic, cultural or religious reasons.  There were many debates on this controversial issue in the UK and legislation was passed in 1994.  The British Government first published a White Paper on <Col N="1491" /> this issue and perhaps we should consider such an approach in dealing with the broader issue of Sunday trading.  The Fianna Fáil Party is carrying out a detailed study of the broader issue of Sunday trading.  I have not only consulted my colleagues in the parliamentary party and the various sectors on this issue but have also asked members of local authorities to submit their views to me.  It is important that we get it right when dealing with an issue like this and it is most important to consult with local authorities which have experience of what is happening on the ground and know what is right for their communities.</P>
    <P>Many Government Deputies share my concern about the need to grant employees the choice in law to opt out of Sunday work.  For that reason I welcome the Government's support for the Bill. We are showing solidarity with the thousands of workers who have rightly sought action from their legislators, not promises.  Workers have won tonight.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear from the Minister that the Government would be accepting the Bill, but there were a few issues I wanted to raise tonight and I was pleased to have the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing time with me.  This is the second week in a row I have followed one of my party's spokespersons introducing a Bill which the Government has rightly seen fit to accept.  It raises an interesting question as to who is actually delivering the raft of legislation in this House.  In the ten years I have been a Member, excluding a short period in the other Chamber, I have never seen so much Private Members' legislation accepted by Government.  It is a testament to the fact that Fianna Fáil has its finger on the pulse of the nation rather than the Government.  If the Government had done what it should have been doing over the past number of months, in a wide range of areas, it would not be accepting well drafted, up to the minute legislation from Fianna Fáil.  One can at least say the Government had the foresight to realise the difficulties it faces would be further compounded if it did not accept this legislation.</P>
      <P>In observing the contributions of Fianna Fáil Members who have introduced legislation in the House over the past number of months, from my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, in the justice area to Deputy Kitt on labour affairs, it is clear that both the Labour Party and Democratic Left are best at raising public concern and making us aware of the problems the country is facing, but they fall short when it comes to drafting legislation to address those problems.  Any neutral observer of the proceedings of this House could easily come to such a conclusion.</P>

    <P>A question that has puzzled me for a long time concerns the advisers, programme managers and various other relations.  What are they doing at <Col N="1492" /> the behest of the State and the taxpayer to deliver in this area?  We have an excellent Civil Service. When Fianna Fáil was in Government, it drafted its programme managers from the Civil Service in all but one case, and rightly so, but this Government changed that position.  We were led to believe there was no expertise available in regard to the openness and transparency the Government intended to deliver.  What are all those people in the pay of the State supposed to be doing?  I meet them every day walking up and down the corridors of Leinster House talking on their mobile phones.</P>
    <P>Over the past months Fianna Fáil dedicated itself to producing legislation on relevant issues which the Government had to accept because it had no other choice.  The days of prevarication were over and it had to face up to its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>This excellent Bill introduced by Deputy Kitt did not come out of thin air.  Fianna Fáil does not draft legislation on the hoof.  This legislation has been ready for some months and has been enunciated by my colleague, Deputy Kitt, on a number of occasions, as has other legislation produced by my party.  Fianna Fáil is not interested in producing rabbits out of the hat, a hallmark of this Government.  Legislation produced by my party is so well drafted and thought out that the Government must accept it.</P>
    <P>As my colleague rightly pointed out, the question of Sunday trading is a difficult one.  The Government decided to accept my colleague's Bill because of the spectre of Easter Sunday trading, which no Deputy in this House or the vast majority of people would like to see introduced. I subscribe to that view.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to the debate on the Organisation of Working Time Bill, during which issues before us this evening were addressed by Fianna Fáil Deputies.  They were laughed at by members of the Government who could not find their way to introduce legislation dealing with the right of any worker to opt out of working on Sunday if they so wished.  We were told, in effect, that it could not be done because there were constitutional implications.  Whenever there is a difficulty with legislation, the question of the Constitution is raised and we cannot move forward.  We now know that is not the case because the Government has seen the light of day in regard to this Bill.  It realises that hiding behind the Constitution is unacceptable to workers, trade unions such as MANDATE and RGDATA, which represents a large number of small, family run businesses.</P>
    <P>This Bill will enshrine in law, for the first time, the right of workers to refuse to work on Sundays, something that is long overdue, and I commend my colleague for introducing it.  As a family man, like most Members of this House, I am aware of the difficulty in balancing legitimate commercial operations required on an ongoing basis to sustain a large or small business with the needs of our society, which is under enormous <Col N="1493" /> pressure, particularly in terms of the family.  I suspect we will be back in this House in less than a decade reviewing the question of Sunday trading.</P>
    <P>Denmark has often been mentioned in this House in terms of what it has and has not achieved.  As Members will be aware, I have a reasonable knowledge of that country as my wife is Danish.  I was interested to discover on my last visit to Denmark that the shops close at 1 p.m. on Saturdays.  I am not referring to major cities like Copenhagen, but rural Denmark has decided that the family must come first and that there is more to life than the merry-go-round of excess commercialism.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the party that was supposed to be economically and financially so far ahead of everybody else is beginning to review many of the decisions taken in the 1980s, not least the raft of &ldquo;politically correct&rdquo; social legislation. In the context of this evening's debate it is worth nothing that the trend is beginning to change.  I welcome that, if we as a society are to live normal lives instead of stressed out lives.  People in every walk of life are subject to stress, whether they work on the factory floor or in an executive office.  There is pressure to deliver, to pay the mortgage, to buy the latest labels for the children, be they Manchester United shirts or Nike shoes. We are all under pressure.  I know it as a father of four young children.  The time is coming when we will have to review where Ireland as a society wants to go in the future.</P>
    <P>Part-time working is a legitimate and worthwhile entry to employment.  It is positive and it allows working mothers particularly access to employment which it would not be possible for them to undertake on a full-time basis.  In this context I will not say that part-time working is a bad thing.  However, there is a danger that has been evident in many of the multiples where young women constitute the greatest numbers in employment, that the move to part-time working will be seen by many employers as a way to negate their responsibilities to employees, to cut corners, cut costs, worsen conditions and cut pensions. Part-time working is a valuable contribution, but we need to ensure that employers do not use it as a way of negating their responsibilities. There is evidence of such a trend having begun to gain momentum in some quarters.  A distinction must be made between the use and abuse of part-time workers.  Many businesses can benefit greatly and create a greater pool of employment from employing workers on a part-time basis.  The benefits cut both ways.  There are benefits to employees and to employers.</P>
    <P>My colleague's Bill provides that if workers give their consent to work on a Sunday they must be rewarded, and we are talking about a minimum of time and a half for Sunday working.  This brings me to something that is dear to my heart. Within the taxation system we must take every opportunity to tilt the balance in favour of people who want to work by ensuring that business is competitive.  The draconian tax on labour is a testament <Col N="1494" /> to the present Government.  After three budgets, the contribution of Labour, Democratic Left and Fine Gael to the PAYE sector was one paltry penny.</P>

      <P>From 1987 to 1984 when things were at their most difficult, Fianna Fáil-led Governments reduced taxation from 58 per cent to 48 per cent at the high rate and from 35 per cent to 28 per cent at the low rate.  Fianna Fáil has always had the capacity to recognise work and worth and the right of people to employment. The expectation of work is the legitimate right of any young man or woman and there is a range of options which include part-time working, job sharing and full-time working.  The taxation system should not penalise an enterprise culture because it is not something which belongs to a business but is in the heart of an individual; it is what we give our children coming out of school into employment or into third level education, and if we kill that spirit society will be the loser. It is vital to facilitate all types of access to employment not just in theory but in reality.</P>
      <P>I admire the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, for coming into the House this evening.  One would have thought, given the recent performance of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, that Deputy Fitzgerald had left the country.  The Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology acted as Minister for Labour Affairs and Minister for Finance. Deputy Richard Bruton must be wondering who the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is. The public perception is that the man wearing all the hats, the Jack of all trades, Deputy Rabbitte, is the man who seems able to comment on everything that goes on in society.  However, he has been irresponsible, because what he put on the record in the past few weeks has now proved to be incorrect.  Deputy Rabbitte challenged my colleague, Deputy Kitt, to put up or shut up.  We saw and raised him, as would any good poker player. Where are Deputy Rabbitte and the other Democratic Left Deputies this evening?  Not one of them is here.  The great party that loves to tell the workers how well it looks after them has not the interest to come into the House and listen to what is going on.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, for having the gumption to come in after the treatment she has been given by her colleague in Government.  It was a shameful performance that brought no credit on him or on the Government, but it will come as no surprise to any Member of this House or to anybody observing what has been going on in the House over the past few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend my colleague warmly for introducing this Bill.  I acknowledge the Government's reluctant acceptance.  As the legislation being introduced in the House is now almost exclusively introduced by Fianna Fáil, it follows that Fianna Fáil must be returned to Government.  We are <Col N="1495" /> ready and are demonstrating that we can deliver when push comes to shove.</P>

In the seven glorious years to which Deputy Cullen referred, no legislation was introduced in this area.</P>

      <P>Since the Labour Party came to office in 1993 we created 150,000 additional jobs and cut PRSI for the low paid, unlike the cuts for the high paid, with which Deputy Cullen is more concerned.  That has contributed to job creation and shows our commitment to the low paid.  This Administration has cut taxes on labour.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the issue of Sunday working.  Deputy Kitt, in this Bill, is seeking to improve the conditions of employment of shop workers by giving them a right to say no to Sunday working.  I fully support meaningful measures to improve the conditions of shop workers and combat exploitative practices.  In my legislation I sought to address this matter in a practical way.  There is, however, a measure of opportunism in the timing of the Bill as many of its features have already been dealt with in a comprehensive manner in the Government's Organisation of Working Time Bill which is due for Report Stage in the next two weeks.  Notwithstanding this, I will not oppose the reference of this Bill to Committee.  Many of the provisions of the Bill might be examined more closely and might benefit from further consultations with the social partners and other interested groups, but these issues can be dealt with during the next Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some confusion about the issues involved in the opening hours of shops and the rights of employees.  It has always been my intention &mdash; I have been working on this matter for the past two years &mdash; as Minister with responsibility for labour affairs to ensure that the <Col N="1496" /> rights of employees are protected.  A number of provisions in the Organisation of Working Time Bill provide for that and I will outline them in a moment.  The advice I received from the Attorney General clearly indicates it would not be possible to ban Sunday opening for large shops and not others.  Any such rules would be unsafe from a constitutional point of view as it would be open to challenge on the grounds of invidious discrimination, irrationality or lack of proportionality. Closing shops on Sunday is, therefore, not being considered in the context of addressing the Sunday working issue.  I have explained that at length at many meetings with MANDATE and others involved in the trade union movement.  Although that is often a very simple demand, constitutionally it is not acceptable.  There is no demand to close corner shops and small shops in rural areas where people can buy a loaf of bread or a few cooking apples on a Sunday when they have unexpected visitors.  We cannot provide that shops such as Dunnes Stores should close on Sundays without also closing those outlets which provide a much needed and valued service.</P>
    <P>The Organisation of Working Time Bill provides that every employee is entitled to one day off per week, which must be Sunday unless Sunday working is specified in the employee's contract of employment.  What this means is that employees whose contracts of employment do not specify Sunday working are already protected in the Organisation of Working Time Bill.  Unless a contract of employment states that a person must work on Sunday, Sunday working is voluntary under the terms of this Bill.  If the employee is required to work on Sunday he or she must be rewarded with a Sunday premium unless Sunday working is otherwise built into the pay structure, such as a shift premium for those working on a rotating shift.</P>
    <P>It is important to underscore the background to the approach adopted in the Organisation of Working Time Bill to the issue of Sunday working which has always been a feature in a broad range of sectors.  Public utilities, health care &mdash; our hospitals could not operate without Sunday working &mdash; media and entertainment, hotels and catering, security, and agriculture are just some of the sectors where employment includes Sunday working.  In the leisure sector, Sunday is the busiest day.  In recent years the numbers working on Sundays and the sectors in which Sunday working is now commonplace have been increasing.  Continuous processing and round-the-clock production are now typical features of our major industries where cost and competitive pressures require the optimum use of all resources.  This has resulted in increased operating time for many industries.  The number of employees working on Sundays in manufacturing and in commerce generally has increased by 20 per cent in the past three years alone.  A total of 36 per cent of the labour force now work on sundays.</P>
    <P>Sunday working is already recognised as premium <Col N="1497" /> time in many employments and is typically rewarded by an overtime rate or shift premium. Rates of pay for Sunday work within the joint labour committee system provide for premium pay for Sunday work in many sectors.  The Labour Court in its adjudication on the issue of Sunday working has also recommended premium rates for Sunday working in recent cases.  Section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Bill is designed to put this accepted feature of rewarding work done on Sunday at a premium rate on a statutory footing for all employees, whether covered by a unionised agreement or a joint labour committee, or where there is no protection. This applies to all employees, not simply those who are rostered for occasional Sunday working.  If a person works only on Sundays, under the Organisation of Working Time Bill they are entitled to a Sunday premium.</P>
    <P>Sunday working is clearly a growing trend and figures suggest that seven day opening and seven day production will be a feature of many more employments.  With this legislation we now have the proper statutory protection for employees who work on Sunday and legislation which responds comprehensively to trends and working patterns.  Ensuring that Sunday work is rewarded at the appropriate level for all employees responds fairly to the issue of Sunday working.</P>
    <P>The Organisation of Working Time Bill is modelled closely on the European Working Time Directive, but the European Court found that the Sunday provisions of the directive were not compatible with health and safety measures.  Notwithstanding that, considerable provisions have been agreed for Sunday working, which is voluntary for people whose contract of employment does not specify they must work on Sundays &mdash; that covers the vast majority of existing shop workers. Sunday working must be rewarded at a premium rate or by premium time off if it is not already rewarded through a bonus system.  I am addressing fairly the issue of Sunday working.  Under the Bill Sunday must be included in the 35 hours weekly rest to which employees are entitled unless otherwise provided for in the contract of employment.  These are very fair provisions which go well beyond the terms of the European directive.</P>
    <P>Before responding in detail to Deputy Kitt's Bill, I want to outline to the House some of the significant changes which I recently introduced to improve the position of employees in general. Those will be of particular benefit to shop workers, many of whom are part-time, young workers, women workers and unorganised.  In addition to those represented by unions such as MANDATE and SIPTU, we must remember that thousands of workers in one and two person establishments are not in a union and do not have any bargaining power.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment has a duty to set minimum conditions for those people.</P>
    <P>Those who stand to benefit significantly under <Col N="1498" /> the Government's Bill are part time, casual and atypical workers, some of whom had no rights up to now to, for example, holiday pay.  In addition to the obligatory day of rest per week and the Sunday premium, the major improvements in workers' rights include holiday pay for all, including part-time workers, reduced qualifying period for public holiday pay, advance information on hours of work, regulation of zero hour contracts, which will effectively end those contracts, easier enforcement, tougher penalties on employers who break the law and a one-stop-shop where people can go with claims &mdash; at present holiday claims have to go to the District Court.  We are providing that people can take a bundle of claims to the rights commissioner, the Labour Court or, if taken with Employment Appeals Tribunal claims, to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is a popular argument that the adaptation to change necessary to survive and compete in an increasingly globalised economy requires a willingness on all sides to accept the importance of increased working time flexibility.  However, we cannot demand flexibility unless workers are properly protected.  Flexibility must be matched by a floor of rights for workers to safeguard against exploitation or capricious behaviour by employers.  We cannot legislate against bad management but we can, I hope, ensure a basic floor of rights for workers through working time legislation and demonstrate to employers that respecting employees' basic rights makes good business sense.  A badly treated employee will not be as productive as an employee who is treated with dignity.</P>
    <P>Report Stage of the Organisation of Working Time Bill will be taken shortly in the Dáil.  The Bill was drafted following one of the most comprehensive consultative processes ever undertaken in the preparation of legislation.  We met approximately 110 groups and I have held five or six meetings with MANDATE, the most recent of which lasted two and a half hours.  That legislation brings our laws on worker protection into the 21st century.  It places concerns for workers' safety and health at the heart of how work is organised.  It gives workers a legal right to minimum daily and weekly rest and adequate rest breaks during the working day.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation in this area dates from the 1930s.  The Organisation of Working Time Bill repeals seven Bills dealing with the conditions of employment applicable to various sectors and replaces them with generally applicable legislation. The practical effect of this is that employers and employees can now refer to one consolidated Act instead of seven Acts or 137 pages of primary legislation and hundreds of regulations, orders and licences.  It is time the protections available to employees reflected the modern world of work.  The overall effect of that legislation will greatly simplify and clarify the rights and obligations of employers and workers. It is an updated and modern approach to conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> Some of the features of the new legislation will provide significantly greater protection for shop workers and other employees.  The new legislation will repeal and improve existing legislation on holidays.  While the most obvious improvement in holiday entitlements for employees is the increase from 15 to 20 days per annum, an equally significant improvement for part-time and contract workers and those on very short contracts is the <i>pro rata</i> increase in their holiday entitlements. The increase in holiday entitlements will begin this year.</P>
    <P>The participation rate for part-time employees has increased from 8.5 per cent to 13.8 per cent in the past eight years.  With such increasing numbers of part-time and atypical workers in the economy, particularly in the retail sector, it is very important that their work earns an entitlement to holidays.  Under the new working time legislation, all employees, regardless of hours worked, will be entitled to holidays.  The principle that holidays are earned against time worked will apply to everyone.  Up to now a threshold of eight hours per week applied.  For example, people packing bags in a shop for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon were not entitled to holidays. Under the Organisation of Working Time Bill people will be entitled to holidays on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, irrespective of the hours they work. Another significant feature of the new holiday arrangements will be that an employer must take family circumstances into account in the timing of annual leave.  This is the first time we have reconciled family and working life in law.</P>
    <P>In a further recognition of the way in which the workplace has changed since the legislation on holidays was enacted in 1973, the qualifying period for a public holiday is reduced to 40 hours in the five weeks immediately preceding the public holiday.  This provision will bring public holiday entitlements to a range of part-time and atypical workers who would not have benefited prior to this because of their working arrangements.  For example, those who work on Mondays lose out because most bank holidays fall on a Monday.</P>
    <P>Another significant protection feature of the Organisation of Working Time Bill, which goes beyond what is required by the EU directive, is the new regulation on zero hour contracts and the entitlement of an employee to advance information on working hours.  Recent labour force survey figures show an increase in part-time and atypical working.  The demands of business dictate working patterns that are no longer based on our traditional view of regular working hours or the full-time job.  I am also conscious that there is a demand from some workers for part-time and atypical work to match their personal circumstances. Labour force survey figures suggest that most part-time workers do not want full-time work.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the development towards greater flexibility has led to some disturbing practices. Zero hour contracts have all the characteristics <Col N="1500" /> of the old hiring fair.  Employees should not have to make themselves available without receiving money.  Being at the beck and call of an employer is unacceptable in this day and age. Workers must be able to plan ahead for their working hours, family and child care arrangements, social life and income.  For the first time in legislation, zero hour contracts will effectively be banned and, in a further improvement for workers, employers will be required to give advance notice of working hours.  In other words, people who work Monday to Friday should be told their working hours for the following week on the previous Thursday evening.  This is an important right for employees and it will ensure that workers are not left hanging around waiting for a telephone call from their employers.  It should improve the quality of life by enabling workers to better plan and organise their working life.  These initiatives are an important response to demands from the MANDATE trade union and others in the aftermath of the Dunnes Stores dispute.  They ensure the development of new working arrangements will not take place at the expense of the worker.</P>
    <P>A primary objective of the proposed new legislation is that it should be enforced in a manner that is familiar to both workers and employers, that such enforcement should be informal and cost effective and provide speedy determinations. For those reasons, we have adopted a new approach to the enforcement of these new statutory rights and have given an expanded role to the Labour Court.  Both the court and the rights commissioners are familiar to the parties and will, I am confident, provide a speedy and cost effective service to resolve problems or disputes without either of the parties having to resort to formal legal proceedings.  The rights commissioners and the Labour Court have traditionally dealt with disputes relating to working time and are best placed to deal with disputes under the working time legislation.</P>
    <P>The Department's labour inspectorate will be given wide-ranging powers under the legislation to inspect records and respond to complaints.  The inspectors will also be able to follow up complaints on behalf of employees who would not be in a position to take up complaints on their own behalf.  This provision was specifically introduced to deal with unrepresented and vulnerable workers who, for various reasons, would not be in a strong enough position to proceed with a complaint.  It is reasonable to presume that some shop workers would be in this category, particularly non-unionised workers working in small corner shops.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals at EU level deal with the issue of atypical work and we are monitoring progress closely.  The UK vetoed provisions on part-time work and this is being addressed under the social Protocol by European employers and trade unions.  We must allow the potential of the employment market to be fully realised while simultaneously affording basic rights to all <Col N="1501" /> workers employed on a regular basis.  The most balanced approach is to ensure that standard workers and non-standard workers have the same legislative entitlements.  Progress is being made on this matter in Brussels.</P>
    <P>We have made considerable progress in meeting the needs of shop workers under the Organisation of Working Time Bill.  Under that Bill people will not be obliged to work on Sundays if it is not in their contract of employment.  The Bill also provides for a Sunday premium, which is set by reference to the going rate, for increased holiday entitlements and it outlaws zero hour contracts.  Deputy Kitt will be aware that the 1938 legislation, which will be repealed by the Organisation of Working Time Bill, provides that three women working behind a counter are entitled to share one chair.  I have already signed regulations under the health and safety rules providing for a gender neutral rule in that regard.  Irrespective of how many people work behind a counter, they have a legal right to sit down if the work can be done from a sitting position.  I have written to all the major chain stores, RGDATA and shop workers' unions in that regard.  It is not acceptable that a person at a cash point should be expected to stand all day given the disadvantages to their health.  This is a progressive step forward and of practical benefit to shop workers, many of whom suffer from varicose veins and other health problems because they are forced to stand although the job does not require it.</P>
    <P>The Organisation of Working Time Bill deals in a practical way with a number of the concerns which affect shop workers as well as other groups of employees.  It reflects the unprecedented level of consultation with the social partners and other interested parties.  I am concerned there has not been sufficient consideration of the implications of the measures proposed by Deputy Kitt and that the views of the social partners and other interested groups on his proposals have not been sought.  The Deputy's Bill is at best a partial response to a complex issue and at worst an exercise in opportunism, although I would not accuse my constituency colleague of such a heinous crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>How voluntary is the opt-out proposed?  Deputy Kitt will be aware of my overall scepticism about opt-outs, particularly for those working in small businesses.  While there is popular appeal in opt-outs, more complex interests and considerations arise.  One must ask how voluntary could an opt-out be if an employee was only offered Sunday work and little other work for the rest of the week.  How can an employee bargain on his or her own from a position of relative weakness, particularly if they have no union and are one of two or three employees in a small shop in a town?  As legislators, we must <Col N="1502" /> consider the realities and complexities of legislating for the employment relationship in circumstances where there is an unequal relationship and one might be better served by better protections in the area of industrial relations.</P>
      <P>This is an area to which the Deputy would need to give further consideration.  For example, what would be the implications for existing collective agreements which provide for Sunday working? There could be industrial relations problems if Sunday working becomes voluntary for certain people despite well established agreements.  I draw the Deputy's attention to the formula used in the Organisation of Working Time Bill where the limited individual opt-out to the 48-hour week over a two year phase in period is safe-guarded through the collective agreement process and by giving a role to the Labour Court in vetting not only the health and safety aspects but also the voluntary nature of any agreement.  We need to consider whether voluntary work is voluntary. These precise measures may not be appropriate in these circumstances but no consideration appears to have been given to the need for such protections by Deputy Kitt.  This is one area which needs substantial rethinking before Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Another issue which Deputy Kitt has not thought out in any detail is who should be covered by the legislation.  Should the Sunday opt-out be available to those who are employed to work on Sunday only?  If an employee agrees to work Sundays only, the opt-out would make a nonsense of the contract of employment.  Should the opt-out apply to all shops?  What would be the effect on the corner shop which has traditionally operated Sunday working?  What would happen in rural areas if such shops were to close?  Much consultation and discussion is needed to tease out the practical implications of what is proposed. The Deputy would not wish to close all shops and retail outlets, such as garden centres and places of entertainment.  The views of RGDATA should be sought.  We need to know if small shops in rural areas will close because nobody will work on a Sunday.  Such discussions should precede the enactment of legislation in this area.</P>
      <P>We should also look at issues such as the timing of the opt-out and when it should take effect. Should there be a differentiation between employees employed before and after the opt-out? I looked at UK legislation in this area which is fairly complex and is being reviewed.  We need much more detailed study in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kitt has not considered the most appropriate mechanism for policing such an arrangement.  The criteria should be, as adopted in the Organisation of Working Time Bill, that the mechanism should provide informal, speedy and cost effective settlement while allowing the employment relationship to continue.  Deputy Kitt has chosen a more time consuming, complicated and costly method of enforcement.  Furthermore, the Deputy's proposals as regards enforcement have the potential to cause irreparable <Col N="1503" /> damage to the employment relationship.  We must consider what will happen in small shops where the employee may have a personal relationship with the employer.  How will the enforcement mechanism work in practice?</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt does not seem to be aware of the joint labour committee for the retail and grocery sector or the fact that a legally binding Sunday premium and overtime rate exists for shop workers in this sector.  These rates, which are set out in the Employment Regulation Order for the sector, were arrived at following agreement between both sides of industry and without the need for legislative intervention.  This Government supports a partnership approach but this aspect of the Bill could drive a coach and four through existing agreements which are legally binding and working well.</P>
    <P>It would be particularly damaging to enshrine in law an overtime rate for Sunday workers which is less than that under the statutory minimum rate for the retail grocery sector.  Shop workers would be badly served by enshrining in law a time and a half rate when they are entitled to double time under existing the Employment Regulation Order where Sunday working is worked as overtime. Nobody would welcome a lowering of overtime or premia rates for the sector.  The approach we adopted in the Organisation of Working Time Bill where people may go to the Labour Court to seek a determination of the appropriate rate for the job with reference to established agreements in the sector allows flexibility.  In law we would end up with the lowest rate but this allows workers to get a higher rate for the job, where appropriate.</P>
    <P>A large number of questions need to be considered before legislation on voluntary Sunday working can be enacted.  We must ask what are the intended effects of our proposals and if they will be effective in achieving these objectives.  Of very real concern is the question of the voluntary nature of any agreement between an employer and employee in these circumstances.  We should also ensure the legislation would not have the unwanted effect of disrupting existing collective agreements operating well in relation to Sunday. We also need to look closely at the effects of such measures as closing rural shops as well as other services.  We need to receive the views of the social partners who ultimately will have to live with the legislation.</P>
    <P>I regard Sunday as a special day and this is evident by the provisions I included in the Organisation of Working Time Bill, which were not required by European law.  I have gone further by enshrining in law that employees are entitled to a weekly rest on Sunday unless the contract of employment provides otherwise.  These employees already have a right to voluntary Sunday working.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the increase in Sunday working, particularly in shops which have increased opening hours dramatically in recent years.  While I <Col N="1504" /> have no wish to interfere with trading, I am anxious to ensure that more flexible arrangements should not come about at the expense of the worker or his or her rest and family life.  It is also clear, and this has been commented on by the Labour Court, that the increase in part-time and atypical working is responding to a demand among some workers for working hours which suit their personal circumstances.</P>
    <P>More work needs to be done on Deputy Kitt's Bill but I have no problem in accepting the spirit in which it was put forward and the principle of improving the conditions of employment of employees in the retail trade.  I have already taken substantial steps to improve the situation of workers in this sector.  Further study and more exploration of the details in the Bill are required. The outcome of these deliberations can be reflected on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State referred to what the Labour Party has done in terms of tax reform and job creation.  As far as job creation is concerned, she should visit County Donegal and read the figures for that area.  Much has to be done and it will take a lot of work on everyone's part to do it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Protection of Workers (Shops) Bill brought to the House by Deputy Tom Kitt. It is heartening that Fianna Fáil's commitment to the workers has culminated in this Bill and I am glad the Government has agreed to accept it in the absence of its own.  There has been a trend since 1994 towards the bigger stores opening on Sundays.  This impinges on the lives of many people, the employer, the employee and the consumer, and more so than the traditional confinement of Sunday opening to newsagents, small groceries or neighbourhood shops.  As it affects many people, it is important it is legislated for in a manner which ensures equity for all and, above all, protection for workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of Sunday trading was brought sharply into focus last week when the debate arose on the possibility of stores opening on Easter Sunday.  The reaction from many people was considerable and was obviously caused by the religious aspect whereby people want the most important Sunday of the Christian religious calendar maintained, along with Christmas Day, as a special day.  There were other reasons for the strength of the reaction and these arise partly from the psychological pressure felt by employers, employees and consumers alike.  Once one large chain store made a move to open on Easter Sunday, all big employers were put under pressure to do likewise.  Once one employer called on its staff to work Easter Sunday, psychological pressure was placed on that staff.  If shops opened on Easter Sunday, there would be a subtle pressure on consumers <Col N="1505" /> to use the opportunity to shop.  I applaud those who listened to all sections of public opinion and decided not to open.</P>
    <P>Many people disagree with Sunday trading because they see Sunday as a traditional day of rest and the one day in the week when the family can come together as a unit.  Many see the six days from Monday to Saturday as adequate service to the community's needs.  This is not specific to Irish people.  In countries such as Germany, it is difficult to get a litre of milk or a box of matches from Sunday afternoon to Monday morning as everything closes and the right of the family to have Sundays free is respected.  Substantial reasons underlie this train of thought, so we are not unusual.</P>
    <P>For many, Sunday work is now a reality.  They feel there is a need for the finance which can be gained in the extra day's pay.  While Sunday trading has not arisen from any request from employees for more hours, it is nonetheless with us.  As the Minister of State said, we are not legislating to close everything on Sunday and there is no desire to go that route.  Sunday opening is becoming more normal.  It seems that, with the working time directive, we are moving to a European ideology that all days are the same.  Whether we like it or not, Sunday is commercialised.  If the special status of Sunday has changed, the need for legislation becomes even more important.</P>
    <P>There should be no compulsion to participate on those who do not wish to do so and their jobs and incomes should not be threatened if they say no, nor should it lead to an increase in the hiring of casual labour.  For those who wish to participate, there must be a fair measure of remuneration and fair terms and conditions.  The word &ldquo;optional&rdquo; is important as are the words &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; for the working time directive.  Shop workers need the option to decide not to work yet the ability of a business to operate profitably must also be taken into account.  That is covered in the Bill where notice must be given by workers if they are not going to work on a Sunday.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision dealing with zero hour contracts because workers should have the right to advance notice of work; the provision insisting on a minimum of time and a half pay for those who opt to work on a Sunday; the provision prohibiting discrimination &mdash; if a person does not want to work on a Sunday, they should not be discriminated against on any grounds &mdash; and the provision that a shop worker will not be obliged to work on a Sunday without their consent.  These seem to be basic rights but it is only now they are being legislated for.  I welcome the fact that employees must now get four days' notice of their being required for Sunday work.</P>
    <P>Some 45 per cent of shop workers are female which is almost twice the European average. Legislation is important as it will lead to stronger standards and a better quality of life for all.  The many women involved in this work should be <Col N="1506" /> treated properly.  Casual working must also be catered for.  The provisions in this Bill will help strengthen the position of full-time workers.  Irish workers are recognised the world over for their ability and they are wanted everywhere.  We do not want or need exploitation to occur now or in future.</P>
    <P>I give Deputy Kitt substantial credit for researching this area thoroughly.  There has been widespread interest in the party in this topic.  The Bill has been published since November 1996 and has not been pre-empted by any Government legislation.  I am glad to see it has come this far and that it will proceed unopposed to Committee Stage.  It will mean action will have been taken on an issue which badly needs it.  There is no point talking unless action follows quickly.  This Bill will strengthen the position of employers, employees and consumers, people will not lose out, there will be a sense of fair play and we will all benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister of State has accepted Deputy Tom Kitt's Bill.  That is important because he has put a tremendous amount of work into it.  It has been on the Order Paper since November 1996.  He has had two years of discussions with the unions involved and has a large measure of agreement for the Bill. The agreement of the MANDATE union with the Bill was important.  It is also significant that it has been welcomed by RGDATA, something the Minister of State omitted to mention in her critique of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The important aspect of this Bill is that it provides protective measures for workers.  I was disappointed the Minister of State mentioned it was at worst an exercise in opportunism.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Anyone who knows Deputy Kitt will know he has a real interest in this area, has been working on it and has been involved in consultation for a long time. It is very unfair even to suggest any hint of opportunism. Rather, Deputy Kitt should be congratulated for the interest and deep commitment he has to people working in the retail trade.  They appreciate the amount of time and effort he has expended in ensuring that their rights are protected under legislation brought before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, is present.  I thought the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, would have replied to this matter.  I listened to what he said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; last week and wondered how, if this matter is part of the brief of the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, he was allowed such an expansive brief.  Who has the various portfolios in the Department?  Does the Minister or the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, have the portfolio on this matter or is he once again dallying through the daffodil fields on this issue to try to upset, but certainly not to upstage, the Minister of State?  However, his dally through the daffodil field on this occasion came a cropper, as he did <Col N="1507" /> not seem to realise this Bill had been on the Order Paper for some time.</P>
    <P>During the Cork North Central and Cork South Central by-elections the Minister, Deputy Bruton, who was then a spokesperson for his party, indicated there would be no problem in issuing a licence for the deflector system.  He said on entering Government he would ensure a temporary licence would be made available to the South Coast Community Television Group in Carrigaline.  Two and a half years later that group is still awaiting a temporary licence.  We are trying to eke out the report that has been passed on. Nothing has changed except the Taoiseach sinks much further into his seat every time the issue is raised in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Bruton, promised he would introduce legislation on Sunday trading and the protection of workers' rights.  It is astonishing that once again Fianna Fáil has to give the lead in this House.  What has been happening during the past two and a half years?  We have heard there were constitutional and other problems. The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, said she accepted the spirit of our Bill, there are good provisions in it and amendments will have to be made on Committee Stage.  We have no difficulty with the tabling of amendments on Committee Stage, provided they improve the Bill and ensure workers have greater protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State expressed some scepticism about the opt out clause and said Deputy Kitt had not addressed that issue.  The Minister of State appears to hold the view that the opt out clause would be the absolute exception rather than the rule.  Section 3 provides for exemptions for a relative of the proprietor or an owner of a shop.  We do not have any difficulty with students working part-time on a Sunday.  We are conscious of that and Deputy Kitt ensured that aspect is covered in the Bill.  Paragraph (b) provides an exemption for an employee who is normally expected to work for the employer for less than eight hours in a week and paragraph (c) provides an exemption for an employee who has been in continuous service of the employer for less than a month.  Protections are inherent in the Bill and it is important that those exemptions are included.</P>
    <P>We have been critical and have questioned the activities of Dunnes Stores on many occasions, its approach to its workers and Sunday trading.  It is important to record our appreciation that when Dunnes Stores was asked to reconsider its decision about Easter Sunday trading in view of the fact that people consider it a special day in terms of religion and Irish history, it did so.  It would have been wrong for it to open on Easter Sunday.  We should remind other multiples with headquarters outside Ireland of how special Easter Sunday is to our people.  As Dunnes Stores has taken a lead, those stores should also respect the wishes of our people in terms its special nature, whether on religious, historical or cultural <Col N="1508" /> grounds.  I, together with Deputies Kitt and Keaveney, call on those stores to respect our people's wishes and not open their stores on Easter Sunday. If they took that decision unilaterally, they would be held in far higher regard.  I urge them in the strongest possible terms to reconsider their decision.</P>
    <P>Sunday trading is exercising our minds.  I come from a small village where Sunday was the vital day for trading in our area when proprietors made a few bob after Mass on Sunday morning. Life has moved on since then, the multiples have moved in and their growth has brought about many disconcerting facets.  Public opinion is divided on Sunday trading.  I have asked many people about their views on it.  We must accept that society has changed.  In many households both partners work outside the home, many people consider Sunday shopping a social outlet for the family and it is difficult to argue against that viewpoint.  However, many others hold the traditional view that Sunday should be a day of rest and I share that sentiment.  I would be regarded as following the traditional rather than the modern style.</P>
    <P>Sunday trading will cause major problems for those who are actively engaged in sport, whether racing, tennis, camogie, mountain walking or any other leisure pursuit.  The psyche of our people has been geared towards Sunday being considered a rest day.  The vast majority of our sporting organisations centre their activities and games around Sundays on the basis that Sunday is a day of rest.  We should be conscious and take cognisance of that.  When the Minister of State introduces legislation on Sunday trading she should take account of the psyche of our people to ensure that people are given as much free time as possible on Sunday to pursue the games and leisure facilities they enjoy.  I recognise the issue is extremely complex.  I look forward to the introduction of this legislation by the Minister of State in the near future when I am sure we will have a level-headed debate on it.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am pleased to introduce the Health (Provision of Information) Bill, 1997, to the House.  This Bill is but one of a number of elements of the national cancer strategy which I launched last November and which will for the first time provide for a co-ordinated and integrated cancer service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that on 4 March last I announced details of an action plan which will fund and implement the cancer initiatives proposed in the national cancer strategy.  The action <Col N="1509" /> plan commits the Government to putting in place the necessary funding to support the various measures which will further improve the prevention, early detection, treatment and palliative care services for cancer.  The main elements of the national cancer strategy include reorganising cancer treatment services to promote a strong patient focus and ensure equity of access throughout the country, devoting resources to screening and early detection programmes of proven value, using health promotion activities to emphasise further the importance of healthy lifestyles, developing specialist pallative care services on a phased basis and facilitating greater co-ordination of cancer research.</P>
    <P>The detailed features of the action plan which describes how the strategy will be implemented include plans costing an extra £6 million this year for the development of cancer services in each region.  The plans include additional consultant appointments for treatment services, development of palliative care and funding for research. Regional directors have been appointed to coordinate services and develop a cancer plan for their region.  Further funds will be allocated in 1998 and 1999 to implement all of the provisions of the strategy.  A national cancer forum, will be appointed as promised in the national cancer strategy.  Expert bodies will be established to steer the implementation of national programmes of screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer and legislation will be introduced to ensure that the breast and cervical screening programmes comply with data protection requirements.  The legislation before the House will ensure that efforts to establish the proposed screening programmes can proceed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, cancer continues to be one of the major causes of death.  It accounts for some 7,500 deaths every year, or one quarter of all deaths.  In the under 65 age group the proportion is even higher, at one third of all deaths in this group.</P>
    <P>Deaths in the under 65 age category are described as premature mortality.  Many of these deaths can be prevented.  With this in mind the national cancer strategy focuses on steps to reduce premature mortality from cancer.  It reiterates a key target set in the national health strategy, published in 1994, namely, to reduce the deaths in those aged under 65 years by 15 per cent in the ten-year period to 2004.</P>
    <P>Of all deaths from cancer in those aged under 65 years, breast cancer accounts for nearly 10 per cent with approximately 660 women dying each year from the disease.  Cervical cancer accounts for a further 60 to 70 deaths each year.  Expert advice is that between 20 and 30 per cent of deaths from breast cancer among women aged over 50 years could be prevented if a quality mass screening programme were established.  International studies indicate that programmes should be aimed at women aged between 50 and 64 years.  To date there is little evidence to support breast screening among women under 50 years of age.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> In the case of cervical cancer, there is evidence that, where a pre-malignant condition known as CIN is identified, it can be treated with almost 100 per cent success.  The fact that CIN usually precedes cervical cancer and can be identified is obviously very important.</P>
    <P>While there continues to be an ongoing debate about the efficacy of different screening programmes, there is a high level of consensus within the medical profession on the value of screening programmes for breast and cervical cancer.  The potential value of screening programmes for these particular cancers lies in their ability to reduce significantly the number of deaths from the disease where early diagnosis can be identified. It is recognised that in developing any such programmes they must be carefully organised. Ensuring that only the highest quality practices are used will also help to secure the best results.</P>
    <P>We have already built up a high degree of expertise through the valuable pilot programme of screening for breast cancer, known as the Eccles breast screening programme, which began in 1989.  This programme, which was funded by my Department, was organised by the Mater Foundation.  The experience of the pilot programme will be very valuable now that we are moving to establish a national programme.  The Eccles breast screening programme underlines the importance of organising screening carefully on a phased basis so that the lessons of each stage can be taken into account before the next phase proceeds.</P>
    <P>In relation to screening for cervical cancer, we are fortunate to have the report of an expert multidisciplinary group of health professionals available. This report was also published with the national cancer strategy last November.  The report of the working party on cervical screening recommended that a national programme of cervical screening should be established for women in the 25 to 60 age group.  I have taken on board the recommendations of the expert committee and have now established an advisory committee to oversee the implementation and monitoring of a national programme.  Based on the valuable and practical experience which was gained by running a pilot programme for breast screening, it is considered important to run a pilot cervical screening programme in the first instance to ensure that the national programme operates in the most effective manner.</P>
    <P>Having accepted the medical evidence that the time is right to proceed with national screening programmes for breast and cervical cancer, we are faced with the issue to ensuring that the current legislation relating to data protection is complied with.  That is the principal purpose of the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Expert advice is that both programmes can only operate effectively if population registers can be established and regularly updated.  The purpose of the population register is to have the names and addresses of women in the target age group so that they can be invited for screening. <Col N="1511" /> The intention is that women will be invited to attend for screening as soon as they reach the appropriate age and therefore the registers will need to be updated constantly.  The women's details can then be retained on the registers until they move outside the target age group but the first concern is to ensure that we can identify all women who should be offered screening for the first time.</P>
    <P>No such population register is available for this purpose at present.  Therefore, it will be necessary to draw upon data from a number of existing sources such as the GMS Payments Board, the Department of Social Welfare and health insurance companies.  The names and addresses of women must be obtained from these sources and used to create a national population register for the age groups concerned.  However, under current data protection legislation it does not appear to be possible for these sources to pass personal details to a third party such as a screening programme.  An important principle of data protection is that personal information, such as the names and addresses of individuals, should be used only for the purpose for which it was originally collected.  There can be little argument that, in this case, the information is required for a very important public health purpose.  However, legal advice available indicates that specific legislative authority is required before we can proceed.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the sections of the Bill, I want to remind Members that the cancer screening programmes and the National Cancer Registry Board, with which I will deal in a moment, will be subject to the Data Protection Act in how the information collected is stored and used.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides that an organisation participating in any programme of breast or cervical screening authorised by the Minister for Health may request information from any person regarding names, addresses and dates of birth so that, for public health reasons, women may be invited to participate in that programme.  The section enables any person requested to provide information for this purpose to do so.  The key points to note are as follows: the screening programme must be authorised by the Minister for Health: the information must be requested for the purposes of compiling and maintaining a record of persons who may be invited to attend for screening and the purpose of the screening is for reasons of public health.  The section is enabling rather than mandatory: it does not require any person or agency to provide the information requested.  However, agencies such as the General Medical Services Payments Board and the Department of Social Welfare would be expected to co-operate fully in such important programmes of screening for cancer.</P>
    <P>Members of the Seanad &mdash; where I introduced this Bill &mdash; made a very valuable contribution during their debate on 13 March.  One of the key issues raised was whether we should restrict provisions relating to cancer screening to breast and <Col N="1512" /> cervical cancers or make a similar provision in respect of other types of cancer.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Bill was first raised in the context of screening for prostate cancer but, as I pointed out, it could equally arise in the case of other cancers if effective screening programmes for them became available.  With this in mind I suggested it would be appropriate to frame the amendment in a manner sufficiently wide to apply to other screening programmes provided they had been proven to be medically effective.  I undertook to consult the Attorney General's Office on the most appropriate wording.</P>
    <P>I will table an amendment on Committee Stage to extend the data protection provisions for breast and cervical cancer, contained in the Bill as originally published, to any other cancer screening programmes authorised by the Minister for Health.  I emphasise that I can give no commitment to organising or funding any other cancer screening programmes unless and until they have been proved to be effective.  It would be most unwise of any Minister for Health to arrange for cancer screening programmes which have yet to pass this test.</P>
    <P>The approach in my amendment will enable the establishment of population registers for other cancer screening programmes provided they are authorised by the Minister for Health. This authorisation would not be forthcoming unless cancer screening for that type of cancer had been established as effective.</P>
    <P>I thank individual Senators who contributed to this debate.  This amendment was generated resulting from one tabled by Senator Finneran, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson in the Seanad.  I thank him for his advice and co-operation, supported by many others, including Senator Henry who also strongly urged that we cast the net slightly wider to include prospective screening programmes which may prove to be medically effective in the future.</P>
    <P>I have also had an opportunity to consider the wording of other aspects of the Bill.  As currently drafted, the Bill refers specifically to &ldquo;national&rdquo; programmes of screening for cancer.  However, it has been pointed out to me that there may be good reasons for establishing locally-based or regional screening programmes which may or may not subsequently be organised on a national basis.  Indeed, the breast cancer screening programme I have already announced will commence in three health board areas before moving, on a phased basis, to a national level.  It would be unsatisfactory if the wording of this Bill operated to preclude the establishment of appropriate local screening programmes.  Therefore, the amendment I will table on Committee Stage will remove any reference to &ldquo;national&rdquo; programmes.</P>
    <P>I now wish to draw the attention of the House to the second major element of the Bill which will allow the National Cancer Registry Board to continue collecting important data relating to cases of all forms of cancer.  The National Cancer Registry Board is a statutory body established in <Col N="1513" /> 1991 under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961.  The functions of the board include the collection and analysis of information in relation to each newly diagnosed case of cancer.  Its main task is to gather and analyse information on the incidence and prevalence of all types of cancer in Ireland.  The data it collects are very important for epidemiological and research purposes.  The registry's work forms a critical part of the initiatives announced in the national cancer strategy. The registry's first national report on cancer is at present being finalised and will be published in the near future.</P>
    <P>One of the main sources of data for the registry is provided by the hospitals sector.  To ensure that the registry has a complete and detailed picture of cancer in Ireland, the information supplied by hospitals must include the name and address of each patient diagnosed.  There are a number of reasons for this requirement.</P>
    <P>First, it is vital for the National Cancer Registry to be able to trace patients across episodes of treatment in different hospitals.  Its data must be consistent and accurate in this respect.  The registry's own experience, and that of cancer registries internationally, is that access to the names and addresses of patients is the only reliable method for achieving this cross-matching.</P>
    <P>Second, the registry also collects data on deaths from cancer.  As part of this task it must update its records of patients diagnosed with cancer who subsequently die.  Information from death certificates is used for this purpose.  Again, both international experience and that of the National Cancer Registry is that it is virtually impossible to link cases currently registered with those who die from cancer unless the name and address of the patient is available.</P>
    <P>The question of whether hospitals can supply data of this kind to the registry has been raised in the context of current data protection legislation. It is necessary to resolve any possible questions about this matter so that the National Cancer Registry can continue its important work. Failure to resolve these now could deprive the National Cancer Registry of vital sources of data. Its ability to collect accurate information would be greatly hampered and its role in helping to analyse the incidence and prevalence of cancer would be severely curtailed, which could also have implications for the registry's contribution to cancer research.</P>
    <P>We cannot leave any room for doubt in relation to the legal basis for the National Cancer Registry's current arrangements for obtaining named patient data from hospitals.  The Bill will enable the registry to continue to request this data for the purposes of any of its functions and provides that the persons requested to supply that data, in other words hospitals, may do so.</P>
    <P>The fact that this provision goes no further than safeguarding the present position should be clearly noted.  No additional powers are being conferred on the National Cancer Registry Board by virtue of this legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> The passing of this important Bill will have no direct staffing or cost implications.  The action plan I launched earlier this month details the plans for developing cancer services in 1997 at a cost of £6 million.  The full costs of the programmes of screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer are included in that action plan.  The implementation of the complete set of initiatives in relation to cancer will continue in 1998 and 1999 and the full package of developments, including screening programmes, will cost an additional £25 million when all those initiatives are in place.   There are no cost implications for the National Cancer Registry Board resulting from the proposal to safeguard its position in the collection of data from hospitals.</P>
    <P>On taking office I set as a priority the improvement of cancer services.  I am confident the plans contained in the national cancer strategy will deliver on this promise.  The passage of this Bill will allow the programmes of breast and cervical screening to proceed and the National Cancer Registry Board to continue its important work.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Very shortly after his appointment the Minister for Health made clear that the improvement of cancer detection and treatment services would be high on his ministerial agenda; in fact he set it as his top priority in the development of health services.  He promised in January 1995 that his Department would have a policy on cancer within 12 weeks.  Instead of 12, we have had to wait 100 weeks for that policy first published last November.  Obviously the Minister thought it so good that, like the lyrics of &ldquo;New York, New York&rdquo;, he decided to announce it twice, with a second launch of the strategy this month.</P>
      <P>Cancer is a hugely important health issue here, about which there is great fear and foreboding; indeed, few words in the English language strike such terror into people.  For many decades cancer was a taboo here and there are still many who hate even to say the word; they will describe it as the &ldquo;Big C&rdquo;, the &ldquo;boyo&rdquo; or use some other expression rather than refer to it by name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of deaths due to cancer in this country is of the order of 7,500 annually, higher than the EU average.  After heart disease, cancer is this country's higgest killer among the under 65 year olds, with 18,000 new cases recorded annually.  In 1996 cancer accounted for 50,000 hospital episodes. Cancer deaths among Irish women are particularly high and action needs to be taken. Screening can play a major part in detection and I am pleased this is finally being acknowledged. However, cancer and other health matters are also major concerns for men.  Up to now there has been a perception that health matters are women's issues.  However, men die on average six years younger than women and prostate cancer in men is almost as common as breast cancer in women.  Five times as many men die from cancer of the prostate as do women from cervical cancer. <Col N="1515" /> Prostatic cancer is not as well researched as any of the female cancers.</P>
    <P>Testicular cancer is the commonest form of cancer in men aged 15-44.  One in every 251 Irish men will develop cancer of the testes.  One in every 32 males develop prostate cancer.  Some 75 per cent of men aged over 50 have symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia &mdash; that is when the prostate enlarges and affects the flow of urine through the urethra.  Some 25 per cent of men who live to 80 will require a prostatectomy, the surgical removal of a portion of their prostate gland.</P>
    <P>Women have used the health services more intelligently and more frequently than men.  Diseases such as coronary heart disease kill at least one in every three men.  High blood pressure affects one in five.  One in three gets cancer, while one in four dies from it.  It is time for men to learn from women and the way in which they have raised consciousness in the past 20 years about their gender-specific cancers.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for national breast and cervical screening programmes.  Since 1989, the Eccles programme at the Mater Hospital has operated on a pilot basis.  It is unfortunate it has taken eight years to get it to a national programme. Breast cancer is a major killer in Ireland.  The death rate remains depressingly high and the disease eventually kills eight in then sufferers. Screening programmes targeted at women in those age groups where the risk is greatest can be effective.  Early detection rates will make all the difference.</P>
    <P>We should not have to wait as long for cervical screening as for breast cancer screening.  I am disappointed to note in the cancer strategy the Minister's commitment is just to start the national programme for cervical screening not later than 1999. Many deaths will have taken place between now and then.</P>
    <P>The Minister also needs to attend urgently to the smear test results delay.  In some cases there is a delay of four months.  Last month the Coombe Women's Hospital put a three-month moratorium on routine cervical smear tests in a bid to clear a massive backlog.  Thousands of women should not have to wait months for results.  This creates fear.  The Minister must give a commitment to provide adequate backup diagnostic laboratory staff and services for this purpose.  Screening programmes which take weeks or months to produce their results can be stressfully counter-productive.</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Registry Board has existed since 1991.  I am keen to establish where the concern has come from and on what legal advice the Minister is acting.  I call on him to read that advice into the record.  In his speech to the Seanad on this matter he said under current data protection legislation, it &ldquo;does not appear&rdquo; to be possible for the sources in the Bill to pass personal details to a third party such as a screening programme.  Either the Minister has a definitive <Col N="1516" /> view or he has not.  If he has a definitive view let us hear it.</P>
    <P>The data protection commissioner noted in his 1995 report published last year the extended use of the RSI number in the interests of data sharing and data matching by public authorities was the single greatest challenge facing data protection at present.  He said he has long argued &ldquo;for the need for a proper legislative framework such as the Data Matching legislation which is in place in Australia and New Zealand to deal with the issues&rdquo;.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Ad hoc</i> arrangements, whether supported by minor amendments to existing legislation or not, are in my view an inadequate response to the real issues.  Such an approach undermines the data protection principles to which we have committed ourselves on ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on data protection and does not take account of the requirements of Article 8.7 of the EU directive on data protection....</P>
    <P>Has there been consultation with the data protection commissioner on this Bill and what is the Minister's view on what the commissioner has said in his 1995 report?  It would appear the Minister is flying in the face of what the commissioner said.</P>
    <P>Cancer machinery is a matter about which there has been some concern.  I welcome the introduction of guidelines on the administration of chemotherapy.  It is important to have an auditing system to ensure hospital machinery for cancer treatments functions properly and correct doses are being administered.</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Registry is taking on a huge task but one it regards as manageable.  It will have huge numbers of people to contact and locate.  If the National Cancer Registry is able to do this why cannot the BTSB make contact with all the people who have received potentially infected blood or blood products?  During the debate on hepatatis C the Minister said the BTSB was doing its best.  Perhaps the National Cancer Registry will advise it on better procedures.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons given by the Minister for Health for not introducing a prostate cancer screening programme is that the national health screening committee in the UK has recently concluded there is no evidence available at this time for the introduction of a prostate screening programme. Must we always slavishly follow the British advice in this area?  In the hepatitis C episode, we witnessed the same situation where the Department of Health was holding on for a British decision.  One reason given by Britain for not doing it was the Gulf War.  Is the stonewalling on prostate cancer another issue about resources which is being dressed up in medical terms?</P>
    <P>The Minister said the National Cancer Registry's first national report is being finalised.  Is this the first report the group has produced since 1991?  Perhaps the Minister could give details on <Col N="1517" /> its resources, staffing and work in reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>As this stage screening is possible for many cancers.  The Bill as drafted was minimalist in nature. As the Minister adverted to the debate in the Seanad, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Health, Senator Michael Finneran, made tremendous efforts to broaden the scope of the Bill.  He rightly pointed our screening for prostate cancer should be considered.  The Minister, fearing a Seanad defeat, said he would do this.  He said: &ldquo;I will introduce an amendment along the lines the Senator has suggested&rdquo;.  The Minister even put forward suggested wording which included the word &ldquo;prostate&rdquo;.  However, what he has put forward is not quite the same.  Prostate screening is not mentioned as an objective.  There is just a wider umbrella of cancer screening offered but no specific goal to have a prostate programme.</P>
    <P>In my amendments I have specifically mentioned the question of prostate cancer screening going ahead and the Minister should do the same. He should insert the word &ldquo;prostate&rdquo; in his new amendment and I will propose this on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>My other main amendment relates to widening the medical screening provided.  Many people would be scared if they received a note with a request to attend for a cancer check.  If they received a note with a request to attend for a full medical, they would be less alarmed and co-operate more quickly and more fully.  Coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and many other conditions are prevalent and detectable at an early stage.  People presenting for screening could also have their blood pressure taken and urine tested which would show up anaemia and any blood-related problems.  In his reply in the Seanad the Minister said: &ldquo;There is nothing in the Bill which prevents that &mdash; wider medical screening&rdquo;. I ask the Minister to accept this amendment since he agrees there is nothing in the Bill to stop it and it should be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister's cancer strategy has been published with much fanfare and is welcome. However, there are concerns.  Professor Jin Fenelly, a medical oncologist and chairman of the Irish Cancer Society, has warned the £22 million to be spent over three years will be somewhat stretched.  Some £6 million of this money is to be spent this year.</P>
    <P>We must put an end to people having to travel long distances to receive just one hour of treatment. I welcome the Minister's proposals and I hope they will be implemented.  However, I note the concerns expressed by Dr. John Armstrong, medical director of St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin. He says Ireland is significantly below par in terms of the number of radiation oncologists working in hospitals.  He notes that it has been over a decade since a new consultant post in the specialty was created in Dublin and that there is no specific mention of the need to create additional posts in this area in the national cancer strategy.  The Minister must follow through on his proposals <Col N="1518" /> and take up such serious concerns.  We must listen to the expert advice of eminent doctors such as Dr. Armstrong.  If the cancer strategy is to make a difference it must be resourced adequately.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also take note of Dr. Armstrong's concern that more than 2,000 Irish people, newly diagnosed with the disease each year, might not be receiving the necessary type of treatment.  He says that up to 10 per cent of patients who should be receiving radiotherapy are not getting it.  It is now estimated, according to international figures, that 50 per cent of all new cancer patients require radiotherapy at some stage during their illness.  However, in Ireland about 40 per cent or less of new cancer patients receive radiotherapy.  There is a 10 per cent deficit compared to international norms.  Dr. Armstrong believes radiotherapy might be under utilised and that other treatments are being recommended instead.</P>
    <P>In the health strategy document, Shaping a Healthier Future, a target is set to reduce the number of cancer cases by 15 per cent by the year 2004.  What progress has been made towards achieving that target since 1994?  Sellafield remains a live issue in Ireland.  A recent conference was told that the incidence of stomach cancer in females in the north-east is 75 per cent higher than in the rest of the State while the incidence of cervical cancer is 27 per cent higher in that region.  The Government has been scattered and weak in its actions on Sellafield. health issue in this country.</P>
    <P>There have been many calls for the establishment of a sperm bank.  There was widespread recent controversy when a 14 year old Irish cancer victim had to travel to the UK to freeze sperm in case cancer treatment rendered him sterile.  In a recent edition of the <i>Irish Medical News</i> it was reported that a new national sperm freezing programme, which would be restricted to cancer patients, is expected to be sited at the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin.  Will the Minister confirm that this is the case?  It was also reported that a private UK clinic based in Clane, County Kildare, is planning to set up its own sperm bank.  Are we now to have two such facilities having had none up to a while ago?  Will the Minister clarify this aspect of the debate in so far as it affects cancer patients?</P>
    <P>People remain concerned about foods and the links with cancer, especially following the Chernobyl disaster.  It is important to have high standards and recent reports that almost half of all Irish food analysed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the last three years was found to be contaminated with traces of pesticides are a concern.</P>
    <P>Health education has a major role to play in preventing cancer.  It is estimated that 70 per cent of cancers could be avoided if we followed the European code against cancer.  The rules of that code are: do not smoke; if one drinks alcohol, do so in moderation; eat more fruit, vegetables and cereals; avoid becoming overweight; limit intake <Col N="1519" /> of fatty foods and increase physical activity; avoid excessive exposure to the sun and sunburn especially in children; follow health and safety instructions on substances which may cause cancer; report any unexplained lumps, sores, bleeding or changes in moles to one's doctor; see one's doctor if one has persistent problems such as coughs, hoarseness and unexplained weight loss; women should have regular cervical smears and breast checks and, if they are over 50 years of age, participate in mammographic screening programmes. Clearly not all of these rules were drafted by an Irish person.</P>
    <P>The issues I have raised are important.  I ask the Minister to consider the inclusion of prostate screening in section 1.  I do not accept that its inclusion will involve a burden on the taxpayer. In view of the fact that the scope of the Bill was widened in the Seanad, following the intervention of the Opposition, to include men as well as women, the inclusion of prostate screening programmes would ensure that it comes about more quickly than if we were to remain silent on the issue, as the Minister proposes in his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  We welcome the proposed national screening programmes for breast and cervical cancer.  This Bill will facilitate the implementation of the screening programmes. However, I accept the argument that the Bill should have a wider remit.  It is useful to discuss the wider issues that have been mentioned and I await the Minister's response.  I also look forward to hearing his reaction to the amendment proposed by Deputy Cowen.</P>
      <P>Although I agree with extending the remit of the Bill, we must bear in mind the Bill's purpose. The word &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; engenders great fear.  People are still extremely reluctant to go through procedures which would lessen the threat of cancer occurring.  Deputy Cowen outlined a list of rules to which we should adhere and they left me quaking. Unfortunately, the only one I can claim to follow is that which directs a person not to take too much sun.  The main aspect of preventive measures is that we must be aware of them.  There must be a publicity campaign which asserts the importance of such measures to ensure that people take precautions.  Prevention is the major aim.  Part of prevention involves early detection and if people are aware of those issues the mortality risks will be significantly reduced.  Prevention is essential but it is also important that people go through the procedures that are available.</P>
      <P>A number of wider issues must be discussed in the context of cancer, particularly breast and gynaecological cancers.  I am interested in what might be termed the wider care path with regard to cancer.  It proceeds from prevention to screening, diagnosis, treatment and after care.  There must be a continuum regardless of the type of cancer involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> One must be aware of the preventive measures that must be taken and the screening mechanisms. However, we reach a problematical area which might not be within the scope of the Bill. A number of women will be concerned about privacy and revealing their names and other information.  Many women, and possibly men, do not want people to be aware that they are suffering from the disease.  They are fearful of the implications of the release of information.  These issues need to be handled delicately and sensitively. A doctor told me today that she was not aware that names and addresses of patients were made available in the cancer register.  This raises the issue of confidentiality.  We have to balance the needs of cancer screening and the register with the sensitivity of patients.  Women should not feel they have to reveal intimate information.</P>
    <P>I welcome the wider screening programme and the implementation of the strategy because of the number of deaths that result from cancer.  Breast cancer is the most common cause of mortality from malignancy, resulting in nearly 700 deaths per year.  While women need to be treated sensitively, there must be a publicity programme which explains how important a screening programme is.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to screen for cervical cancer in the 25 to 60 years age group.  The Minister should take on board the different social mores.  Young women in their late teens to early twenties can contract the most severe and fast spreading form of cervical cancer.  I ask the Minister to address the case for screening in this lower age range. Fears about the release of confidential information arise so sensitivity in this area is called for.</P>
    <P>Once the screening process is complete and progresses to diagnosis, we must be aware of the necessity not only for screening resources but for treatment and after-care.  It is important to talk to sufferers to understand what they are going through and to reflect on their experiences so that we can give them the best care.  There is a continuum from prevention to after-care.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of an enabling process and, because we are concentrating on a small aspect, we should not forget that the views of cancer sufferers should be respected.  Their experiences should be examined so we can learn from them in the future.  Unless we do this, women will be unwilling to participate in screening because of a subsequent bad experience.  This will then permeate through the system.  From the prevention point of view, it is essential that women participate in screening procedures which ensure that mortality rates are drastically reduced.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that there is a degree of delay in this matter although the Minister spoke about pilot programmes, etc.  I urge that procedures are undertaken speedily so that we know what works and that the lives of women who may fall through the cracks in the system at the moment can be saved.  The Eccles Street pilot project was set up <Col N="1521" /> in 1989.  Screening procedures are urgent and necessary as they can save lives.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen said that women are more aware of cancer than men, which is perhaps true.  It is because of the huge amount of work done by groups such as the National Women's Council.  It is extraordinary that it takes campaigns by these bodies to get the health system moving and ensure that these types of proposals are followed through.  This should not happen.  The Department of Health should be championing these programmes.  To a certain extent we are moving in that direction, but it should not be up to organisations to drive cancer information.  The impetus should come from the Department of Health.  At the end of the day this makes financial sense.  Prevention is better than cure.  It is essential that we drive these issues and ensure that people's misgivings about confidentiality are dealt with sensitively.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that the initiatives he is responsible for are carried through with urgency, especially as we approach the end of this Government.  In view of some of the negative events which have occurred during the Minister's term in office, he may want to have provisions on the Statute Book to ensure women's health, which I know he is concerned about, particularly in relation to cancer.  I criticise the elements of delay but not his bona fides on this issue.  At least he is showing a commitment to the treatment and prevention of cancer, which is to be welcomed. However, unless his initiatives are carried through urgently, they will count for little.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the screening programme contained in the overall strategy rather than standing on its own.  I would like the Minister to reassure me that there is treatment and after-care. We should reflect the needs and wants of patients, specifically of women.  It is important to take the prevention issue on board.  I welcome any amendment which will extend the remit of this Bill.  I welcome the thrust of the Bill with some misgivings in relation to confidentiality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of national programmes of screening for breast and cervical cancer.  This is an historic decision for the health of women.  I congratulate the Minister on not just talking about it or launching a cancer strategy but making the necessary resources available.  This initiative is long overdue. Research and experience in other countries has taught us that both programmes are vital if we want to protect women's health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About four or five years ago when I was working with the Commission on the Status of Women, in a chapter on women's health &mdash; a very good one &mdash; it made the key points that any effective health policy should include a strong preventive health dimension, that there should be specific preventive strategies targeted at women, that a crucial aspect of these would be adequate screening facilities for specific cancers and that with regard to cervical cancer there should be a <Col N="1522" /> national campaign to publicise the importance and availability of cervical smear tests.  That still holds true.</P>
    <P>Deputies Cowen and Keogh spoke about the fear the word &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; generates.  One of the most striking speeches I have ever heard on women's health was made by Monica Barnes at a seminar on women's health in Kilkenny when she spoke movingly about the fear and shame felt by women 20 to 30 years ago when diagnosed with breast cancer.  It is still a frightening illness but woman are not silent now.  The more we make programmes available to woman the more we will help to break that resistance and allay fear.  There are still many barriers preventing women presenting for tests &mdash; cost, access, information and fear &mdash; but in providing national screening programmes it is more likely that women who have been screened will talk to their friends.  As Deputy Keogh said, if women present themselves early enough, with good quality screening programmes for breast and cervical cancer &mdash; which can be prevented &mdash; and high quality controls, lives will be saved.  These are two important programmes which will make a huge difference.</P>
    <P>I share some of the concerns expressed in relation to the pilot screening programme for cervical cancer.  I ask the Minister to look seriously at the timeframe.  Much work has been done by the steering group and there is much information available.  The programme should be developed and implemented as quickly as possible.  Will the Minister indicate where it has been introduced on a pilot basis and how he sees it developing?</P>
    <P>It is important that these programmes are accompanied by a health promotion and information strategy.  Resources should be made available to inform women that they are available to allay their fears and highlight the benefits of screening.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister tackled the delays in issuing cancer screening test results.  It is appalling that some women have had to wait up to 13 weeks.  I am pleased that extra resources have been made available and that the turn-around time will be one month.  This should be reduced to two to three weeks, if possible.  It is extremely important that results are made available quickly as women become anxious when they present for a smear test.  In other countries there have been major scandals when women who were given the wrong information developed cancer.  There is a need, therefore, to maintain high standards in screening.</P>
    <P>The speeches in the Seanad on this Bill were interesting.  The point was made that when women present for screening the opportunity should be taken to conduct further tests to detect other illnesses.  That would mean extra resources but it is a point well worth thinking about.  The opportunity could be taken to help women to look after their health effectively.</P>
    <P>I take the point made in relation to men's health and the cancers which affect them.  We have been very good in recent times in high-lighting <Col N="1523" /> particular illnesses which affect women and have begun to get a response but in health research women have been neglected.  I cite research into heart disease as an example, women are less likely to be treated than men for heart illnesses.  There is a need for constant monitoring to ensure there is no bias.  Less money is made available to research the health needs of women. We must be careful to address the needs of women and men.</P>
    <P>Much more work needs to be done in the areas of education and prevention.  It is clear that international companies in their advertising are targeting young women and getting the message across that it is smart to smoke.  Unfortunately, they have been successful.  This is worrying.  It appears the health strategies have been more effective when it comes to young men.  Young men involved in sport in particular have got the message that one should not smoke.  Young women, on the other hand, are vulnerable, although the recent figures show a slight change in the numbers who smoke.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of these screening programmes which are extremely important and will make a huge difference to women's health.  I hope they will be implemented speedily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to comment on the Bill.  As everybody knows, cancer is a major killer, up to 7,500 people per annum.  It reflects well on the health services that we are thinking about the introduction of screening programmes.  In years gone by the biggest killer was TB.  Anything that will help in the early detection of cancers is welcome.  The cancers most amenable to screening are cancer of the breast and cervix.  Early detection in many cases means better results.  In others, the prognosis depends on the types of cancer cells present.</P>
      <P>Prevention is better than cure.  We should start perhaps with what can be done for those who have skin cancer, to which the Celtic race is especially prone.  There is a need for an information programme to advise farmers, fishermen and those exposed to excessive sunlight on how to avoid developing this form of cancer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowen mentioned testicular cancer which affects young men especially.  It can be detected easily and is amenable to screening.  On cancer of the lung, there has been much hype in the American press recently in regard to companies, even at this late stage, acknowledging that there is a definite link with smoking.  We have been aware for many years of the link between smoking and cancer.  Smoking has been a big killer of men and it is unfortunate that an increased number of women have started smoking in recent years.  Lung cancer can be prevented to some extent and we should highlight the risks associated with smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great strides have been made in recent years in the treatment of cancer.  I welcome the efforts by the Minister to set up a regionalised treatment <Col N="1524" /> programme as patients do not like to travel too far from home and prefer to be treated in their local hospitals.  While surgery and chemotherapy are now available in most county hospitals, the question of the provision of radiotherapy in some hospitals has still not been decided.  I recently read that radiotherapy services would not be available in the Western Health Board area for some years.  This may be related to the building programme at the University College Hospital, Galway, but I hope this service will come on stream shortly.</P>
    <P>The provision of palliative care is very important.  If people cannot be cured then they should get the best care possible.  Cancer patients worry about what will happen to them and how their families and relatives will cope.  Palliative care not only helps to ameliorate pain but also helps families deal with psychological problems. The palliative care programme has progressed very satisfactorily in recent years.  Palliative care should be provided at home by the general practitioner and the palliative care team.  If this is not possible then it should be provided by district or county hospitals.  In most cases palliative care can be provided on a domiciliary basis.  We must ensure that this care is provided to patients in their areas.</P>
    <P>We need to carry out further research in this area.  We can also learn from other countries in terms of how to approach the problem.  The provision of data on cancer is important in ascertaining whether there are any precipitating or aetiological factors.  I wish the Minister every success with his cancer treatment programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  It is interesting during a debate on a Bill with no political overhang or content to hear the views of Deputies and to take them into account when formulating policy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowen in his very interesting contribution referred to the waiting lists at the Coombe Hospital.  As Deputy Fitzgerald said, when I announced the cancer strategy and the publication of this Bill I also made a further announcement that £1.5 million would be allocated this year to recruit the necessary laboratory and trained medical and analyst staff to ensure that the backlogs were cleared.  While some of this money will be allocated to the Coombe Hospital, it will be distributed evenly throughout the country to ensure, as the year progresses and the staff are taken on, that the longest any woman will have to wait for the result of a cervical screen test is four weeks.  If one looks at the regional breakdown of the national cancer strategy one will see that elements of this are included in taking on extra staff.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowen also asked about the legal advice in respect of the National Cancer Registry Board.  This arose from the decision by a hospital in the south to refuse to advance names and addresses to the National Cancer Registry Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> The board must accumulate data on all types of cancers over a period of years before any conclusions in respect of incidents, clusters or treatment can be drawn.  The hospital in question contacted the data commissioner, its legal adviser and the Department of Health.  The data commissioner refused to give a definitive answer: he did not tell the hospital it was okay to do so but he did not stop it from doing so either.  On the basis of the advice it received from its legal adviser, the hospital decided it would no longer comply with the requests of the National Cancer Registry Board.  I took advice from the legal adviser in the Department of Health who was of the view that it would be better to use the opportunity and vehicle of this Bill to preserve the present position.  I am not giving the National Cancer Registry Board new powers but rather am simply preserving the present position to ensure that this hospital which had a problem will now feel comfortable giving names and addresses and that this practice continues.  This is a very closed medical community and what happens in one hospital today may happen in a hospital up the road or the next health board area within a very short period.  That is the reason I sought the legal advice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh referred to the issue of confidentiality. Names and addresses are provided to the National Cancer Registry Board at present. There is no other way of ensuring that the data is accumulated and is accurate.  That is the experience abroad and the experience of the National Cancer Registry Board up to now.  Data on the consultant, hospital, diagnoses and treatment is passed on; in other words a person may go from St. John's Hospital to Limerick Regional Hospital, to St. Luke's Hospital and finally to the Mater Hospital.  The only accurate way of ensuring the incidence and development of the cancer is tracked is by the provision of this data.  The data made available to the National Cancer Registry Board is useful and does not merely involve gathering statistics.  This data can be used for the benefit of others subsequently.</P>
    <P>I am not giving any new powers to the National Cancer Registry Board; rather I am simply protecting the present position.  It has been the practice of the National Cancer Registry Board to treat with the utmost confidence the names and addresses of persons whose cancer condition has been notified to it.  It has no interest in publishing the names and addresses.  Its only interest is to ensure that the incidence is tracked across the treatment so that there is no duplication and no information is included which would falsify the data.</P>
    <P>The first report of the National Cancer Registry Board will be published shortly.  If I recall correctly, when the board was founded in 1981 it covered the Cork-Kerry health board region and only became a national board in 1993.  In terms of national data, therefore, we are only talking about a couple of years.  One year's data would not be of much use because it could give an atypical <Col N="1526" /> result.  It will be a period of time before the resource is really valuable.  Once a number of years' data is accumulated, pictures will begin to emerge on which some conclusions can be based, although one would like to see it proceeding over a period of years before basing absolute conclusions on it.</P>
    <P>As regards certain cancers in the north east, such as the one referred to by the Deputy, and linking that to Seallafield, it is premature to argue there is a higher incidence.  The increase may have been for just one year.  In a particular housing estate not far from where I live there has been a very high incidence of breast cancer on one road, but next year and the following year that may change completely.  It is difficult, in the absence of the work of the National Cancer Registry Board continuing over a period of time and publishing its results, to draw conclusions in regard to clusters and the reason particular clusters occur.</P>
    <P>In terms of prostate cancer and the amendment I have proposed, I thank Senator Finneran and I understand the point he was making.  It is not just a question of ag sodar i ndiaidh an uasal, or chasing after the British, in terms of medical advice. The medical advice internationally is that it would be premature to invest in screening programmes for prostate cancer because the results do not justify it.  A European Union study, which includes Ireland, is ongoing, and we may have data arising from that.</P>
    <P>In terms of other cancers where screening might be an appropriate initiative, cancer of the colon may be first over the line in terms of medical opinion on the efficacy of a screening programme. The reason we moved away in the Seanad debate from including prostate cancer as an additional possible cancer, for which a future Minister for Health might arrange a screening strategy, to the wider &ldquo;catch all&rdquo; amendment in terms of cancers was because of the additional information given to me.  It is not clear that if one were to proceed from breast cancer to cervical cancer that the next best option would be prostate cancer.  It might be other cancers, particularly cancer of the colon.  That is the reason the amendment is cast in a wider way to suggest that any cancer screening programme being introduced by a future Minister for Health will not run foul of data protection legislation.  That is the essence of the amendment.</P>
    <P>If a future Minister for Health decides to proceed in regard to prostate or some other form of cancer, this enables him or her to do so.  That was the basis on which Senator Finneran accepted the strategy that I would come back to this House and propose an amendment.  While we were tying it narrowly to prostate cancer, he was pressing the amendment.  When the Seanad decided, on a consensus basis, that this wider approach was better, Senator Finneran withdrew his amendment and said he would be happy if we introduced it along the lines proposed here.  We will go back to <Col N="1527" /> the Seanad tomorrow morning to report what we have done.</P>
    <P>There is no need to specify prostate cancer separately because the jury is still out on the effectiveness of prostate screening as a strategy, but the amendment is enabling and it allows that kind of screening to be introduced subsequently if it is deemed to be effective.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question raised by Deputy Cowen about Dr. Armstrong, I answered a parliamentary question recently pointing out that Dr. Armstrong clarified the situation to the Department. He did not mean to say that 2,000 persons were seeking radiotherapy who were not in receipt of that treatment.  He said a large number of people might prefer radiotherapy as a strategy if the service was available.  He did not suggest there was a waiting list of 2,000.</P>
    <P>Clinical decisions are being made constantly as to whether a person with cancer is given the option of surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Chemotherapy interventions are currently on the increase and the conventional wisdom that radiotherapy should be the first intervention no longer applies.  There is not a waiting list of 2,000 for radiotherapy, and Dr. Armstrong has confirmed he did not mean this number was not receiving services.  He was pointing out that more people might benefit from radiotherapy than currently were being treated if extra facilities were put in place.</P>
    <P>There is competition among oncologists, as there is among other people in our community. Some chemical oncologists argue that their interventions are superior to the interventions of others.  We are increasing the facilities around the country on an interdisciplinary and even basis, and we want interdisciplinary teams under team leaders in all the health boards to ensure best practice prevails universally and that, if there are any shortcomings, they will be addressed.</P>
    <P>I commented already on Deputy Keogh's remarks about privacy.  The breast and cervical screening programmes will be organised in a sensitive manner.  Both programmes will be optional, as will any further screening programmes for the other types of cancer should they be launched.  It is essential that population registers are put in place to ensure a high percentage uptake of the target population.  For example, in respect of breast screening, the cohort for women between the ages of 50 and 65 is 240,000, the first step of which is 120,000 or half the cohort.</P>
    <P>Once the women are screened, anonymity prevails and a name and address will only be required for reference to the National Cancer Registry in Cork if they are diagnosed with cancer. The names and addresses are necessary to call the women in, but that does not mean records will be made available in respect of their medical condition.  The issue will be treated sensitively and confidentiality will be respected.</P>
    <P>In respect of cervical screening for young girls, a point also made by Deputy Keogh, the experts <Col N="1528" /> in the area recommend that, in respect of cervical screening, the target population should be from 25 to 60 years of age.  They are the most appropriate cohort for cervical screening.  The expert group which advised me was of the same conclusion. Cervical screening is not recommended medically for teenagers but it is recommended for young women from the age of 25, whereas breast screening is recommended for women from the age of 50.  It is a different cohort of women.</P>
    <P>On the timetable for cervical screening, a national programme is planned for not later than 1999, and earlier if resources permit.  One of the main reasons for the deferred time scale is that we first need a pilot project to ensure best practice is developed and that what has bedevilled other screening programmes &mdash; high incidents of false positives and false negatives &mdash; are eliminated. Once best practice is developed, it can be transferred to wider screening programmes.  The lessons learned would be harnessed for the national programme.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board area is to be used for the site of the pilot project on cervical screening.  That is home territory for me, as Deputies are aware.  The breast screening will be expanded in the Eastern Health Board, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board areas in the first instance, and will be developed later in the west and the south.  Those are the arrangements I have put in place.</P>
    <P>The £6 million available for the cancer programme is sufficient for our needs this year, but an additional tranche of money will be required in 1997 and again in 1998.  We estimate that a total annual budget of £22 million will be necessary to bring the services to where we want them to be in accordance with the national cancer strategy. Professor Jim Fennelly of St. Vincent's was quoted as saying that the budget will be a bit tight.  He has accepted the position as chairman of the cancer forum and will be in a position to ensure that all the information crosses his desk. He will be able to advise us in the future of any inadequacy in the strategies we are pursuing or in the financing.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for a very constructive debate.  The Bill is quite short but it is extremely important.  I do not want it to intrude on the wider data protection issues.  I am aware that we should not approach issues such as this in a piecemeal fashion.  However, we have consulted the Data Protection Commissioner and he is agreeable that we should move along these lines. Lesser causes always give way to greater causes, and the great cause here is the cause of public health in terms of cancers, particularly cancers that affect women and in respect of which we know the incidence of death among women would be reduced if we had screening in place. In circumstances such as that, I thank the Data Protection Commissioner for his co-operation in agreeing that we should move forward incremenabl <Col N="1529" /> tally in this fashion to enable screening programmes to commence and proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 17 to 23, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the Minister for Health or a health board, hospital or other body or agency participating in any cancer screening (including any breast or cervical cancer screening) programme authorised by the Minister for Health, for the purposes of compiling and maintaining a record of the names, addresses and dates of birth of persons who, for public health reasons, may be invited to participate in that programme,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The issue here is the one to which we adverted on Second Stage and to which Deputy Cowen replied.  In the debate in the Seanad this enabling section was confined to breast and cervical screening. It was pointed out to me that medical advice in the future might drive policy decisions forward to where future Ministers would bring in screening programmes for other forms of cancer, and that by not taking a wider enabling mandate here future Ministers would have to come back into the House with data protection legislation if they wanted to develop further screening programmes. The amendment here is to ensure that future Ministers for Health would not be prevented from introducing any cancer screening programme because of anything in the data protection legislation.  The amendment goes on to mention specifically the ones we intend introducing, namely, breast or cervical cancer screening. Initially the issue of screening for prostate cancer was raised but research is going on now which suggests that other forms of cancer might become the subject of screening programmes even before prostate cancer.  That is why I have cast the amendment so widely.  I thank Deputy Cowen for his amendment which reflects the position in the Seanad and has given us an opportunity to explain and debate it again.</P>
      <P>Some amendments are consequential on this, for example, amendment No. 6 in my name which substitutes the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;women&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 proposes to delete the word &ldquo;NATIONAL&rdquo;.  In the course of the debate in <Col N="1530" /> the Seanad it was suggested that we may want to introduce regional screening programmes.  If, for example, the National Cancer Registry Board in its next report were to produce evidence that there was a very high incidence of a particular cancer in a particular area and that it was a matter of great concern, it might be an appropriate strategy to bring in a screening programme for one area, one county or one health board area.  I want to ensure that whoever is in the Department of Health could move straight away and introduce a screening programme without having to legislate, because we all know how long that can take.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 is a recasting of section 1(2)(a) cataloguing to whom one would report if one had appropriate data.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendments that seek to widen the scope of the legislation, which was the original intention when this debate took place in the Seanad.  For all the criticism of the Seanad, the work it does is helpful.  It was particularly helpful on this occasion.  The many Senators who have expertise in this area added significantly to the quality of the debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>I take on board that, as the Minister says, colon cancer and not prostate cancer may be next to be screened.  The reason Senator Finneran was insistent was that he wanted to indicate that screening programmes are not specific to women only but that there can be screening programmes for gender specific cancers in men and women and for cancers that affect both men and women, and that it is important to introduce screening programmes for those as well.  I take the point that funding has to be put in place and that cervical cancer screening will begin.  It is to be hoped that when advances are made the incumbent in the Department of Health will have the support of his colleagues in ensuring that preventive screening measures are allowed to proceed on a wider scale than is the case at the moment.  Similarly, I welcome the amendment which provides that screening will not be restricted to women but will apply to persons generally.</P>
      <P>As amended, section 1(2)(a) states:</P>
      <P>(2)  Nothing in the Data Protection Act, 1988, shall prevent the Minister for Health or a health board, hospital or other body or agency referred to in subsection (1)(b) from providing&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to any other such health board, hospital or other body or agency, for the purposes of that national programme...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is there a double reference to the Minister for Health?  Subsection (2)(a) states that a hospital, health board or other body will not be prevented from providing information to the Minister for Health or health board.  If the wording is in order from the point of view of drafting I accept that, but it seems there is tautology in <Col N="1531" /> that regard.  I accept the Minister's bona fides that he will facilitate the position.</P>

      <P>Given people's fear of cancer &mdash; this matter was raised by Deputy Frances Fitzgerald &mdash; is there evidence that a programme involving an overall check up, including cancer screening, would increase the participation rate, or would that involve a significant charge on the Exchequer?  Will further consideration be given to that matter given the importance of getting accurate data?  With the diagnosis of cancer at an early stage through the screening process, savings would accrue to the Exchequer.  Perhaps we are being penny wise and pound foolish in targeting 120,000 people.  Is there evidence to suggest that only 40,000 of those people would be screened, or what percentage is expected to be successfully screened?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The overall incidence of breast cancer is such that for screening to be effective, high participation rates of the target population would be essential.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes, by effective advertising.  This has been a women's health issue for some time.  For example, the ICA has for a long time organised a campaign to ensure the Government, through the Department of Health, introduced breast screening programmes.  There is great awareness among women of the prospect and the efficacy of a screening programme.  General practitioners are also well tuned in to this matter and much advice which would encourage women to take up the screening option is forthcoming.</P>
      <P>I will consider the wider issue.  In organising a screening programme one would have to be specific in what is on offer.  To disguise it as a general health check-up would not be appropriate.  Any invitation to a screening programme must highlight, for example, that it is a breast screening programme.  Having arrived for screening, it might be medically effective to have a general check up, for blood pressure, temperature and so on, but that might upset the screening programme in that there might be a problem of recording data and subsequent referral in the event that a problem arose.  I have not received advice on that matter.</P>
      <P>There is merit in the suggestion, but I would not like to commit to anything that would upset the purpose of the screening programme, which is breast screening aimed at getting very accurate results and ensuring that the programme is effective. Between 600 and 700 women die of breast cancer each year.  All those lives could not have been saved by the introduction of a screening programme, but with effective screening programmes it might be possible to reduce that number by one third.  I would not like to commit to anything that would interfere with the primary purpose of the legislation, but I will take advice on the matter and come back to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important matter, particularly for a number of women in the County Clare area, the Clare Haven House Refuge Centre, of which I am sure the Minister is aware. There has been a 50 per cent increase in the number of Clare women receiving ongoing support in this house and because of the increase in the workload there is a crisis within the refuge.  The refuge made a submission to the Mid-Western Health Board in the past ten days or so.  If the refuge is to assist the number of women and children seeking its help it needs this type of backing on a planned basis.  The staff are committed to their work and counselling has continued under difficult circumstances.  I am sure the Minister will accept that FÁS schemes are not the correct way to provide this type of counselling.  As a psychologist, I appreciate the need for the same staff to continue to provide counselling over a long period of time.  It takes time to build up trust between clients and counsellors.</P>
      <P>In its submission to the Mid-Western Health Board the refuge applied for £120,000 per annum. This money would provide a public office, a second stage house, a telephone help line, education and prevention workshops and staff training. Unfortunately, domestic violence appears to be increasing.  In its submission to the Mid-Western Health Board, Clare Haven House stated that centralising services would disadvantage women in rural and isolated areas.  No State agency currently provides the type of service provided by Clare Haven House.  It raises funds on a voluntary basis.  Last year it received £5,000 in lottery funding and £600 from leaflet sales.  I am sure the Minister will agree this is not sufficient funding to run such an essential service for the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past five years numerous reports have been issued on domestic violence.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with the Child Care Act, 1991, the Kilkenny incest report, the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, Making the Links, a study commissioned by Women's Aid, the policy document for women's refuges, the fourth report of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights on seeking a refuge from violence and the Adapt report.  Those reports outline the measures necessary for the provision of adequate services and preventive measures. Clare Haven House made six recommendations in its submission, including a recommendation that one place should be provided for every 10,000 population.  The Kilkenny incest report <Col N="1534" /> outlined that health boards should provide a free-fone service to facilitate contact and provision of information and counselling for victims of domestic violence.  That report also stated that health care workers, gardaí and staff of voluntary organisations dealing with victims of domestic violence should receive adequate training in the recognition, investigation and recording of cases of domestic violence.  Clare Haven House proposed that the health promotion unit of the Department should work in co-operation with it to produce education packages for the public, women's groups and schools to raise public awareness about violence against women in the home, to challenge stereotypes and change attitudes.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a positive response from the Minister and hope that additional funding will be provided for this worthwhile project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I am fully aware of the excellent support services provided by Clare Haven House to women and children who are the victims of domestic violence in County Clare.</P>
      <P>I understand the activities and general workload of this project have increased in recent times and that the complexity and long-term nature of some of the matters in which they are engaged has become more apparent.  In view of this, last January the Clare Haven House project submitted a comprehensive report to the Mid-Western Health Board which detailed its proposals for service developments in the area of domestic violence for County Clare.  This report has been the subject of ongoing meetings with members and officers of the Mid-Western Health Board and an updated report is being prepared.  The Clare Haven House proposals will receive detailed consideration in the context of the resources available for developments in services for victims of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board supports the activities of Clare Haven House and, in particular, wishes to support the development of public educational and preventive programmes and a direct counselling and support service in County Clare.  The board, in partnership with the Adapt refuge based in Limerick, provides a regionally based emergency accommodation and support service to victims of domestic violence and their children.  The Adapt refuge provides a mixture of accommodation including bedroom-bathroom units and a number of self-contained flats.  In an average year approximately 100 families are admitted to the refuge and, of these, approximately 12 will involve families from County Clare.  The health board is aware of the strong concerns of Clare Haven House about access to emergency accommodation and is giving serious consideration to the concept of developing a small emergency unit based in County Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a national context, we have been considering how best to improve our response to the issue of domestic violence.  The role of the health services <Col N="1535" /> has been to support refuges for women and children who have been subjected to violence in the home and to provide crisis support and counselling. However, I recognise that the provision of emergency accommodation and ancillary support services, while necessary, deals only with the symptoms of domestic violence and does not confront the issue of violence itself.  This is an extremely complex issue and one which no Government Department or agency can tackle in isolation.  The nature of the problem calls for a wide ranging inter-agency and interdisciplinary approach.</P>
    <P>In view of the multifaceted nature of domestic violence, the Government decided that responsibility at central Government level to co-ordinate action to deal with the problem of violence against women should be assigned to the office of the Tánaiste.  That office established a working group on violence against women, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, to examine existing services and supports &mdash; whether emergency, interim or long-term &mdash; for women who have been subjected to violence, to examine legislation dealing with the victims and perpetrators of domestic violence and to make recommendations on how legislation, services and supports could be improved and made more effective.  The working group is due to report to the Government in April.  I have set aside £500,000 in 1997 to implement its recommendations as far as health and personal social services are concerned. I also hope to be able to contribute £250,000 in capital moneys towards the implementations of that report's conclusions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled this matter on the Adjournment to seek a guarantee from the Minister that the junior and leaving certificate examinations will not be jeopardised by the ongoing industrial dispute in the Department of Education, particularly in the examinations branch in Athlone.  Before Christmas I received correspondence from personnel in the examinations branch in Athlone outlining their concerns about under staffing and the failure to implement the recommendations of the Price Waterhouse report on the proper organisation of the examinations system. That report was published as a result of the debacle in the arts examination in 1995.  It is disgraceful that, given the serious consequences of that debacle, the recommendations of Price Waterhouse have not been implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must outline his intentions in regard to this year's junior and leaving certificate examinations.  There has already been serious disruption of the leaving certificate applied programme. It is disappointing that assessments due to take place on 1 February for the leaving certificate applied, an excellent programme designed for students for whom the curriculum does not suit, were cancelled because of the dispute by the <Col N="1536" /> PSEU in Athlone.  Sample papers for the leaving certificate applied were sent out over a month late and students await news on the organisation and completion of their assessments prior to June.</P>
    <P>Students on the leaving certificate applied programme have been treated appallingly.  Because their number is small, they have not got the attention they deserve.  I have received a considerable amount of correspondence from schools whose students will sit the leaving certificate applied articulating their disgust and frustration that the Department and the Minister, in particular, allowed this situation to continue without intervening to ensure a resolution of the dispute. The attitude seemed to be that because only 3,000 students were involved and not the full cohort of leaving certificate students, the dispute could sit on the back burner.  The students concerned feel they were neglected and not given the attention they deserved.</P>
    <P>The dispute has been ongoing since before Christmas.  We are now approaching the end of March which is a critical time for the organisation of the junior and leaving certificate examinations. At this time additional hours are worked and staff are brought in on a short-term basis from outside the Department.  Given the considerable delays in terms of the organisation of the examinations, I am concerned we may face serious organisational difficulties this year.  Will the Minister state clearly her intention as regards resolving this dispute?</P>
    <P>Apparently there is a conflict between the Department of Education and the Department of Finance in relation to a resolution of this dispute. This Minister and her advisers told staff they made representations to the Department of Finance on additional staffing in the examinations branch but that it is turning a deaf ear to their entreaties.  I would appreciate if the Minister would elaborate on this point and outline what is happening as regards the appointment of additional staff in Athlone.  I received correspondence from the Department, some of which was anonymous, but its detail showed it was from people who were informed, stating that morale is at an all time low in the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>This Minister stands indicated on a poor industrial relations record.  The staff situation in the Department is difficult.  Staff are demoralised and believe nobody is looking after their interests. The ongoing failure to resolve the dispute with teachers about early retirement and so on under the PCW agreement is only now coming to a resolution, although management is not satisfied. This Minister seems to have a difficulty organising the industrial relations framework in her Department.  This dispute is a further manifestation of that inability to manage the Department properly, efficiently and effectively.  I plead with the Minister to guarantee that this dispute will not jeopardise the preparation and organisation of this year's State examination because students <Col N="1537" /> face enough stress and trauma without having to face uncertainty about their examinations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject out of hand the suggestion that because only a small number of students are involved, this dispute is dragging on. As far as the Department is concerned, every student counts.  The industrial action which is being taken by members of the Public Service Executive Union in my Department involves members of that union refusing to carry out work related to vacant posts and refusing to co-operate with any new work or scheme which they deem to require additional resources.</P>
      <P>Industrial action of this nature has the effect of slowing the flow of work to a greater or lesser extent.  In the Athlone offices the principal effect has been delays in the completion of administrative processes relating to the leaving certificate applied programme.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that, following discussions between my Department and the union, the union has agreed to co-operate in the arrangements for the leaving certificate applied.  Following this agreement, my Department has contacted schools by telephone to ascertain when the assessment of taskwork, postponed from February, can be rescheduled.  As a result of these consultations, schools and examiners have been informed, by letter issued on 20 March, that the taskwork will be examined in the period from 8 to 18 April.  Schools have been informed that where there is a particular difficulty with this schedule, my Department should be notified so that alternative arrangements can be made.</P>
      <P>Sample papers for the final written examinations and assignment briefs for the final practical examinations were issued to schools on 19 March. The final written examinations and assessment of the final practical examinations are scheduled to take place in June.  I am glad to say that arrangements for the junior certificate and for the established leaving certificate, including arrangements for holding oral and practical examinations, are now proceeding broadly to schedule.</P>
      <P>In relation to the oral examinations, briefing conferences for examiners have taken place and these examinations will be held, as scheduled, in the period from 14 April to 25 April.  Arrangements for holding the written examinations are also proceeding to schedule.</P>
      <P>Discussions with the Public Service Executive Union are continuing in an effort to fully resolve the dispute.  The issue is a staffing claim and is a particularly difficult one in the context of the need to balance the demands of the union against Government policy on recruitment.  The claim is also being considered in circumstances where the resources required for running the examinations are currently the subject of a work survey which is nearing completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to comment with care and sensitivity on a matter which is the subject of ongoing discussions.  I welcome the spirit <Col N="1538" /> which moved the union to resume co-operation with the arrangements for the leaving certificate applied.  I am confident an accommodation will shortly be arrived at which will be satisfactory to both sides and will be in the best interests of candidates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Research Scientists Association and the universities have recently been informed of a proposal by the Higher Education Authority to cut the allocation it provides to the universities for research equipment.  I understand this will take place in two phases. There will be a 50 per cent cut in the allocation for continuing capital costs and the large capital equipment grant will be eliminated.  The combined effect will be an overall cut of 60 per cent. That is ironic since the report of the Science. Technology and Innovation Advisory Council and the HEA's CIRCA report on the management of research in the universities draw attention to the lack of adequate modern research equipment in the universities.</P>
      <P>The CIRCA report states that such neglect is compromising the colleges' ability to have adequately prepared graduates.  The Minister will agree that access to research equipment is essential for improved training for graduates, employment prospects, innovation links with industry, particularly the SMEs, and for improved access to a global knowledge base as producers and consumers. STIAC recommended an emergency reequipment budget to bring our national stock up to date.  In the absence of this, and with the Higher Education Authority cuts, we have no hope of maintaining the quality of graduates.</P>
      <P>The chemistry department in UCC, for example, receives £100,000 per annum.  If there is a 60 per cent cut, it will only receive £40,000.  It has entered into contracts, whether leasing equipment or whatever, and will not be able to meet these demands.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the recent major focus on the skills shortage in the software, electronics and pharmaceutical industries.  One motivating factor for innovation and economic activity is the money invested in research and development. Germany is typical in that it recognises research and development as the most significant factor in industrial development which allows a proper response to diversification within industry.  If graduates apply themselves to research and development, they can respond to market forces more quickly than before and changes in emphasis and consumer requirements can also get an immediate response.  It makes no sense to spend vast amounts of money training people to meet industry requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently debated with the Minister for Education in this House on her failure to integrate a policy between education, industry, enterprise and employment.  Four years ago, the IDA stated we would by now, be short of graduates in the <Col N="1539" /> computing and pharmaceutical areas but there was no integration of policy.  Ploughing in money for quick retraining of people is a stop-gap effort. It seems the Higher Education Authority is suggesting it will cut the capital budget for research and development which everyone accepts as vital to the well-being of future economic growth.  The Minister of State should bring whatever influence he has to bear on the Higher Education Authority in the best interests of this country and graduates coming out of universities.  It is important the quality of those graduates continues on the highest possible plane because they are now recognised internationally as being among the best.  It is important the standard be maintained.  The money needed for investment in capital equipment towards research and development is minimal in terms of the results and benefits which would accrue to the economic well-being of industry.</P>

      <P>The unique success of the Irish economy has posed these challenges and they will be met.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position regarding the allocation to universities for research equipment. Like the Deputy, I received many letters from different institutions in recent days.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-9, £10 million is being provided to replace and enhance research and teaching equipment in the universities.  This provision is part of a £120 million capital investment programme designed primarily for the purpose of supporting the third level sector, particularly in areas of research and teaching related to economic growth and job creation.  Of this amount £46.5 million has been set aside for capital projects in the Higher Education Authority sector.  The dedicated provision of £10 million for equipment within the European Regional Development Fund programme has already been complemented by a further £2 million of Exchequer funds bringing the provision for equipment for the Higher Education Authority sector to £12 million over the period of the plan. In addition, the £46.5 million programme includes elements of funding for new equipment.  A further £60 million capital investment programme comprising £30 million from the private sector with matching funds from the Exchequer was approved by the Minister for Education in 1995. This programme provides for constructing and equipping new facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> There is no question of a reduction in the allocation for capital equipment under these programmes. Of the £12 million for replacement capital, £6 million has already been allocated to universities through funding provided to the Higher Education Authority in the three years 1994, 1995 and 1996.  There is a commitment to providing the balance of £6 million over the period of the plan.  While the average annual amount to be allocated is £2 million, the actual amount in any one year varies depending on building expenditure commitment in that year.  For example, the original allocation for capital equipment in 1995 was £2 million, which was subsequently increased to £4 million when the position regarding building commitments became clearer.  On the other hand, all available capital was devoted to building works in 1996.  In 1997, £1 million was targeted for replacement equipment in the £15.25 million capital allocation made to the HEA.  In the normal way, this figure will be kept under review during the year and, in light of building commitments and depending on progress, it may be increased as appropriate within the framework of the overall capital allocation of £76.5 million for the European Regional Development Fund and additional numbers programmes.</P>
    <P>There is an absolute commitment to allocating sufficient funds to the Higher Education Authority over the period of the national plan to enable the balance of £6 million for replacement equipment to be paid to the universities.  The Department of Education is considering introducing a number of further initiatives which will contribute to the funding of new equipment for the university sector to ensure its effectiveness in meeting the recommendations of the Science Technology and Innovation Advisory Council and the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education.</P>

      <P>This matter is important for the Nire Valley sheep farmers who see themselves as forgotten, despite the cost of resolving this problem being small in terms of the budget of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. The problem is the result of a severe blizzard which occurred in the Nire Valley area in the Comeragh Mountains in March 1996 when 21 sheep farmers suffered a loss of 1,500 sheep in snow drifts.  I previously asked in a parliamentary question that a five year scheme be implemented to allow ewe numbers to be increased to levels they were at before the disaster and called on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to grant full payment to the farmers involved for five years on existing quota numbers to protect <Col N="1541" /> their livelihoods while they rebuilt their flocks. However, the Minister hid behind EU regulations and refused to pay the compensation as requested.  I pointed out at the time that the cost to the Exchequer would be minimal and I am convinced that, because of the bizarre nature of this incident, a precedent would not be set although an earlier precedent was set for it.</P>
      <P>I am certain that, if this group were larger and more vociferous, action would have been taken by now.  They live close to Clonmel, the inhabitants of which were compensated when the town was flooded.  The Government gave in because the town was up in arms but not in this case because only a small number of people is involved.  It is felt in Government circles that these few people trying to make a living on the side of a mountain do not matter.  One of the farmers has already been forced to sell and emigrate as he could no longer wait for assistance. The attitude of the Minister and the Department is shameful and typical of this Government which obviously has no interest in the weaker sections of our society.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated he could not get any assistance from Europe.  However, in 1982 £30 per ewe compensation was paid after a big snowfall and £690,000 was allocated to the Department at that time to deal with the problem.  In 1978 interest free loans were given to farmers who suffered losses and in both those cases verification was not needed in terms of herd numbers, etc.  In this case the herd numbers could be easily identified.</P>
      <P>It will take these farmers three to four years to build up their herds and it must be remembered they cannot simply buy ewes as ewes must be bred locally to survive on the mountain.  I do not know if the Minister of State is aware that the type of sheep most farmers keep would not survive on the side of a mountain.  It is not simply a matter of going to the mart to replace the stock that have been lost.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will not trot out the <i>force majeure</i> provisions or remind me that ewe and headage premiums were paid in 1996.  I know all that.  I am asking him to treat these sheep farmers of the Nire Valley fairly to allow them to rebuild their livelihoods and provide for their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to contribute in support of the case being made by my colleague, Deputy Kenneally, for 21 sheep farmers in the Nire Valley who have suffered a natural disaster resulting in the loss of a good deal of their sheep herds and who are looking for some remedy and support from the Government. There is a precedent for this in agriculture.  A few years ago farmers in Donegal suffered potato loss, the horticulture industry also suffered a loss and provision was made to support them in those desperate circumstances.  There is a desperate need to support these 21 farmers who have suffered the loss of 1,500 sheep.  I make a plea in <Col N="1542" /> support of Deputy Kenneally to the Minister of State to come up with a formula to help these sheep farmers.  He need not resort to EU regulations. These mountain sheep farmers who are doing their best to make a living under very difficult and inclement conditions have suffered a natural disaster.  If a caring Government is about anything, it is about intervening in a case such as this to bail out these farmers and to come up with a formula to support and tide them over until such time as they can build up their stocks. Rather than doing that, it was pernicious of the Government this year to cut the ewe premium given to those mountain farmers by £6.60 per head.  I look forward to a positive reply in support of these farmers from the Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should know about the ewe premium as he was involved in calculating it.  The Department and the Minister noted, with concern, the blizzard conditions and heavy snowfalls in the area of the Comeragh Mountains and in the Nire Valley in County Waterford on 12, 13 and 14 March 1996. Many sheep producers suffered large scale losses and, as a consequence, were faced with a difficult financial situation in 1996 and in the current year. On learning of this, the Minister immediately instructed officials from his Department to visit the area to carry out an assessment of the damage done, with a view to putting in motion some means of providing assistance to these producers. A report indicated that as a result of this freak storm 22 sheep producers lost 1,580 sheep out of a total of 7,876 ewes which had been applied for under the ewe premium scheme.  This included nine producers losing more than 20 per cent and the three most severely hit losing approximately 45 per cent of their breeding stock.</P>
      <P>There is always a great difficulty regarding where the State can and should step in when individuals have been hit by an unexpected disaster. Since public funds do not draw from an unlimited purse, it is not possible to provide financial support in all cases of hardship even where the case, on the face of it may be very deserving.  By and large assistance has to be confined to situations of large-scale loss or disaster on a national scale or to a situation which would not be adequately covered by a private insurance policy.  The Minister immediately set about providing some means of minimising the hardship of the producers in this area recognising that they had suffered not only the loss of valuable livestock but of income earning potential in 1996 and 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under EU Regulations an annual premium is paid for ewes subject to an individual limit or quota provided certain conditions are met. Among those conditions is the requirement that flocks are maintained by the owner for a specific retention period, and in 1996 the retention period was 9 January 1996 to 18 April 1996.  The March snowstorm occurred during this retention period. In normal circumstances EU Regulations do not <Col N="1543" /> permit the payment of ewe premiums if the animals have not been kept or died on the holding during the period specified.  The Minister secured the agreement of the EU Commission to ensure that <i>force majeure</i> conditions can be applied in this case, thus allowing the full ewe premium and headage payment to be paid in 1996 for the sheep lost in this disaster.  The premium, rural world premium and headage together were worth £30.50.</P>
    <P>EU Regulations also allow that in certain circumstances producers who may be unable to replace fully lost stock will not suffer loss of their sheep quotas.  Last year the Minister directed that a provision would be made exempting Nire Valley sheep farmers affected by this disaster from the requirement to use 70 per cent of their quota in 1996 and 1997 so that none of the quota rights was forfeited as a result of their misfortune. These arrangements allow a breathing space in which a breeding programme for replacements can be put in place.</P>
    <P>In the interests of competitiveness EU Regulations exert a very restrictive influence so that member states are precluded from subsidising their own productive sectors at the expense of other areas in the Community.  There have been requests for assistance for those affected by this snowstorm from a special disaster fund.  However, the fund available within the EU is specially for humanitarian aid or a national emergency, and unfortunately the sheep losses in 1996 on the Comeragh Mountains do not fall into either of these two categories.</P>
    <P>In the case of the losses suffered by the sheep farmers in the Nire Valley last year their situation <Col N="1544" /> has already received considerable sympathetic support.  As a result of the actions of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry each producer received a payment of £30.50 in respect of each ewe lost, where eligibility for that payment would otherwise have lapsed.  In addition, producers now have a two year period to build up their flocks to the original size without loss of quota. The Minister has done all in his power within the limits of available resources to assist this group of producers by ensuring full premium and headage payments in 1996 and allowing for an exemption by the sheep farmers affected from the usage clause of the quota regulations.  It is not possible under EU rules to continue payment of the premium, headage or rural world premium for sheep which died in 1996 and if a further period is necessary to breed replacements the national quota group will look sympathetically at any request for restoration of quota rights which may have been lost.</P>
    <P>A number of factors make the losses suffered in the Nire Valley last year unique.  The sudden blizzard in mid-March, at a time of otherwise seasonal weather conditions, was unexpected.  The fact that replacement ewes have to be bred locally imposes an additional difficulty for the producers who are trying to get back into full production. In the context of these unusual circumstances an approach has been made to the Department of Finance seeking a once-off compensation package to offset the hardship which has been suffered. However, this approach has to be seen in the context of many demands on the limited funds available for hardship cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> It is my intention that Ireland should comply fully with EU Council Directive 93/43/EEC on the hygiene of foodstuffs.  Currently the statutory requirements in Ireland in relation to food hygiene and food premises are set out in Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950-1989, which consist of a number of statutory instruments.  Work is at an advanced stage to revoke this entire existing code and to replace it with a single statutory instrument which will also transpose Directive 93/43/EEC.  This has involved extensive consultation with both the food industry and the enforcement agencies and the preparation of a new set of regulations is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>The Directive, when transposed, will be enforced by environmental health officers in the health boards.  As the Deputy is aware, EHOs who are members of IMPACT are engaged in a limited form of industrial action which entails non-co-operation with the implementation of any legislation which has been enacted since 1981. Consequently to revoke and replace the current regulations while the dispute is in progress could result in a situation where no regulations were being enforced.</P>
      <P>Pending its transposition into Irish law, my Department has been actively promoting the principles and practices contained in Directive 93/43/EEC.  A central element of the directive is the promotion of the system of HACCP, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points, whereby food business operators shall identify any step in their activities which is critical to ensuring food safety and ensure that adequate safety procedures are identified, implemented, maintained and reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding has been provided by my Department to health boards to enable enforcement officials undertake training in HACCP and almost all officials at local level have now been given formal training.  The National Food Centre is providing training courses for industry to enable businesses to install HACCP systems.  The National Hygiene Partnership, with which the Department of Health is associated, has developed a number of initiatives in food hygiene training for those employed in industry.  The course which it offers <Col N="1547" /> is supported by my Department and is based around the Directive.</P>
    <P>Directive 93/43/EEC also requires the member states to encourage the development of guides to good hygiene practice which may be used voluntarily by food businesses as a guide to compliance with the provisions of the directive.  My Department has been very active in encouraging industry to become involved in the preparation of guides to good hygiene practice which are specific to different sectors of the food industry and has also sought the services of the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  To date three guides have been completed and two more should be available in 1997.  They are: National Standards Authority of Ireland Irish Standard I.S. 340: 1994-Hygiene in the Catering Sector, National Standards Authority of Ireland; Guide to Good Hygiene Practice for the Irish Beverage Industry, Irish Business and Employers Confederation, Confederation House, 84-86 Lower Baggot Street, Dublin 2; Guide to good hygiene practice for the food processing industry in accordance with the Council Directive 93/43/EEC on the Hygiene of Foodstuffs, National Standards Authority of Ireland, 1996; Guide to good hygiene practice in the Retail/Wholesale Sector, National Standards Authority of Ireland, for publication in 1997; and Hygiene for Food Producer Working on a Domestic Scale in or from their home, National Standards Authority of Ireland, for publication in 1997.  Preparations have also been made to develop a guide for Irish County Markets, an organisation of about 75 weekly markets with a membership of 1,500 persons.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that any delay in fully implementing Directive 43/93/EEC will not leave the public at risk or allow food business unrestricted operation as the food hygiene regulations provide wide-ranging powers to enforcement agencies and their main provisions date from before 1981.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I assume the Deputy is referring to the requirements laid down in the Medical Council's rules in relation to full registration for the holders of medical qualifications from countries outside the European Union who are not otherwise entitled to full registration.  As the Deputy will know, such doctors are firstly required to hold temporary registration with the Medical Council for a specified period.  It should be understood that the category of temporary registration primarily exists to facilitate overseas doctors who <Col N="1548" /> wish to pursue postgraduate training in this country. The extent of temporary registration is limited by statute to a total of five years.  There is no automatic entitlement to progress from temporary registration to full registration.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that one of the primary functions of the Medical Council is the protection of the public from, among other things, inadequately educated or poorly trained doctors. The council must exercise particular vigilance in granting full registration to overseas doctors who thereby acquire the same rights and status as the graduates of Irish medical schools.  I am satisfied that this is a matter appropriate to the Medical Council within the existing statutory framework.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 99 together.  IMPACT, on behalf of environmental health officers, withdrew from negotiations which were being pursued under Clause 2 (iii) &mdash; Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and pursued industrial action in the form of a&ldquo;work-to-rule&rdquo; with effect from 15 January 1996.</P>
      <P>Efforts to resolve the impasse continued on an informal basis culminating in a formal meeting under the auspices of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board on 25 June 1996.  On Wednesday, 26 June 1996 I met with IMPACT and a delegation of environmental health officers to explore whether or not the provision of the joint Government/ICTU statement of 15 May 1996 could usefully be applied to resolving the current impasse in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>On 5 July 1996, with the assistance of a facilitator from the Labour Relations Commission, an informal meeting took place between management and the union.  The meeting was of considerable assistance to both sides and as a result negotiations continued up until quite recently when IMPACT took the decision to escalate the work-to-rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following renewed contact between both sides the Health Services Employers' Agency and IMPACT met this morning with a view to reopening discussions.  As a result the threatened escalation in the work-to-rule will not now take <Col N="1549" /> place.  Despite the difficult and protracted nature of this dispute, I am still hopeful that a satisfactory resolution can be achieved through established procedures in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have already informed the House that following the introduction of HIV donor screening test by the Blood Transfusion Service Board in October 1985, no lookback was undertaken between 1985 and 1989 in respect of earlier donations made by donors who were now screening positive for HIV.  A lookback procedure was in place from 1989 onwards for newly-presenting donors.  As the House will be aware the BTSB has intensified its HIV lookback to trace all recipients of potentially HIV-infected blood issues.</P>
      <P>Because there can be no guarantee that all or indeed any of the untraced issues will ever be traced, and also because of the possibility that some donors who were HIV positive prior to the introduction of HIV donor screening in October 1985 did not donate after October 1985 and cannot, therefore, be identified, I decided to introduce an optional HIV testing programme to offer screening to blood transfusion and blood product recipients who may be at risk, however small that risk might be.</P>
      <P>Before commencing such a programme it is absolutely essential that the risk, if any, involved for recipients must be determined, as far as possible, to enable each recipient to make a fully informed decision, in consultation with his or her general practitioner in relation to availing of screening.  The element of risk for recipients will vary according to the year in which they received the transfusion or blood product, and according to the particular product they received.  I am hopeful that the preparations for the HIV testing programme, which are well advanced, will be completed in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the BTSB targeted lookback is continuing and the following is the up to date position as of today.  A total of 25 blood donors have tested positive for HIV since screening was introduced in 1985.  Eight of those were first time donors and accordingly, no risk of HIV transmission to recipients was involved.  In the case of ten of the remaining 17 donors, recipients of potentially infected issues were traced and none of the recipients tested positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tracing of recipients of the issues from the remaining seven donors has been rendered very difficult by the absence of the BTSB despatch records for the period prior to 1986.  Of the 33 issues from those seven donors 15 were donated <Col N="1550" /> prior to 1981 and are not regarded as a potential source of infection.  The residual problem relates to tracing the recipients of the balance of the 18 issues derived from the potentially infected blood donations made prior to 1985.  Seven of the issues have been traced leaving 11 issues of concern remaining.</P>

    <P>Considerable progress has been made nationally in reducing waiting lists for surgery in the target specialties, and one of the largest reductions has been in the Western Health Board area.  In December 1995, there were 2,365 people on waiting lists for hospital treatment in the WHB area. By December 1996, this figure had fallen by 27 per cent to 1,721.  As the Deputy is aware, demand for acute hospital services in the west is mainly concentrated at University College Hospital, where the bulk of the reduction has occurred.  In June 1996, 1,707 people were on that hospital's in patient waiting list and by December 1996 this figure was reduced to 1,172.  This represents significant progress in the reduction of waiting lists and demonstrates my concern to ensure that the necessary resources are provided to improve waiting times for treatment in the west.</P>
    <P>I am happy to assure the Deputy that special measures to reduce waiting lists will continue in 1997.  The provision of special funding to reduce waiting times continues to be a priority for the Government and £4 million has been provided in the budget to continue progress in this area.  This provision will bring to £8 million the total funding available in 1997 to address the problem of long waiting times for elective surgery.  The funding provided in 1997 brings to £58 million the total resources committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists since the current initiative commenced. My Department will be holding detailed <Col N="1551" /> discussions with health agencies in the coming weeks on the allocation of the 1997 funding.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Last November, I published a national cancer strategy as a wide-ranging statement of policy on the future development and improvement of cancer services in Ireland.  The strategy is aimed at reorganising cancer treatment services, devoting resources to screening and early detection programmes of proven value, developing specialist palliative care and facilitating a more co-ordinated approach to cancer research.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, I announced a detailed action plan to fund and implement the cancer initiatives which included a breakdown by region of the different developments which will come on stream in 1997.  In relation to the North-Eastern Health Board, I was pleased to announce a range of developments which will significantly enhance cancer diagnostic and treatment services in the region.  Specifically, these improvements include:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The appointment of a regional director for cancer services, Dr. Deborah Condell, who will have responsibility for organising and auditing the region's cancer services on a continuing basis.</P>
      <P>Funding has been approved to enable the board to provide additional medical oncology services on an interim basis pending the appointment of a new medical oncologist for the region.</P>
      <P>A post of consultant haematologist will also be approved and details of this post will be agreed in tandem with the appointment of the new medical oncologist.</P>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board will also form part of phase I of the screening programme for breast cancer.  In addition, the chairperson of the steering group for the breast screening programme is the programme manager for hospital services in the North-Eastern Health Board area, Dr. Sheelah Ryan.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the plans contained in the national cancer strategy will deliver on the promise I made on taking office to significantly improve the co-ordination and delivery of cancer services.</P>

      <P>In the initial phase of the scheme, which commenced on 1 November 1994, emergency dental treatment was made available to all adults.  Routine dental treatment and priority full denture treatment was made available to persons 65 years of age or older.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the report,&ldquo;The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly&rdquo; stressed the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, and their families.  The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly.  Additional funding has been made available to the health services to implement key recommendations of the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families.  The investment by health boards in additional community nursing, day care, respite services and nursing home places has increased the support available to sufferers of Alzheimer's disease and their carers.  Considerable progress is being made in improving health and welfare services for the elderly and their carers, including the development of specialist assessment and community support services for people suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease.</P>
      <P>Prior to the publication of &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo;, many elderly people suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease were inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals.  &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo; emphasised the need for separate small units for the disturbed elderly with dementia.  Examples of the specialist facilities provided to date are the establishment of units for the elderly mentally infirm at Sacred Heart Hospital, Castlebar, St. Camillus' Hospital, Limerick and St. Columba's Hospital, Thomastown.  Facilities for the elderly mentally infirm are provided by the Eastern Health Board in Tivoli Road, Dún Laoghaire and Clonskeagh Hospital.  The board also provides services in its new long-stay unit for the elderly on the Navan Road and it is board policy that all new long-stay units for the elderly will provide such services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has regular contact with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in relation to matters of concern to the society, including the development of services.  The society receives <Col N="1554" /> £80,000 annually from my Department in recognition of the contribution it is making to the support of people with dementia and their families. In addition, funds have been provided in 1997 to enable a dementia service information and development centre to be established at St. James's Hospital in association with the Mercer's Institute for Research on Ageing at Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which commenced on 1 September 1993 widens the options available to those caring for dependent relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.  Just under £17 million has been made available this year to fund subventions under the Act.</P>
    <P>It will be clear, therefore, that health boards are giving priority to the development of services for persons with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, as well as support services for their families.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have accepted the need for a national communicable disease surveillance unit to provide a comprehensive broad based approach to the prevention of disease.  The Department of Health is currently considering the organisational and structural issues involved in conjunction with the relevant agencies and professional interests. In deciding on the organisational and structural issues involved, however, it will be essential to take account of developments in relation to a number of other bodies, all of which will have to have linkages of one type or another with the unit, and all of which are in either a development stage or a review stage at present.  These bodies include the Institute of Public Health, the Office for Health Gain, the Food Safety Board and the Virus Reference Laboratory.  The intention therefore is to work on the detailed arrangements for the unit, in conjunction with the ongoing work on these bodies during the coming year, with a view to its establishment in 1998.</P>
      <P>I must, however, point out that health boards are statutorily responsible for the control and prevention of infectious diseases and they will continue to carry out this function when the national communicable disease surveillance unit has been established.  Serious infectious diseases such as meningitis are reported to and monitored by the health boards at regional level and the Department of Health at national level.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I assure the Deputy that I am committed to the publication of the annual report of the inspector of mental hospitals as soon as possible after the inspections of individual facilities are completed and reports are compiled.  The most recent published report, that for the year ending 31 December 1995, was the eighth report of the inspector to be published since his appointment in 1987 and the fourth such report which I have published since taking office.  The inspector's report for 1996 will be published later this year.</P>
      <P>The inspector carries out in-depth inspections of all public and private hospitals and units in the country, including the Central Mental Hospital. Public psychiatric hospitals and units are inspected annually while private hospitals and the Central Mental Hospital are inspected twice yearly.</P>
      <P>Detailed reports on each inspection, with general comments and recommendations for improvements in services, are prepared by the inspector.  These reports are forwarded to the chief executive officer of the responsible health board or voluntary hospital, in respect of public psychiatric facilities and to the person in charge of each private facility.  In each case a response to the comments made by the inspector and on his recommendations for improvements in services is requested.  The reports of individual inspections are then summarised to form the inspector's annual report.  It will be clear, therefore, that the relevant service providers are made aware of the inspector's findings before the annual report is published.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there has been in the past a time lapse between the time of the inspector's reports of individual inspections and the publication of his annual report.  I am satisfied however, that this area has been significantly improved in recent years.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): As I have stated previously my Department has included in the Western Health Board's provision for funding an additional revenue allocation of £500,000 in respect of the Galway Hospice Foundation.  The figure is additional to the sum of £100,000 already allocated in 1996, giving a total provision of £600,000.</P>
      <P>The provision of this additional funding was subject to the Western Health Board and the hospice foundation reaching an acceptable service agreement.  In this regard, my Department has been informed by the health board that it has reached the basis of an agreement with the foundation whereby an in-patient service can be provided from 1 May 1997.</P>
      <P>The provision of additional funding for the hospice foundation will fall to be considered in the context of my Department's Estimates campaign for 1998, following a review of the Western Health Board's arrangement with the hospice foundation later in the year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The National Social Work Qualifications Board was established as a corporate body on 27 February 1997 and replaced the National Validation Body on Social Work Qualifications which was dissolved on that date.</P>
      <P>The newly-established board has a number of functions relating to overseeing standards in social work training and education and the assessing of qualifications obtained outside of the State.  The board will also grant the National Qualification in Social Work (NQSW) to those who have successfully completed recognised courses.  The NQSW will replace the CQSW which was traditionally awarded by the UK Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work until its withdrawal from Ireland in 1993.</P>
      <P>The NQSW is now the benchmark entry qualification for employment in the public health service but I would like to avail of this opportunity to stress the fact that qualifications pertaining to social work posts in such areas as the probation and welfare service, local authorities etc. remain a matter for decision by the relevant Government Department, i.e. the Department of Justice and the Department of the Environment respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1558" /> I requested the former National Validation Body on Social Work Qualifications and Training to examine the issue of B.Soc.Sc. graduates in the public health service and to make recommendations to me.  The body reported on 20 November 1996 and, following examination by my Department of the advice received, it was decided that additional detail was required on a number of issues.</P>
    <P>The newly-established National Social Work Qualifications Board will supply the information already requested in due course.  Therefore, I am not in a position to make any further comment at present other than to say that as the board is not a registration body the question of disqualifying social workers without CQSW qualifications currently employed in the health service will not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As I have previously mentioned in the House the extent and nature of the problem of homeless children varies between health boards and between community care areas.  It is recognised across the health boards that an integrated range of measures is necessary in order to deal with the problem including early childhood intervention to prevent children at risk from becoming homeless, greater provision of services for families and young people in the community, the provision of suitable and varied accommodation and back-up services for the young homeless and accommodation and support services for children leaving care.</P>
      <P>In this regard, health boards are at present undertaking a series of initiatives to address the problem locally and the responses are drawn up with due regard to the particular nature of the problem in the area.  The problem is most acute in the Eastern Health Board region.  Services introduced by the board to tackle the problem include an emergency short-term residential unit for 12 to 18 year old homeless children opened early in 1996.</P>
      <P>Supported lodgings are being developed in all community care areas.  There are now 87 approved supported lodging places for adolescents who are out of home.  This initiative helps to maintain young people in their area of home origin.  The lodgings provide an element of independence to young people but provide support at the same time.  This very successful new scheme supported a total of 145 young people in 1996 and provided a total of 17,733 bed nights.  A number of hostels provide care for young people who are out of home.  An additional adolescent residential unit, under the management of the crisis intervention service is at an advanced stage of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> The board has assigned additional social workers to its out of hours service.  In addition a number of out of hours foster parents are currently being recruited and assessed.  They will be available throughout the night to the out of hours service where young people require emergency placement.  The board also operates a day project which offers care, welfare and recreation support to approximately ten young people who are considered to be at risk during day time.</P>
    <P>An emergency carers project is also in operation in the region.  During 1996, 20 foster families were approved specifically for short-term/emergency placements.  It is planned to continue to expand the pool of out of hours foster homes in addition to emergency cover placements and supported lodgings.</P>
    <P>Initiatives introduced in other health boards to meet the needs of the young homeless include: crisis, short and medium term accommodation, supported lodgings and supervised accommodation; youth projects and day projects for children who would otherwise be roaming the streets; social work services, child care and family support services all aimed at preventing young people becoming homeless.  Since 1993 over £40 million has been provided to develop services under the Child Care Act, 1991.  The further development of services to meet the needs of the young homeless will continue to be a priority in the context of child care service developments for 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 46 together.  First, I am sure that Deputies will join me in expressing our condolences to the families and friends of the deceased.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, it has been the policy of successive Governments to restructure the psychiatric services through the development of services located in the community as an alternative to institution-based care.  This policy has been widely accepted as providing a much improved quality of life for persons who were former in-patients of psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>The community based facilities include community residences which offer high, medium and low levels of support.  A flexible approach to each patient is required and structures and staff support levels vary relative to each patient's needs.</P>
      <P>Those who have recovered from their illness and who are capable of independent living with minimum support are accommodated in low-support residences.  This type of facility has mimimum staffing levels and is supervised by members of a multi-disciplinary team working in community settings.  The security facilities provided in low-support residences would be similar to those provided in the typical family home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Patients accommodated in medium-support residences, who have recovered from their illness but who may have residual problems, have variable <Col N="1562" /> levels of staff support depending on each patient's needs while high-support residences have 24 hour cover at all times.  All community residences are fully integrated with other components of the services, such as day facilities, sheltered workshops and other support facilities, all of which enable patients to enjoy normal community living.</P>
    <P>The level of cover, support and security required in all cases is constantly reviewed by the management of each service.  In addition all community facilities are inspected by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals during his inspections of local psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>The recent tragic incident referred to by the Deputies is, of course, a matter of deep concern to me, as Minister for Health.  The women concerned were former in-patients of the Eastern Health Board's mental health service and were, at the time of their death, living independent lives in a low support residence.  The incident is the subject of Garda investigation and the Eastern Health Board and my Department, through the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, are keeping in close touch with the situation.  Notwithstanding the tragic nature of the incident, it is extremely important to ensure that the policy of rehabilitating patients to independent living continues.  I am satisfied that, with the regular review of the health and safety of clients, the management of the psychiatric services are taking the measures necessary to enable former residents of psychiatric hospitals to live in reasonable comfort and security, like their fellow citizens, in the community. However, should it emerge that any additional security measures are required following a review of this particular tragedy, these will, of course, be acted upon.</P>

The report of the study, which is chaired by Professor Michael Murphy, Professor of Clinical Pharmacology, University College Cork, and cost £75,000, is currently being finalised and I expect to have this within the next few weeks.  I am confident that the report of this study will assist the Department in its evaluation of the impact of the scheme in the encouragement of rational, safe and cost-effective prescribing for patients and in the investment of resources for the improvement of patient services within general practice.  No decision has been taken in relation to the publication of the report.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the IDT scheme has been a success.  Most doctors are now making a genuine effort to achieve more rational and cost-effective prescribing.  Prior to the introduction of the scheme, the average annual rise in the general medical services drug costs was much greater than that occurring since its introduction.  The rise in the cost of medicines in the GMS has decreased from an annual average of 10 per cent prior to the inception of the scheme to an annual average rise of 5.6 per cent in the past three years. This containment in costs is in no small way directly related to the impact of the IDT scheme and the achievement of more effective prescribing by doctors.  Arising from savings made under the scheme, significant resources have been freed up for the development of general practice which, in turn, has resulted in a more comprehensive and better quality service for patients.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health,</askee>
      <Quest>further to his reply to Question No. 74 of 13 February 1997, the reason there are 200 persons attending one pharmacy for methadone and only one attending pharmacy number five; and if this has changed, with eight pharmacies dispensing methadone in postal district eight.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4810/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Methadone can be prescribed under the general medical services scheme for medical card holders or on a private prescription for those attending a general practitioner on a private basis and information is only available on the methadone dispensed through the general medical services scheme.  At present, once methadone is prescribed by a registered general practitioner the patient holding that prescription may go to any pharmacist he or she pleases in order to have the prescription dispensed.  In the past methadone has been available only through a small number of pharmacies, and for that reason these pharmacies have built up a large client group.  The pharmacy referred to by the Deputy with a large client group is one such pharmacy.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is actively recruiting other pharmacists to become involved in dispensing, but while it has obtained the goodwill of these pharmacists, it cannot at present dictate that drug misusers use any specific premises.  The pharmacy referred to by the Deputy does not exclusively provide a methadone service for the Eastern Health Board, rather it dispenses methadone as it would any other medication on foot of a properly written doctor's prescription.  At present any general practitioner can prescribe methadone and this methadone can be dispensed at any retail pharmacist.</P>
      <P>My Department has requested the Eastern Health Board makes a special effort to encourage pharmacists other than the one singled out with 200 clients to dispense to drug misusers. However, the system is still dependent on clients opting to use other pharmacists.  To date there has not been any significant increase in the number of clients going to other pharmacies in the area.</P>
      <P>It is the board's policy to encourage drug users to use the nearest chemist to where they live rather than transferring to another area.  Pharmacists who are becoming involved in dispensing need reassurance that dispensing of methadone to drug misusers will not disrupt the rest of their business.  They commence on a small scale dealing with one or two clients and if everything is satisfactory, they will extend that service to others. Indeed, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland in its policy document of October 1996 recommended that all pharmacists should be encouraged to dispense methadone for patients.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has met with local public representatives to discuss how treatment facilities can be extended in the area.  It intends to meet this group again in the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review is currently under way to examine the role of general practitioners and pharmacists in the provision of services for drug misusers.  The review will examine present practice in relation to the prescribing and dispensing of methadone and will advise on how the present system can be <Col N="1565" /> expanded, with the appropriate controls, to encourage more doctors and pharmacists to become involved in the treatment of drug misusers. The Eastern Health Board and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland are both represented on this committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Since the publication of the report of the task force on the travelling community, the health boards have taken a number of initiatives in relation to travellers' health.  These include the establishment of a pilot project by the Eastern Health Board in the training of travellers for jobs in primary health care, the appointment of an officer by the Western Health Board to co-ordinate health services for travellers and the setting up by the North-Eastern Health Board of a broadly based advisory committee on travellers' health.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have, in consultation with the health boards, been working on a draft policy statement on travellers' health.  The policy statement will set out a number of specific steps to be taken to increase the level of uptake of health services by the travelling community.</P>
      <P>I propose to take steps in the immediate future to set up the traveller health advisory committee recommended by the task force.  This will comprise officials of my Department, representatives of the health boards, travellers and representatives of traveller organisations.  The first function of this committee will be to consider the draft policy statement.  I expect to be in a position to publish this document within the next few months.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the policy statement a traveller health unit as recommended by the task force will be established in each health board. This will bring together travellers, health service providers and other relevant statutory bodies, such as local authorities, in order to identify developments most likely to achieve greater takeup of health services by the travelling community. The question of mobile clinics will be considered in this context.  Another crucial development which I will be pursuing will be the replication in all health boards of two pilot projects in the Eastern Health Board involving the training of travellers to participate in the delivery of health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Due to problems with definition, the exact prevalence of autism in Ireland is still open to debate.  Depending on the diagnostic criteria <Col N="1567" /> being applied, up to five per 10,000 children manifest autism to a marked degree.  A greater number may show lesser symptoms and it has been suggested that there is an &ldquo;autistic continuum&rdquo; which stretches from those severely affected to those with only a mild disability.</P>
      <P>My Department published a policy document on services to persons with autism in 1994.  I am arranging for a copy of the policy document to be sent to the Deputy under separate cover.  As part of the implementation of the recommendations contained in that document, the health boards have been obtaining information on the needs of persons with autism in their regions and, in particular, on those who require or will require specialist services.</P>
      <P>The majority of persons with autism are in receipt of services within the mental handicap services including multi-disciplinary support services, residential, respite and day services and home support services.  However, a minority do require specialised facilities.  Specific services for persons with autism are available in the Eastern, North-Eastern, Southern and Western Health Boards which provide between 128 and 130 residential places overall.  Planning for the development of further specialist facilities is being included by the health boards in their overall consideration of the needs of persons with a mental handicap and autism in their regions.</P>
      <P>Additional funding amounting to £12 million has been made available in 1997 for services to persons with a mental handicap.  £2 million has been used to meet identified needs in existing services. The remaining £10 million, which was announced in the budget, is being used to provide new services in 1997 including 160 new residential and respite places, 350 new day care places and the further enhancement of services to persons with autism in line with the recommendations outlined in the Department's policy document on these services.</P>
      <P>Details of the precise services to be put in place in each health board region will be agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees in line with the priority needs which have been identified for each region.</P>

      <P>My appointment as the first Minister with responsibility for western development clearly indicates the Government's commitment to give special attention to the needs of the western region and to rural areas.  Under my area of responsibility a number of important initiatives have been put in place.  The Western Development Commission has been appointed to promote the economic and social regeneration of the western region by working alongside existing agencies and groups active in the region.  A western investment fund is being established to provide long-term venture capital and equity specifically for developing business in the west.  The Government has committed Exchequer funding of up to £25 million over a six year period as matching funding for this special fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council has been commissioned to carry out a detailed study on population settlement patterns which will inform the Government on future policies to be persued to address problems of population imbalance, particularly in the west.  In addition, I am overseeing the implementation of a pilot programme which is exploring appropriate models of delivering public services in areas of declining and dispersed populations.  The objective of the programme is to identify sustainable models of best practice in public service provision which could be mainstreamed.  In line with the Government's policy for offshore islands, as set out in <Col N="1572" /> the report of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development, the difficulties faced by communities living on offshore islands are being specifically addressed in a co-ordinated manner.  Additional funding of £2 million has been provided between 1996 and 1997 for priority access and infrastructure projects.</P>
    <P>Under Sub-Programme II of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development for which my Department has overall responsibility, funding of £78 million is available to the end of 1999 for 38 area partnership companies in 35 areas designated as disadvantaged. These areas were designated as disadvantaged on the basis of objective indicators e.g. the rate of unemployment particularly long-term unemployment, age dependency, the numbers living in local authority housing, the number of lone parents etc. 33 community groups are also being funded, to an amount of £18 million, in areas outside those designated as disadvantaged.  Allocations are made to partnerships and groups on the basis of integrated area actions plans.  The Urban Initiative applies to these disadvantaged urban areas, areas with a population of over 100,000, in Dublin, Northside, Tallaght-Clondalkin, and north Cork city.  A sum of £21 million is available under the initiative to end of 1999.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force on Border Funding which I chair, specifically focuses on the needs of the Border region.  It clearly identifies programmes available in the Border counties and the relevant sources of funding available.  It also clarifies and simplifies the application process for communities in the Border area applying for funding.</P>

      <P>The Government's position on contacts with Sinn Féin remains as set out in my reply to oral Questions Nos. 1 to 8 of 22 January when I said that the official level channel of communication to Sinn Féin can be used whenever the Government receive reliable assurances that an IRA ceasefire is attainable in a genuinely short-term horizon, and that previously identified and realistically attainable things need to be discussed at the meeting, and done, that will achieve that end.  If such assurances are received, meetings can be arranged at very short notice.  The sole purpose of any such meeting would be an end to IRA violence, once and for all, and quickly.</P>
      <P>It is the IRA campaign of violence which is responsible for Sinn Féin not having the same level of access to communication with the Government as is available to all those parties which abide exclusively by democratic and peaceful means.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> The Government has long recognised that tackling poverty and social exclusion, in all parts of the country and in all communities, is one of the major challenges currently facing Ireland.  We have a particular concern about the concentrations of people living in poverty and suffering from chronic and cumulative disadvantage.  The two typical areas are the inner cities and the sprawling suburban housing estates.  Both are characterised by large numbers of people experiencing long-term unemployment, where the economic, social and environmental infrastructure is in decline, or was never in place, and by communities affected by social exclusion and the problems of vandalism, drug misuse and lawlessness.</P>
    <P>The national agreement, Partnership 2000 for Inclusion Employment and Competitiveness, sets out, in a concise and comprehensive way, the strategic approach we have agreed in order to tackle social exclusion, in an integrated manner with full inter-sectoral co-ordination.  It recognises that access to jobs is the key to ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared by all, and it has specific paragraphs on the particular needs of major urban centres.</P>

      <P>In 1996 in preparation for and during Ireland's Presidency of the EU a number of mobile phones were purchased for use by key personnel.  Mobile phones were also rented for use by staff of the Department assigned to work on Presidency related matters.  Their usage was essential to the conduct of a successful Presidency. Accounting records do not readily identify the cost of mobile phone rental-call charges abroad and it is not possible at this time to give a full and accurate statement of costs for 1996. Costs in 1997 are expected to be significantly lower as the level of costs associated with the Presidency in 1996 will not recur.  The total costs of the mobile phones to the Office of the Tánaiste in 1996 amount to £7,767.06.  This figure includes the costs of calls made, the line rentals and the once off purchase of necessary equipment.  The estimated costs for 1997 are expected to be some £2,000 lower.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to her previous written question of 22 January 1997 with regard to the reopening of the section of Cannings Lane-Coney Road, Muff, County Donegal which lies in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1577" /> Since that reply, I have had further inquiries made to the British authorities on the issue through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.  However, the question of the responsibility for the section of road in question has still not been resolved between the roads service of the Department of the Environment of Northern Ireland and Derry City Council.  This continues to impede its reopening to vehicular traffic.  As stated in my reply of 22 January 1997, we would not wish any dispute as to the relevant competences involved to stand in the way of the reopening of this road. I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to pursue the matter with the British authorities with a view to the full reopening of this crossing.</P>

      <P>The 2 per cent non-life insurance levy yielded more than £28 million for the Exchequer in 1996, and the Deputy will appreciate that these moneys make a significant contribution to funding the Government's important economic and social programme. The Government attaches a high priority to targeting further tax reforms towards those areas where the positive impact on employment is most significant.  In this context, I have no plans to remove this levy in the near future. Neither is it intended to introduce a cut-off point in the way the levy is operated as this would lead to a reduction in the yield from what is an important source of revenue.</P>

      <P>Ireland as a whole qualified for objective One status under the current round of funding on the basis that our GDP <i>per capita</i> was less than 75 per cent of the Community average.  My Department in preparing the National Development Plan, which formed the basis for our negotiation with the European Commission of the Community Support Framework 1994-9 and its constituent operational programmes, did seek regional and other inputs into the process.  Submissions from the sub-regional review commitees and sectoral interests which would have reflected the views of the regions and the views, among others, of rural Ireland were considered in developing the National Development Plan.  While it must be acknowledged that the operational programmes are national sectoral programmes and primary responsibility for their implementation rests with a number of my Cabinet colleagues, some of the programmes such as, for example, agriculture, rural development and forestry and local urban and rural development have a specific rural focus.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that the programmes will continue to have regard to the development needs of the regions my Department commissioned on behalf of the regional authorities a mid-term evaluation of the regional impact of the Community Support Framework 1994-9.  This regional evaluation will form an integral part of the mid-term review decision making process of the CSF which is currently ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, my Department is responsible for the Community Initiatives Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme and the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland and the Ireland-Wales INTERREG Programme. <Col N="1586" /> These have a specific focus on the Border region and on the south-east and mid-east as well as the Dublin regions respectively.  The programmes provide for a variety of infrastructural, human resources, economic development and rural re-development measures in these areas.</P>

      <P>There is no basis for the assumption that £50 million of unclaimed moneys in post office savings and investment services belongs to relatives of deceased account holders.  This is not to say that there are no unclaimed moneys which belong to deceased account holders.  However, An Post is not in a position to estimate the amount, if any, involved because it only becomes aware of the death of an account holder when notified of it by a beneficiary or the executor of the deceased's estate.</P>
      <P>The rules and regulations applicable to An Post's products &mdash; post office savings bank, savings certificates, savings bonds and national instalment savings &mdash; provide for the legal beneficiary or beneficiaries of a deceased account holder to redeem funds formerly held by the deceased.</P>
      <P>Where legal beneficiaries apply for redemption of amounts held by a deceased account holder, clear procedures are in place for establishing the beneficiaries' entitlement to the funds.  These procedures normally include production of a grant of probate and a capital acquisition tax clearance certificate.</P>
      <P>Where a potential beneficiary or the executor of a will is uncertain as to whether a deceased person has investments in post office products, they can write to An Post who will establish whether any funds are held in the name of the deceased.  If funds are so held, the redemption procedure proceeds in the normal course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of the new system of pay related social insurance (PRSI) in April 1979, part of the former flat-rate contributions were tax relieved. Contributions paid by an individual under the Social Welfare Acts in respect of widow's contributory pension, orphan's contributory allowance and old age contributory pension were allowable as a tax deduction in each of the years 1961-62 to 1978-79.  The contributions paid in respect of retirement pension and death grant were also allowable from 1971-72 to 1978-79.</P>
      <P>On the introduction of the new system of PRSI, the tax relief was withdrawn in the Finance Act, 1979, section 6.  However, in setting the new PRSI rate account was taken of the fact that income tax relief would not be available.</P>
      <P>In relation to the taxation of social welfare pensions, I would draw to the Deputy's attention that it is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subjected to tax.  In line with this principle, most social welfare payments, including pensions, are therefore reckonable as income for tax purposes. Treating social welfare pensions as for income tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  The extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case, from having such pensions reckonable as income for tax purposes, depends essentially on the amount of other income that the recipient or the recipient's spouse has in the same tax year.  If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare pension, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid.</P>

      <P>I would draw to the Deputy's attention that the income tax changes I introduced in this year's budget are of benefit to old age pensioners.  If being taxed under the normal tax system a couple, both over 80 years of age, will benefit from the £500 increase in the married couples personal allowance to £5,800 and also from the doubling of the age allowance for a married couple to £800.</P>
      <P>If the couple are being taxed under the marginal relief system their exemption limits will be increased by £200 to £10,400.  Consequently, in this year's budget the amount of the couple's income exempted from tax has been increased compared to the 1996-97 tax year whether the couple are being taxed under the normal tax system or the marginal relief system.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that income tax statistics do not generally distinguish between individuals who have income from pensions and from other sources.  The only relevant information available is in respect of all individuals aged 65 years or over, including individuals with income from pensions, who are estimated to qualify for a reduced liability to income tax under marginal relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the enactment of the changes announced in this year's budget, it is estimated <Col N="1589" /> that approximately 27,000 taxpayers aged 65 years or over will pay tax under the marginal relief system in the income tax year 1997-98.  The amount of tax liability involved is estimated to be of the order of £20 million in the tax year 1997-98.</P>

      <P>The joint Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme 1994-99 covers all of Northern Ireland, except Belfast, and the Border counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo. The programme is divided into five subprogrammes covering regional development, human resources development, infrastructure, agriculture-fisheries, forestry and environmental protection. The programme was approved by the Commission in February 1995.  Over 930 applications have been received of which 200 are cross-Border in nature.</P>
      <P>Projects are assessed by joint working groups on the basis of their compliance with the objective of the programme &mdash; cross-Border co-operation and the economic regeneration of border regions &mdash; and the more detailed requirements of the individual subprogrammes.  Grants are approved on the basis of projects submitted and funding is not determined on a county basis. Accordingly, it is not possible to provide an accurate breakdown of projects on a county basis.</P>
      <P>The most recent dates show that over 500 of the applications related to projects in the Border counties.  This figure includes 76 cross-Border projects which applied through partners in those counties, and a number of projects involving two or more of those counties.  It does not include the cross-Border projects submitted through the Northern ireland secretariat for the programme. Some 211 of these applications have been approved and almost £43 million in EU funding has been committed to them.  The total value of these projects is over £83 million.  I have arranged for a copy of the most recent listing of all grant approvals, arising from applications received through my Department, to be circulated with this reply.</P>
      <P>At present the programme is undergoing a mid-term review by independent consultants in accordance with the requirements of the programme. Their report will address the effectiveness of the programme to date in meeting its objectives and its impact on economic and other indicators for the region.  The joint monitoring committee will consider the report at its meeting in June and will take any necessary action to ensure that the programme remains on course to meet its objectives and expenditure targets over the remainder of its time period.</P>

      <P>The operational programmes under which Structural Funds are committed are national sectoral programmes. The programmes do not contain specific regional allocations.  The amount of funding which a region receives is determined by a combination of factors which include sectoral needs as determined in the operational programmes and demand from the regions for the various schemes of assistance under the different programmes.</P>
      <P>The following are the latest projections by region of EU Structural Funds commitments for 1997 for each of the operational programmes under the Community Support Framework for Ireland 1994-99 as furnished by the lead Departments for the programmes.  Figures are not yet available for the Environmental Services OP.</P>

      <Quest>if he will have investigations made into the case of a person (details supplied) who is the holder of an Irish passport but who cannot get a birth certificate in his country of birth in view of the fact that his father, an Irishman, is deemed a nonnational; and if he will supply an Irish birth certificate in the circumstances.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The administration of the registration system is statutorily a matter of An tArd-Chláraitheoir (Registrar-General) of Births, Deaths and Marriages.  As previously advised in relation to a similar question answered on 26 February 1997, the registration in the State of a birth or death event occurring outside the State is subject to a number of conditions set down in section 4 of the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1972.  Among these conditions is the requirement that evidence to the satisfaction of An tArd-Chláraitheoir must be produced to the effect that the applicant, an Irish citizen, was domiciled in the State at the time of the birth of the child in a foreign country.  I understand that evidence available to An tArd-Chláraitheoir indicates that these domiciliary requirements have not been clearly established and accordingly the birth in question may not be entered in the register.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that among the other conditions set down in section 4 of the above mentioned Act, is a condition that the section shall apply where there was not at the time of the birth a system for the registration of births in the country in which the child was born.  In this particular case, I understand that the birth of the child, referred to by the Deputy, may be registered under the system of registration which applies in the country in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware, it has been the policy of successive Governments to restructure the mental health services through the development of services located in the community as an alternative to institutional-based care.  Acute psychiatric units at general hospitals, day hospitals, day centres and community residential accommodation are now being provided to replace services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals.  This policy has been widely accepted as providing a more comprehensive service for patients and a much improved quality of life for persons who were former patients of psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>Persons with mental illness, including those with schizophrenia, are provided with a continuum of care from acute admission through care in the home or in the community. Acute services are provided in a hospital setting.  Following recovery from the acute stage of the illness a patient may be discharged to the care of his-her general practitioner in conjunction, where necessary, with a multidisciplinary team.  Mental health professionals are available to the families of schizophrenia patients to discuss patient treatment and recovery programmes.</P>
      <P>Schizophrenia Ireland, which is a national voluntary organisation established for the purpose of assisting in the alleviation of distress in the families of persons with schizophrenia, receives financial aid from my Department and the health boards in support of its work.  In the course of a number of submissions made to the Department in recent years, Schizophrenia Ireland emphasised, <i>inter alia</i>, the need to improve support for schizophrenia patients' families and for the committed improvement in services provided to persons with schizophrenia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, health boards, in conjunction with the Department, regularly review the level of mental health services provided in the context <Col N="1607" /> of agreed national policy for the development of the service.  It is my intention to continue the policy of ongoing improvements in the level of facilities and support service for the mentally ill and their families and I regard the input of Schizophrenia Ireland as particularly valuable in this process.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am kept informed of the issues of concern to people with a mental handicap, their parents and carers and the voluntary and statutory service providers, through a range of mechanisms. I receive a large number of representations which cover a broad range of issues from the need for the further development of services to individual cases.  Officials in my Department regularly meet with the voluntary mental handicap agencies and service providers to discuss current and future developments. The priorities which I set in any year for the allocation of development moneys takes account of the feedback I receive from these sources.</P>
      <P>Additional funding amounting to £12 million has been made available in 1997 for services to persons with a mental handicap.  £2 million has been used to meet identified needs in existing services. The remaining £10 million, which was announced in the budget, is being used to provide new services in 1997 based on the priorities identified to me which are for residential and day places and for the continuation of the ongoing programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from inappropriate care settings.  The detailed decisions about the precise services to be provided will be taken by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committees on which parents and the voluntary sector are represented.</P>
      <P>Information on the number of persons with a mental handicap in receipt of services or awaiting placement in either residential or day services is currently being compiled from the national intellectual disabilty database as part of the preparation of an assessment of need for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am conscious of the need to develop cardiac surgery facilities in this country.  While cardiac surgery services have been developed and enhanced in recent years at both the Mater and Cork University Hospital, I am keenly aware that the demand for these services has continued to increase in the interim.  With this in mind I have asked for a thorough examination of service need to be carried out and I envisage that cardiac service throughput will be increased nationally by 500 cases per annum.</P>
      <P>To ensure that the service is delivered in the most efficient and effective manner with patient care a priority, I set up an option appraisal group with the intention that four hospitals would be asked to submit proposals for the further development of cardiac surgery services.  The four hospitals chosen all have merits in favour of locating the service on their campus and I have asked the group to look carefully at the case for locating the service on each of these sites.  I look forward to receiving the report of the option appraisal group which will be presented to me in the coming weeks.  The question of additional cardiac procedures at Cork University Hospital will be determined in the light of this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> The Deputy will be pleased to learn that the Southern Health Board has confirmed that it will perform an additional 150 cardiac procedures this year.  This will bring its agreed activity levels for this specialty in 1997 to a total of 400 procedures. This level of activity has been made possible by the substantial funding made available to the hospital in recent years in respect of cardiac services development.  I am satisfied that this additional activity will impact positively on waiting times for cardiac procedures.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Health boards, through their general practice units, have been facilitating the computerisation of GMS practices through the provision of financial assistance and training in the use of information technology and my Department has emphasised to the boards the importance of maintaining progress in this area.  The rate of progress on the computerisation of practices to date has been variable, with 25 per cent of practices computerised in one health board area and up to 70 per cent computerisation in another board area.  However, I understand that boards intend to make significant progress on information technology development in general practice during this year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Magnetic resonance imaging facilities in the public hospital sector are available in Beaumont Hospital.

Private MRI facilities are also available at the Mater Private Hospital, St. Vincent's Private Hospital, The Blackrock Clinic, and on the campus of Cork University Hospital.</P>
      <P>I have had a review of the current availability of MRI technology in Ireland conducted and an currently examining options for further diffusion of MRI facilities in the Irish health service, taking into account all relevant factors.  I hope to have consideration of this review finalised in the near future and to be in a position to make a decision on developments in this area.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Since 1993, significant progress has been made in the implementation of the commitments in the health strategy which are relevant to general practice.  Arising from this, the health boards, in conjunction with local general practitioners, are involved in the development of a number of purpose built general practice centres throughout the country.  In this context, the Department advised the health boards in 1995 and 1996 that, in addition to ongoing infrastructural developments, they should concentrate specifically on the development of a priority range of services, in a general setting, which would progress the development of this speciality to enable it to fulfil a wider and more integrated role in the health care system.</P>
      <P>The range of such developments which are comprehended relate to services for elderly patients, physiotherapy, dietetics, counselling and social work support, services for cancer patients linked to palliative care, women's health services for the travelling community.  In addition, health boards have been asked to examine ways in which general practitioners can be involved in the provision of specific services which has been traditionally located in hospitals but which could be more appropriately provided by the primary care services.</P>
      <P>The provision of an enhanced range of services in a general practice setting, as outlined above, would of course require the involvement of consultants and other professionals in the respective fields.  It is envisaged that this involvement would be on a sessional or fixed term contract basis as appropriate.  It would be a matter for the authorities and individuals in each area i.e. health boards, hospitals, consultants and general practitioners to make appropriate arrangements for the provision of such services.  I fully support these developments in general practice which are in keeping with the overall thrust of the health strategy.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy will be aware, a Working Group on the Reorganisation of Accident and Emergency Services in Cork was established by the Southern Health Board in May 1995 to review the organisation and deliver of accident and emergency services in Cork.  The group met on a number of occassions under the chairmanship of Mr. Stephen Cusack, A &amp; E consultant at Cork University Hospital.  The group completed its report in March 1996 and I understand that its <Col N="1611" /> recommendations have been endorsed by the Southern Health Board, subject to a small number of modifications.  A copy of the report was forwarded for consideration within my Department at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>Preliminary discussions have already taken place between officials of my Department and the Southern Health Board, to clarify the resource implications, priorities and time scale involved.  I understand that the board has made provision in its 1997 allocation to Cork University Hospital for an initial investment in the A &amp; E department to meet priority capital and equipping needs.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The principal financial support available to people with a visual impairment between 16 and <Col N="1613" /> 18 years is disability allowance which is administered by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Other financial supports available to people with disabilities aged between 16 and 18 years, including people with a visual impairment, which are the responsibility of my Department, and which are administered by health boards, include the following allowances.  The disabled person's rehabilitation allowance is payable to persons who require full time rehabilitation training who are living away from home.  The qualifying criteria are identical to those in place for disability allowance.  The allowance is currently £14.20 per week.  The mobility allowance is paid to people with severe difficulties who are unable to walk or use public transport.  The purpose of the allowance is to finance the occassional taxi journey for such persons and is currently paid at a maximum monthly rate of £39.10.  Applicants must be between the ages of 16 and 66 years and be living at home or maintained by a health board in longstay residential care.  The allowance is subject to a means test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I refer the Deputy to replies given on 26 September, 17 October and 11 February on this issue.  I have already outlined that the report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service was published in November 1993.  The group, in their report, stated that the ambulance service is an emergency service similar to the gardaí and fire service.  The report of the review group has been accepted by Government and forms the basis of Government policy in relation to the ambulance service.</P>
      <P>In relation to the pay and conditions of ambulance personnel and controllers in provincial locations, I have clarified the nature of the claim made by SIPTU on behalf of ambulance personnel in previous responses.  Briefly, this claim, lodged in 1993, sought parity of pay between the provincial ambulance personnel and their counterparts in Dublin.  Final agreement, including concession of this claim for parity, was reached on a package of proposals in December 1996.  A ballot on this package was started at the end of last year.  For technical reasons on the union side the ballot had to be rearranged.  A second ballot was completed on 28 February.  The offer made was rejected by both driver-attendant and controller groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A ballot for industrial action was undertaken in relation to these two grades in provincial locations.  The result was a vote in favour of strike action.  Any strike action is a breach of the industrial peace clause contained in the PCW agreement. <Col N="1614" /> Details have not yet been made available by the Union of the grounds for rejection of the deal on offer, or the issues which remain in dispute. I would urge them to utilise the industrial relations machinery available by considering a resumption of discussions with the Labour Relations Commission on the outstanding issues; and-or a referral of the matter to a full hearing of the Labour Court.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I wish to take Questions Nos. 123 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>Physiotherapists and speech and language therapists, similar to all other paramedical professions, have benefited in full from all standard and special pay awards under the various national pay programmes down through the years.  The relative position of both professions, in terms of remuneration, has been maintained with those of their colleagues in other paramedical disciplines.</P>
      <P>IMPACT, on behalf of physiotherapists and speech and language therapists was pursuing a pay claim under Clause 2 (iii) &mdash; Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> These negotiations were complex and were ongoing under the auspices of the Health Service Employers' Agency until recently with a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible.  However, as the recent widespread media coverage has indicated, IMPACT has now opted to ballot a number of paramedic professions including physiotherapists and speech and language therapists, with a view to strike action in the coming weeks.  In these circumstances, I am sure that you will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment at this point.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The only EU funding received directly by my Department is in respect of two health promotion projects and a research project.  The first health promotion project, <i>Smoking Cessation Programme for Pregnant Women</i> is part of the framework of Europe Against Cancer programme. The total EU grant for this project is £18,259 of which £5,220 is due in 1997.  The previous instalment of £13,039 was received in 1994.</P>
      <P>The second health promotion project is within the European network of health promoting schools.  The estimated EU funding is £25,902 in 1997 with the balance of £11,102 due in 1998.  An application for £37,004 for continued support of this project from November 1997 to November 1998 has been submitted to the EU Commission and is awaiting a decision.</P>
      <P>The research funding received by my Department is under the Biomed II programme. £15,717.44 was received in 1996 and it is estimated that £9,835.55 will be received in 1997 for a project of efficiency of scanning services.  This is part of a global research project headed up by the University of Wales in Cardiff.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department receives EU funds indirectly <i>via</i> the Departments of Finance and Enterprise and Employment.   This funding, which is included in the figures supplied to the Deputy by those Departments, is provided under the following headings:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Training for People with Disabilities.</i> Funding is provided as part of the Operational Programme for Human Resources 1994 to 1999 which is administered by the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>ESF support in 1996 was £18.442 million and the estimated ESF support for 1997 is £19.079 million European Regional Development Fund support in 1996 was £2.799 million and the estimated European Regional Development Fund support for 1997 is £4.198 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Equity is one of the key principles underlying the health strategy &ldquo;Shaping A Healthier Future&rdquo;.  The aim of health policy is that access to healthcare will be determined by actual need for services, rather than ability to pay or geographic location.  The health services are structurned to meet the demands of different groups throughout the county.  The acute hospital sector, for example, has centres of excellence dispersed geographically which provide national and regional speciality services for the population, in addition to locally-based services.</P>
      <P>The question raised by the Deputy raises the issue of positive discrimination towards particular areas.  There are many examples of this in the health services which are being continuously reviewed and adapted, as appropriate.  The continuous development of community based services is a feature of this process.  In the primary health care sector, for example, specific arrangements and provisions are made for meeting the needs of the population in rural areas.  In particular, in regard to general practitioner services under the general medical services scheme, special incentives and payments are provided for doctors in rural practices, including special payments to dispensing doctors in areas where a pharmacy might not be viable.  Significant progress has been achieved in relation to the development of community based services through the establishment of community health centres, linkages with local GPs, hospital services, voluntary agencies and direct family involvement. The North-Western Health Board, for example, has pioneered developments in this area.  Other health boards have similarly developed excellent programmes to meet the needs of both the rural and urban population in partnership with the local community and local service providers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all of these ways the health services have been positively geared and funded, towards meeting the needs of the entire population, while recognising the special needs of particular groups in the community.  In determining financial allocations for health boards these factors are taken <Col N="1621" /> into account, within the context of the overall available resources.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The management of health services, including the employment of staff, is a matter, in the first instance, for each health agency.  A consultant oncologist was sanctioned by my Department on 25 June 1996 and Comhairle na nOspidéal subsequently approved the appointment.  The post is before the Local Appointment Commission at present and it is hoped to advertise this position in the near future.  When the consultant is appointed, a full medical oncology service will be provided for the south-east region from Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>

      <P>The national blood screening programme commenced in February 1994 for recipients of human immunoglobulin &mdash; anti-D, their children and partners.  Under this programme, 61,486 women were screened for hepatitis C.  The number of women who have tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies is 974.  Of these, 463 have tested positive for the hepatitis C virus.  The number of children screened under this programme is 1,776. Twelve of these tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies, of which three are positive for the virus.  The number of partners screened under the programme was 504, four of whom tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies.  No partners have tested positive for the virus.</P>
      <P>The targeted lookback programme was commenced in October 1994 to identify persons who may have been infected with hepatitis C as a result of a transfusion, by tracing the past donations of donors identified with evidence of hepatitis C infection.  Under this programme, 270 living recipients have been traced.  Two hundred and thirty of these have been tested, of whom 128 are antibody positive.  Of the 230 who were tested for hepatitis C antibodies, 207 were tested for the virus.  Eighty three of these are positive for the virus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> The optional screening programme commenced in September 1995 to ensure that all recipients of blood transfusions and blood products who might possibly have become infected with hepatitis C through the receipt of transfusions or blood products were given the option of being tested free of charge.  To date, 11,800 people have been tested under this programme. Of these, 43 have tested antibody positive. Twenty nine of these 43 have tested positive for the virus.</P>
    <P>Testing for hepatitis C became available on I October 1991.  Many haemophiliacs and kidney patients would have been screened for hepatitis C before the national blood screening programme was introduced in February 1994.  My Department has been informed by the Irish Haemophilia Society that 210 haemophiliacs have been infected with hepatitis C.  The Irish Kidney Association has indicated to the Department that 50 kidney patients have been infected with hepatitis C.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am pleased to set out in the following tables details of (a) health board non-capital allocations for the years 1994 to 1997, (b) approved overdraft facilities for 1997.  In relation to bank overdraft facilities, approval is given to health boards to utilise this facility, up to a maximum of 2 per cent of a board's non-capital allocation.</P>
      <P>The non-capital funding approved for health boards in any year takes full account of the payment of statutory grants, as approved by boards in that year.  In 1994, the Department put in place a payments Protocol linked to a system for determining and reporting on health boards' working capital.  This system has worked well, and significant improvements have been made in payments by boards to trade creditors, to those providing services on their behalf and to those persons eligible for cash and other statutory grants. The Department reviews the performance of individual boards on a monthly basis.  In this regard, my Department is not aware of any significant delay in the payment of statutory grants approved by boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, should the Deputy be aware of specific problems in relation to the payment of grants, I would be glad if he communicated these to me <Col N="1624" /> and I will have my Department address the matter on an urgent basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware of public concern with regard to the sale of alcoholic fruit drinks.  Evidence available from UK-based research indicates that such drinks are particularly popular with underage drinkers.  I indicated to the House last November that, whereas the national alcohol policy does not make specific reference to these drinks, it does contain proposals for a range of initiatives to tackle, <i>inter alia</i>, underage drinking.  I am concerned, therefore, to ensure that we put in place a broad range of strategies to discourage underage drinking.  The actions proposed in the national alcohol policy include: initiatives with youth in the formal and non-formal education sectors; development of the role of parents in helping their children to adopt sensible and responsible attitudes and behaviours in relation to alcohol and facilitation by the Department of Justice of the identity card scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the first two of these initiatives, my Department is in dialogue with health boards about appropriate health promotion strategies for young people.  A Youth Health Promotion Officer has been contracted by the Consultative Committee on Health Promotion, chaired by my colleague, Deputy Brian O'Shea, Minister of State, to take this work forward.  An Education and Training Officer was also assigned to the Health Promotion Unit within the last few months.  One of her functions is to work, through the health boards, with local parent and community groups on a range of topics including the <Col N="1629" /> substance abuse package &ldquo;Drug Questions Local Answers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The national alcohol policy also encourages the drinks industry to play its part in promoting sensible drinking.  This could be done by providing responsible server training for staff; establishing a charter for retailers which would incorporate best practices in relation to customers, staff and promotions; endorsing and incorporating into their code that &ldquo;no alcoholic drinks sponsorship of youth activities should be undertaken directly or indirectly&rdquo; and confining advertisements to factual information which would be in keeping with the National Alcohol Policy sensible drinking guidelines.</P>
    <P>My Department, together with the Department of Enterprise and Employment, is in discussion with representatives of the industry concerning a code of practice with regard to curtailing underage drink supply.  The Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, has sought the agreement of the European Commission to introducing more stringent requirements for labelling alcoholic fruit drinks with the aim of protecting consumers' health.  We are keeping in close touch with this proposal.  In the meantime, I would encourage the drinks industry to continue its work of developing an appropriate and effective voluntary code aimed at curtailing the supply of all alcohol to under age groups.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 to 156, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Allergies arise from a very wide variety of causes and affect individuals in many different ways.  Therefore, beyond advising sufferers to keep in close contact with their general practitioners or hospital consultants about their own particular situation, it is difficult to set down a general policy position which would adequately reflect the full range of situations which can arise.</P>
      <P>There is no consultant in the public acute hospital sector specialising solely in allergies and anaphylaxis.  A range of consultants such as immunologists, respiratory physicians, dermatologists and others deal with allergy conditions relating to their speciality.</P>
      <P>As regards food allergies, my Department has written to the health boards and voluntary hospitals alerting them to the problem of food allergies and outlining such issues as the likely symptoms and the appropriate treatment of patients presenting allergic reactions.  My Department asked the health boards and voluntary hospitals to bring its correspondence in relation to food allergies to the attention of all appropriate medical personnel in the relevant hospital or health board area, including, in particular, general practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to scientific research into food allergies, Ireland is participating in an EU project which was recently set up under the SCOOP &mdash; Scientific Co-operation in relation to Food &mdash;<Col N="1632" /> programme.  Reports drawn up under the SCOOP programme provide a factual basis on which the EU Commission can base legislative proposals. The current research project, which is being co-ordinated by the UK, is entitled, &ldquo;consideration of the epidemiological basis for appropriate measures for the protection of public health in respect of food allergy&rdquo;.  I understand the objective of the project is to examine data across the member states concerning the causative agents of fatal or immediate life-threatening allergic responses to food and to attempt to identify the causative agents of these allergic reactions to food, taking into account regional variations within the EU.</P>
    <P>The specific matter of food labelling at the retail level is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit of my Department is available to provide advice and assistance to voluntary organisations interested in disseminating information on particular topics, as appropriate.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The provision of long-stay beds for the elderly in the Tullamore and Birr areas is a matter for the Midland Health Board.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the Health Strategy, the Midland Health Board developed its own strategy and action plan for health and social gain for the elderly.  This plan considers the full range of services, namely, needs assessment, health promotion, care in the home, care in the community, housing, care in acute hospitals and care in long-stay institutions.  The board's aim is to put in place a comprehensive package of services that ensures the elderly retain their independence, live in their own homes-community for as long as possible and have access to appropriate in-patient or long-stay care when they can no longer live at home or in the community.  The board also identified the need for increased bed provision for the elderly in the Birr and Tullamore sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Tullamore sector, an additional 16 bed extension in Edenderry is due to open later this year and a further 20 beds are planned to be added to the existing 40 bed unit at Riada House, Tullamore, although this is more long-term.  Regarding Birr, a planning brief to integrate the existing Welfare Home and District Hospital into a 90 bed Community Nursing Unit, resulting in a net increase of 20 nursing beds, is being examined in my Department and I will <Col N="1636" /> respond to the Midland Health Board in the very near future.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The veterinary services of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and, where appropriate, the veterinary services operated by local authorities under the Abattoirs Act, 1988, are responsible for animal health controls as well as the pre and post mortem inspection of animals in slaughter houses.  These inspections are concerned with general animal health and welfare, meat inspection and the testing of meat for the presence of antibiotics, growth promoters and other prohibited substances.</P>
      <P>My Department, through the health boards, controls the sale of meat at retail level under the food hygiene regulations.  In addition, the health boards enforce a wide range of other regulations on my behalf in respect of food additives and contaminants.</P>
      <P>My Department has been concerned about the reports of antibiotic residues in meat.  Not only can such residues induce reactions in some people, they can also have the effect of increasing resistance to medicines administered for human illness.</P>
      <P>I understand in recent months, the pigmeat producers and processors have been made aware by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, that he is committed to the total elimination of antibiotic residues to ensure both full compliance with legal requirements and to allay the concerns of consumers.  I have been assured the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will rigorously apply the controls in this area which have recently been tightened and of which both producers and processors are by now well aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department does not have any direct function in relation to the control of antibiotic residues. This is exactly the type of issue which will come within the remit of the new Food Safety Authority of Ireland which will operate under my aegis.  The Authority's primary function will be to monitor the implementation of food controls operated by the various official agencies to ensure that food safety and the interests of consumers in this regard are at the top of the agenda. The Authority, which will be independent of the existing food control agencies, will have all the necessary powers to ensure that it can evaluate the effectiveness of control systems, enforce compliance with its audit findings and have power to take action for failure by persons or agencies to <Col N="1637" /> observe the highest food safety standards available.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new Authority will meet the needs for consumer protection in this area and play an important role in stamping out unacceptable practices in regard to antibiotics and other substances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Throughout 1996 my colleague Deputy Currie, Minister of State with special responsibility for child care, hosted a consultative process on mandatory reporting.  The process examined not only the issue of mandatory reporting but also other aspects of our child protection services.  In response to the views which were expressed by child care professionals and others who participated in the consultative process, a series of initiatives were published to best promote and protect the rights of children in &ldquo;Putting Children First &mdash; Promoting and Protecting the Rights of Children&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The proposed initiatives are: (i) designated officers in the health boards to co-ordinate inter-agency approaches to child protection at community care level; (ii) regional and local child protection committees, operating at health board and community care level, to enhance inter-agency and inter-professional approaches to child protection; (iii) multi-disciplinary training, under the aegis of the regional child protection committees, to increase inter-agency and inter-professional approaches to child protection; (iv) the new social services inspectorate to review the 1987 child abuse guidelines and the procedure for the notification of suspected cases of abuse between health boards and the Garda; (v) a public information campaign to heighten public awareness of child abuse and of the system to respond to cases of child abuse; (vi) the provision of support services by health boards for victims of past abuse; (vii) funding of voluntary agencies dealing with children to be conditional on procedures being in place to deal with allegations of child abuse; and (viii) evaluation of the impact of the above measures on the reporting of child abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is also developing proposals on the establishment of a body to promote and protect children's rights, such as an Ombudsman for Children.  The Minister of State has given a commitment that he will evaluate the impact of these measures on the reporting of child abuse. If, following this evaluation, it is clear that the <Col N="1638" /> introduction of mandatory reporting would be in the best interests of children, or that some form of statutory basis to ensure co-operation between agencies is required, the necessary legislation will be introduced.</P>
    <P>My paramount concern and that of my colleague, the Minister of State, has always been what was in the best interests of children.  I was heartened that this was also the paramount concern of all those who participated in the consultative process of mandatory reporting.  However, it was suggested in a number of submissions that sight should not be lost of a person's right to his or her good name in dealing with the reporting of child abuse and the Minister of State was conscious of the need to maintain an appropriate balance in this regard in developing the initiatives outlined above.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government stands by the commitment given in the lead up to the divorce referendum in 1995 to support the development of marriage counselling services and the Family Mediation Service.  As indicated in &ldquo;The Right to Remarry&rdquo;, the Government information paper on the divorce referendum published in September 1995, any comprehensive approach to tackling the problem of marriage breakdown must involve not only the introduction of an appropriate legislative framework and the upgrading of services provided by organisations which deal with separating couples, such as the Legal Aid Board and the Family Medication Service, but must also involve the taking of meaningful steps to support and enrich existing marriages. In that regard, increased resources have been invested in voluntary marriage counselling services provided by organisations, many of which have a long and distinguished track record in this country.</P>
      <P>Following on my appointment as Minister for Equality and Law Reform, I instituted a scheme of grants to voluntary organisations providing marriage counselling services.  Grants were first paid under this scheme in 1994 when £750,000 was expended.  A similar amount was expended in 1995.  Prior to 1994 these grants were administered by the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the amounts paid out in individual grants by these Departments were relatively small and had remained static over a number of years.  In 1996 the scheme administered by my Department was extended to include the provision of assistance to voluntary organisations providing counselling to children whose parents have separated.  A sum of £900,000 was distributed in 1996 and a similar sum has been allocated for distribution in 1997.  Already, it is apparent that significant tangible benefits have accrued from the scheme, both to counselling organisations and those they serve.  By continuing to receive significant and regular funding under this scheme, I am satisfied the voluntary counselling organisations will be encouraged to continue to develop and expand their services and to adapt to meet the challenges presented to society by <Col N="1643" /> changing attitudes in the area of human relationships.</P>
    <P>Family mediation is a process whereby couples, who have decided to separate or who have already separated, are enabled to negotiate their own separation agreement with the help of a trained mediator and without resorting to adjudication through the courts.  Help to arrive at an amicable resolution to the difficulties surrounding separation, for example, maintenance, division of property, custody of and access to children, is provided by mediators in the employment of the Family Mediation Service, a professional confidential service provided by my Department.  The Family Mediation Service has made significant advances in the progressing of its development plan, the first stage of which is almost complete. A new service co-ordinator and two area mediation co-ordinators, new posts, have been appointed to its centres at Dublin and Limerick. With a management structure in place, recruitment of further staff is now possible.  The process of recruiting additional part-time mediators for the service is well advanced and I anticipate that the first of these will be selected for appointment within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Equally, the rapid and nationwide expansion which the Legal Aid Board has undergone since 1992 was undertaken in order to ensure that an effective civil legal aid and advice structure is in place, nationally and locally, to provide legal aid and advice, including legal aid and advice to couples whose marriages have broken down. Funding to the Legal Aid Board has increased from just under £2.7 million in 1992 to £8.3 million in 1997, an increase of over three times the 1992 figure.  Over the same period staff numbers more than doubled, from 99 to 224.  Also, I amended the scheme of civil legal aid and advice to enable the Legal Aid Board introduce a scheme for the use of private solicitors in delivery of legal services to legal aid applicants, a provision now reflected in the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995.  The recent addition of a further two law centres, at Newbridge and Tullamore, brings to 30 the total of full-time law centres in the nationwide network as compared to 16 in 1993.  This expansion can now be seen as necessary and timely and to have anticipated the increase in applications to the board for legal services consequential on the introduction of divorce.</P>
    <P>My achievements to date in expanding and developing the Legal Aid Board is evidence of my determination to ensure that sufficient resources are made available to the Legal Aid Board to enable it to provide an adequate response to the challenge which has been posed by the introduction of divorce and to those challenges which can be foreseen at present, subject of course to budgetary considerations.</P>
    <P>Civil legal aid, when introduced in 1979 under the scheme of legal aid and advice, was one of a number of measures intended by Government to facilitate access to the courts.  It was intended to <Col N="1644" /> cover not only low income groups, such as persons dependent on social welfare payments, but also persons on moderate incomes who could afford to contribute a portion, but not the full costs, of the required legal services.  Accordingly, those seeking to avail of the legal services provided by the board must satisfy a financial eligibilty test and are liable to pay certain contributions based on means.  I am satisfied that the financil eligibility test and all other requirements of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 have at all times been applied in an equitable manner by the Legal Aid Board.</P>

      <P>Ireland's five national parks were established under criteria set down by the IUCN, also known as the World Conservation Union and affiliated to the United Nations.  The IUCN criteria for selecting an area as a national park are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" />&ldquo;The area should contain a representative sample of major natural regions, features of scenery, where plant and animal species, habitats and geomorphological sites are of special spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and tourist significance.</P>
    <P>The area should be large enough to contain one or more ecosystems not materially altered by current human occupation or exploitation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While Lough Key Forest Park is an area of high amenity, it is not a natural area.  Most of the property is a working commercial forest, some of it having been developed as a popular amenity by the forest and Wildlife Service before the property was transferred to Coillte Teoranta.</P>
    <P>The property is one that has been highly modified by man for human exploitation and does not qualify under the international criteria as a national park.  The greater part of the forest park does not contain any habitats, flora or fauna of nature conservation value.  Accordingly it would not be appropriate to consider acquiring it for designation as a natural park.</P>

      <P>The question of policy in relation to the use of the park for pay-in musical and other cultural events has been raised in relation to specific proposals for such use of the park, and I am currently examining the issues involved.

      <P>However, already, arising from an interim report of FORTE requested by me in relation to taxation issues, I was successful in securing the extension of the business expansion scheme to the music industry.

Without prejudicing my consideration of the full report and my dialogue with the industry, I look forward to the advancement of further initiatives in this important sector.</P>

      <P>The operation of the scheme is continuously monitored and assessed by the task force and, in making annual financial allocations to health boards, due cognisance is given to returns by the boards of activity under the scheme and the number of applications on hands within each health board area.  It is a matter for each board to determine, within the funds available, the priority of individual cases on hands and to consider which applications should receive assistance in 1997.  I am not in a position to further increase the provision for 1997.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>No arbitrary cut back is being made in the capital <Col N="1662" /> provision for teaching and research equipment for the universities over the period 1994-99. While some variations may occur in the annual capital equipment allocations to the Higher Education Authority by my Department it is not envisaged that there will be any reduction in the level of equipment to be approved over this period.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-99 an amount of £10 million is being provided for the replacement of research and teaching equipment in the universities.  This provision is part of an overall £120 million capital investment programme designed primarily for the purpose of supporting the third level sector in areas of research and teaching related to economic growth and job creation.</P>
    <P>This £10 million for equipment has already been complemented by a further £2 million of Exchequer funds bringing the total allocation for equipment for the Higher Education Authority sector to an average of £2 million per annum over the period of the plan.  In addition the £120 million programme includes elements of funding for new equipment.  A further £60 million capital investment programme comprising £30 million from the private sector with matching funds from the Exchequer was approved by Government in 1995 with a view to providing additional graduate and postgraduate places in the university sector.</P>
    <P>To further enhance the effectiveness of the sector both in terms of meeting the recommendations of the Science Technology and Innovation Advisory Council and the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education and in the awareness that there is need for further investment in capital resources for research my Department is at present considering introducing a number of further initiatives that will contribute to the funding of new equipment for the sector.</P>

    <P>My Department funds the adult literacy and community education scheme, which was established to provide literacy and community education <Col N="1663" /> to disadvantaged adults, including literacy groups.

    <P>An annual grant-in-aid is also provided by my Department to the National Adult Literacy Agency in support of its activities.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that illiteracy is a source of great embarrassment and difficulty for adults who are affected by it.  My commitment to develop and enhance the programmes in place to address adult literacy problems is reflected both in the policy measures proposed in the White Paper &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo; and the substantial additional funding provided in recent years to support these services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226, 264 and 297 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Synge Street school has made application to my Department for the appointment of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing <Col N="1665" /> special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
    <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional concessionary teacher posts to schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  In the event of such posts becoming available, the needs of the school in question will be considered.</P>

      <P>My Department's technical staff have drawn up plans for a proposed extension at the school referred to by the Deputy.  At present, I am not in a position to sanction funding towards this project.  All available funds are committed on existing capital projects and on grants already sanctioned.  I will, however, be keeping expenditure on the primary building programme under review during the year.  The needs of the school will receive consideration at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>The school in question has applied to my Department for an extension.  Enrolment projections indicate that an additional teacher will be appointed in September 1997, but that the need will be short-term.</P>
      <P>The ideal solution is additional classroom accommodation.  However, there were massive cuts in the capital funding of national schools in the 1988-92 period and this has resulted in a backlong of urgent projects.  While I accept that the temporary use of a GP facility is not ideal, I must give priority to the schools on the capital programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 234 and 235 together.</P>
      <P>My Department makes provision for physical education facilities in second level schools and this includes indoor PE halls, outdoor hard play areas such as basketball and tennis courts and playing fields.  Virtually all second level schools have at least one element of these facilities.</P>
      <P>PE halls are provided in all new schools as a standard part of the schedule of accommodation. Where schools do not have PE halls, they are provided on a phased basis as resources permit. However, because of financial constraints, the provision of essential classroom accommodation must continue to be the first priority.</P>
      <P>At primary level, a general purposes facility is provided in every new school with four or more classrooms.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 236 and 237 together.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for the conduct of examinations in third level institutions are a matter for those institutions.  I understand however that while those arrangements may vary, in general special provision is made in all third level institutions for students with disabilities sitting examinations. Each such student is dealt with on an individual basis with appropriate arrangements being made within practical limits.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to second level students is that additional time is one of a range of special examination arrangements which may be approved in the case of candidates with disabilities. Additional time is approved where the candidate is visually impaired or where the Department is satisfied that the candidate needs the help of a scribe or is unable to make adequate use of mechanical aids for recording the answers.</P>
      <P>When the scheme of special arrangements was revised some years ago, schools were informed that additional time of ten minutes per scheduled hour of each question paper could be approved in the circumstances which I have outlined.  This provision would give a candidate an extra 30 minutes in the case of an examination which was scheduled for three hours.  My Department's experience is that schools have found this amount of time adequate to meet the needs of candidates.</P>
      <P>Additional time in excess of 10 minutes per scheduled hour of the question paper may be approved only in the most exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <P>Aid from the European Social Fund is made available to my Department to assist in the provision of specific services across the first, second and third levels of education.  These services are provided through schools, vocational education committees, regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the universities.  The overall cost of the programmes is provided in the annual estimates for grants to these institutions.</P>
      <P>In 1996 my Department received £120,219,454 in aid from the European Social Fund.  A sum of £25,500 was also received in grants under the SOCRATES Programme.  In addition to EU payments made to my Department, agencies and institutions in the education sector also receive funding directly for projects under SOCRATES, LEONARDO, Youth for Europe and Community Initiatives.</P>
      <P>The programmes funded by my Department and the associated EU receipts in 1996 and expected receipts in 1997 are listed in the following table.  Receipts from the European Regional Development Fund in respect of my Department's capital programme are drawn down by the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 247 and 248 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate a resource teacher to the schools in question.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate such posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability in that year.  Ten resource teacher posts were recently allocated by my Department to schools in the primary sector.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need following the collection and analysis of data from primary schools by my Department's Primary inspectorate.</P>
      <P>The special educational needs of pupils attending the schools mentioned by the Deputy will be considered in the context of any future allocation of resource teacher posts.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> Detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre concluded that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  The studies noted that the disadvantaged areas scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
    <P>In line with the findings of these studies, I recently launched the Breaking the Cycle initiative which seeks to target a special package of supports on selected urban and rural schools which have been identified as suffering serious levels of educational disadvantage.  The schools in question were selected by the Education Research Centre on the basis of priority of need as reflected under a range of criteria devised by the centre.</P>
    <P>In the event of additional resources becoming available for special needs areas, the needs of the schools in question will be considered.</P>

      <P>Montessori qualifications are not recognised for child care assistant positions in the early start programme.</P>
      <P>The minimum qualification for child care assistants in early start is a one year full-time post-leaving certificate level 2 qualification validated by the NCVA.  The National Vocational Certificate: Community and Health Services &mdash; Child care, Level 2 or equivalent qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full-time courses in child care, pre-school care or social care, of longer duration, which are validated by the National Council for Vocational Awards (NCVA) or the National Council for Educational Awards (NCEA) or equivalent qualifications are also recognised.  The National Nurseries Education Board Diploma (NNEB) in Nursery Nursing awarded by the Council for <Col N="1678" /> Awards in Children's Care and Education is recognised as an equivalent qualification, provided applicants have also passed the leaving certificate including a pass in Irish.</P>
    <P>Where a case is being made that other qualifications are equivalent, it is necessary for the training institution, which provides that qualification, to apply to the NCVA to seek equivalence recognition.</P>
    <P>My Department recognises the Montessori Diploma awarded on successful completion of the three year course at the Montessori College, Mount St. Mary's, Dundrum Road, Milltown, Dublin 14 formerly Sion Hill.  Persons holding this diploma may be granted exceptional recognition for teaching posts in special schools for children with mental handicap, emotional disturbance or hearing impairment.  However, the qualification does not meet the training qualification requirements of primary school teachers.</P>
    <P>Teachers appointed to the early start programme must be fully qualified primary teachers. Such teachers are members of the staff of the school in which the early start centre is located and have deployment mobility within the school and in the primary school system in general.  Persons with Montessori qualification are not eligible for appointment to the staffs of ordinary national schools.</P>

An overall quota of up to 10 per cent of places applies to these categories.</P>
      <P>The main aim of the VTOS is to provide a second-chance education opportunity to long-term unemployed persons who have demonstrated through the signing on process that they are unemployed and seeking employment.</P>
      <P>Because of the focus of VTOS on employment, my Department is not in a position to raise the 10 per cent quota in order to accommodate more lone parents, recipients of disability allowances and dependent spouses of eligible categories.</P>
      <P>The position regarding eligibility for the scheme will, however, be kept under review.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case made by the schools in question for a remedial teacher service.</P>
      <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, <Col N="1682" /> I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
    <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
    <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remedial service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261 and 262 together.</P>
      <P>Children attending the special class in the school referred to by the Deputy will receive education from a teacher in a class with a maximum of six pupils.  In addition, these children will require a range of back-up services including those referred to by the Deputy.  The back-up services, with the exception of a child care assistant, will be made available by the North-Western Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department allocated a child care assistant post to the school in June 1995, when plans for the establishment of the special class were at an early stage of development.  It was indicated to the school that this post was being provided on <Col N="1683" /> the basis that it was to be used specifically for this class when it was established.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the operation of the class will rest in the first instance with the class teacher, under the direction of the principal of the school. However, the teacher and child care assistant will work closely with the professional staff employed by the health board.  This work will be arranged as part of the multi-disciplinary approach and in a spirit of close co-operation between the staff involved.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the letter mentioned by the Deputy, which relates to detailed information concerning the provision of supports for special classes.  Officials of my Department have been in contact with the school in question on an ongoing basis regarding the establishment of a class for children with severe-profound mental handicap. Plans for this class are now at an advanced stage and I understand that it will become operational in the near future.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive reply to the letter mentioned will issue within the next two weeks.</P>

      <P>A post of administrative principal in a special school is sanctioned when the enrolment in the school warrants a staffing of principal plus four assistants.  In the case of the school referred to by the Deputy, the current enrolment warrants a staff of principal plus three assistants.</P>
      <P>The school has recently applied to my Department for the appointment of an additional assistant teacher from the commencement of the 1997-98 school year.  My Department has requested a report from the primary inspectorate in order to consider this application.</P>

      <P>At primary level the time spent on music classes, including practical lessons, is estimated to be one hour per week, or 4.3 per cent of total instruction.</P>
      <P>Because of the flexible integrated nature of the curriculum in primary schools, it is difficult to state categorically what amount of time is spent on any particular aspect of the curriculum.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the principal teacher, in consultation with the school staff, to outline a plan of work for the school as a whole and to ensure that each area of the curriculum is adequately dealt with in all classes.</P>
      <P>At second level, all pupils who take music as an examination subject at the junior certificate must take a practical test as well as a written examination. On average the equivalent of at least one class period per week is given to practical music activities in the junior cycle.</P>
      <P>At leaving certificate level, depending on the options taken within the syllabus, pupils are involved in practical musical activities for one or two class periods per week.  Practical activities will be given greater emphasis in the new leaving certificate syllabus which will be introduced in September 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition through choirs, school orchestras and the presentation of musical works, practical <Col N="1689" /> musical activities feature prominently in the formal and informal curriculum in many schools.</P>

      <P>My Department's provision of a psychological service to primary schools began in 1990 with a pilot project in two designated areas.  The designated areas were west Tallaght-Clondalkin and south Tipperary. Four psychologists were employed on temporary contracts in the pilot areas.</P>
      <P>The project completed its pilot phase in September 1993, and was put on a permanent basis in the two areas in early 1994.  The four psychologists took up permanent posts in my Department.</P>
      <P>A further ten psychologists were appointed by my Department in 1995 in order to allow for the expansion of the psychological service to primary schools.  These psychologists were assigned, as a mater of priority, to national schools serving disadvantaged areas in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  In addition, the national schools in the original pilot project continue to have access to the psychological service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a policy statement concerning the development of the schools psychological service in the Government White Paper on Education, <Col N="1690" /> which envisages the expansion of the psychological service on a phased basis.  The provision of the service is seen as a function of the new education boards.</P>
    <P>Due to the need to limit public expenditure, it has not been possible to extend my Department's psychological service since 1995.  Any further expansion will take place in the context of government decisions on public sector numbers.</P>
    <P>As and when it becomes possible to extend the schools psychological service, the needs of children and of schools in various areas, including those in County Donegal, will be borne in mind. The number of psychologists appointed in any particular area or county will be related to its identified needs.</P>

      <P>My Department has not changed its policy in relation to assessment of the leaving certificate applied and following resolution of the element of the industrial dispute affecting the leaving certificate applied, arrangements have been made to reschedule the assessment of taskwork, originally scheduled for early February, in the period from 8 to 18 April 1997.</P>
      <P>This information has been communicated to schools and examiners and it is intended that the arrangements for the rescheduled assessments will be made by mutual agreement between the schools and the examiners concerned.</P>
      <P>I regret the inconvenience caused to schools, teachers, students, and examiners as a result of this rescheduling and I wish to express my appreciation of their co-operation with the new arrangements.</P>

      <P>While it is not Garda policy to engage private organisations in such services I understand that underwater search and rescue units and clubs have been very helpful to the gardaí in assisting in river searches for victims on a number of occasions in the past and that their services have been much appreciated.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that there are many such voluntary organisations throughout the country who assist the gardaí from time to time and give their services and facilities willingly in what can be considered to be a public civil service.  I regret that I do not have funds available to me to provide the financial assistance suggested by the Deputy to these clubs and voluntary organisations.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that this principle is fully adhered to in the majority of cases in this jurisdiction.  Due to operational reasons, however, a small percentage of prisoners are not accommodated separately but are, in all other respects, treated in accordance with their remand status.</P>
      <P>Construction is due to commence shortly on the new remand prison at Wheatfield, Clondalkin, Dublin 22.  This facility, which will provide an additional 400 spaces, will provide for the centralised classification and assessment of all of the State's remand prisoners.</P>

      <P>I am also informed that it is not Garda policy, for operational reasons, to remove vehicles from main roads to side streets.</P>
      <P>There are presently no regulations in force for clamping illegally parked vehicles.  The provision of such regulations is a matter for the Department of the Environment who are responsible for all road traffic regulations.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I have no function in relation to particular cases which arise under the landlord and tenant code.  The rights and obligations of a landlord and a tenant in respect of any particular tenancy are largely governed by the terms of the lease between them. There are, however, certain protections afforded to tenants under the various landlord and tenant Acts.</P>
      <P>While I am prepared to have examined any detailed proposals for change in the law in this area, I must emphasise that constitutional issues arise and in that context rights to new business leases under existing legislation are generally based on a market value rent being paid by the tenant.</P>

    <P>Under the general budget of the European Union, expenditure on operations to give effect to co-operation in the areas covered by Title VI of the Treaty on European Union is financed principally by the use of appropriations entered under Article B5-800 &mdash; (co-operation in the fields of Justice and Home Affairs.  The Council of Ministers under the Irish Presidency adopted a number of joint actions setting up multi-annual programmes defining the areas of co-operation in the fields of justice and home affairs.  In 1996, Ireland secured approval for funding of £152,715 in respect of a programme of seminars in accordance with the multi-annual programmes.  It is not possible to state, at this stage, what funding, if any, Ireland will receive in 1997 under the multi-annual programmes in question.  Approval was also secured for funding of 83,625 ECU, outside of the multi-annual programme arrangements, in respect of a seminar-citizens' hearing which took place in Dublin in November 1996.</P>

      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities. They have informed me that Kilcoole is policed by the gardaí assigned to Greystones Garda Station.  The area is regularly patrolled by both uniform and plain clothes personnel assisted as necessary by members of the divisional crime task force unit and the divisional drugs unit.  I understand there is a community garda assigned to the Kilcoole area on a full-time basis and that <Col N="1706" /> this member regularly liaises with the local community and has the use of a community policing van for the purposes of carrying out his duties.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me they are satisfied that the current Garda coverage afforded to Kilcoole area is adequate in meeting its present policing requirements.  However, they have assured me the situation will be kept under continuous review and any changes necessary made to ensure an adequate policing service to the area.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that arrangements are currently being made for the policing of the Murphy's Irish Golf Championship which is to beheld at Druids Glen from 3 to 6 July 1997.  While no final decision has been made in this regard it is envisaged that Garda personnel will be drawn from the Dublin Metropolitan Area (East) and the Wexford Division for the duration of the event.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of a blind person's pension since April 1996.  This is a means tested payment.  In order for the Department to consider backdating her pension entitlement to when she was first certified as being blind, a local officer will call to the person concerned shortly to determine her means between then and 1996.</P>
      <P>If it is decided to backdate her pension, then any arrears of pension would be paid to the person concerned net of the amount of adult dependant allowance paid to her husband in respect of her during that period.</P>

      <P>The wife of the person concerned applied <Col N="1716" /> for deserted wife's benefit following the breakdown of the marriage in June 1995.  Her application was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not a deserted wife within the meaning of social welfare legislation as her husband had not left of his own volition and that he had not wilfully refused or neglected to contribute to her support and maintenance.</P>
      <P>She appealed against that decision to the independent social welfare appeals office and an oral hearing of the appeal was heard on 23 October 1996.</P>
      <P>The appeals officer heard evidence from both parties and had before him all the documentary evidence, including copies of various court orders.  On the basis of all of the evidence available, including that adduced at the oral hearing, the appeals officer decided that she was a deserted wife within the meaning of social welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, an appeals officer is a statutory determining authority.  In the absence of new facts or fresh evidence his decision is final and conclusive subject to review by the chief appeals officer or appeal to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
      <P>The decision in this case has been reviewed by the chief appeals officer who does not consider that it is erroneous as to the facts or the law as to warrant a revision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a review of the current rules, this year's budget provided for the extension of the period during which arrears are paid in the case of late claims from six months to one year. The revised arrangements, which will apply in the case of retirement pension, old age (contributory) pension, widow's and widower's (contributory) pension and orphan's (contributory) allowance, are contained in section 32 of the Social Welfare Bill, 1997.  This Bill is currently passing through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The new arrangements, which will be brought into force as soon as the Bill has been enacted, will apply in relation to claims received on or after 1 January 1997.</P>
      <P>The provisions governing the payment of arrears on foot of late claims have given rise to a certain amount of criticism over the years, particularly in so far as claims for old age (contributory) pension and widow's and widower's (contributory) pensions are concerned.  A number of complaints have been made to the Ombudsman over the years and the issue has been highlighted in several of the Ombudsman's annual reports.  The issue is currently the subject of an investigation under section 4 (2) of the Ombudsman Act, 1980.  In this regard the Ombudsman has now completed his investigation and in accordance with section 6 (3) of the Ombudsman Act, he has recently sought the Department's response to the recommendations contained in his report.  The Department will be in a position to formulate its response in the near future when the provisions contained in section 32 of the Social Welfare Bill, 1997, have been enacted.  These provisions arise from some of the issues raised by the Ombudsman in the various consultations with my Department during the investigation.</P>
      <P>Firstly, section 32 incorporates into primary legislation existing regulatory provisions governing the payment of arrears on foot of late claims for the various social welfare payments, i.e. the payment of arrears to people who fail to claim within the prescribed time is generally limited to six months.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it provides for the extension, from six to 12 months, of the period in respect of which arrears of old age (contributory) pension, retirement pension, widow's (contributory) pension, widower's (contributory) pension and orphan's (contributory) allowance may be paid.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, this section provides for payment of arrears of up to six months in the case of late claims for family income supplement.  Under the present arrangements, there are no provisions for payment of arrears of FIS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, section 32 introduces into the system a greater degree of flexibility in dealing with cases where claims are made outside the prescribed time.  Provision has been made for regulatory powers under which arrears may be paid for periods in excess of the six and 12 month limits, subject to conditions and in circumstances to be specified in the regulations.  These decisions will <Col N="1718" /> be made by officers appointed by the Minister for this specific purpose.</P>
    <P>I believe these powers will prove to be sufficiently broad to provide the flexibility required to address the issues arising from the report of the Ombudsman of his investigation.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that the free schemes were extended in July 1996 to low-income pensioners who were not in receipt of a social welfare type payment.  The weekly income <Col N="1722" /> limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age (contributory) pension &mdash; currently £75 per week &mdash; plus any increases for dependants, plus £30.</P>

      <P>An underlying principle of a social insurance scheme is that, to establish entitlement to benefit, persons must have been insurably employed and paid appropriate rates of PRSI for <Col N="1723" /> a certain length of time.  The requirement in the case of treatment benefits, for persons aged 25 years and over, is a minimum of 260 weeks' paid contributions.  The person concerned does not satisfy this requirement.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the difficulties that those younger than 25 would have in meeting these insurance conditions, the contribution condition for those under 25 years of age was reduced in July 1992 to 39 paid contributions.</P>
      <P>Any further relaxation in the insurance conditions for receipt of treatment benefits would have financial implications and is a matter for consideration within the constraints of budgetary policy and the best targeting of available resources.</P>

      <P>The individual referred to by the Deputy is currently in receipt of lone parent's allowance (LPA) of £79.70 and a FÁS allowance of £64.50 per week, giving her a total weekly income of £144.20.</P>
      <P>FÁS training allowances are assessed as means for the purpose of determining entitlement to a rent supplement.  People who participate in FÁS training courses do not retain secondary benefits, with the exception of those participating in an area allowance enterprise scheme; a community employment scheme; or a back to work allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>The SWA scheme is administered in this case by the Midland Health Board and my Department has no function in determining individual entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The FÁS course attended by the person involved commenced on 15 January but the community welfare officer (CWO) was not advised by the individual of her changed circumstances.  As a result, she was overpaid rent supplement for the first four weeks of the course, at which stage the CWO became aware of the change in her circumstances <Col N="1726" /> and that there was a possibility of an overpayment. On review, it was discovered that the person concerned was no longer entitled to a rent supplement and she was advised on 14 February that her combined means of £144.20 exceeded the income guidelines for the supplement.</P>
    <P>If the person in question is dissatisfied with the decision of the community welfare officer, she may make an appeal to the appeals office, setting out her grounds for appeal.</P>
    <P>The person was advised of her right to appeal on 14 February 1997 and was supplied with the address and telephone number of the appeals officer in the Midland Health Board.  No appeal has been lodged to date.</P>
    <P>My Department is carrying out a review of secondary benefits.  The issue of people on FÁS courses retaining secondary benefits will be examined as part of that review.</P>

      <P>As the national authority with responsibility for the overall management of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, my Department received £43.3225 million of European Regional Development Fund funding during 1996.  With the exception of a small amount retained under the technical assistance provision of the programme for monitoring purposes, these funds were transferred to the implementing agencies, namely the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the Department of the Marine, Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development.  These are the bodies designated for the distribution of grants awarded under the programme.  It is expected that a further £70 million of European Regional Development Fund grant assistance will be drawn down under the Operational Programme for Tourism in 1997, for similar distribution to the implementing agencies.</P>
      <P>An Bord Tráchtála receives European Regional Development Fund funding under the marketing sub-programme of the operational programme for industrial development, the lead Department of which is the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  European Regional Development Fund funding for expenditure by an Bord Tráchtála during 1996 was £10.51 million and is expected to be £10.77 million in 1997.</P>

      <P>While my Department is the national authority designated with overall responsibility for the management of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, grants are approved by independent management boards established under the programme.  Consequently, my Department has no grant approving role.</P>
      <P>Generally, under the programme, the consideration of regional spread is one of the criteria exercised by these boards in arriving at their decisions on grant applications.  However, only one measure under the programme, i.e. the select hotel accommodation improvement scheme, for existing small and medium sized hotels with a capacity of up to 100 bedrooms graded up to 3 star level, has a specific restriction based on geographical location.  The purpose of the restriction is to ensure that hotels outside the main metropolitan areas, where demand for hotel beds tends to be higher and less seasonal, are the primary beneficiaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position in relation to proposals to develop a national conference centre in Ballsbridge, Dublin 4, is that following the failure of the open tendering competition to produce an acceptable private sector proposal, an alternative strategy was pursued whereby Bord Fáilte, under the aegis of the independent management board for product development, examined an outline proposal from the Royal Dublin Society (RDS) which, as a voluntary body, is potentially eligible for consideration for a higher rate of capital assistance normally reserved under the tourism OP for public and similar bodies.</P>
      <P>Upon completion of its examination of the RDS proposal, Bord Fáilte, on the recommendation of the management board, commissioned an independent cost-benefit analysis which is required under the tourism OP in the case of all large projects.  This was undertaken by an experienced UK consultancy firm who were selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure.  The results were favourable to the RDS proposal.</P>
      <P>The Government, having taken into account a number of factors including the recommendations of the management board and Bord Fáilte, and the results of the cost benefit analysis, agreed on 5 November last to make a submission to the European Commission, recommending formal approval of the proposed development by the RDS.  The Government is recommending approval of 75 per cent capital grant aid subject to the existing financial provision for such a project in the current tourism OP.  The proposal has been submitted to the European Commission for approval, as required under the OP for projects of this scale, and the Commission's response is now awaited.  The question of the length of time required to examine an application of such a scale is one more properly addressed to the European Commission but I can assure the Deputy that I have spared no effort in urging a speedy response to the application.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a complaint has been made to the Commission but to date I have had no formal notification of such from the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A specific timescale for commencement or completion of the national conference centre project <Col N="1731" /> cannot be determined until the proposal has been formally approved by the European Commission, and matters such as planning permission are in place.  There is, however, no reason at this stage to believe that the project cannot be developed under the tourism OP in accordance with the permissible timeframe.</P>

      <P>Assessment by life assurance companies in respect of applicants for life assurance with a diabetic condition is a matter for each individual insurance company based on its underwriting criteria and claims experience.  Insurance, by its very nature, is based on the concept of risk and contingent upon any uncertain event or circumstance. In all cases, the acceptance, rejection or deferral of an application for a life assurance policy is based on the individual's insurer's assessment of the risk represented by a particular medical condition.  Insurers will vary in their risk assessment of different ailments and diseases. The more prudent insurers may impose extra premiums for relatively minor medical conditions and refuse applications that other companies would more readily accept.  Other insurers may specialise in insuring applicants suffering from specific medical conditions such as diabetes and forms of heart disease.  There is no discrimination by insurers against diabetics, <i>per se.</i></P>

      <P>While there is no statutory requirement that co-operatives should be registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1978, it is the case that most co-operatives are so registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Schedule to the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, describes the items that should be included in the rules of any society registered under that Act.  For instance, paragraph 8 of the schedule requires provision to be made for the audit of accounts and for the appointment of auditors or a public auditor, while paragraph 3 of the same schedule deals, <i>inter alia,</i> with the mode of holding meetings.  There is, however, no requirement under the Acts that shareholders must give notice of their intention <Col N="1732" /> to change financial auditors, and the registrar considers it unlikely that any co-operatives have rules which would provide specifically for such notice.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I will be happy to check out the position if he communicates with me.</P>
    <P>Case law over the years has established that the Registrar of Friendly Societies cannot oblige societies, including co-operatives registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, to include provisions in their rules over and above those required by law.  Accordingly, the registrar considers that he is not in a position under existing legislation to require the stipulation suggested by the Deputy, if societies were not prepared to amend their rules in the manner suggested on a voluntary basis.</P>

    <P>Significant progress has been made in achieving a better gender balance on CE.  At the end of 1996, 43 per cent of participants were female compared with 36 per cent in 1995 and 20 per cent in early 1994.  This increase is due to several factors, in particular the wider variety of work available under CE as well as increased numbers of lone parents participating in the schemes.</P>
    <P>The duration of unemployment prior to joining a CE scheme in respect of those participating on CE schemes at present is as follows: under one year, 4 per cent; one to two years, 43 per cent; two to three years, 16 per cent; three years or over, 37 per cent.  Prior to the introduction of the two CE options in 1996, the eligibility criteria for joining a CE scheme was 12 months or more on unemployment benefit or any period on unemployment assistance.  Consequently, other than meeting these criteria, the duration of unemployment prior to joining a CE scheme was not collected.</P>
    <P>Since the eligibility criteria for CE apply equally regardless of marital status or educational qualification, there has been no need or requirement to ask participants for this information and it is not therefore collected by FÁS.  However, a profile of the dependency status of participants is available because the amount of payment that a participant receives on CE is determined by their Social Welfare dependency status before they commenced on CE.  The following table shows the dependency status of CE participants for each of the years in question:</P>

    <P>While information regarding the educational qualification of participants is not collected by FÁS, the 1996 FÁS-ESRI follow-up survey on CE participants who completed CE in 1994 gives some insight into the matter.  That survey indicated that 34 per cent of participants had only primary education while another 30 per cent had attained junior certificate level.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it was not possible in the time available to get all the information requested and I will communicate with the Deputies in the matter.</P>

      <P>As the national authority for the European Social Fund, all ESF transfers to Ireland come through my Department.  In 1996, Ireland's ESF receipts amounted to £252.989 million. My Department's current projection of total ESF receipts for 1997 is £313.7 million; among the variables which would impact on the final outturn for 1997 is the exchange rate of the Irish pound against the ECU.</P>
      <P>Almost all ESF aid is transferred to other Departments and agencies and to private beneficiaries for use under approved operational programmes, community initiatives and innovative actions programmes.</P>
      <P>My Department is directly responsible for managing a number of operational programmes and community initiatives which receive support from the Social Fund.  In the case of some programmes, EU aid is also provided from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).  The Department of Finance, in its capacity as the national authority for the European Regional Development Fund, is the central recipient of all European Regional Development Fund funds from Brussels.</P>
      <P>Details of EU receipts in 1996 in respect of the programmes which my Department administers, together with latest forecasts for 1997, are as follows:</P>

      <Col N="1743" /> In addition to the programmes listed above, the county enterprise boards, which are under the aegis of my Department, benefited from ESF and European Regional Development Fund funding under the operational programme for local, urban and rural development.  This operational programme is administered by the Department of An Taoiseach.  ESF receipts for the county enterprise boards in 1996 amounted to £0.383; ESF receipts for the boards in 1997 are estimated at £2.334 million.</P>
    <P>ERDF aid of approximately £10 million was received in 1996 in respect of actions carried out by the county enterprise boards.  Projected European Regional Development Fund receipts for 1997 in respect of the board's activities are estimated at £12 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>To achieve a better regional distribution of jobs across the country requires a strong co-operative approach between the development agencies, local authorities and infrastructure-service providers.  I am ensuring that this approach is pursued by the agencies for which I have responsibility.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is currently implementing a new regional policy for employment growth in locations outside of the larger urban centres.</P>
      <P>This new policy involves: financial incentives being biased in favour of smaller regional locations with higher grant levels as appropriate to each individual case.  The involvement of private sector investors, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory contruction at key locations.  Working in partnership with local authorities to have available quality, serviced sites at priority locations for new industrial investment.</P>
      <P>In addition, IDA Ireland is devoting additional resources at senior executive level to oversee this new focus.  This, allied to the regional structure and emphasis of all the industrial development agencies for which I have responsibility, will further assist in achieving the balanced industrial development and employment creation which is a central objective of this Government.</P>
      <P>Clearly, in the final analysis, location decisions are made by industrialists themselves but the policy approach outlined will focus consideration or options additional to location in the major cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> This policy will yield positive results for rural areas.  We have to recognise also a fundamental shift in the mix of IDA's business in recent years. More than half of all job creating investments are not mobile.  They come from existing overseas companies expanding their operations and these companies usually expand on their existing site. Secondly, many of the new technology based and larger scale investments have requirements that can only be met near larger urban centres.  If Ireland as a country does not provide the support services, infrastructure and logistics they require at or near large urban centres, they will go elsewhere in Europe or beyond it.</P>
    <P>Forbairt is also ensuring that a good geographical spread of development is maintained. Specialist technology transfer executives are based in the Forbairt regional offices in order to specifically bring the benefits of these initiatives to all areas and it is intended that a greater focus will be put on these activities in 1997.</P>
    <P>Forbairt also operates a linkage programme which works with companies to maximise the amount of raw materials, components and other major purchasers.  Significant progress was made in 1996 in extending the benefits of this programme to all the regions, and executives in regional offices will be focusing on this activity in 1997.</P>
    <P>Forbairt is taking steps to exploit developments, under the small business operational programme-measure 3, which examiness initiatives for extending the range of support and assistance to service businesses.  Given the nature of the projects which can emerge in this sector, it is likely that they will contribute to a wider dispersal of new employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Since the county enterprise boards were established in 1993 they have played a key role in developing local enterprise throughout the country. They have created over 8,500 full-time job equivalents.  These jobs have been created in every county in the State and reflect the potential for job creation represented by local development initiatives.  I am confident that the support provided by the boards will continue to ensure the development of micro-enterprise and job creation throughout all regions of the State.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the widespread concern in County Cavan at the announcement by three major employers (details supplied) of in the region of 160 redundancies; the proposals, if any, he has to offset such a severe loss of employment in the east Cavan area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8181/97]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about proposed job changes in the companies to which he refers.  I have been informed that redundancies where applicable are intended to be made on a voluntary basis in the companies concerned, a significant proportion to be made on a phased basis over the next two years.  I am further advised that one of the companies mentioned is in fact undertaking an expansion of its activities leading to an increase in employment of almost 100 over the next three years.  The company has plants at a number of locations in Cavan and throughout the country.  I have been advised by Forbairt that the recently announced expansion will involve the transfer of a number of jobs from the company's plant at Shercock to a new plant in County Meath.</P>
      <P>I think that we must accept that the normal cycle of business inevitably means changes in company fortunes over time.  Commercial companies are not immune to the pressures of open market competition and a certain level of negative as well as positive change is to be expected in the numbers employed in individual companies as they react and adjust to these pressures.</P>
      <P>As regards the broader context, a recent positive development in Cavan has been the announcement of an additional 129 jobs in Pauwels Trafo in the town.  In addition, negotiations have concluded between Cavan County Council and IDA Ireland to acquire a site in Cavan town on which a privately financed advance factory will be constructed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I announced on 3 March 1997, IDA Ireland is currently implementing a new regional policy for employment growth in locations outside the larger urban centres involving: financial incentives being biased in favour of smaller regional <Col N="1746" /> locations with higher grant levels as appropriate to each individual case; the involvement of private sector investors, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations; working in partnership with local authorities to have available quality, serviced sites at priority locations for new industrial investment.</P>
    <P>While the decision in regard to the location of an industrial project is a matter for the promoters, this new policy should give an added bonus to regional locations.</P>
    <P>The industrial development agencies will continue to maximise their efforts to promote Cavan to potential new investors while also encouraging the expansion of existing companies located in the area.</P>

    <P>In addition, the county enterprise boards assisted enterprises throughout all areas in the county in the creation of 49 full-time and eight part-time jobs in the county in 1995.</P>
    <P>While Forbairt assisted job creation in a number of enterprises throughout the county, there were a number of positive developements in relation to IDA in Donegal during and since 1995.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; IDA Ireland is working closely with the existing base of companies and appointed a Development Manager, Mr. Eamonn Howley, to work with a select number of companies in the North-West Donegal Region with a view to expanding their existing operations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" />&mdash;&nbsp; On the greenfield investment side, IDA Ireland continues to market Donegal to overseas companies.  There are a number of small vacant buildings and industrial sites in various locations including Buncrana, Carndonagh, Moville, Ballyshannon, Letterkenny which are being promoted for overseas investment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; In 1996, IDA agreed with Donegal County Council to develop a business park in Letterkenny. Work on this initiative has been ongoing and a full planning application will shortly be submitted to Donegal County Council.  As soon as full planning permission and services have been put in place, work will commence on this park which will include the construction of a 25,000 sq. ft. advance building.  This business park will enhance the area's attractiveness to potential investors and will assist IDA in marketing the area to potential overseas clients.</P>
    <P>As announced, recently IDA Ireland is currently implementing a new regional policy for employment growth in locations outside the larger urban centres.  It is expected that in line with other locations, the Border region will benefit from this recent announcement &mdash; where financial incentives will be biased in favour of regional locations with higher grant levels as appropriate to each individual case.</P>
    <P>This policy will involve working in partnership with location authorities to have available quality, serviced sites at priority locations for new industrial investment; stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction by the private sector at key locations.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland has already been responding to the challenge of attracting new inward investment to the Border region through the acquisition of land for development.</P>

      <P>The forest property at Lough Key was vested in Coillte Teoranta under the provisions of the Forestry Act, 1988, as part of the total forest estate previously managed directly by the State.  This decision reflected the fact that the Louth Key property contained forests of considerable value which required careful silvicultural management and expertise and which was readily available in Coillte Teoranta.  This silvicultural requirement has not changed in the interim and in the circumstances there are no plans to transfer the property on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Coillte Teoranta is, of course, aware that there are additional, important recreational benefits inherent in the Louth Key Forest Park which are greatly appreciated by the general public.  It is, accordingly, the company's policy to maintain public access to this facility, with which I am in full agreement.</P>

      <P>The position is that under the present round of Structural Funds, the whole of Ireland is classified as an Objective One region. This classification results in an EU contribution of up to 75 per cent of structural measures as against a maximum of 50 per cent in regions outside Objective One areas.</P>
      <P>This Department is involved in two operational programmes under the Community Support Framework for Ireland, 1994-99 under the Structural Funds as follows: the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry (OPARDF) and the Food Sub-Programme of the Operational Programme for Industrial Development.</P>
      <P>Under one major aid scheme of the OPARDF, compensatory headage allowances are paid on specified animals in certain disadvantaged areas of the country where natural production conditions are difficult, as defined under Council Regulation (EEC) 2328/91, as amended.  Furthermore, within that designation, some areas are further designated as severely handicapped and qualify for extra payments for specified animals.</P>
      <P>Special rates of aid also apply to the above disadvantaged areas in the implementation of the following schemes under the farm diversification measure: (a) Housing-Handling Facilities for Alternative Enterprises, (b) Agri-Tourism.</P>
      <P>Under (a), grant rates of 50 per cent of the cost of investment are available, subject to certain ceilings, for sport horses, deer and goats, etc. as against 40 per cent in the rest of the country.  The financial allocation for this scheme has now been fully committed and applications on hands are being processed.</P>
      <P>Under (b), higher rates of aid are available for the provision of leisure facilities for applicants from disadvantaged areas of the country, i.e. a rate of 50 per cent of investment, subject to certain ceilings, as against 40 per cent for the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the food sub-programme, it provides for EU aid of 35 per cent for disadvantaged areas as against 25 per cent in the remainder of the country for investment projects in relation to the marketing and processing of agricultural <Col N="1753" /> products under Council Regulation (EEC) 866/90.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), more commonly known as &ldquo;blue ear&rdquo;, is a condition which affects pigs and has no known implications for human health.  It is highly contagious within the pig population and can in fact be wind-borne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that in excess of 30 pig herds in <Col N="1754" /> Northern Ireland are now believed to be infected. Officials of my Department have been in frequent contact with their counterparts in Northern Ireland since the first outbreaks there several weeks ago.  This has been important not alone in terms of monitoring the evolving nature and scale of the problem in the North but also of maintaining a necessary awareness of the approach being adopted by the authorities there to sampling, testing, containment, slaughter, etc.  In that context my Department, on being notified of the first outbreaks of PRRS in Northern Ireland, publicly advised all involved in the pig industry of the risks of transmission, including, specifically, the transmission risks associated with the transportation of animals and the vehicles used for such purposes, and identified particular measures which should be taken to minimise such risks.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have also met with representatives of pig producers on a number of occasions, most recently within the past week, and have worked very closely with them in addressing this issue.  Arising from these contacts my Department undertook to carry out a programme of sampling at a number of processing plants with the specific objective of testing pigs supplied from herds in both Northern Ireland and the Republic for PRRS.  Checks made by my Department to date would indicate that there is at least one processing plant still slaughtering pigs from Northern Ireland.  Reports that other plants are also processing such pigs are being followed up.  Testing carried out by my Department on samples taken have established the presence of PRRS in 49 animals which originated in five herds in Northern Ireland.  In all cases the details have been given by my Department to the Department of Agriculture in the North for follow-up action.</P>
    <P>There is to date no evidence of PRRS in any pig herd in the Republic and I am obviously concerned that we should do everything possible to minimise the spread of the disease from Northern Ireland.  The best means of addressing this problem lies in all elements of the industry in the Republic taking effective, co-operative, risk minimisation action themselves and, where possible, in collaboration with their Northern counterparts.</P>
    <P>My Department will of course continue to work closely with and provide all appropriate support to the industry on this issue.  In particular, the Department will continue its programme of testing at pig plants and will, as it has done up to this point, ensure that results are speedily made available to all concerned.  I also anticipate further contacts involving the Departments of Agriculture in both jurisdictions and representatives of the pig industry in both the Republic and Northern Ireland in coming weeks which will focus on limiting the spread of the disease.</P>

      <P>The controls applicable to landspreading of wastes, including slurry spraying, are those put in place by the Minister for the Environment to prevent pollution.  The legislation which applies are the Water Pollution Act, 1977, the Water Pollution (Amendment) Act, 1990 and the Waste Management Act, 1996.  My Department does not have any statutory controls in place in this area.</P>
      <P>My Department's involvement in this area is largely in recommending codes of good agricultural practice to farmers which will, correctly applied, maximise the nutrient value of such wastes and at the same time minimise the risk of water pollution from point or diffuse sources.</P>
      <P>In 1996 my Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, introduced the Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution by Nitrates.  This code sets out the best farming and waste management practices to be followed in the interests of sustainable farming and avoidance of water pollution.</P>
      <P>The storage and landspreading of all organic wastes, including slurries, are dealt with in this code which is freely available from my Department, the Department of the Environment, Teagasc offices, local authorities and offices of the regional fisheries boards.</P>
      <P>Additionally farmers participating in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) are precluded from spreading slurry within 50 metres of any private dwelling, school, public building or amenity area.</P>
      <P>Landspeading is the most effective means of recycling organic wastes, including animal slurries, and accordingly, the emphasis from my Department's perspective is on advising and encouraging farmers to recycle such wastes in ways that respect the natural and living environments.</P>

      <P>The level of exports of live cattle up to 9 March 1997 was 10,748, of which 4,831 were exported outside the EU and 5,917 to EU markets. This compares with 36,941 and 6,540 cattle to those markets, respectively, in 1996.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that beef exports to date are approximately 120,000 tonnes which represents an increase of 8 per cent on the same period last year.  Some 17,000 tonnes of beef has been sold into intervention this year.</P>
      <P>Every possible effort is being made to reopen all markets.  In this regard a Libyan delegation is in the country this week examining our veterinary controls with a view to getting the live export ban lifted.  This follows on a visit by the Egyptian veterinary authorities earlier this year.  I am hopeful that these visits will bear fruit in the near future.</P>

      <P>ALF includes bovine animal data from the following sources: Database of headage-premium schemes; animals recorded in ERAD special category herds; animals registered under the calf birth registration scheme; animals slaughtered at meat plants and at local abattoirs; animals exported live.</P>
      <P>Using these sources, ALF is able to give important location information on a large number of individual bovine animals, thus helping us to provide significant additional reassurances as regards the origin and status of our cattle and beef.

      <P>Measures adopted by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in October 1996 obliged member states to introduce an early marketing premium scheme for veal calves or the calf processing scheme.  As Ireland has no veal industry we are obliged under Council Regulation (EC) No. 2222/96 to introduce the calf processing premium scheme.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the measures is to assist in bringing the market into balance, thereby assisting producer prices and facilitating orderly marketing within the EU and internationally</P>
      <P>A processing premium of 120 ecu is payable on male dairy breed calves and 150 ecu on beef breed calves which are less than 20 days old.  The premium will be paid only on animals which are in a fit and healthy condition on presentation and are processed in conformity with the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>To date 8,521 calves have been processed under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The price paid to milk producers for their milk is essentially a commercial matter between themselves and their milk purchasers. While the price for butter and SMP is supported under the EU common organisation of the market for milk and milk products, the actual price for milk paid to producers is a function of a number of factors, including the products into which the milk is processed and the markets on which those products are sold.</P>
      <P>It is the case that international dairy markets have weakened during 1996 and this is now reflected in the price being returned to producers. It is also the case that recent revaluations of the Irish green rate have given rise to a reduced level of support in Irish pounds.  As regards the latter, the compensation package, which I recently announced, will offset some of the effects on producers' incomes of the recent revaluations.</P>

      <P>The position is that when dealing with applications from farmers under the various EU headage and premia schemes my Department may only implement the degree of flexibility which is allowed under the EU regulations governing the schemes.  Generally speaking, payments are not refused simply on the basis of trivial <Col N="1760" /> clerical errors in the completion of application forms.  Failure by farmers to properly complete application forms does, however, lead to a delay in processing.  In practice many errors such as invalid tag numbers are capable of correction following consultation with applicants and this type of correction is carried out on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Help sheets and checklists are made available with all application forms and the forms have been revised and simplified to assist farmers and to minimise errors.</P>
      <P>In so far as area aid applications are concerned the position is that the EU allows correction by member states of &ldquo;obvious errors&rdquo;.  One category of obvious error is defined as purely clerical and containing no risk of fraud such as boxes not filled in or information lacking, mathematical errors, figures reversed and incorrect plot numbers which can be corrected by reference to accompanying maps.  Such errors may be corrected without prior notification from the applicant. Less obvious errors can be corrected only where the farmer notifies the error to my Department before he-she is made aware that any on-farm inspection is to be carried out or before he-she is notified of that error by my Department.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the foregoing that there is flexibility for dealing with obvious errors made by farmers in completing application forms.  I have also put in place a formal appeals facility in my Department to handle appeals against decisions taken under the headage and premia schemes.</P>

      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, the Transport Operational Programme and the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme provide for an EU backed investment programme in the development of economic infrastructure in the aviation, public transport, postal, energy and telecommunications sectors.  These investments are intended to support national sectoral policy objectives.  All parts of the country including rural areas will derive benefits from these investments even though they may be located in specific regions.  There was extensive consultation at national and sub-regional levels in the development of the National Plan which outlined the Government's proposed strategies for the use of EU funding over the period 1994-99</P>

      <P>I am aware of this problem in the Navan area but understand that it is confined to the direct off air reception of UK television services.  As the Deputy will know such channels are available in this country only because of the fortuitous overspill of signals from UK television transmitters.  As new Irish national programme services are rolled out, and existing ones developed, we may need to use the frequencies on which these services are carried for national purposes.  The result will be that the scope available to protect the availability of the UK signals will, unfortunately, diminish.</P>
      <P>In this particular case, however, I understand that the source of the interference is not from another television service.  The problem has been identified and my Department, in co-operation with RTE, is taking steps to rectify the matter.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, considerable progress has been made in the renewable energy area under my stewardship.</P>
      <P>In March 1995, I announced the results of the first Alternative Energy Requirement scheme (AER 1).  This competition was designed by my Department, in conjunction with ESB, to secure an additional 75MW of electricity generation capacity from alternative energy sources.  In total the AERI initiative yielded contract offers for 111MW of capacity broken down as follows:</P>

    <P>In December 1995, I launched the competitive tendering scheme (AER II) to secure an electricity generating plant of up to 30 megawatts using biomass or waste as a fuel.  Following independent assessment of the tenders for this competition, I announced on 27 February 1997, that the winner is a consortium of Foster Wheeler Power Systems Inc., based in New Jersey, USA and ESB Power Generation.  They will build, own and operate a 30MW waste-to-energy electricity generating station at Goddamendy, Ballycoolin, Co. Dublin.</P>
    <P>In April 1996, I launched a long-term strategy for renewable energy entitled Renewable Energy &mdash; A Strategy for the Future.  Under the strategy I have set targets for the development of renewables in Ireland up to the year 2010.</P>
    <P>My strategy sets a target of an additional 100MW from renewables by the end of 1999.  This consists of 90MW from wind energy, 3MW from Hydro and 7MW from biomass/waste.  I have also allowed for the construction of Ireland's first wave energy to electricity pilot plant.  This additional capacity of 100MW will be secured by means of a competition, known as AER III, which I launched yesterday.  Subject to EU approval, European Regional Development Fund grant aid of 9.3 MECU (approximately IR£6.9 million) will be available under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme to support projects up to the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>The process of appointing an independent agency to conduct the competition to secure these targets is now under way.</P>
    <P>My strategy also set targets for the period 2000 to 2010 consisting of an annual target of 30MW for wind energy and 1MW for hydro.  I have yet to decide on targets for biomass/waste.</P>
    <P>The EU Thermie programme provides financial support for energy demonstration projects, including renewables.  In recognition of the positive impact of this on renewable energy development in Ireland, I have included a special Thermie support initiative in my renewable energy strategy which guarantees electricity market access for successful renewable energy Thermie projects.</P>
    <P>Altener has contributed significantly to the raising of the profile of renewables right across the EU.  Since its inception in 1993, Ireland has been particularly successful in participating in the programme.  To date, total funding of 1.9 MECU has been secured by a number of institutions ranging from Government Departments, semi-State bodies, third level institutions to the private sector.  While most of the studies and projects are still under way, those that have been completed have provided valuable information in the areas of, for example, biofuels, biomass and training <Col N="1767" /> and education in solar and bioclimatic design. The reports of these studies have been disseminated across the member states.</P>
    <P>Ireland is represented on the four member team appointed by the Commission to evaluate Altener I and is thus actively involved in recommending a strategy for Altener II.  The commission is currently working on a proposal based on the team's recommendation of a three pronged approach namely: (i) standards development and harmonisation; (ii) information and marketing; and (iii) special projects on such topics as the de-regulated electricity market, heating systems and CHP, interaction between Altener II and national fiscal and other measures, socio-economic studies and transport.</P>
    <P>Unlike Altener I, the proposal is also expected to provide a fund for capital investment in technologies which have been technically proven but which have not penetrated the market for economic or other reasons.  I am confident that Irish interests will participate actively in Altener II when it is announced by the Commission.</P>

On St. Patrick's Day I attended a medal parade for Irish troops in Lebanon.  The primary purpose of my visit was to see for myself the work of Irish military personnel, serving in the region and to assure them, on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland, of how proud we are of the outstanding manner in which they have consistently performed their duties on United Nations service.</P>
      <P>I was accompanied by my wife, my private secretary, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and the Chief of Staff's Personal Staff Officer. The total cost in relation to the visit is not yet available but is estimated to be in the region of £12,000.</P>

      <P>EU Structural Funds are designed to support the Community aim of strengthening economic and social cohesion and reducing disparities between the various regions.  For the purposes of the current Community Support Framework, Ireland is classified as an Objective One region.</P>
      <P>As the fisheries industry is concentrated in rural communities around the coast grant-aid for investment in this sector is focused on activities in coastal regions.  The Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-99 is currently providing for a total investment of £140 million in the fishing industry throughout the coastal regions.  The programme provides grant-aid towards fleet renewal, aquaculture development, fish processing and associated activities.  In addition, the PESCA Initiative which provides for investment of some £10 million is an EU-funded programme which aims to assist fishermen and those dependent on fisheries to respond to the structural changes in the fisheries sector by offering opportunities for diversification into other areas of economic activity.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the importance of our inland fisheries resource, a comprehensive investment programme to develop the tourism angling product totalling almost £19 million over the six year period 1994-99 was included in the Tourism Operational Programme.  The purpose of the tourism angling measure is to ensure that our coarse, game and sea angling is upgraded to the best international standards with a view to increasing substantially tourist angling and revenue and the creation of valuable sustainable new jobs, particularly in the more remote and disadvantaged areas where the majority of our prime fisheries are located.  The Central Fisheries Board and my Department are charged with the responsibility for the administration and implementation of the Tourism Angling Measure.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland are the responsible authorities for administering the fisheries measures in the Joint INTERREG Programme for Northern Ireland and Ireland 1994-99 and the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland 1995-99.  Only projects located to the six Border counties of this State and-or Northern Ireland are eligible to benefit from these two programmes.</P>

Following the initial examination of the proposal a number of issues have been raised with the company where additional information is required.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy was advised on 4 February 1997, the level <Col N="1780" /> of licence fees in the Foyle Fisheries area is primarily a matter for the Foyle Fisheries Commission, subject to the general requirement that regulations made by the commission are approved by the Minister for the Marine and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>A direct comparison between the Foyle Fisheries Commission and its counterpart bodies cannot be readily made and would have to take account of the different characteristics of the regions, the differences between roles, functions and operations, as well as the differing financing/funding arrangements which apply.</P>
