      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss an urgent matter of public importance, namely, the need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to take remedial action to protect farmers' livelihoods in view of the crash in cattle, beef and milk prices.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take the report from the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on the Housing (Miscellaneous) Provisions Bill, 1996 and No. 1 &mdash; the Finance Bill, 1997, Second Stage (Resumed).  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m. Private Members' Business shall be No. 54 &mdash; Heritage and Cultural Events (Televisual Access Protection) Bill, 1997 &mdash; Second Stage (Resumed) and the proceedings on the Second Stage thereof shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not normally raise anything about Question Time on the Order of Business, <Col N="486" /> but every day the Taoiseach or somebody else rules out of order most of the questions we table. This is normally the function of the Ceann Comhairle's office.  We examined closely the questions we tabled today, but those on the North, the McCole case and many others were ruled out of order.  A question on the 1400th anniversary of the death of Saint Colmcille will be taken, but more urgent questions will not.  Consequently, I have no option but to raise this matter now.  We have given broad bipartisan support to the Government for the past two and a quarter years. Will the Taoiseach repudiate the disgraceful and unwarranted remarks of the Minister for Tourism and Trade who stated that a visit by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds &mdash; one of the architects of the peace process &mdash; to Northern Ireland to open a community centre in the Falls Road &ldquo;cast doubt on Fianna Fáil's unequivocal commitment to democratic politics&ldquo;?  I am proud of our stand on democratic politics and on the Northern issue.  Will the Taoiseach disown the Minister today?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the gesture on the part of Deputy Reynolds was ill advised and open to misconstruction.  I have no doubt about Deputy Ahern's views on this matter.  Indeed, I compliment him on the article he published in the <i>Irish News.</i> It is interesting, however, that when asked to do so, Deputy Reynolds did not support what Deputy Ahern wrote in the <i>Irish News.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>All my questions today on the North have been ruled out of order.  I have been deprived of an opportunity to debate this matter yesterday and today.  In the interests of fair play, will the Taoiseach disown the remark his Minister made, which, I quote, &ldquo;cast doubt on Fianna <Col N="488" /> Fáil's unequivocal commitment to democratic politics&rdquo;.  I lead that party and I ask the Taoiseach to withdraw that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt about the commitment of the Deputy or his party to democratic politics, but I believe that his inability to control the activities of Deputy Reynolds in this matter does create doubt, not in my mind, but in the minds of others who are not as well aware as I am of all the Deputy's statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a separate matter, yesterday on the Order of Business the Taoiseach said it would serve no useful purpose for this Government to look into the Vincent Browne phone tapping matter.  In the light of a very public conflict between the then Deputy Garda Commissioner and the then Minister for Justice on <i>Prime Time</i> last night, will the Taoiseach agree there is cause to look behind this matter and the subsequent settlement, with taxpayers' money, by this Government and by the Minister for Justice with the journalist concerned with a view to keeping the whole matter secret?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was raised yesterday on the Order of Business when the Taoiseach responded.  Will the Taoiseach agree to look into this matter?  There is much public concern about it, given that the whole matter was intended to be hushed up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has promised legislation on the MMDS deflector system a number of times in this House.  In view of yesterday's High Court decision will he now say when legislation will come before the House?  Will he <Col N="489" /> release the consultant's secret report on which his Government has been sitting for some weeks? Will he let us have the Attorney General's advice on the matter?  In particular, will the Taoiseach tell us what plans he has to prevent over 100,000 people being without a multi-channel service in the next few weeks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, this country is governed by a Constitution and where commitments have been given &mdash; and in this instance they were given to exclusivity for services to particular individuals by a previous Government &mdash; the Government obviously has to work within the constraints imposed by commitments given by its predecessor, given that we have a written Constitution.  Indeed, the responsible Minister of the time is sitting beside the Deputy and could advise him on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not constitutional two and a half years ago.  The Taoiseach did not give it much examination then.  It was done on an electoral basis.  The Taoiseach gave commitments to a crowded hall in Carrigaline two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is committed to a clear objective in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, to provide licensing for deflector systems throughout the country.  The Taoiseach gave a solemn promise and commitment to a crowded hall in Carrigaline two and a half years ago that he would give them an interim licence immediately on his return to Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>An interim licence, mind you.  He would not wait for any report or legislation; he would give an interim licence, but he reneged on that and did so on sectoral grounds.  He made a promise he could not keep.  It says a lot about integrity and about his commitment to the promises he gave to people two and a half years ago.</P>

      <P>I am not particularly worried about contracts.  The Taoiseach has been here a long time.  He knew about the facts before he went to Carrigaline.  He knew the history of this case.  He gave a commitment in full knowledge of everything, yet he reneged on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right to say that the Government, in its programme, seeks to introduce a fair licensing system, which would allow access to some of the people who are not now licensed to provide services on a cost-effective basis and to allow a greater degree of competition. The difficulty is that in so far as the law is concerned, this Government is bound by commitments and exclusive contracts that were given by Deputy Martin's party when Fianna Fáil was in Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, as the Deputy knows, any Government has to work within the legal obligations which have been undertaken by its predecessor.  I have no doubt that Deputy Martin, who is an increasingly experienced politician, understands this perfectly well.  I assure Deputy Martin, whom I know is concerned about <Col N="491" /> this matter, that we will do everything possible to resolve this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

Because there are approximately 110,000 to 120,000 more people at work than when we entered office, there is a need to look critically at how we spend money on training to ensure it is focused on the areas where job opportunities arise and where skills shortages exist.

      <P>Yesterday I made a point about the hypocrisy of the Progressive Democrats and of the Fianna Fáil Party on water charges.  When Deputy Harney was asked to comment on the results of a public opinion poll which were not <Col N="499" /> very favourable to her on radio this week she launched into a tirade on water charges and suddenly realised she had said many things that are politically unpopular that she had not intended to say.  She and her party tried to claw back by making statements to which we have been listening ever since.  Water charges are unpopular with 95 per cent of the people in Deputy Harney's constituency and about 75 per cent of people throughout the country.  Public representatives and Members of the Dáil and Government have to take those views into account and reflect on them.  It is also dishonest and untrue to suggest that water rates are being replaced by motor tax. Motor tax is replacing the rates support grants to local authorities.  Deputy McDowell made that inaccurate and almost dishonest statement in the House yesterday.  If he was a member of a local authority, he might know better.</P>
      <P>We all know that the amount of local authority revenue generated by charges was a very small portion of overall income.  With the level of rebalancing and local authorities retaining motor tax revenue, which is collected locally and which was returned heretofore to the Department of the Environment for use in the general pool of Government spending, most local authorities will do better by this system rather than relying on the Department of the Environment on an annual basis for a rates support grant which was put in place after the abolition of various rates, such as the relief of agricultural rates which existed in the 1940s and the disastrous rates policy which followed the Fianna Fáil manifesto 20 years ago.</P>

      <P>Section 23 of the Finance Bill extends the urban renewal scheme for another year.  The scheme has been a signal success in the larger towns to which it was applied.  It was first introduced in the cities and it then extended to <Col N="500" /> larger towns and it is a great pity that it is not being extended further this year.  There are a number of smaller towns throughout the country with populations of between 2,500 and 5,000 people in which there are areas of dereliction which would benefit enormously if this scheme was extended.  I know a study group is examining the matter but there is a major argument for its extension because it has stimulated an unprecedented level of economic activity everywhere it has been applied.  Will the Minister ensure it is retained as a live issue on the Government's agenda?  I hope the review body will report before the forthcoming budget in November and that the Minister will have more news for towns throughout the country which await this because, while there is a major boom, it is a little uneven and only the larger cities and towns are doing extremely well.</P>
      <P>I travel from the west to the Dáil and when I pass Mullingar and get closer to Dublin I can see the boom in the level of traffic on the road.  In the last year I have had to allow an extra 15 minutes for the journey to Dublin because of the additional traffic.  We have provided millions of pounds on additional road capacity, by-passes, wider roads, realignments, etc., but that has been swallowed up gradually by the additional traffic, and freight traffic in particular, which this economic boom is creating.  The boom is wonderful but we must look at it in relation to the development of the roads infrastructure.  While we have been over reliant on EU funds to build by-passes or realignments, we must now look at providing further Exchequer funding to supplement the roads projects which are necessary because of the increased traffic which this boom has generated and, with good management, will continue to generate for several years.  The extra roads capacity which we have provided has been absorbed by the additional traffic.  Many have spoken about the retarding effect of bad infrastructure on economic growth so this must be borne in mind and we ought not to lose sight of it.</P>
      <P>The seaside resort scheme was not extended this year but it has also been a signal success in those areas where it applied.  I appeal to the Minister to look at providing this resort scheme in inland areas.  There will always be seaside resorts which need the scheme but inland resorts also need such incentives.  Tourism is a major industry in inland areas which attract tourists.  I live in an area which is straddled by the greatest navigable waterway in Europe, the River Shannon, which has links to the River Erne.  Whole stretches of that waterway are underdeveloped and without amenities for tourists.  When I cross the Shannon every week during the summer months I can see traffic jams on the river.  There is scope for additional capacity and much additional revenue could be generated if we invested more in inland resorts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Boyle, County Roscommon, near Lough Key, which is a gem among Ireland's beauty spots, we had put in place a £30 million programme <Col N="501" /> of investment from the US to build a large conference centre and hotel, chalets, other improvements and an 18 hole golf course which would appeal to the upper end of the tourism market.  Unfortunately, that project collapsed earlier this year due to lack of finance but if it became a tax incentive area, that project would be relaunched.  If that concession was available, it would have a huge impact on an area which is totally underdeveloped.  What was proposed would not damage the environment but it would give an infusion to the area and the small town of Boyle, which has a population of 3,000.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the possibility of providing a scheme along those lines before the Finance Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that section 24 has been extended around the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin and that additional streets now qualify for the tax concessions.  That is a good provision because the IFSC has been a major success in Dublin, but people in my part of the world will naturally say that they also need some such concession.  We need to do many things to hold the population together and give local economies the boost they need and a greater chance to participate in the present boom.  The places which are already well developed in terms of investment and infrastructure are doing disproportionately well out of the boom but there are still black areas which can only enjoy 10 per cent of the growth of other, more developed, areas.  I ask the Government to look at that area around Boyle and Lough Key where the project fell through because of difficulties with the investment in the US.  If there was provision for a tax incentive, the investment will come forward again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably unnecessary at this stage to spend much time lauding the achievements of the Government or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  It is generally accepted that he has done a good job and the best tribute I can pay to him is that I could hardly do better myself.  He is doing a fine job and that is accepted and recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should use this debate to look for a different focus because some interesting things are emerging on the Opposition side.  One could almost say the search for the missing link is reaching its final stages.  I have been looking to see what common bond there might be between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, the alleged alternative Government.  It is difficult enough to find much in common between them. If one goes back to the past all one will find is a rather poisonous relationship.  Be that as it may, an interesting scenario is unfolding and we are getting a new approach to politics.  What is emerging is a combined platform involving a fraudulent Fianna Fáil and a phoney PD programme on public expenditure.  I say that deliberately because if you examine the approach of <Col N="502" /> both, clearly that is what we are heading into.  Let me be more specific.</P>
    <P>Both Opposition parties had a difficulty in deciding how they might best tackle the Finance Bill and the budget.  Quite simply, they are green with envy at the success story of the Government. They cannot attack the huge extra numbers at work, our interest rates which are so low, our inflation rate which is at an historic low or any of the economic indicators.  They cannot attack the fact that we are now one of the leading member states of the European Union in respect of our compliance with the Maastricht criteria.</P>
    <P>Rather than taking an honest approach and accepting this fine job has been done, a phoney bond is emerging between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on public expenditure.  In 1989 and 1992 there was not much evidence of interest in cutting public expenditure, in fact the contrary was the case but with the revisionist approach that can be overlooked by them.</P>
    <P>Let us focus on exactly what they mean by cutting public expenditure.  Perhaps the Leader of Fianna Fáil, who is present, will be more specific. I am interested to know what he will do about cuts in public expenditure.  There is the general approach that public expenditure must be cut but under no circumstances will one single item be specified.  It seems there is an approach which involves making it clear, directly or indirectly, that any item which might cause hardship will not be mentioned.  We are told there is a secret list. It is fair to remind Deputy Ahern of his interview in <i>Business and Finance</i> when he mentioned he had a list of spending cuts.  That was about a year ago.  He thought it inappropriate to tell the people at that time.  I want to know a little more about the secret list of spending cuts.  It is unfair that we should not know the full facts because they are relevant.  If Deputy Ahern has a magic formula to achieve cuts in public expenditure without causing hardship or pain, he has a duty to tell the country.  We are all agog and want to hear it.</P>
    <P>I have noticed the Fianna Fáil posters which state that it is putting people before politics.  That sounds anodyne and meaningless.  Will Deputy Ahern consider putting the facts before the people?  What will he do about the secret list of public expenditure cuts?  Will he clutch it to his breast and hold it tightly throughout the election campaign?  Will he ensure that nobody is made aware of the contents of this secret list?</P>
    <P>When I think of such secret lists I am reminded of the bad old days when Popes used to appoint cardinals behind the iron curtain <i>in pector.</i> They could not mention it in case the person appointed was killed by the regime of the day.  This seems to be the approach of Deputy Ahern as far as his famous secret list of spending cuts is concerned. I sometimes wonder if there is a mafia-like approach &mdash;<i>omerta</i>&mdash; to this list.  If Deputy Ahern is serious about spending cuts I challenge him to tell us about them and let us not have this secrecy any longer.  He should think of his own <Col N="503" /> Deputies.  I was listening the other night to Vincent Browne's programme when Deputy Eoin Ryan was speared by Vincent Browne on this issue.  I felt sorry for Deputy Eoin Ryan, a decent Deputy, who was left by his leader in a situation where he had no answer to give on this vital issue.</P>

      <P>I was speaking of the development involving a fraudulent Fianna Fáil and phoney Progressive Democrats programme on public expenditure.  I demanded this famous secret spending list of Deputy Bertie Ahern, or will it be like the third secret of Fatima and remain a secret until well after the general election?</P>
      <P>I wanted to examine the possibility of this alleged alternative alliance of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  There was a disastrous effort on their part between 1989 and 1992.  On the Fianna Fáil side we had a twice-divorced party.  One might recall that Elizabeth Taylor remarried Richard Burton but that second alliance did not work out either.  That is the sort of alliance about which we are talking.  There appears to be nothing in common between these two parties except a dishonest approach to public expenditure.  As dishonest as is the Fianna Fáil approach to public expenditure, the approach of the Progressive Democrats is totally phoney to the extent there is a danger that party might be rechristened the &ldquo;Phoney Democrats&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats has portrayed an apparent tough approach to public expenditure, levelling a solemn attack on third level fees, which leads me to question whether they will propose their reinstatement in their manifesto.  That party has also launched an attack on the county enterprise boards despite the fact that they are producing hundreds of jobs in most areas at an approximate cost of £3,000 to £3,500 each.  Is there a specific proposal from the Progressive Democrats to abolish these?</P>
      <P>The principal question is what the Progressive Democrats will do about water rates and what will the Fianna Fáil party stomach on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> The latest proposal is to spend £200 million on metering with a further £8 million to £10 million annually on collecting from those meters.  Deputy Mary Harney appears to be in very deep water on that issue.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats has become involved in option politics.  That party has a great image of being very tough on expenditure at national level.  However, to save their seat in Galway they had no problem with Deputy Molloy's commitment to produce £23 million, three times the amount required, for rural water schemes. Closer to Dublin, in Laois-Offaly, we find they have no problem in committing £60 million to the new Cathy Honan wing of Portlaoise Prison to give some little push to her flagging campaign there.  Even closer to Dublin, in Kildare, we find Senator John Dardis who is seeking a seat there proposing to produce sufficient funds to buy out the MMDS monopoly operators, at an estimated £100 million.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of option politics in which that party engages at local level.  It gives the lie to the approach that suggests that party has any interest in cutting public expenditure.  It confirms that if, by some remote chance they and Fianna Fáil ever got back into Government, we would be faced with the same circumstances as obtained between 1989 and 1992 with public expenditure again running out of control.</P>
    <P>A reasonable comment on this alleged alternative Government, is that it is a lethal cocktail, a combination that would bring disaster.  The country is doing well and the only advice I can give to the people is &ldquo;if it works, don't fix it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is Deputy Ahern prepared to unveil this famous secret list?  This fraudulent Fianna Fáil and phoney Progressive Democrats' approach to public expenditure needs to be exposed.  The public deserve to know about it.  If there is any defence from either party against what I have said, I shall be glad to hear it but I have serious doubts based on any of the evidence before me.</P>

      <P>Beyond putting into effect the tax changes announced in the budget this is a dull, pedestrian Finance Bill, unimaginative, uninspiring, a disappointing non-event compared with its predecessors.  With one or two minor exceptions such as the proposals relating to the film industry there is no obvious political input.  Just as in the case of Programme 2000, economic policy appears to have been put on auto-pilot leaving the Civil Service and Revenue Commissioners to do most of the work on the policy thinking of the Government, such as it is.  I detect no strong political commitment from this Government to the development of a dynamic enterprise economy. <Col N="505" /> I have serious worries about the lack of direction of economic policy clearly evident throughout its tenure.  The view seems to be prevalent that all the Government has to do is coast along on the crest of the wave and, despite the budgetary concessions, tax reform and reduction remains on the back burner.  Everything else by way of spending and meeting the Maastricht criteria has been provided for.</P>
      <P>I shall deal first with the technical aspects of this Bill and later with some of its broader provisions. When my party was in Government, after the budget, we regarded the Finance Bill as the second major annual opportunity to stimulate development and enterprise in our economy.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and other Ministers with key economic portfolios took a personal interest in framing the legislation which provided an opportunity to introduce more technical financial measures aimed at creating employment.  During my 20 years service in the House, the launch and presentation to the media of important legislation such as the Finance Bill has always been a major event.  This year, however, only a number of brief newspaper articles referred to its introduction during Easter Week and the majority of these were concerned mainly with provisions involving the film industry.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill I presented in 1994 reduced capital gains and profits from the sale of shares in small Irish companies which was a very important initiative.  It eased the capital acquisitions tax on the transfer of a family business, which is carried a stage further in this year's Finance Bill but not to the ultimate conclusion I set out in 1994, namely, 100 per cent relief to help small family businesses.  The 1994 Act also extended the PAYE allowance to the children of directors or owners of small businesses and dealt with tax difficulties on foreign currency borrowings, which was an extremely complex issue at that time.</P>
      <P>There are some useful minor measures in this year's Finance Bill, particularly section 12 which makes provision for the exemption of payments made to employees under certain company restructuring schemes and in the situation of company rescue.  I welcome the measures designed to secure the continued successful operation of the International Financial Services Centre which was largely created by the 1987 Act.  As the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Gay Mitchell, is aware, that legislation was introduced entirely on the initiative of my party.  I hope he will do no damage to it before it is returned safely to Fianna Fáil hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, the Finance Bill is woefully short of any real or comprehensive vision to encourage a more thriving small business sector.  Fianna Fáil outlined many of its proposals in this area in its policy document <Col N="506" />&ldquo;Rewarding the Risk-Takers&rdquo; which was presented by the party's deputy leader, Deputy O'Rourke.  We propose a reduction in corporation tax to 25 per cent for companies with profits below £100,000 and an intermediate rate of 30 per cent on the balance up to £250,000.  We also propose a PAYE allowance for proprietary directors and suggest that small business owners who increase employment should be given personal tax incentives to do so.  Despite the headline importance and prestige of multinationals, in practice most new employment will be created in the immediate future in the small business and services sectors.</P>
      <P>The Government employs a piecemeal approach to the needs of the small business sector which it regards with as much suspicion as enthusiasm.  Labour and Democratic Left remain uneasy about private sector profits and they are not prepared to recognise the owners of small businesses who create jobs as the real patriots I consider them to be.</P>
      <P>In the period ahead, when EU Structural Funds will play a reduced role in our economy, we will need to be more self-reliant.  Our economy will literally stand or fall on the dynamism of the business sector.  Fianna Fáil will, as in the past, support business in every possible way.  I do not refer to subsidies or hand-outs but to fostering a more pro-business environment.  One might have expected the Finance Bill to provide a clear signal on the future of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for manufacturing and international financial services.  EU agreements on the latter run out in under ten years.  As most Members are aware, multinational and financial sector companies want to know what will happen in the future because they must make plans on the basis of ten or 15 year investment strategies. They must make decisions now for their long-term development.  This may seem a long period to some people but that is how the process works on the international and domestic scenes.  Therefore, we must deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt the tax incentives which were highly successful in attracting inward investment will come under closer scrutiny in Europe as monetary union approaches, despite the fact that the majority of member states wish to preserve their fiscal sovereignty.  Ireland is no longer a relatively underdeveloped country on the periphery of Europe and our partners will look on our success and the reasons for it with an increasingly jaundiced eye.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that corporation tax could be standardised at 12.5 per cent, 15 per cent or 17 per cent.  It is necessary to be clear on this matter because members of the Government have spoken to senior business people at dinner parties trying to discover their views on a 12.5 per cent or 15 per cent rate.  I spoke to many of these people who are extremely concerned about the Government's efforts to move to that rate without engaging in a strong battle in Europe in favour of its introduction.  If such a rate were put in <Col N="507" /> place it would mean a 25 per cent, 50 per cent or 75 per cent increase in the tax liability of multi-nationals operating in Ireland.  I am afraid there is a lack of understanding among Ministers who state this merely involves a move to a 12.5 per cent or 15 per cent rate.  It involves far greater risks for multinational companies.  The indecision should cease.  The Taoiseach is attempting to wait until an election is called so that he will not be obliged to make a decision but he owes it to the business community to state his negotiating position in Europe.  It is difficult to say whether he holds such a position, given that he does not have an opinion on CAP, Structural or Cohesion Funds, the review of Cohesion Funds or the mid-term review of the Structural Funds.  However, if he has a view &mdash; some people believe he favours a 15 per cent rate &mdash; he should make it known to the House.  The Taoiseach has declined to answer my questions in this regard on a number of recent occasions.</P>
    <P>The Government should be conscious that a significant number of multi-nationals will move to alternative locations if we proceed with the higher level of taxation.  Following much analysis, my party reached the conclusion that the higher rate of corporation tax must be gradually reduced in stages over a period of years to a rate of approximately 10 per cent.  The advantage of a phased reduction over a prolonged period is that it would have the effect of stimulating business, particularly if a clear and continuous trend, which will largely offset any shortfall in revenue, is visible.</P>
    <P>In the mid-1980s, trade unions and others complained about the small tax take from the corporate sector.  In 1986, corporation tax raised only £258 million or 6 per cent of tax revenue.  During the 1987 election campaign, my party stated that it would address that matter and deal with the issue of section 84 loans and other hidden shelters, exemptions and allowances that had been put in place for the business sector to try to create a level playing pitch and make the process more transparent.  Successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance, Ray MacSharry, Deputy Reynolds and me, did so and the corporation tax yield is now six times the level it was when my party assumed office in 1987.  The figure is approximately £1.5 billion, exactly double what it was a decade ago at 11 per cent of national revenue.  Fianna Fáil claims 98 per cent of the credit for that transformation which placed a previously stagnant source of revenue into a dynamic growth path.  We did so at the same time tremendous growth in the economy, particularly in the multinational business sector, took place.</P>
    <P>The International Financial Services Centre has made a significant contribution to the tax take to which I referred, thanks to the initiatives of Charles Haughey and those who worked with him against Garret FitzGerald and others&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who criticised the idea and stated that it was a brass plate operation which would enable financiers to hide.  However, it is a different story now that the IFSC is bringing in £600 million, creating 5,000 jobs and expanding annually.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the chopping and changing of very successful film incentives &mdash; which are dealt with in the Finance Bill &mdash; provides an object lesson in how not to go about one's business.  The incentives I introduced as part of the Finance Act, 1993, admittedly in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, had a positive and immediate impact.  The clawing back of these incentives in 1996 meant a considerable loss of interest on the part of international film producers. That the incentives are being changed strongly suggests that the Government got it wrong and was foolish to interfere with the goose that was laying the golden eggs, by drastically tightening the provisions.  In the debate on last year's Finance Bill, I stated that it was the height of stupidity to introduce these concessions.  At a time when the Irish industry was performing strongly, as a result of the incentives I introduced in 1993, and the British Government had realised what we were doing and introduced similar incentives, what did we do?  Instead of trying to go a little further than the British Treasury's proposals we went backwards and paid the price.  That is what happens when people stop listening.  I have no doubt the incentives may have to be altered yet again judging by the lukewarm reaction from the film industry.  If we are serious about promoting Ireland in the film sector we should listen to the industry.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the operation of the BES scheme which is only touched on in a minor way in paragraph 13 of the Seventh Schedule.  Investors encounter serious and unsatisfactory delays in issuing the requisite documentation and certifications. This makes the scheme less attractive because investors may be deprived of any immediate tax benefit.  The process must become more streamlined.  Successive Governments have been concerned to ensure that BES investments carry a genuine risk but the Government must also ensure that investors enjoy reasonable safeguards. The BES should not become a cover for financial scams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good deal of disquiet among those who some years ago entered a certain BES investment scheme involving a relatively new manufacturing company which has a national reputation. Everything may well be above board but there needs to be full transparency.  Around the time the investors were due to be reimbursed the company went into receivership and re-emerged with new owners, producing as normal with the same number of staff employed.  We are happy that employment has been safeguarded but questions continue to be asked about the changes of management and ownership.  It would be too convenient for a firm if by sleight of hand BES investors remain out of pocket while the business <Col N="509" /> continues to function as before under different management.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment should satisfy themselves fully as to all the circumstances of such cases, not just in the interests of the shareholders who, as things stand, have lost their money, but also to learn lessons for the future if the schemes are to continue.  There will be a lack of confidence in future BES schemes if there is a suspicion that investors can be taken for a ride and then shrugged off.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a limited extension of the urban renewal scheme.  It is Fianna Fáil's view that the scheme continues to have valuable potential although it should not be extended for too long in any one area.  Apart from inner city areas, there are a number of towns which would benefit from urban renewal schemes and it was our intention that the scheme, having had a fair run in urban areas, should be extended to give people in rural areas a chance to benefit and to tackle dereliction and, furthermore, to give a chance to those in local communities who have sufficient resources to invest in it with the relevant tax breaks.  I stated that view in 1993 and 1994 and we developed the scheme with that intention.  Unfortunately, the Government does not seem interested in extending the scheme to the rural areas.  Fianna Fáil made creative use of the scheme throughout its period in office and it wants the scheme to continue, particularly in newly designated areas and rural locations.</P>
    <P>The Bill implements the stamp duty provisions to replace the residential property tax.  The level of stamp duty on homes must be reviewed as the rise in house prices is putting houses further out of the reach of young couples, particularly in the Dublin area.  The increases in stamp duty are too steep in the attempt to convert the RPT into an extra stamp duty charge which will fall on the buyers of property rather than existing owners. There is no doubt that such a measure is intended in the short term to assist in cooling down an overheated property market but it is not consistent in the long run with an enterprise economy in which mobile employees, whether returning emigrants or others, are seeking homes to work here in the high-tech, services, construction and financial sectors.</P>
    <P>When people look back on the record of this coalition Government, particularly if it continues in office, they will see an undistinguished record of economic management with possibly disastrous long-term consequences.  I relate these remarks in reply to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe who was trying to work out a new economic theory which, although Deputy Briscoe gave him time to work it out, he did not articulate in a way which I could understand. In so far as he wished to know my criticisms perhaps he would listen to me.  When this Government took office everything had been set up for it &mdash; a fast growing economy, the PCW, the flow of Structural Funds and the first current budget surplus in over 25 years.  The opportunity <Col N="510" /> was squandered and all that was done with the additional resources was to spend them.  Nearly every spending limit and target has been broken. Between 1994 and 1997 nominal economic growth is estimated to have increased by 26 per cent of which about 6.5 per cent is accounted for by inflation.  That is the rainbow Government's record.</P>
    <P>Total Exchequer funded public spending increased by 19 per cent or roughly three times the rate of inflation.  This explains why taxpayers have received only a 1 per cent cut in income tax in one of the best economic periods we have seen. Between 1989 and 1992 Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance, on their own and with the Progressive Democrats, cut the standard rate of income tax from 35 per cent to 27 per cent and the top rate from 58 per cent to 48 per cent while also cutting VAT from 25 per cent to 21 per cent.  They are the comparative facts and realities.  When the people have to decide we will stand on our record of tax reform and tax cuts.</P>
    <P>There can be no comparison with the present Government which is not a friend to the PAYE sector.  The headline tax concessions announced in Partnership 2000 have already been given in this year's budget on the assumption that they will not be clawed back over the next two budgets. If the Government had stuck to the disciplines it set out in its programme it would have had over £500 million in hand to cut the tax burden and move towards the goal of eliminating Government borrowing.  Instead the Government proposes to borrow another £2 billion between now and 1999 according to the Minister's figures. I do not know why.</P>
    <P>The cyclically adjusted deficit is not consistent with the stability pact for which the Minister claims some credit.  In his recent document on economic and monetary union he reminds us that the stability and growth pact will require member states in EMU to commit themselves to aim for a medium term budgetary position of close to balance or in surplus.  An article on Ireland in yesterday's <i>Financial Times</i> by a senior banking economist in London indicated that a 1 per cent drop in growth could cause us to miss the 3 per cent deficit target &mdash; not my prediction but that of an eminent economist.  However, the Minister's multiannual budget table shows Ireland continuing to borrow up to £700 million to £900 million.  In Europe he negotiated a pact to bring us down to 1 per cent yet four weeks later in the budget his three year figures indicate that he will borrow another £2 billion.</P>
    <P>There is little effort to control the growth in public spending and serious tax relief will be off the agenda for another five years if the electorate make the mistake of returning this Government to office.  If there was a better balance between the needs to improve public service, limiting further debt and creating a healthier and more competitive economy everyone would be more prosperous in the long run.  The foundations would also be laid for a steady improvement in <Col N="511" /> public services.  A tighter grip on the public finances and the public spending commitments cannot come too soon.  If the right decisions are taken now we may prolong the present period of prosperity even with the reduction in some forms of EU assistance after 1999.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy weathered the last international recession remarkably well under a Fianna Fáil-PD coalition.  It was one of the very few countries to escape recession.  Public spending rises faster in such conditions but that should not be a criticism.  Indeed, the OECD questioned whether we were too tight on spending during the last recession.  It is economic ignorance to try to compare public spending growth when the economy is in periods of low and high growth.  The Taoiseach, who failed to have a budget or a Finance Bill passed when Minister for Finance, does not understand that logic, which is to his discredit. However, such a comparison is one that other members of the Government try to make with their typically shallow political rhetoric.</P>
    <P>Ministers have boasted of 1,000 jobs per month created since they took office.  Jobs were being created at that rate throughout 1994.  The Government has taken no decisions of any consequence to speed up the flow of inward investment since it took office.  The economic decisions of March 1987 to the end of 1994 have the economy working well but nothing is being done to plan for the future.  An effort is being made to drift on to 1999 to see what will happen.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil negotiated the £12 billion in European funds in 1989 and 1993 we were hounded about what would happen on the review of the funds.  The review was meant to take place in 1996-97.  We are coming to the end of the period yet we have not received an extra pound. When Deputy Joe Walsh was Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Ray MacSharry was commissioner, extra resources were made available continually under the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, has been in hiding in his constituency for the past three weeks and unable to meet farmers to answer their questions because he has no money to give them.  There was confidence in the economy long before the Government took office.  The only thing about which it can boast is that it has not affected it too much, although in 1995 and 1996 there was a decided dip in Ireland's world competitiveness ratings.</P>
    <P>The prospects of the economy depend on whether the necessary gear change is made now. The people will have an opportunity to elect a Government fully committed to creating an enterprise economy with definite all-round improvements in employment and living standards without sacrificing social solidarity or they can opt to re-elect a Government which has shown a lack of ambition and is just drifting along doing nothing other than frittering away the fruits <Col N="512" /> of economic growth without giving the taxpayer a break.  They deserve better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> One would think that a Labour Minister for Finance in introducing a Finance Bill would be biased towards creating jobs and looking after the less well off sections of the community.  There is, however, nothing in the Bill that will lead to increased job creation or give extra income to the less well off in society.  The creation of 1,000 jobs per week has been the subject of much hype and discussion but there are still 260,000 people unemployed, 150,000 of whom are long-term unemployed.  The unemployment rate among young people stands at 25 per cent.  I would like to know, as someone who comes from the heart of rural Ireland, where these jobs are being created.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that there is a bias towards Dublin and our major cities.  Rural Ireland is being neglected. In the past three years there has been only one such announcement in County Wexford.  The factory in question has provided a welcome boost to the county but jobs are not being created at the same rate as in Dublin and our major cities. It is important to recognise that there is a serious unemployment problem in rural Ireland which is leading to social problems in housing estates in our communities.  While the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has done a little, he has not gone far enough.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance should consider providing incentives to stimulate job creation and rebuild the social fabric of towns and villages. There has been much talk about urban renewal in our major towns and cities, a welcome development, but the Minister should consider seriously introducing BES and urban renewal-type schemes to encourage investment in smaller towns and villages.  Farmers who are well off and making plenty of money are buying apartments and investing in BES schemes in Dublin.  Some have informed me that they would be prepared to invest in similar schemes in smaller towns and villages.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, has informed me in replies to parliamentary questions that a high powered committee is looking at the matter but the Minister for Finance should consider providing incentives as people are willing to put money up front for schemes in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>On tax reform, with the Labour Party and Democratic Left in Government and a Labour Minister for Finance I expected to see substantial reductions in tax rates but in the past three years there has been a reduction of only 1 per cent in the standard rate.  During the previous four years, under Fianna Fáil, the standard rate was reduced from 35 per cent to 27 per cent and the top rate from 58 per cent to 48 per cent.  According to the Minister, there have been record tax receipts in the first three months of the year.  In spite of this, there has been a miserable reduction of only 1 per cent in the standard rate.  This is baffling at a time when the country is awash with money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> There is no doubt that the PAYE taxpayer is being ripped off and taken to the cleaners.  Other sectors are not paying their fair share.  Even at this late hour, the Minister should consider further reductions.  It is unacceptable that Democratic Left and the Labour Party, which see themselves as the champions of the working class, have not provided for greater reductions.</P>
    <P>I have been arguing for some time that greater amounts should be allocated for facilities for people with disabilities to give them more independence. Those who work with them have made numerous submissions to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health seeking greater resources to fund the provision of minders or carers.  People with disabilities want to live independent lives but they can only do so with the necessary backup from the Department of Health and the Department of Finance.  The Minister for Finance should seriously consider increasing substantially the amounts paid to health boards through the Department of Health for the provision of services.  Centres of Independent Living have been established in most towns and are run by the physically challenged.  The Minister, who is a caring and compassionate man, should make adequate resources available to fund these centres.</P>

      <P>In spite of the begrudgery, the Labour Party and Democratic Left have made a major contribution to Government and the political life of the country.  We have shown by our performance that we are capable of filling the most responsible of positions in Government, including the Department of Finance.  I congratulate my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and the Government for the steady progress that has been made in managing the national finances.  There has been sensible tax reform without bankrupting the country and the needs of the elderly, the underprivileged and those on the margins of society mentioned by Deputy Browne have been met.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has always argued that Governments must bring justice back into economics and not merely seek to balance the books. In 1987, when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats had control of the books, there were widespread swingeing cuts in the health area, hospitals were closed and 5,000 workers were sacked.  One might say this was marvellous economics but unfortunately it had serious implications for those people who need these services. The Labour Party proudly fought bitter battles against these closures and job losses and when it was returned to Government it ensured these issues were addressed.  In spite of the begrudgery, we have proven to the public that we are not only capable of doing this but are willing to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> The Deputies opposite have criticised the Government for moving away from its spending targets.  However, in recent years during Private Members' time Fianna Fáil and the righteous Progressive Democrats have sought additional spending.  When it comes to looking for additional spending and making promises these parties bring in their agents of despair.  Yesterday at IFA, county council and other meetings these agents looked for additional spending.  Members of the Opposition parties are speaking with a forked tongue because they criticise the Government for spending too much on the one hand and seek additional funding on the other.  This is particularly true of the Progressive Democrats.  Deputy O'Keeffe referred to a string of possible seats for the Progressive Democrats if they promise enough to the electorate.  With complete abandon, that party has promised to spend millions of pounds to deal with the water charges issue, deflector systems, etc.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I chaired a meeting of an Oireachtas joint committee which dealt with the cattle crisis which has correctly been referred to by several speakers.  At that meeting a previous Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry said that when he was in office he sought and got a facility whereby the State would top up a green pound revaluation during a crisis.  He advocated the use of this facility to deal with this crisis in the cattle industry.  To chair the meeting fairly, I called on members of the Progressive Democrats to give their views on the matter.  The former eminent Minister, Deputy O'Malley, for whom I have much regard and respect, said no Government of which he was a member or any other Government had ever used this facility and we would be setting a dangerous precedent if we used tax-payer's money at national Exchequer level to deal with such a crisis.  He also said that once we did this we would undermine the concept and principle of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>The Chair and I represent rural constituencies and we are aware of the importance of the agriculture industry to these areas in terms of income, employment and exports.  However, as a result of the revaluation of the green pound there will be a loss of income in this sector.  Like previous Governments, we must ask the European Union and the Commission if they accept responsibility for the Common Agricultural Policy.  Our economy is different from that of Germany and the Bundestag has not only paid German farmers but has also paid farmers in other countries, including Ireland.  This is one of the benefits of membership of the European Union.</P>
    <P>There are problems in the agriculture industry and, having listened to all the wise men who were members of previous Governments, the joint committee agreed the Government and the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Finance should be asked to consider ways of addressing the loss of income in this sector.  We all have a responsibility to ensure facilities are in place which take account of what is happening in agricultural <Col N="515" /> production and the industry generally. Farmers were beginning to recover from the BSE crisis when this problem arose.  No doubt this will also become an election issue.</P>
    <P>I have discovered the differences between the two parties which hope to form the next Government. They have different views on neutrality, on how this problem should be addressed, water charges, etc.  Deputy Harney referred to the installation of water meters.  One would think that the word &ldquo;meter&rdquo; was not heard of until she referred to it.  However, there have been water meters in South Tipperary since 1899 when water charges were first introduced in rural areas. Farmyards, public houses and hairdressing salons all have meters and we do not need promises from the Progressive Democrats Party that it will allocate £200 million for the installation of meters in the houses of old age pensioners who use only £20 worth of water a year.  Deputy Harney wants to charge these people for water.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris:</NameTxt>
      <P>These PD economics satisfy those members of the electorate to which that party is pandering.  It wants to reduce the level of tax for its supporters.  It is a pity members of that party are not present in the House because they love to dish it out on the radio but do not want to listen to the truth in the House where it matters. They are never present to defend some of their ludicrous suggestions on how to approach problems. They do not seem to know the difference between a directive and a proposed directive.  It seems Deputy Harney was never allowed to see directives when she was a Minister of State. Maybe that was part of the temporary little arrangement.  She does not seem to have been allowed near the action when she was in Government. No doubt her party will be kept far away from the action if it goes into Government with Fianna Fáil to prevent some of the problems which would arise if all the different opinions had to be taken into account.  The possibility of these two parties forming a Government is very remote because the public is satisfied with the Government's performance and there is a &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor.  The Government is working well and the parties trust one another, something which did not occur in the previous Government or in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to publish shortly the taxes consolidation Bill which will make the taxation area more user friendly. However, I sound a note of caution in regard to the threat to publish names.  In cases where tax audits were carried out, genuine errors were discovered and the people involved are willing to pay these taxes and are not breaking any law or withholding tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, which will give legislative effect to the measures in the budget, reflects the success of the Government.  We can stand proudly before anybody <Col N="516" /> and suggest we did a good job.  We do not owe any apology for participating in a Government which has proven to be of benefit to the people, and that is all that matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing time with me.  I congratulate the Minister for Finance on producing such a fine Finance Bill and on the excellent budget introduced earlier, the main provisions of which are enshrined in this legislation. When one examines the provisions of this Bill, the budget and Partnership 2000, one must ask: why change a winning team and a winning formula?  I am sure the electorate is asking that question</P>
      <P>Let us contemplate the alternative proposed by the Opposition parties.  The Progressive Democrats do not even consider the debate on the Finance Bill sufficiently important to warrant having a Deputy present in the Chamber to listen to the various contributions.  To date we have heard from the Progressive Democrats in terms of the need for a low wage economy &mdash; what they see as the happy workforce in countries such as Hong Kong and New Zealand &mdash; and in terms of water charges, with money being spent hand over fist by Deputy Molloy.  We have also had statements from the party leader that all households, including those of old age pensioners, should be metered for water supplies.  In what type of auction politics are the Progressive Democrats currently engaging?  This is the vehicle onto which Fianna Fáil is proposing to hitch its electoral message in the forthcoming election.</P>
      <P>There was nothing of substance in the contributions of Fianna Fáil Deputies this morning. They were simply bluster and filibuster.  It is difficult to see how they could have anything of substance to say when one considers the quantity and quality of the provisions we are dealing with in this legislation.  In the first instance we have the basic principles adopted by the Government at the outset in terms of prudence as far as the economy is concerned.  We are putting together a careful package, and that has been done year after year.  This is the third budget introduced by the Minister, Deputy Quinn.  It is a balanced one in which we have succeeded in reducing the personal rate of tax as well as corporation tax.  We have widened the tax bands and increased personal allowances.  More than 60 per cent of the population is on the standard 26 per cent rate, reduced from 27 per cent, with an opportunity for further reductions in years to come as a result of our buoyant economy.</P>
      <P>Compare that to the slash and burn attitude of the Progressive Democrats who want to reduce the rate from 48 per cent to 40 per cent and from 26 per cent or 27 per cent to 20 per cent almost overnight.  One can imagine the effect that would have on the economy, the provision of social services such as health and education and the lifestyle of old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to having a successful formula in terms of maintaining a buoyant economy and <Col N="517" /> reducing personal taxation, we have also remained within the parameters of the Maastricht criteria, in a better way than most of our EU colleagues. Ireland can set an example for the larger EU countries, such as Germany and France, which preached the loudest about meeting the Maastricht criteria</P>
    <P>Inflation is less than 2 per cent and there is no indication that it will rise above that figure.  Our gross domestic product is increasing by over 6 per cent per annum.  The national debt, as a percentage of gross domestic product, has decreased this year stantially each year.  It has decreased this year alone by approximately 8 per cent to 72 per cent or 73 per cent.  If the economy continues in this vein, we can reduce it by a further 7 per cent or 8 per cent bringing the figure down to the low sixties.  As we all know, 60 per cent is the cut-off point required for European Monetary Union entry.  We have done extremely well, particularly when one considers we had a GDP debt ratio of 129 per cent a few years ago.</P>
    <P>These are wonderful statistics of which few countries can boast, and it is nothing short of nit picking that we have not heard a single word of approval from the benches opposite for the excellent management of the economy and the positive direction in which the Minister for Finance and the Government is going in terms of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the Fianna Fáil-PD Administration there were approximately 145 job losses per week.  Over the three and a half years of this Government more than 150,000 jobs have been created per year.  That is a colossal transformation.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the quality of the jobs created. There was a perception that many of them were in the casual and part-time area, but we know from studies undertaken that 85 per cent are in the permanent pensionable area, and that is to be welcomed.  Compare that to the New Zealand economy which the Progressive Democrats present as its ideal economy.  Between 1991 and 1996, New Zealand created 200,000 new jobs, most of which were part-time.  At the same time, 165,000 jobs were lost, virtually all of which were full-time.  That is the economy being put forward as a model we should follow, whereas we are creating new jobs and reducing unemployment. Over the past 12 months, unemployment levels have reduced by 18,900.  That is the first time this has happened and it never happened during the Fianna Fáil-PD Government.</P>
    <P>In New Zealand, the official statistics consider a person as being in employment if he or she works one hour per week.  One can see, therefore, the way in which statistics can be manipulated. One hour's work per week is sufficient to officially classify a person in New Zealand as being employed.  Tuition fees for third level education have been reintroduced in New Zealand, but we are going in the opposite direction, as we have abolished tuition fees for third level education. Inflation rates have gone up and mortgage <Col N="518" /> interest rates are also very high.  In 1993 mortgage rates here had reached the inflationary rate of 14 per cent.  They are now less than 7 per cent, and the Trustee Savings Bank has introduced a special lower interest rate for first time mortgages. We are being advised by the Opposition that we should go down the road taken by New Zealand.  During the debate on the Organisation of Working Time Bill Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats argued strongly for an across the board opt-out clause in the manner of the British Government, which did not sign the Social Charter, and, rather than having a highly skilled well paid workforce we should adopt the Hong Kong or New Zealand model.  That is not the way we should go and it is important that the trade union movement should know precisely what is being suggested by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 is an integral part of the overall policy in the Finance Bill.  This is the broader picture in which a partnership deal has been done over a three year period with all the social partners to ensure stability in the market place and the continuation of the progress up to now.  There is provision in Partnership 2000 to look at the question of a basic income which is something I would certainly like to see carefully examined. The Conference of Religious of Ireland recently published a document on the issue indicating it might be possible to consider that option more seriously.  I am not sure whether the figures would work out as proposed, but it is an interesting option and would result in considerable benefit if we were able to pursue it.  The Partnership 2000 initiative is the first to get the full support of the Irish Organisation for the Unemployed, that is a very welcome contribution to the social partnership.</P>
    <P>As to the specific measures in the Finance Bill, it is welcome that the Minister has proposed that VAT on child care services will not be operational. It is an area where there is much scope for State involvement in terms of assistance.  I would like to see the State eventually providing a range of national pre-school and child care services. I am not sure whether we are in a position to go down that road, but we are in a position to recognise the importance of child care and give it the tax relief benefits it requires, and the Minister has begun this process in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased there are tax breaks for film production which have already resulted in further announcements of major film making and film production here to take place this and in future years.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that tax breaks are given to restructure companies in difficulties.  That is a very sensible approach because too often companies in financial or trading difficulties have had to go into receivership.  Now they will be able to benefit from tax relief until they return to full competitiveness in the market.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Tax Consolidation Bill will be introduced soon.  Much work has been done to close off the many loopholes in this area. <Col N="519" /> In this Finance Bill and in the budget that preceded it, the Minister has taken the combined approach of giving corporate tax breaks and tax reductions, widening the tax bands and, at the same time, ensuring that the economy is put on a competitive footing and is not overheated.</P>
    <P>Specifically in regard to the Dublin area, we have to look carefully at areas that might be described as unemployment black spots.  Long-term unemployment remains a stubborn issue with which no Government has successfully dealt. It exists in rural areas but more particularly in urban areas where there are greater concentrations of local authority housing in certain areas.  This is the case in my constituency to a substantial degree.  My constituency has been beset in the past with major drug problems.  Over the past few months we have seen how an area can be undermined and scourged by the problems of drugs and joyriding.  All that is part and parcel of an overall problem of lack of services and facilities and unemployment.  Areas like that, which are almost ghetto areas, need a particular tax break in terms of the people there rather than on the basis of property, on the basis of which tax relief and designated status has been given in the past.  Perhaps the Minister will consider introducing an amendment to the Finance Bill with a view to designating some areas in the city on a pilot basis where emphasis could be put on giving tax breaks to an enterprise culture that would provide local employment rather than on the basis of property <i>per se.</i> I commend this Bill to the House and congratulate the Minister on its content.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Andrews.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a few comments on this Finance Bill.  It amuses me that in introducing each Finance Bill Ministers for Finance always say that they are happy to be able to say they have made further inroads into the tax bills of the hard-pressed taxpayers.  This year was no exception.  We heard nice words about the unfortunate PAYE taxpayers and were told that their burden would be reduced.  Within weeks of that, the same Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, boasted a 15 per cent increase in the tax take for the first quarter of this year over the same period last year.  The only logical conclusion of that is that the 15 per cent extra tax was paid by the ordinary taxpayer.  The burden has not been reduced but increased quite dramatically by 15 per cent.  Let nobody pretend that this is because more people are employed or that it is due to other factors.  Figures relating to the long-term unemployed were released recently and, unfortunately, they are more acute than ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the regular grand announcements about additional jobs and extra employment I found what I suspected when I put down a parliamentary question recently concerning employment in Cork.  Cork was neglected and very shabbily treated.  For instance jobs were not provided <Col N="520" /> in west Cork by Forbairt.  That is not good enough.  The good citizens of Cork south west in the towns of Kinsale, Bandon, Clonakilty, Dunmanway, Skibbereen, Bantry and Castletownbere pay their taxes and deserve a fair share of the cake.  An opportunity has been missed.  Net spending has unfortunately been increased in this year's Estimates by 6.5 per cent, three times the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>I concede we have a buoyant economy with low inflation, a good growth rate and low interest rates, but it must be acknowledged that it was built up painstakingly under Fianna Fáil-led Governments from 1987 onwards.  It is a pity current spending has been allowed to increase by more than 20 per cent against cumulative inflation which was less than 6 per cent in the period from January 1995 to December 1996.  The national debt of £30 billion is at an all time high. It has been pointed out in a number of studies that it would greatly help the economic performance of this country if it were reduced.  Regrettably, the opportunity to do that has not been taken.</P>
    <P>I was honoured to serve as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry along with Deputy O'Shea as Minister of State and I acknowledge the contribution made to the food industry by him during his time in the Department.  He was a loyal and valued colleague.  Regrettably, over the past 18 months there have been difficulties in agriculture, food and forestry.  We have lost our way and are in a deep malaise.  Cattle and beef prices are at their lowest for 20 years while milk prices are at their lowest for 25 years which affects the entire co-operative and plc sector. Yesterday, Golden Vale, a star performer in the agri-food world, announced its profits had decreased dramatically and, of course, so had farmer incomes.  Following its annual general meeting, it stated the workforce would have to be trimmed down substantially.  This did not have to happen.  Avoidable mistakes were made.  Inactivity was the order of the day.  Making fine statements and appearing at nice photocalls is not what managing the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is about.</P>
    <P>For example, Irish Governments have on a consistent basis used their fine contacts to very good effect since we joined the EU.  We lost our way in Brussels.  I need only refer to the past few months where there have been two disastrous cuts in export refunds totalling 17.5 per cent and three disastrous revaluations of the green pound totalling 8.75 per cent.  It should not have happened but did at a particularly bad time.  Export refunds are vital as we have to export more than 80 per cent of what we produce.</P>
    <P>Outside the EU, we have allowed ourselves to be shut out of vital markets in north Africa and Russia.  For example, when Deputy O'Shea and I were in charge of the Department, more than 372,000 head of cattle were exported in 1993 while this figure increased to 400,000 in 1994.  For the first quarter of this year that figure is down <Col N="521" /> to a trickle, 15,000 head.  We have been excluded from the Libyan, Egyptian and Iranian markets and beef from eight counties has been excluded from the Russian market.  No effort is being made to restore these vital markets and no visits have been made to the countries involved.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has not met the very important trade commission with Iran.  The last time he did so was in 1994.  Farmers, workers in the agri-food business and the general economy deserve better.  I am deeply concerned about the development of our primary indigenous natural resource.  However, in its editorial this week, the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal,</i> which is found in every farmhouse in Ireland, stated:</P>
    <P>The collapse in beef prices that has followed last week's revaluation and cut in export refunds is the clearest indication yet that we have lost our way in the day to day dealing with Brussels and its critical management of the beef market.  There is no point in repeating the arguments of last week: the fact that at least three quarters of our steers go to third countries and so our unique vulnerability to export refund changes; the fact that we are effectively denied access to EU mainland beef markets&mdash;-; the fact that we have no live trade to give even a semblance of competition; the fact that beef at this time of year is at its most expensive to produce.  Ultimately, the blame for this debacle has ended up on the desk of Ivan Yates.  It will take more than recycled compensation announcements to quell farmers' anger and sense of betrayal this time.</P>
    <P>There is a crisis.  I call on the Government to meet farm leaders and embark on an immediate campaign to restore vital export refunds in Brussels and to pay compensation which was promised by the Minister to the IFA in the Davenport Hotel, Dublin, on 8 February 1997.  There is also an explicit commitment to the payment of compensation in the Partnership 2000 programme.  It is vital this is done not alone for farmers and the agricultural industry but for the entire economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill is governed by an internal contradiction.  On one level it sets out detailed proposals on tax based investment and corporation taxes that are designed to subsidise investment in one of the fastest growing economies in Europe but on another it has ensured in an era of increased tax and value added tax receipts the Government will not make any significant concession to the ordinary man or woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking not only about meaningful reform in income tax for those who have brought about this so-called boom, but of provisions that would improve the quality of life, provide more and better opportunities and ensure that every citizen could live in the dignified manner promised in our Proclamation of Independence.  The Bill lays the foundations for an internally divided country. It recognises the growth of the so-called Celtic Tiger, but ignores the need to ensure that all sectors <Col N="522" /> of society benefit.  As such, it reflects the real danger that the effects of recovery will be distorted.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the process and function of budgets and Finance Acts have undergone considerable change.  They are no longer peculiar to any one year or mere lists of financial provisions and proposals.  Just as the growth we are currently experiencing cannot be put in separate boxes and labelled &ldquo;1997&rdquo; and &ldquo;1998&rdquo;, the policy that governs the growth must be long-term.  The Finance Bill does not reflect this kind of integrated long-term approach and its encouragement of a divided society is an act of economic and social vandalism.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifically exempts all regulated child care facilities from VAT.  I need not remind the House that these provisions were included only as a result of considerable opposition to the original proposals the Minister for Finance announced in his budget last January.  I commend the Government on its U-turn, but I also want to draw attention to a more fundamental point.  That VAT on child care services was mooted in the first place shows how out of touch the Government is with the position of single parents who have to go out to work or of two parents who have to work to meet enormous mortgages.  Child care facilities are a necessity, not a luxury.  For many they are as central to family life as education and health. It is pointless claiming that low interest rates can help such families if at the same time mortgage relief remains unchanged and, more pointedly, if housing inflation in Dublin runs at more than 20 per cent &mdash; the official figure released on 3 April, It is pointless trumpeting a growing economy if certain sectors of our people are becoming worse off or if their needs, and those of their communities, are not recognised in the major financial legislation we consider each year.</P>
    <P>When talking about Structural Funds we should recall why they were introduced in the first place.  Jacques Delors quite rightly recognised that if the European market, and the various systems that underpin and inform it, were to have a realistic and integrated life, regional and sectoral imbalances would have to be addressed. The same applies to the Celtic Tiger.  If we do not ensure the national cake is more equitably divided when the Exchequer has more money in its coffers, our recovery will be very lopsided.  As currently drafted, the Finance Bill does not suggest that kind of vision and if the underlying philosophy does not change, the Government will continue to sow the seeds of future trouble.</P>
    <P>The problems are evident for all to see, most notably in the areas of education and crime.  I was not surprised to hear that apart from the loud objections to the Education Bill, many of the substantive motions concentrated on the lack of funding for the new problems &mdash; if I can call them that &mdash; a new educational environment is bringing out.  For example, at the INTO Congress in Killarney, the delegates complained that the schools' remedial service was being run on a <Col N="523" /> shoestring and being held together by a group of dedicated but grossly overworked people. Despite the need for such a basic service, the economic boom is certainly by-passing these teachers and schools, 900 of whom have no integrated remedial service.  Following the introduction of the Finance Bill, they will still have cause to complain.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, much has been written about how best to deal with the increasing crime rate. Fianna Fáil published two documents on this issue, the second of which lists a wide range of proposals on crime prevention, including the provision of resources for community organisations and services, as well as incentives on community renewal and development.  These must be priorities in Government policy.  If this rising tide, about which we hear so much, is to lift all boats, our spending policy must be directed not just towards the Maastricht criteria, but towards renewing our social fabric.  In this regard, the Finance Bill is sadly lacking.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the tourism sector is all but ignored.  This is one of our fastest growing industries, but it is also an area that can help to renew communities, especially in rural areas. Some time ago many of these communities were being devastated by emigration.  Today, they are still under threat from an unpredictable and changing economic climate which the current Bill does little to clarify.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is short-sighted and restrictive. It provides no framework or reference point for a broader agenda of renewing the social fabric of our country.  Instead, it provides a recipe for community decline.  It may mask itself in the &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; statistics of consumer spending and increased tax receipts but, as the legislative instrument of the budget, if it does not ensure Government policy halts the increasing internal division in our country in the longer term, it will fail the Government and the people.</P>
    <P>Wealth has its place in society.  Constructive and productive wealth creation is necessary to ensure the strength of industrial development and the security of jobs.  However, when it is flouted and used as a slogan to claim rich is good and poor is bad, society had better be careful.  When certain elements of the media seek to glorify and deify the rich it causes immense problems in our community.  The haves and have nots syndrome causes immense and unnecessary tension and this was reflected in a newspaper last weekend when wealth was glorified.  That is unacceptable.  While wealth is necessary, I deplore the actions of a section of the media to glorify it.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight a problem regarding the Celtic Tiger, on the one hand, and the subculture of poverty, on the other.  On Sunday morning I visited St. Joseph's House for Adult Deaf and Deaf Blind.  That institution, which is well managed by the Dominican Sisters, was established in 1965 and caters for 42 people.  The sisters told me three patients have been denied partial disability <Col N="524" /> allowance.  Why are they being victimised at a time of economic boom?  Their request for partial disability allowance is under appeal in the Department of Social Welfare and I do not wish to prejudice the possibility of them receiving the allowance.  However, this matter highlights the difference between the haves and the have nots and it is a mystery how it can happen in 1997. The system must be radically reviewed.  I have written to the Minister about the three cases and, as a passionate person, I am sure he will give serious consideration to the matter.</P>
    <P>Drugs, crime and a lack of local authority housing cause a number of problems in my constituency. I would appreciate if the Minister for Justice would bring to the attention of the Minister for Health the problems that will arise when a GP in Dún Laoghaire retires from his practice after many years of dedicated service to the community. He prescribes a number of chemicals, including methadone, for drug addicts and a local pharmacy dispenses medication to approximately 80 such addicts each week.  The GP in question deals with between 240 and 400 addicts per week and will retire in the near future.  It is crucial that the Minister for Health appoints another GP to the community to ensure the service continues.</P>
    <P>While a clinic must be set up to deal with the serious drugs problem in Dún Laoghaire, it should not be located in a shopping centre or built up area.  Dún Laoghaire suffers from a serious drug problem.  I would strongly support any efforts to ensure that drug pushers are put in jail, where they should be, but that drug addicts are dealt with in a kind, compassionate and decent way. Hope should replace hopelessness, and compassion should replace despair as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address the proposed changes in the Finance Bill for the film industry. The proposals have been trumpeted by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, who has engaged in his usual soft focus public relations. However, the reality of the actual changes are much different.</P>
      <P>The film industry will not get the major boost in big budget productions, as the Minister has claimed.  Film finance intermediaries have said the Minister for Finance's increased tax relief on films with budgets of up to £15 million will not attract major Hollywood players back to Ireland. One financier has said there are very slim hopes of getting more big budget productions back here.  He has said the measures fall way short of what would have been required to get big budget films.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the technical structures to attract these types of film but the legislation is not geared to encourage the individual to invest.  This has been echoed by many tax partners in the major accountancy firms.  One has said the changes are likely to have little practical bearing. Another has said the changes will not produce <Col N="525" /> any improvement in the return available to the corporate sector to entice it back into investing in films.  He went on to say that the doubling of the limits in the Finance Bill, 1997 in relation to certain films is contingent upon 50 per cent of the funding being provided by corporates.  This, he said, will effectively thwart what is being presented as a positive incentive because of the lesser tax break associated with corporate investment film projects.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Higgins, should have more interest in the film industry than just seeing it as a platform for photo opportunities.  In our document, Planning for the Film and Television Industry, we criticised the lack of a long-term policy for the industry.  We called on the Minister last December to explain why he has not dealt with the most obvious problems in the film industry: those in training and education; in the areas of company and project development; in marketing and distribution.  We asked what strategy he had to deal with the current downturn in medium to large film projects, and why there is a delay in putting a film commission in place which could have dealt with, among other things, the bad coverage internationally for the changes in section 35 in 1996.  We have never had a response. If these changes in the Finance Bill are absolute, then, unfortunately, the message from those central to the industry is that they will have little effect.</P>
    <P>We have outlined the necessity for a ten year plan and we have said that in Government we will work closely with the industry to develop such a plan that will make the industry viable and secure for the future.  In our policy discussion document we put forward ideas on training and education, development, production and financing, a film commission, co-production treaties, television broadcasting and the film industry.  We also addressed the section 35 issue.  We have said that in Government we will continue section 35 after 1999 when it is due to expire and look at extending its use.  We also proposed a widening of the relief from production only to include script and project development.  We believe tax relief can offer greater opportunities to film and television producers and that a tax regime that would encourage speculative investment in film and television development should be brought forward.  This would encourage investors to finance the development of projects and scripts.</P>
    <P>As well as tackling these issues, we also put forward proposals for regularising the PAYE regime for the film industry as, currently, different tax districts adopt different practices in relation to it.  We also urged greater co-operation between An Bord Tráchtála and Forbairt, and a development of the facilities and infrastructure for the film industry.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has raised concern about how section 35 has operated under the Minister, Deputy Higgins.  In particular, we asked how section 35 certificates were issued by him to a film promoter at a time when the film promoter <Col N="526" /> involved was experiencing serious financial difficulties. The Minister said that at the time the certificates were issued by him to the promoter there was no substantive information available to his Department indicating that the promoter was experiencing serious financial difficulties.  The Minister says that information only became available to him when he had issued a replacement certificate in respect of a project for this promoter.</P>
    <P>In the light of this, one must question the type of investigations the Department undertakes before certificates are issued and how it keeps itself informed in relation to promoters.  Not one of the productions from this promoter who received section 35 clearance from the Minister has been released and the investors in at least one of them have been informed by the Revenue that their tax relief is to be withdrawn.  Staff were left high and dry for their salaries in another episode of this controversy.  I believe there should be a full investigation into this matter and into the Minister's and Department's level of knowledge when certificates were issued.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes that responsibility for the stability of the film and television industry ultimately lies with the industry itself.  The State can play an important role in developing the industry and responding to changing needs as it becomes more stable.  However, the State should not take a leading role as to do so is to ensure political and bureaucratic domination.  We, therefore, propose the establishment of an industry think tank that has representation from industry, educational establishments, banks, broadcasters and others representing market interests as well as State agencies.  We propose that this body should publish the outcome of its meetings.</P>
    <P>Our policy for this industry must avoid domination by bureaucracy.  To fail in this is to encourage mediocrity.  The State is a facilitator, no more. Freedom, courage and conviction are required for the creative spirit and the entrepreneur to thrive. A successful industry ultimately depends on free spirits.  It is our duty as policy makers to play our part in ensuring that space is created.</P>
    <P>Other opportunities were missed in the Finance Bill.  The same difficulties pertain to my constituency of Clare as those referred to earlier by Deputy Andrews in relation to his constituency. With regard to housing difficulties and jobs, I am sure every Deputy has experience of people asking where jobs are available and what hope they have of getting them.  As public representatives we are all disappointed to have to say that, unfortunately, these jobs are not available.  Although a good PR job is being done by the Government with regard to job creation, it is important to re-emphasise the point made by my party leader, Deputy Ahern, who said that job creation was no greater now than in 1994.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record the difficulties experienced by my constituents as a result of the lack of remedial services in education.  Only today I received a letter from the Minister for Education <Col N="527" /> saying that no remedial services will be made available to a number of schools in west Clare, on behalf of which I made representations.  There is a lack of psychological services and capital funding for education.</P>
    <P>Health is another issue that has not been properly addressed in the budget.  My constituency has a higher percentage of elderly people than the national average, but what will happen when they find that the medical care they need is not forthcoming?</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill.  Everything cannot be done during the lifetime of one Government but this Government has done well since it came to office.  It is only half way through its term because the opinion polls suggest the people who will benefit from increased tax allowances and the abolition of water charges and third level fees will return it after the next election.  This Government has responded to the needs of the less well off in society.</P>
      <P>Certain political parties have criticised this Government.  I warn people in the west to think before they vote in the general election.  It has been suggested that if this coalition is not returned after the next election, the next Government will be a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats one.  People must remember what the Progressive Democrats stand for.  They will reintroduce water charges and reduce social welfare payments because their policy is to give the less well off as little as possible.  This Government, however, has responded to those who need assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera mentioned unemployment. This Government has created 1,000 jobs per week in the past year.  Everybody wants to be a professional, such as a doctor or teacher.  It is difficult to find skilled people, such as plumbers, carpenters and tilers.  A small extension was built to my house some time ago and I had to wait seven weeks for a tiler and eight weeks for a carpenter because they were busy.  We should teach such <Col N="528" /> skills to young people because everyone cannot be a doctor, teacher or politician.  There is a shortage of skilled people, such as bricklayers, because previous Governments did not provide the necessary funding to train them.  The Government and FÁS are beginning to realise that apprenticeships will soon be a thing of the past.  It is good to have universities and regional technical colleges but we must also teach people skills.</P>
    <P>I am delighted social welfare benefits will be paid earlier than usual.  However, I am disappointed the seaside resort scheme, which applies to Westport, Achill and Mulrany, will not be extended to other areas.</P>
    <P>This morning I heard Deputy Bertie Ahern and other members of Fianna Fáil talking about rural Ireland, although they did not do so when in Government.  I am proud to be part of a Government which has reduced the level of emigration. More people are coming back to the west than are leaving it, although this causes problems in housing, infrastructure and jobs.  Many Members have spoken about the decline in the rural population over the years.  However, that is changing as more people return from foreign lands to take up good jobs.  People criticise this country but our social welfare system, infrastructure and hospital services are better than those in other countries. This would be the greatest country in the world if we stopped criticising it.  Many people criticised our beef industry during the BSE crisis which had a knock-on effect on those proposing to buy Irish beef.  I am glad farmers highlighted the damage this was causing to the industry.</P>
    <P>When I was elected to the Dáil in a by-election, the main issues were Castlebar General Hospital, the regional technical college and the country's roads.  I am glad the Minister for Health allocated £25 million in the budget for the hospital over the next few years.  I compliment the Government for providing £600,000 for the regional technical college. However, we will not be happy until the 500 students who attend the regional technical college on a part-time and full-time basis are accommodated in proper buildings.</P>
    <P>When I came into the Dáil I was a member of Mayo County Council and Westport Urban District Council.  The first major issue raised at every council meeting by Fianna Fáil members was the county's roads.  They had a neck to complain about them, given that their party was in Government for seven years and did nothing to improve them.  A record amount of money has been provided for county roads and a ten year programme has been put in place.  I hope that whoever takes office after the election will continue that policy to ensure our county roads are improved as they have been in the past two years.  I compliment the Government for identifying and tackling that problem.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the seaside resort scheme will not be extended to include towns such as Newport, Louisburgh and the Erris region which would benefit from it.  This is a tax incentive, not a grant, so it would not cost the Government money.  There is nothing wrong with giving <Col N="529" /> people tax breaks to invest in places such as Belmullet, Erris and Louisburgh, like they did in Achill, Westport and Ballybunion, if the local people do not have the resources to do so themselves. It is good for these towns and for rural Ireland if a proper infrastructure is developed. We must have places for visitors to see and things for them to do when they come.  There are many designated tax areas, particularly in Dublin, and I had hoped Knock Airport would be included. The west has benefited under this Government, not under Fianna Fáil.  We heard nothing from the Deputy until he went into Opposition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate and to review the Government's work during the past two and a half years as we enter the last six months of its programme.  We compliment the Government on its work as people, in general, are more than satisfied with the way it has managed the affairs of the country during the past two and a half years.  Many were taken by surprise but those of us who are close to the principal players in the Government knew that they had the ability and that it would only be a matter of being in a position to show their abilities and skills.  They are capably led by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, whom we knew to be an honest and decent man when we elected him as leader of our party.  That has proven to be the case as people have come to know the man and how he operates.  Honesty and <Col N="530" /> decency are important principles at this time in the development of our country.</P>
    <P>If people are asked what has brought about the remarkable change in the past two and a half years, the two words that come across are &ldquo;confidence and trust&rdquo;.  People have confidence and trust in the Government.  The days of the nod and wink and backslapping politics are gone.  They are out of date.  Decisions made by multinationals to invest here are made on the basis of hard economic factors.  For decades Fianna Fáil promoted this country as a misty isle where one might discover a four leaved clover or shamrock, leprechauns and other such nonsense.  That is as out of date as the ass and cart is to modern day farming. The Government must sell the country as a place where it is safe to make an investment which will yield a return.  Those are the decisions being made in boardrooms, not only annually or every six months, but weekly.  We hear weekly announcements of major companies, which do not have any ties with this country, investing here. They view this country as the in place to invest, a gateway to Europe and we have a Government that can maximise that opportunity.  Our young people are the benefactors of that investment. Thousands of jobs are being created.  Many people are surprised our young people have the necessary skills to take up those jobs and many companies which have invested here were surprised they have such skills.  Credit for that lies with our education system, particularly regional technical colleges which produce graduates with computer skills.  Many companies are major employers in the production of microchips and computer hardware and software.  We have the ability and the skills to provide workers for the computer industry.  Those companies are satisfied, otherwise they would not continue to invest here in such numbers.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies are the best of people in many respects, but their attitude that it would have happened anyway annoys me.  That attitude shaped its policy in Government.  Its attitude is that tomorrow will come anyway, but that is not good enough.  We know tomorrow will come, but we must plan to make the most of tomorrow. That is where this Government has shone.  Plans were put in place and it had the vision to know where to direct the country and the economy.  It has been a success and I compliment it.  I complimented the Taoiseach for whom I have always had admiration.  My party as the senior partner in Government is capably supported by the Labour Party and Democratic Left and capably led by the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, and the Leader of Democratic Left, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, for whom I have a high regard.  The Government parties are working as a team and will continue their programme of work.  I hope the Government will continue in office until next October to enable it to finish its programme, to show the people that this team can work together and that this is the type of Government we will have in the <Col N="531" /> future.  I have no doubt that when it comes to the secrecy of the ballot box the people will renew their confidence in the Government returning the majority of seats to Government Deputies to enable them to continue their good work.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the bedrock of the economy of Cavan-Monaghan and of the rest of the country. There is a problem concerning the cattle industry. It is not of our making, but arose as a result of a major blunder in the House of Commons more than 12 months ago with the BSE scare, which was blown out of all proportion.  It undermined our agricultural economy and beef trade for which we are renowned worldwide.  Third World and European markets were closed off to us, but thankfully we are now recovering from the worst effects.  Unfortunately, cattle prices to beef finishers fell after Easter and there is no reason for 80p and 78p per lb being quoted.  The factories can pay more.  I have no hesitation saying here or outside the confines of this House, where some people may think I have protection, that a cartel is operating.  That is not good enough.  Farmers are entitled to more because the factories can pay more and farmers should have a sufficient return to make profits for their various enterprises.  The sum of 85p and 86p per pound is a realistic price that should be paid.  While factories have the advantage now.  Third World countries will reopen and farmers will not forget how they were treated by the factories when doors were closed to them and they had no other outlet.  The factories should note that warning and be careful about how they treat farmers.  They should increase their prices to a realistic level to give a return to farmers who made an investment and bought cattle.</P>
    <P>Regarding pollution grants, our environment is vitally important as is the control of farmyard pollution. Our rivers, lakes and streams are not only important to the farming community but to the tourism industry, including fishing and the enjoyment of those on holiday.  Protection of the environment can be assured only through good methods of dealing with farm and all other types of waste.  Pollution control grants have been stopped since April 1996.  Thousands of young farmers through no fault of theirs have not applied for a grant.  Some were not in a financial position to do so and others did not have control of the farm.  Pollution control is an ongoing process. Under the farm retirement scheme elderly farmers can retire and hand on their farms to younger men who have been locked out of access to these grants.  Will the Minister of State stress when he talks to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that investment in this area is very important not only to protect the environment, the principal reason for the scheme, but also in terms of the spin-off of jobs created in the process?  It ensures farms are tidied up and they can be a place of enjoyment.  Farmers with small holdings are seeking alternative enterprises.</P>
    <P>My constituency is renowned for the poultry <Col N="532" /> industry which is experiencing problems, which I hope will be minimal.  It is also renowned for the mushroom industry.  Tourism could play a major role as an alternative farm enterprise including farmhouse holidays and the renovation of old homesteads on farms through the use of skills, to which Deputy Ring referred, into holiday homes, chalets and that type of development.  There is a major opportunity for farmers to become involved in tourism development.  I tell farmers this is a good enterprise, but the farm environment needs to be tidied up to ensure that people feel safe walking around the farm.</P>
    <P>The care of the elderly must be high on our agenda as they have worked and handed on this country to us in its present fine state.  There is a major problem in relation to cutbacks on home help.  Old people like to live where they grew up and to die in their own home.  In the past there were many sad cases where people were taken out of their home environment, away from their families and put into a nursing home.  I accept nursing home care is very good, but many of the elderly who were moved to nursing homes must have died very lonely people.  We now realise elderly people like to be in their own home and independent, and they can be.  The system has changed with the development of mod cons.  No matter how handicapped a person is he or she can cope with the assistance of push button equipment. Home help is vitally important to care for the elderly.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from the Border region, I appeal to the men of violence to stop the nonsense, to bring peace and restore the ceasefire so that the country, North and South, can grow and benefit from the great opportunities referred to.  The men of violence are doing a major disservice to everybody involved, even those whom they claim to represent.  I appeal to them to restore the ceasefire immediately.  I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy McGrath.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of strands to the State's commemoration of the 1400th anniversary of the death of St. Colmcille.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications advised the Dáil yesterday, in a reply to written Parliamentary Question No. 313, that An Post is <Col N="533" /> now commissioning a stamp for issue commemorating St. Colmcille.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is making a grant of £2,000 to a major international conference to be held in Derry, once the head house of the Columban family of monasteries.  Other recently received proposals for the commemoration of the anniversary are being considered and it is likely decisions on these will be made shortly.</P>
      <P>The most significant projects to commemorate the saint in this country are appropriately being run and held in County Donegal under the guidance of a co-ordinator of events for the anniversary appointed by Donegal County Council.  The largest of these events will be a multi-denominational service for between 10,000 and 20,000 people in the Colmcille Heritage Centre, Gartan, County Donegal. I am very much looking forward to paying a brief visit to the Colmcille Heritage Centre in Gartan tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether the Taoiseach allowed the question because I found one which related to a saint born more than a thousand years ago or because he did a U-turn on the matter. I am glad he did a U-turn and I understand it was because I issued a statement last week after Deputy McDaid received a letter from An Post which said it would be impossible to produce a stamp this year.  I said I would make sure one would be issued before the end of the year as soon as the May election is over.</P>
      <P>On a serious level, why did the Taoiseach refuse to put pressure on An Post to deal with this situation?  I have asked this question a number of times.  It was refused on a number of occasions in February or March so he need not look so surprised. An Post refused to deal with this situation also after Deputy McDaid raised it in the House. St. Colmcille is one of Ireland's more important saints.  His monastery at lona in Scotland has been of huge significance in the cause of peace and reconciliation.  The Taoiseach knew I would press him on the matter today.  He put horrendous pressure on An Post to change its sequence and issue a stamp to commemorate the Royal Dublin Fusiliers.  I welcome the decision here, but is it as a result of pressure and commitment from Fianna Fáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is using very loose language.  I did not refuse to do this nor did I ever direct An Post in any matter in regard to issuing a stamp.  I am glad the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, was able to persuade An Post to revise an earlier decision of its philatelic advisory committee to the effect that there would not be a stamp to commemorate the 1400th anniversary of St. Colmcille.  I expect the stamp will be issued in July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that St. Colmcille was a man from the north-west who made an enormous contribution to spreading the Christian religion not only in Ireland but throughout most of northern <Col N="534" /> Britain.  He was a figure of outstanding historical and religious significance.</P>
    <P>It is also fair to make the point that St. Colmcille is first and foremost a Christian saint and it is appropriate that the Christian Churches should take the lead in the commemoration of saints.  The State has a supportive role in this matter but in terms of the anniversaries of Christian saints, given the relative constitutional responsibilities of Church and State, the appropriate leadership in the commemoration of saints rests with the Churches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>

      <P>I am glad he is slowly following my footsteps around the country.  I announced in Gartan that I would deal with this matter and reverse the decision on the stamp.  I received the letter on 26 March and Deputy McDaid tabled a question that day stating the Government was not providing for a stamp.  The decision to alter that decision was based purely on pressure from this side of the House and, to be fair, the fact that the British Government agreed to issue a stamp to commemorate St. Columba, as St. Colmcille was known in Britain.  It was a shame we did not deal with this issue earlier but I am glad the Taoiseach reversed his decision and I have found some way of asking him a question, even if I must refer to events of 1400 years ago to get one which he will answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to bring to the attention of the committee examining the list of this year's celebrations the close connection which existed between St. Colmcille or St. Columba, as he is known to the Church of Ireland community, and the town of Swords, County Dublin, which is known as Sord Colmcille?  Will he ensure there is some celebration of the saint's anniversary in association with the Church authorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of St. Colmcille's connection with Swords.  As the Deputy will be aware, one of my relatives represented Swords in Dáil Éireann for many years and he advised me of these matters.  I am also very familiar with Swords.</P>
      <P>In case the Deputy did not know, St. Colmcille has a close association with the monastic town of Kells or Ceannanas Mór, County Meath, one of the few towns the urban design of which still dates from the original design of the monastic settlement which was founded there with the assistance of St. Colmcille.  I understand also that Durrow in County Laois has associations with St. Colmcille.  While not wishing to detract from</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> Derry and Donegal, I agree with Deputy Raphael Burke that we in this less interesting part of the country can share in his glories as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the U-turn the Taoiseach has taken <i>vis-á-vis</i> this decision.  No doubt he regrets his reply to a parliamentary question stating he has no intention of celebrating the 1400th anniversary of the death of St. Colmcille, following which the matter was taken up with the chief executive of An Post.  My party leader said if returned to Government a commemorative stamp would be produced and this has now come to pass.  The chief executive of An Post stated in his letter that the programme for 1997 has already been approved by Government and the stamp has been designed so it would not be possible to add an additional stamp.  The Taoiseach will understand my dilemma.  I have been in contact with my local Highland Radio which has been broadcasting intermittently but as the Taoiseach is going to Donegal tomorrow it is suddenly on air again.  Surely there must be a general election in the offing when, just as the Taoiseach is due to visit Donegal, the stamps are produced. Nonetheless, I welcome the issue of a stamp to celebrate the 1400th anniversary of the death of St. Colmcille&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The offence commonly referred to as &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo; is a criminal one under section 112 of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1984 which prohibits the taking of <Col N="536" /> a vehicle without the owner's consent.  The term &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo; does not feature in any legislation.</P>
      <P>The use of cars and other vehicles robbed from their owners, often used in the commission of crime, continues to be a serious problem.  Usually such vehicles are driven recklessly and contribute to road deaths, serious injury and extensive damage to vehicles and property, often stolen by very young people under the age of 16.</P>
      <P>The problem is not a new one and had diminished somewhat from the high figures of the 1980s.  However, in recent months it has manifested itself graphically through the deaths of four people who were hit by a stolen car.  I convey my sympathy to the families of those who so tragically lost their lives.</P>
      <P>The problem of joy-riding is one manifestation &mdash; clearly a seriously worrying one &mdash; of the disorderly and criminal tendencies of a minority of young people, most of whom come from backgrounds in which disadvantage of various kinds is a factor.  While clearly disadvantage does not excuse criminal activity it does point to the need for a broadly based response to the problem.  In so saying I am not attempting to downplay the importance of the direct law and order response to joy-riding.</P>
      <P>I have discussed this matter at some length with the Garda Commissioner and am in no doubt of his commitment and determination to tackle it head on.  It is not always easy to apprehend offenders because of the attendant risk to the general public but the Garda have assured me they will spare no effort to stamp out this extremely dangerous, anti-social form of criminal activity.</P>
      <P>There have been many arrests over the years and sentences both to prisons and to Department of Education detention centres of youths convicted of robbing cars and using them dangerously.</P>
      <P>The Garda are deeply conscious of the need to secure the support and co-operation of the vast majority of law abiding citizens in the areas worst affected.  That is why, side by side with a policy of acting firmly to thwart the young criminals involved, the Garda are and will continue to focus special attention on meeting local community groups understandably outraged at the activities of the small minority of unruly criminal elements in their midst.</P>
      <P>Since I became Minister for Justice I have supported and funded community-based programmes, with the support of the Garda Síochána, designed to divert young people from crime, including joy-riding.  Eight such schemes are in operation in areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford and plans are advanced for the introduction of two additional schemes in Dublin and Dundalk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These programmes are aimed predominantly at young people and involve various activities, sporting and others, counselling, informal group work, education, group family and after-care support programmes, anti-vandalism/pro-environment <Col N="537" /> programmes and other activities deemed appropriate in each of the specific catchment areas.</P>
    <P>In addition, last year my Department's Probation and Welfare Service established the Cork auto-crime prevention scheme aimed at diverting young offenders from joy-riding and designed to teach them basic mechanical and driving skills while addressing their offending behaviour.  The project is being run in conjunction with local business in the area.</P>
    <P>The aims of these projects are to prevent crime, divert young people from becoming involved in criminal or anti-social behaviour, to improve their quality of life, to provide activities aimed at improving their life and communicating skills and personal development, and to support and improve Garda-community relations.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities they are taking all possible steps to deter so-called &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo; and will continue to work closely with local communities, local authorities and State services in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister in extending my deep sympathy to the families of victims of so-called joy-riding in recent months. Does the Minister agree that one of the principal problems confronting society is that some people now engage in criminal activities in the certain knowledge that they will not have to serve sentences imposed by the courts, that the revolving door syndrome appears to have become an open door one and does nothing to deter people from committing extremely serious offences?  In short, does she agree that in the past two years she has presided over a chaotic prison system?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Though I have repeated it so often, it never seems to dawn on Deputy O'Donoghue that I am engaged in the largest ever prison building programme in the history of this State.  A total of 800 places will be built, some are already occupied by offenders and the remainder of the programme is scheduled for completion in 1998. Until adequate prison places are provided we shall continue to encounter a problem.  The reason is that in the years 1987 to 1994 &mdash; when I assumed this portfolio &mdash; not one single new construction programme in the provision of prison places was implemented despite the fact that crime statistics from 1989 increased consistently, yet Deputy O'Donoghue's party, when in control of the Departments of Finance and Justice, did nothing to tackle the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a problem with offenders serving their full sentences as there is a bulge at present. When our programme is completed I am satisfied <Col N="538" /> we will have eliminated that problem which I inherited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is as familiar as &ldquo;The Fields of Athenry&rdquo;.  I put it to the Minister for Justice that prison places were provided for by the outgoing Fianna Fáil Administration in the autumn of 1994 and the Minister for Finance, in her absence, cancelled the prison programme and she endorsed that action.  That is the reason we do not have additional prison places.  There is no point in trying to pull the wool over peoples' eyes.  The Minister seems to forget she is charged with the protection of peoples lives and property in the State and the sooner she remembers it the better.</P>
      <P>There is an additional problem which, despite the protestations of the Minister to the contrary, has not been addressed.  There is a problem in the hearing of criminal trials which in turn is sending a firm message to would-be criminals that they can get away with what they like.  Yesterday, one out of five trials could not go ahead in the Dublin Circuit Court.  Today two out of five trials could not go ahead in the Circuit Criminal Court. Tomorrow's list of trials in the Dublin Circuit Court has been cancelled.

      <P>The reason people believe and are encouraged to believe they can do what they want is that not only will they not serve the sentence but they will not be sentenced for a considerable period after they have committed very serious offences.  What does the Minister for Justice intend to do about alleviating the delays in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court which deals with all serious crime in the city, outside of murder and rape which is dealt with by the Central Criminal Court?  Will she provide the facilities to the courts to enable them administer justice speedily?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Money was not forthcoming to provide prison places on foot of a budget issued by a party holding power for a week or two while a decision was being made about the formation of a new Government.  I invite Deputy O'Donoghue once <Col N="539" /> again to visit Castlerea which is open for business. I visited the site again recently and watched the builders on site working to provide an additional 130 plus places.  The Government has provided the resources to allow me provide the prison spaces and the prison is open.</P>
    <P>On hearings of criminal and other trials I recommend that the Deputy get a copy of the recent edition of the <i>Law Gazette</i> in which he will find the lawyers are pleased at the speed at which the backlogs are being finalised in the courts.  I accept there are too many delays in criminal trials but the number of judges has been increased from 89 when I came into office to 101, plus two about to be appointed due to retirements and one judge doing other work for the State.  Those additional judges have made a huge impact on the backlog of court cases which had been building up year after year.  Effective action was not taken until this Government came into office and I got the resources from the Government to appoint new judges and build new courthouses.  Yesterday I opened another courthouse in the vicinity of the Four Courts in what was formerly the Riverbank theatre.  I was sorry Deputy O'Donoghue was not able to join us there.  He is such a good dramatist he might well have had an urge to do some play acting there.</P>

      <P>On this extremely important matter to which the Minister has failed to respond adequately or to give any comfort to those who suffer from it, has the Minister any intention of having a greater level of liaison between the Garda Síochána and the communities who are afflicted by so-called joy-riding and will she accept it is desirable the Garda should have such a closer liaison with the afflicted communities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the trauma and suffering that arises from this anti-social behaviour of robbing and driving cars in built up areas and that people have recently lost their lives.  The Garda authorities are working closely with the local communities, the probation and welfare service and the local clergy.  There have been numerous meetings with local communities in Dublin and in Cork where the most recent incidents have occurred.  In Cork the auto crime diversion scheme involves a large number of local people and the Garda, Ogra Corcaigh, the Munster Motorcycle and Car Club and the probation and welfare service.  There is communication with the <Col N="540" /> Garda.  As recently as last week there were intensive discussions with the Garda in Tallaght where the most recent serious incidents took place. Approximately 153 of the new stingers have been sent to stations throughout the country.  As a result of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act those stingers can be used now. It is an operational matter for the Garda to decide when to use them, based on an assessment by senior garda as to whether it is safe to use them.  Stingers will be an effective measure against joy-riding.  They have already proved effective in other instances of crime.  Some 153 stingers have been purchased, 36 are available in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, eight units have been issued to Cork East, four to Cork North and five to Cork West and the remainder to other parts of the country.  The Garda have been trained in their use in all those area and I have no doubt they are in use already.</P>

      <P>The crime rate is usually measured with reference to the number of indictable offences reported or known to the Garda, i.e. those offences which must be tried before a judge and jury in the Circuit Court.  Summary offences, i.e. those offences which are dealt with at District Court level &mdash; these are in the main traffic related offences and the less serious criminal offences &mdash; are not included.  This measurement of crime is in accordance with standard international practice and has always been used in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Provisional Garda statistics for 1996 indicate that the number of indictable offences reported or known to the Garda decreased in comparison to the 1995 figure.  I am informed by the Garda authorities there is no evidence to indicate the decrease in the number of indictable offences recorded by the Garda in 1996 is associated or connected with a decrease in the level of reporting of such offences by the public.</P>

Does she further accept that 90 per cent of shoplifting offences throughout the country are undetected, and, for that reason, unreported?

      <P>The recommendation referred to in the question is contained in the First Interim Report of the Committee of Public Accounts on the Appropriation Accounts, 1995, which was laid before this House approximately two weeks ago on 26 March 1997.  The recommendation, which came following the committee's examination of the accounting officer at the Department of Social Welfare about a confidentiality clause used in the settlement of social welfare equal treatment payments cases, will fall to be considered by the Minister for Finance in the context of procedures for the settlement of all legal actions against the State.  The Committee of Public Accounts also noted that the issue had arisen at a number of the committee's examinations of various Departments in the past.  While not wishing to anticipate any debate in this House or the <Col N="542" /> views of the Minister for Finance on the recommendation, I assure the House that my Department will adhere to any instruction or guideline which the Department of Finance may issue on foot of the recommendation.</P>

That build-up occurred during the past number of years as a result of a backlog with which the State must deal.  The vast bulk of cases taken against the State are settled out of court or without the necessity of a court hearing.  Deputy O'Donnell may wish to play a little game by putting down a general question and trying to have a different question answered.  I am happy to answer the questions she has put, although the Chair has ruled that they go beyond the terms of Question No. 4.</P>

      <P>I will comment not to breach the confidentiality to which both parties to the agreement formally committed themselves, but because of clearly discernible attempts by Opposition Members and others to misrepresent what happened by down-playing the central role of my predecessor, particularly with regard to the more recent actions in the case Deputy O'Donnell has raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court proceedings initiated in the case, concern events which took place many years ago. Therefore, my predecessor and I had to deal with matters which were not of our making.  The law on telephone interception has changed radically in the meantime with the introduction of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993. Deputy O'Donnell's and Deputy O'Donoghue's parties were in Government between 1987 and 1993.  The Act was not passed during Deputy <Col N="546" /> O'Donnell's party's period in Government and I wonder why.</P>
    <P>The designated judge appointed under the Act submitted three reports to date which have been laid before the House and in which he has stated he is satisfied the provisions of the Act were being complied with in each period under review, that is the three years since 1993.  I have followed this Act to the letter of the law during my period in office and my actions have been subject to independent review as provided for in the Act.</P>
    <P>I have almost forgotten the terms of Deputy O'Donnell's question given that she got into such an exercised state with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not hiding behind the Chair. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is in charge of the business.  The Deputy should calm down.  She will get the answers she is looking for, although she would have received them anyway had she approached the matter properly.</P>
      <P>Soon after I took office on 15 December 1994 I was briefed on the facts of the case which my predecessor had agreed should be settled to avoid a court hearing which would have been prejudicial to the State's interests.  A document containing the State's proposed settlement terms had already been agreed.  For example, it was agreed that the State should pay compensation to the plaintiff and that there would be a confidentiality clause binding on both sides.  As I was coming afresh to the issue, which was already well advanced, I queried the appropriateness of making any such settlement when I was first told of it.  Having carefully reflected on the advice given to me by my Department and on strong legal advice, I agreed that the State, through the Attorney General's office, would continue with the settlement negotiations already well under way on the lines which had been presented to me when I first came to know of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State's legal team acted from the beginning in April 1994 on the instructions of the Department of Justice.  I should emphasise that what was under negotiation at that stage between the lawyers was not whether compensation should be paid or whether there should be a confidentiality clause.  A sum had already been offered by way of compensation and proposed terms of settlement had been exchanged with lawyers for the other side in early November 1994.  These terms included a confidentiality clause which was to be binding on both sides. Eventually, to meet demands from the plaintiff's legal representatives and on strong legal advice, I authorised an increased compensation offer.  The terms set out in November were altered to reflect this increased offer and one or two other minor <Col N="547" /> refinements to the proposed settlement terms were also included at that stage.  These latter refinements did not alter in a material way the terms already exchanged in November 1994.</P>
    <P>A part of the agreed settlement terms in the case was that either side could, on providing 24 hours notice to the other, issue a statement, the terms of which were agreed.  The other party has already published this statement without giving the 24 hours notice.  I intend to place a copy of the agreed statement in the Oireachtas Library immediately following the required period of notice to the plaintiff's solicitor.  The publication of this statement is not a breach of the agreement reached and was specifically provided for in it.</P>
    <P>It is clear that my predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on departmental and legal advice decided that in the interests of the State confidentiality should be maintained.  On examining the case I also decided that such a confidentiality clause should remain.  My consideration of the facts in the case was based on the best interests of the State, not party political or other grounds. I acted &mdash; as did my predecessor I assume &mdash; in my capacity as Minister for Justice on behalf of the State.  I stand over the agreement entered into in that capacity.  I do not intend to depart from the agreement made in that capacity simply because there is pressure to do so.  I cannot be influenced by the fact that the other party has signalled a desire to lift the confidentiality requirement by which both parties are bound.  It is not open to the other party to lift the confidentiality provision unilaterally, a provision to which his lawyers formally signalled agreement on his behalf.</P>
    <P>With regard to the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on this matter broadcast on RTE last night, I sent a letter to the producers of the programme explaining that the agreement had substantially been reached before I became Minister for Justice. For their own reasons they decided not to refer to the letter or to the answer to that question, despite allowing people in the course of the programme to imply otherwise.  They did not correct that speculation.</P>
    <P>I will deal with three incorrect implications made in the course of the programme.  The first is the suggestion that there may have been other transcripts available which were withheld from the plaintiff.  All the transcripts &mdash; which, incidentally, I did not read &mdash; known to be in existence were shown to the plaintiff.  That was the State's agreement with the plaintiff's lawyers and the State has honoured its side of the agreement. These transcripts were available to my predecessor.</P>
    <P>I want also to nail the implication that the Fine Gael Party has any reason to conceal what happened in the past and that is why I finalised the agreement.  That is utterly untrue.  I proceeded to <Col N="548" /> do what I judged to be my duty as Minister for Justice.  I have been surprised by the comments made by Members of the House and others that in acting as Minister, a Minister for Justice would change his or her opinion willy-nilly because it might harm somebody else.  I deal with my work in a more responsible fashion than those who have made such a suggestion.  I worry for the State if there are Deputies in the House who think that when they take office as a Minister they can decide to take a course of action because it might have an effect on the Opposition or an Opposition Deputy.  That is not a responsible way to act.  I have no reason to think my predecessor acted in such a fashion when she decided that the best interests of the State were served by a confidentiality clause.</P>
    <P>A third suggestion, made not just on the programme but in other recent contributions on the subject, is that there is something extraordinary about settling a civil action on the basis that compensation will be paid and a confidentiality clause included.  The lawyers for the plaintiff were fully involved at all times in the consideration of the case and the negotiations and I am sure, like good lawyers, briefed their client.  There was no coercion of which I am aware.  I am sure the settlement, when finalised, was agreed with the plaintiff.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to turn this into a party political issue, the Opposition parties should talk to and remind each other about sensitive cases settled in the same way when they were last in Government together in the period up to 1992. The Department of Justice had no involvement in these cases.</P>
    <P>There is nothing extraordinary in the fact that the State would decide to settle a case and pay compensation.  On average, approximately 4,000 to 5,000 cases against the State are handled every year, the vast bulk of which are settled out of court.  There is nothing unusual about this.  Perhaps, the Deputy will be more forthcoming on the next occasion and tell me exactly what she wants to know.</P>

      <P>The Minister said she was bound by the agreement reached between her predecessor and the plaintiff.  Is she aware the plaintiff disputes this and that it is his contention agreement was reached with her, not with the previous Administration?  The Minister made the remarkable comment that she did not read the transcripts before the agreement was finalised. On what basis did she make her determination it was in the public interest that the matters should remain confidential and that there should be a confidentiality clause, if she did not take the time to read the transcripts?  Is she not aware that the plaintiff insists that he agreed the final settlement under false pretences?  He was assured in the negotiations and pleadings that all the transcripts <Col N="549" /> dealt with matters of national security.  It turned out, however, that only four dealt with such matters, the remainder dealt with political and personal matters.</P>

I have outlined what was agreed between the lawyers for the plaintiff and the State in this matter as recorded in the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said the plaintiff is now saying he entered the agreement under false pretences.  I deny this.  The lawyers for the plaintiff were kept informed at all times.  I do not participate in negotiations. The plaintiff agreed that the transcripts would be destroyed after he had read them.  He then tried to unpick the agreement after it had been finalised.</P>

      <P>The case, which commenced in 1985, then lapsed.  I understand it was reactivated by the plaintiff in April 1994.  It was open to him at all times to indicate, through his lawyers, that he wanted to take it to court.  It is unworthy and dishonourable to suggest that either the State's legal team or the officials of the Department tried to mislead him and that he entered into the agreement under false pretences.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked why I did not read the transcripts. It was not my business to read transcripts of telephone conversations intercepted 15 to 20 years earlier.  On entering the Department I took legal advice and was satisfied that my predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, had acted in the best interests of the State.</P>

      <P>It is clear that the settlement reached in this case was based on an admission <Col N="550" /> by the Department that there was wrongdoing by the State which had abused its powers in tapping and producing transcripts of Mr. Browne's private telephone conversations.  What assurances can the Minister give to the House that the telephones of journalists are not being tapped by the authorities of the State?  What assurances can she give to citizens with a special interest in analysing and assessing subversive activity or organised crime that their telephones are not being tapped? What extra safeguards are in place to prevent abuse of the State's power to tap citizens' telephones? How many orders has the Minister signed?</P>

Interceptions are regulated in accordance with the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages Act, 1993, a feature of which is that the arrangements for interceptions are subject to annual review by a designated judge of the High Court, currently the President of the High Court who has issued three such reports.  He was satisfied that the necessary safeguards were in place and that the terms of the Act were being fully complied with to the letter of the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer on 27 February to his priority question concerning the number of women reported missing.  As I stated at that time, I have been assured by the Garda authorities that every possible effort is made to locate missing persons.  The Garda has a particular responsibility in tracing those persons who are under 18 years of age or physically or mentally handicapped or whose disappearance occurred in circumstances which give rise to fears for their physical or moral safety.  It has to be borne in mind that some adults may decide, in effect, to go &ldquo;missing&rdquo;.  While this undoubtedly gives rise to great concern on the part of their <Col N="551" /> families and friends, it is a personal choice for the person concerned.</P>
      <P>The Garda puts substantial resources into tracing those missing persons for whom it has a particular responsibility.  In 1995, the last year for which figures are available, the number of such persons reported missing to the Garda was 1,444. Of these, 1,432 persons were subsequently traced. As I previously explained to the Deputy, the detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources is a matter for the Garda authorities. I am informed by the Garda authorities that all reported cases of missing persons are followed up and that in the vast bulk of cases the persons concerned have been located, as evidenced by the figures I gave to the Deputy on 27 February last.</P>
      <P>All files on missing persons are kept open and are regularly followed up to ascertain if any new evidence on their whereabouts is available. Where the Garda has reason to think that a person's disappearance is suspicious or linked to a possible crime, I have been assured by the Garda that investigations remain ongoing, sometimes leading to prosecutions many years after the person has gone missing.  This can happen where new evidence becomes available or where in the investigation of another matter a link is made to a missing person.</P>
      <P>All the resources and units of the Garda Síochána are brought to bear in the investigation of a missing person and the Commissioner has assured me that this is the appropriate way to investigate such missing person cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the families of missing persons are extremely anxious that a missing persons unit be set up within the Garda Síochána structure?  Will she encourage the Garda Commissioner to look positively in this direction during their discussions? Does she agree that the existence of such a unit would enable a concentration on cases involving missing persons and ensure that a link between cases is spotted immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently met the family of a missing person who believe a case can be made for setting up the special missing persons unit.  The detailed deployment of the Garda Síochána is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and this matter comes within his remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Garda Commissioner carried out a review of the structure of all the specialist units attached to the Garda headquarters and the Central Detective Unit at Harcourt Square.  This review came about as a result of emerging trends in regard to different forms of criminal activity. As a result of the review the expertise and resources available to individual units have been combined to form the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation under the control of the chief superintendent.  The resources of this unit will be available to investigate any serious crime, including missing persons, should a local district <Col N="552" /> officer require it.  This is in addition to the existing specialist services available in the form of fingerprint, ballistic, photography and forensic expertise and the services of other units such as the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Garda Sub-Aqua Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Domestic Violence Unit.  All these units might be relevant to a case involving a missing person and the Garda Commissioner has told me he does not think it would be appropriate to set up a specific missing persons unit. He is anxious that all the resources of the State are made available in such cases.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, there are very different circumstances attached to cases involving missing persons.  For example, they can range from a person who walks out of his house, gets on a boat and leaves the country to, sadly, more sinister or suspicious ones where a person disappears and a crime is suspected.  One can never tell which elements of expertise will be required in following up a case.  I agree with the Garda Commissioner that the reorganisation of the specialist units in the way he has done is the best way of dealing with cases involving missing persons. Most years approximately 1,500 people are reported missing, while the number not traced can be as low as eight, 12, 13 or 17.  While the figure is low, I realise that behind each of these cases is a family and wide family circle who are distressed and distraught.  I am satisfied with what the Garda Commissioner has told me about the specialist units.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in the same position as a Minister for Justice in encouraging the Garda Commissioner to establish a missing persons unit and I can only outline the case as best I can to the Minister.  The distraught families of missing persons are of the view, almost unanimously, that a missing persons unit should be established as a matter of common humanity and sensitivity.  The difficulty is that the families concerned do not know whether their loved ones have met a violent death and are not in a position to give them a Christian burial and have no place to go to grieve. This is a great humanitarian tragedy and in this context, it behoves the State and our sovereign Government to do everything possible to try to alleviate the terrible burden being carried by these families.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister, even at this late stage, encourage the Garda Commissioner to establish a missing persons unit, recognising that in all probability there are people in society who are guilty of murder and who cannot be brought to trial until this matter is resolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>A member of one of the families of a missing person told me he would like to see a specialist unit established.  I do not wish to be offensive to the families of missing persons but the Garda Commissioner is responsible for tackling crime, the investigation of cases involving missing persons, etc., and I have to be guided by <Col N="553" /> his expertise, knowledge and experience and that of senior police officers in determining how best their services can be deployed.  The Garda Commissioner has assured me that he has reviewed all the specialist units and does not see any advantage in setting up a special missing persons unit.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the files on missing persons remain open.  Some cases involving people who went missing five or six years ago have since been solved and people are now serving long sentences for their murder.  I assure the families of missing persons that the files are not closed, the cases are continuously investigated and any new evidence or information is included in the files.  It is not a question of whether the families have called for the establishment of a missing persons unit but a question of judgment for good policing by the Garda Commissioner, with whom I agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that there can be no argument with the fact that a specialist unit concentrating on missing persons is the best way forward in this matter.  A specialist unit concentrating on this problem and gathering expertise would have a greater chance of success in locating missing persons than a force obliged to deal with other serious matters also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda have had great success in finding missing persons.  The figures speak for themselves; approximately 1,500 people people go missing every year but approximately 1,500 are found. Obviously, small numbers of people are not found but the problem is not as serious as the Deputy is trying to imply.  In 1996, 1,848 people went missing, but the whereabouts of 1,840 of those was identified.  I will pass on the Deputy's comments to the Commissioner.  This is a matter for judgment by the Commissioner and he has assured me the availability of all the specialist units for the investigation of missing person cases is a better and more effective policing method. I assure the Deputy the Garda will continue to examine and I hope reach conclusions on the remaining cases, particularly those involving women who have gone missing in recent years. Only a small number have not been found but the Garda will continue to search for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who has visited the Tallaght area will be very aware of the rapid growth in many areas of development there.  In the early 1980s the then new Tallaght Garda Station was the first building to be completed on the present <Col N="554" /> complex that now incorporates The Square, the South Dublin County Council Headquarters, many new retail and business premises, the soon to be completed Tallaght Hospital and the new courthouse.  In the intervening years, the population has continued to grow and Tallaght now has its own third level college along with many new recreational facilities.</P>
      <P>With a large youth population, the Garda authorities have placed great emphasis on crime prevention. In one small area alone comprising 274 houses with a population of 1,844, 75 per cent of the population are unemployed and 1,100 are under 18.  Community gardaí attached to the Tallaght Garda Station, by the very nature of their work, are brought into close contact with the young population in the community.  The juvenile liaison scheme is specifically aimed at the first time offender with a view to avoiding reoffending. There is a youth diversion programme known as KEY, Killinarden Engages Youth, operating in the Killinarden area since 1991; the Deputy will know about that.  The main purpose is to divert young people who are seen to be at risk of getting involved in crime or substance and drug abuse away from such activities.  This project has expanded into the Fettercairn estate adjoining Killinarden and I have recently increased its annual funding from £34,000 to £50,000 so that it can bring its good work to a wider target group. This project brings together the statutory agencies and community workers.  A drug strategy team has been established also in Tallaght to deal with the demand for drugs.  A total of £10 million has been made available by the Government to assist in programmes aimed at reducing drug taking, such as the drug strategy team in Tallaght, the ten drug strategy teams in Dublin and the one in Cork.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated publicly that serious consideration must be given to designating Tallaght and its environs as a separate Garda division given the rapid rise not just in population growth but in all aspects of the economic, social and cultural development of the area.  As deployment is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, I have requested him to consider this issue as a matter of urgency.  The matter has been receiving ongoing examination by the Garda Commissioner along with an examination of the policing infrastructure for the Dublin Metropolitan Area, and particularly the growing area of west Dublin in which Tallaght is situated.  The Garda Commissioner will submit his proposals to me shortly and I expect a decision will be made at an early stage based on the Commissioner's report to me.</P>

    <P>It should be noted that the divisional-district configuration of the DMA is examined from time to time taking into account changes in population, increase in business-factories and changes that might arise from physical infrastructural matters such as new roads, etc., and minor adjustments have been made over the years to reflect such changes.  Developments in parts of Dublin have reached a stage that requires a re-examination <Col N="555" /> of policing as well as other State provisions to take account of population growth.  Many of the problems which have surfaced in the Tallaght area require a broad, multi-faceted approach by all the services &mdash; health, education, social welfare and parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her detailed reply.  I note with some optimism her statement on divisional status for the greater Tallaght area. Will she agree that residents of different communities in the greater Tallaght area are forced to provide their own policing structure because of what is perceived to be a lack of adequate resources available to the Garda in terms of manpower and other support facilities?  Will she agree also it is setting a dangerous precedent for the future of our democracy when communities have to take on policing duties?  In view of the Minister's statement on divisional status for Tallaght, will she give her own imprimatur to that?  While not wishing to interfere with the day to day operation of Garda structures, a statement from the Minister for Justice on this matter might go some way towards encouraging an early decision.  The senes witnessed recently in Tallaght greatly depress the vast majority of Tallaght people who are decent, law abiding citizens trying to do the best they can in sometimes difficult circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>From a policing point of view, the gardaí available to the Tallaght station is the largest number available to any area of Dublin, although people will always want more gardaí. This is a large area to police and problems will arise, particularly when crowds of youths gather, perhaps benignly at first, and cause disruption. The gardaí in Tallaght have been provided with a great deal of resources to tackle the problem, but a large number of the incidents that occur in Tallaght are perpetrated by people under the age of 16, and therein lies a serious problem for society.  A small number of people are involved in these incidents which can have an adverse effect on people's lives and I share Deputy Flood's concern that life can be extremely difficult for some of those people.  I recently met two groups from Tallaght to discuss this matter, following which I spoke directly to the Garda Commissioner who arranged for the Assistant Commissioner to meet members of the community in the Tallaght region.  The Commissioner and I are well aware of the problems being experienced in the area.  That is the reason the Commissioner is considering the whole policing of that area, along with other parts of Dublin.  When he has submitted his report to me I assure the Deputy I will make a decision very quickly.</P>

      <P>On the Minister's comments regarding the different facilities coming onstream and those already in existence in Tallaght, is the Minister aware that the opening of the new courthouse <Col N="556" /> and the new Tallaght Hospital will reduce some of the manpower currently available to the Garda Síochána in the area because gardaí may be required to attend at the hospital in road traffic accident cases or appear in court in other cases?  This is of concern to all of us in Tallaght. Consequently, we are anxious to see Garda resources improve in terms of manpower and backup facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated that the development of the hospital and the courthouse will require the availability of additional policing resources.  I have also indicated to the Garda Commissioner the great value people place on community gardaí who are already operating. However, I would like to see a great deal more of them out on the street getting to know people by their first names, getting to know what is going on in a neighbourhood.  That is something I have also discussed with the Commissioner, but it is not something that can be tackled just by Garda involvement.  There has to be community involvement, and the other agencies of the State must also shoulder their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice to comment publicly on individual applicants for refugee status having regard to the fact that applications by their nature are made in confidence with an expectation by applicants that such confidence will be preserved.</P>
      <P>However, the person to whom the Deputy refers entered the State on 26 December 1995 and applied to my Department for refugee status on 2 January 1996 under the terms of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, amended by the 1967 New York Protocol.  I expect a decision on the application will be made in the near future and this decision will be conveyed to the applicant.  The Deputy should note there has been a huge increase in the numbers seeking asylum here which is putting great strain on the process and resulting in long delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  I will say nothing that will identify the applicant.  I am sure she will be pleased there will <Col N="557" /> soon be a determination of her application for asylum given that she has a very sound case.</P>
      <P>On the general point, the Minister said there has been an increase in the number of applications for asylum.  I understand that 1,700 cases are awaiting determination.  In the light of the growing numbers of applicants and the number of people awaiting determination of their applications, will the Minister of State comment on recent criticism by the agencies involved and by applicants that the new and updated provisions of our new law, the Refugee Act, which was introduced in June 1996, have not yet been brought into effect and that because of this there is concern that the same <i>ad hoc</i> incomplete resources and conditions for determination of appeals still apply even though we have on the Statute Book new provisions to provide for appeals, etc.?  Can the Minister of State give an assurance that these delays will be alleviated if she ensures that all of the new provisions which will greatly improve the situation for asylum seekers are brought into effect?  What is the reason for the long delay in bringing into effect these much needed provisions of the Refugee Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to tell the Deputy that arrangements are under way to implement the Act.  A series of regulations, including the Dublin Convention, have had to go to the Attorney General's office and also to come before this House. Work is almost complete, but it is quite a complex and technical piece of work and has taken a considerable amount of time.  During the debates on the Refugee Act in this House I made a commitment to come back and have it debated in the House.  I expect it to come before the House next month.</P>
      <P>Regarding the increase in the number of applications, in 1992 there were 39 applications for refugee status, in 1995 there were 400 applications, in 1996 there were 1,100 applications and this year there have already been 677 applications. That is a phenomenal increase.  Work is under way at the moment to establish the various offices under the Refugee Act.  In particular, the post of refugee appeals commissioner has been publicly advertised and the interview process for that is under way at the moment under the control of the Civil Service Appointments Commission. We decided to make that appointment by public open competition.  This was done to ensure that all qualified applicants who wished to apply would have access and that it would not be a post by appointment.  I am sure the Deputy welcomes the fact that we have done that, but it does take more time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the other matters, the Office of Public Works is currently obtaining a premises and negotiations are under way with the Department of Finance on the detail of staffing requirements. The phenomenal increase in the numbers applying for refugee status has changed the planning in terms of the number of people required.  In the past six months we have given additional <Col N="558" /> resources to the UNHCR to cope with the backlog. Under the arrangements of a legal case going back to 1985 all asylum refugee applications in Ireland are referred for their expert advice to the UNHCR under the Geneva Convention.  We have given additional resources to the UNHCR in London to assist in their examination process. Already this year more than 160 asylum applications have been dealt with, whereas two years ago the Department of Justice dealt with fewer than 25 cases a year, and less than ten in some years.  The Deputy should appreciate, therefore, that there has been a huge additional demand for a variety of reasons including the fact that our economy is so successful, making us more attractive to asylum seekers, the international profile of President Robinson, the international profile of Ireland and the fact that in the post-Cold War era there are civil conflicts in many countries as a consequence of which many more people are seeking asylum than was the case ten or 15 years ago.  Inevitably we have to cope with the consequences of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that given such an increase in the numbers of people seeking asylum &mdash; the 1997 figures indicate about 200 a month &mdash; it is vital that we should have our procedures in order to process those applications.  Otherwise we will have a backlog of people awaiting a determination of their applications.  This is distressing for the applicants because they are in a limbo while awaiting determination of their cases.  Also there is a significant cost on the State because during the period of waiting, which at the moment is very long, there is a cost of about £500,000 per 100 asylum seekers per annum, according to a reply given by the Minister to a parliamentary question.  Apart from the humanitarian aspect of providing for a speedy process, there is the cost element of which the Minister cannot be unaware.  Given the increase in the numbers, it is very important to get our procedures in order at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of applicants at end March this year is 677 which is a considerable increase even on last year.  The cost is substantial, but it will continue to be substantial whether or not a determination is made.  I hope there is no implication in the Deputy's remarks that the determination of an application would result in the person being thrown out of the country and that there would be an end to the cost for the State, because there is an appeals procedure and most applicants choose to exercise their options under it.  The various organisations dealing with refugees have recognised that this State tries to meet its obligations to people who seek asylum here, that we give asylum seekers access to social welfare and the children access to education and health benefits on the same basis as citizens of this State, and that we have introduced what is a fairly compassionate <Col N="559" /> Refugee Act implementing the Geneva Convention.  I have had discussions with individual refugees and their representatives and, although they come from distressing circumstances and are understandably anxious, there is general recognition that the treatment they receive from officials of the Department of Justice and other agencies dealing with refugees is extremely generous in comparison to many countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme, which is similar to schemes operating elsewhere in the public service, provides for a conciliation council and an arbitration board for pay and other specified conditions of service of members of all ranks of the Garda Síochána up to and including the rank of Chief Superintendent.  The scheme was first introduced in 1959 and, following a review in 1977, was refined and expanded to the satisfaction of all parties to the scheme.  A copy of the scheme is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the conciliation and arbitration scheme has worked well.  It has provided a valuable mechanism for Garda representative bodies to pursue claims for improvements in pay and conditions and a forum to discuss with the official side other issues of concern in the force.  Any scheme of this nature ought to be subject to review from time to time to ensure it can meet changing requirements.  A review was carried out in 1995 in conjunction with other similar schemes operating in the public sector and a draft of revisions has been offered to Garda representative bodies.  It is hoped discussion of the revisions will commence in the conciliation council shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda, like any other element of the State, is entitled to be concerned about pay.  Its job is to investigate and detect crime.  The conciliation and arbitration scheme was set up to give it an opportunity to discuss matters relating to pay, allowances, etc.  The Deputy refers to recent calls by the Garda to address the issue of pay.  The force is looking for a pay rise and is not alone in doing so.  Almost every sector of society looks for a pay rise at some stage.  Over the years the Garda received all general rounds of pay increases awarded to the public sector and also benefited from special increases, all of which <Col N="560" /> were in return for agreement to co-operate with change and to improve efficiency.  Constraints on pay, which are a vital ingredient in underpinning the overall strategy on targets of national programmes, affect all public sector workers and not just the Garda and it is not being discriminated against.</P>
      <P>Current Government pay policy for the public service is contained in Partnership 2000.  A fundamental review of Garda efficiency and effectiveness is under way which is examining the role of the force and how it functions.  The group will make recommendations which will involve significant changes.  It is expected that issues affecting the structure of Garda pay and allowances will be a very important element in the delivery of this change.  Should the Government accept the recommendations in the report it would be reasonable that the restructuring of rewards would be looked at in the context of delivering that change under it.</P>

      <P>Should there be a policy whereby the Garda would devote the vast majority of its time to policing?  Did the Minister <Col N="561" /> include this as one of the initiative's terms of reference to see if more time could be devoted to policing by certain sections of the Garda which presently carry out bureaucratic functions?  Is she of the view that there are certain other functions presently being carried out by the Garda which could be civilianized?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want any garda hired to devote all of his or her time to policing.  It is wrong to give the impression that just because a garda might by in an office doing bureaucratic work, he or she is not carrying out a policing function.  A great deal of crime investigation takes place in offices.  Evidence which has been gathered has to be trawled through and this cannot be done on the street.  Policing is more than just walking the beat.  It involves a range of expertise and a dedication to duty.  I assure the Deputy I am continuing a process of civilianization and there are approximately 700-800 civilianized jobs in the Garda already.  In last year's crime package resources for another 200 civilian posts were provided and some of those have been taken up.  We are continuing to fill the remainder of those.  I will continue to civilianize where appropriate to ensure more gardaí are available for deployment for operational police work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the information on sentences but I will let the Deputy have it as soon as possible.  The Garda authorities established a special drugs unit in Tralee consisting of one sergeant and three gardaí which concentrates on detecting more serious drugs offences.  As a result of such detections, a number of cases are due before the courts.  Since the setting up of the unit in June 1996, I understand 13 cases of possession <Col N="562" /> for sale or supply were reported under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act and 52 cases of possession were reported under section 3.  Also, in excess of £50,000 worth of drugs have been seized by members of the unit.  Cash and radio monitoring equipment has also been seized.  Apart from the specialised drugs unit in Tralee, I am advised all gardaí in Kerry have been instructed in changes in legislation and are briefed at inservice sessions on up to date drugs matters.  They are encouraged by their supervisors to be proactive. Consequently, when carrying out other work they are also on the look out for drugs.</P>
      <P>In January 1996 the Kerry gardaí also launched a coastal watch service under the umbrella of the community alert scheme, which has resulted in an increased flow of information to the gardaí in Kerry on suspicious movements at sea.  There is also ongoing co-operation with the Customs authorities to prevent the illegal smuggling of drugs by sea or air.  The Deputy's area is getting a great deal of attention in the fight against drugs.  The drugs problem is no longer centred in cities or towns, but along even the remote and beautiful coastline of County Kerry.</P>

      <P>I join Deputy O'Donoghue in paying tribute to the gardaí in Kerry.  Tralee, in particular, has witnessed a number of traumatic murders in the past year or two and effective police work has been carried out there.</P>
      <P>The drugs involved in the possession offences were mainly cannabis and ecstacy.  There is no evidence of consistent hard drugs abuse in Tralee. However, there is evidence of soft drugs abuse, particularly in Killarney which attracts many tourists.  Perhaps the drugs are being brought into the area by people who do not usually reside there.  The attractiveness of Kerry as a tourist area may also have caused the increase in drug abuse there.</P>

      <P>Only a few years ago none of us had even heard of ecstacy.  It is a new designer type drug on the market.  Therefore, any increase <Col N="563" /> is massive.  There is no evidence that there is a massive problem with ecstacy in the Kerry area, but there is clear evidence that what up to a now was a problem only in big urban areas is now a major concern from teachers, parents and gardaí in all our towns and villages.  That is why the gardaí have set up specialised drug units and trained gardaí to give talks in schools.  My colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, has introduced a scheme to make children aware at a very young age of the risks of being seduced by their peers or older brothers or sisters into the culture of smoking cannabis or taking even a half or one ecstacy tablet.  This public endeavour must be continued in all areas to ensure the serious hard drugs problem does not spread outside Dublin.</P>

        <i>Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Liam Fitzgerald &mdash; the unsatisfactory nature of the reply given by the Minister for Finance to Parliamentary Question No. 41 on 4 March 1997 which dealt with national lottery funding; (2) Deputy Keaveney &mdash; the urgent need for classroom assistants to be appointed to the special pilot unit of Scoil Iosagáin, Buncrana, County Donegal; (3) Deputies Shatter and Frances Fitzgerald &mdash; the urgent need for a national adoption contact register in view of the emerging revelations about St. Patrick's Guild; (4) Deputy Flaherty &mdash; the application from Dublin City University for funding towards the cost of developing sports facilities on the St. Clare lands; (5) Deputy Power &mdash; the need to ensure that the order fixing the day for the forthcoming general election is on a weekend day to ensure the maximum number of people, particularly students, can vote in the election; (6) Deputy Lawlor &mdash; the urgent need to establish an Irish academy for the performing arts as recommended in the PIANO report, given the haemorrhage of classical musical talent from this country as portrayed in a recent edition of the RTÉ arts programme &ldquo;Black Box&rdquo;; (7) Deputy Ó Cuív &mdash; an gá atá ann go gcuirfear seomra breise le Scoil Náisúnta na Tulaí i mBaile na hAbhann, Conamara, in ionad an tseomra réamhdéanta atá ann agus a abhfuil fíor-dhrochchaoi air; (8) Deputy Ellis &mdash; the need for the national forestry policy to have regard to the fact that the increased demand for timber is pushing up the price to levels which are endangering jobs in the timber milling industry; (9) Deputy Nolan &mdash; the need to intervene in the current dispute at Greencore plc to protect the jobs of the workers in the factories currently in dispute with the company and to protect the Irish sugar industry; (10) Deputy Hugh Byrne &mdash; the necessity for an <Col N="564" /> extension to Bridgetown Vocational Education College, County Wexford; (11) Deputy Davern &mdash; the failure to allow Clonmel High School, County Tipperary progress from stage four to stage five which has resulted in tenders not being issued and thus ensuring urgent works cannot be carried out during the summer months; (12) Deputy Joe Walsh &mdash; the need for remedial action to protect farmers' livelihoods in view of the crash in cattle, beef and milk prices; (13) Deputy Martin &mdash; the need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to intervene on behalf of the employees of Irish Helicopters Limited to meet the parent company to secure an adequate redundancy package; (14) Deputy Noel Treacy &mdash; the action required to alleviate the serious reduction in livestock prices in factories and in marts and the gravity of the situation and of the crisis facing farmers at this time; and (15) Deputy Batt O'Keeffe &mdash; in view of the dramatic increase of MRSA in our acute hospitals that the Minister for Health recognises the immediate need to set up a national surveillance monitoring unit.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1977: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;The Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the occupant of the Chair, who, after the election, might be occupying that seat of power.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Ahern, referred to his reservations about the Finance Bill.  He said the Government did not have a policy and that the Civil Service was dictating policy on financial matters.  I remind Deputy Ahern that when he was Minister for Finance more powers were given to the Revenue Commissioners than in any other time in the history of the State.  I also remind him that in the Finance Act, 1991, Deputy Ahern, as Minister for Finance, introduced a measure which is a sad reflection on his party and what it stands for.  I refer to the outlawing of leasing among family members.  It was legitimate and legal up to that time to lease property to a family member, but it was then outlawed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the example of a person who wants to avail of the farm retirement scheme and whose son may want to take over the property.  Many farmers might decide their sons are not ready to inherit the whole property at this time and would prefer to lease it to them.  If the farmer leases his property to a stranger he can get up to £6,000 per year tax free on that leasehold.  If he leases the same amount of land to his son, daughter or another family member he cannot get that tax relief.  In other words, the measure is anti-family. It was introduced in the Finance Act, 1991 by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern.  It is ludicrous for Deputy Ahern to suggest that civil <Col N="565" /> servants control what is happening now without looking back at what he was responsible for at the time.</P>
    <P>This year's budget introduced many worthwhile measures, some of which have already been outlined by Members.  A couple can earn up to about £550 per week without moving on to the full rate of tax.  That is not generally realised.  If they have a mortgage that will increase the amount of money they can earn before they pay tax at the top rate.  That is a tremendous improvement. It has come about not only by widening tax bands but also by increasing personal allowances.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new 26 per cent rate of tax and the further improvement in employees' PRSI, which has been reduced by 1 per cent.  That is on top of the reductions over the past three or four years on employers' PRSI.  It makes it much more worthwhile for people to work.</P>
    <P>Widows and widowers are the forgotten people in society and in my book they get a raw deal. When the wife of a man who lives in my area and earns about £25,000 died he was left with two school-going children.  The man works away from home quite often and the task of looking after his two children is expensive.  He needs a person to look after his house and the children when he is away from home and that creates an additional expense for him.  The mortgage he took out a number of years ago is in his own name, hence the mortgage protection policy did not cover his wife.  On top of the trauma of losing his wife he now has to cope with our taxation system.  He is the sole breadwinner looking after the household, but what does the State do for that man?  It puts an additional burden of £50 per week income tax on him.  To my mind that is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>It comes about because of our tax system.  A single person starts to pay the top rate of tax at about £13,000.  A married couple will start to pay the top rate of tax at about £26,000.  A widow or widower, however, goes to the top rate of tax at £15,500.  That is why this widower will have to pay additional tax.  It is unfair and needs to be looked at urgently.  It is very anti-family and we cannot stand over it.  We should at least introduce a system whereby widows and widowers can get a special tax allowance for the period during which they have dependent children.  The Minister should look specifically at that and contemplate amendments to the Bill.  A move on that would be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other anomalies in the taxation system.  For example, a woman whose husband died of cancer leaving her to look after three small children, contacted me recently.  The children receive pensions in their own right from the contributory pension scheme their father was involved in.  The widow will receive a pension from the Department of Social Welfare with allowances for the children because of his contributions. However, that woman is taxed on her social welfare income and is even taxed on the amount she receives for her children.  This is despite the fact that each of her children has a <Col N="566" /> tax allowance of £3,500.  Since the pension they receive is just over £2,000, why can the additional amount of tax free allowances those children have &mdash; to bring them up to their personal allowances of £3,500 &mdash; not be offset against the social welfare allowance their mother receives?  That seems ludicrous and it would only take a small adjustment to our tax code to deal with it.  Such a change which would be welcome is pro-family, and that is something we must be conscious of.</P>
    <P>That widow had to have expensive orthodontic treatment carried out on one of her children.  Her application to have that treatment offset against her tax was disallowed because the child had an income in excess of £2,000.  The income limit of £2,000 was set back in 1967 and has not been reviewed since.  Surely a strong case can be made to have that £2,000 increased?  That would remove the terrible anomaly in the system whereby she cannot get tax relief on that expenditure. It is anti-family.</P>
    <P>Over the years our tax system has contained a number of anti-family measures, a matter the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Family dealt with.  In these buoyant times with the economy running so well, the Minister should make great efforts to eliminate any anomalies in the tax code. I understand they cannot all be eliminated overnight at a stroke, but over a period we should set ourselves the target of making our tax system family friendly so that it is beneficial for somebody to live within a family unit.  The tax code should reflect that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill gives us an opportunity to look at financial and other matters. I refer particularly to the admission by the Minister for Finance in a recent interview in Brussels that there was no scope for further tax cuts.  That is clear evidence of the dangerous indiscriminate tax and spend policy of the past two years.  It is extremely alarming and defeatist for a Minister for Finance to speak in those terms. I was appalled when I read those remarks, which he also made in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and their Cabinet colleagues are trying to make a virtue out of necessity, having squandered the growth achieved in 1995 and 1996 by allowing public spending to rise by 22 per cent at a time when inflation was only 6 per cent.  The spending of the fruits of growth has been flushed out into the open.  Departments were broadcasting good news, but no one mentioned the fact that public spending increased by 22 per cent when inflation was 6 per cent.  Every household knows that is a recipe for disaster which we will pay for when growth slows down.  When the party ends, the legacy of this three party Cabinet will be that it presided <Col N="567" /> over a 22 per cent increase in public spending when inflation was 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is clear the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have given up on tax reform and tax reduction and have become hostages to the 1 per cent party, Democratic Left, which appears to hold substantial levers in Government.  We should have expected the admission by the Minister for Finance that there was no further scope for tax reductions when he took 1p off the rate of tax in the budget at a time of unprecedented growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>I reject the attack by the Minister for Finance in his speech in Brussels on the Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and on this party's finance policies.  Fianna Fáil, and particularly Deputy Bertie Ahern as Minister for Finance, oversaw the tax reduction programme from 1987 to 1994.  It also reduced the top rate of tax from 54 to 47 per cent and the lower rate of tax from 35 to 26 per cent.  That should be compared to the 1p reduction offered by the Minister for Finance. We did that in difficult times when we did not have enormous growth and when we had to find savings.  The Minister has reduced it from 26 to 25 per cent at a time of unprecedented growth.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right that there will be a clear choice in the general election between a Fianna Fáil Government, which has delivered the type of tax reductions to which I referred while meeting its social responsibilities, and this three party Government, which admits, through the Minister for Finance, that it does not see any scope for tax reductions at this time or in the foreseeable future.  At least it has put its money where its mouth is by reducing tax by 1p at a time of unprecedented growth.  The only thing on which I agree with the Minister for Finance is that there is a clear choice between steady tax reductions of the type to which I referred and controlling public spending while meeting social obligations out of growth or an economic strategy of spend and tax and tax and spend.</P>
    <P>It may be all right for economic commentators to say it does not matter if public spending is up by 22 per cent because growth will pay for it. However, it is not good enough for a Minister for Finance to preside over a party which squanders public money.  The party will end soon because the funds from Brussels will run out, growth will slow down and interest rates will start to rise, as they are already doing in the United States.  The party will have to be paid for and this will cause great economic hardship.</P>
    <P>When growth is cut by international circumstances, we might not be able to cut public spending. However, we do not have to make substantial cuts.  People often ask me on radio and television programmes where the cuts will be made to allow for tax reductions.  I reject the view that we need to make cuts in public spending.  What is needed is a Minister for Finance or a party in Government to say that public spending will grow at the rate of inflation plus 1 or 2 per cent.  If this</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> Government had done that, £1.5 billion would be available for tax cuts, debt reduction and social programmes.  It would have been able to reduce the top rate of tax by 5p or the bottom rate of tax by at least 4p.  It is childish to challenge this side of the House to state where cuts will be made because it is well known that if public spending is restricted, the economy will grow and this will generate revenue.</P>

      <P>Figures published a few days ago show a tax take of between £300 million or £400 million more than the Government had projected and yet there is still no scope for tax cuts by the Minister for Finance.  This money will be used to prop up the social programmes.  In fairness to the Labour Party and Democratic Left, at least we know where they stand.  They want to tax people and spend the money on major social programmes.  However, I am surprised at Fine Gael, a party that should know better and knew better in the past than to let anyone else in Government embark on such a reckless economic strategy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The editorial in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> last weekend stated that Fianna Fáil stands for nothing and questioned its <i>bona fides</i> on various matters.  I take this opportunity to reject the thinking in that newspaper's editorial and to tell the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> to decide where it stands on a range of matters.  That editorial was an insidious demonisation of the main Opposition party and it requires a response from this side of the House.  That Sunday newspaper should withdraw and reject the thinking in that editorial. <Col N="569" /> That business paper appears to have crossed the Rubicon in that Democratic Left and the Labour Party are running the Government given the type of spending I mentioned.  A party with 1 per cent support in the national opinion polls is calling the economic and social policies of the Cabinet.  Last Sunday there was an assault on the Fianna Fáil Party by the editorial writer of that newspaper who said he or she did not know what our party stood for.  If that editorial writer cared to listen I would tell him or her that this party stands for many things including enterprise, republicanism, social and cultural progress&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a balanced approach to social issues and a range of central important issues.  It is strange that a newspaper bearing the words &ldquo;business post&rdquo; in its title should write that type of editorial at a time when the left wing dominates the Government and I call for it to withdraw that insidious, unnecessary and gratuitous assault on the main Opposition party.</P>
      <P>John Waters in his recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> at least had the good grace to explain what was behind such thinking, some type of profound repugnance to Fianna Fáil in the modern Irish mind.  If that is the case, the writer of that <i>Sunday Business Post</i> editorial, and other editorial writers, should think again before they fan the disgraceful attitude in that editorial.</P>
      <P>There will be many discussions and debates on financial and economic matters in the forthcoming election campaign, but I would like it to focus on the real issues.  The country faces many important decisions, including participation in a single European currency, the peace process in Northern Ireland, the economic and tax strategy to be pursued by the future Government, investment in education, health and so on.  There are serious economic, financial and other issues on which the campaign should be based such as what should we do when EU funding dries up in 1999; what should we do if the EU does not participate in a single currency and we have to go it alone; what should we do if this Cabinet continues the spending party and there are no tax reductions and what should we do about ensuring growth continues?</P>
      <P>If the campaign begins with an editorial such as that published in the <i>Sunday Business Post,</i> it would lead to a very messy and silly one.  I call on all parties to have a campaign in which we discuss the real differences between the Government and the Opposition on economic strategy and serious differences in their approaches to Northern Ireland, as came to light during this morning's Order of Business when one of the main architects of the peace process was in effect criticised by the Minister for Tourism and Trade and the Taoiseach refused to withdraw that criticism.</P>

      <P>I do not mind discussing those differences with the public.  Other differences include approaches to taxation, spending, Northern Ireland and prioritisation of programmes with which we have to deal and crime.  The liberals opposite have gone soft on crime, but our view is that it is time to get tough.  Our party has different policies on crime, tax and Northern Ireland.  I would like those differences explained to the people to let them vote for candidates whose views on those issues they support.  That is why I take issue with that <i>Sunday Business Post</i> editorial which sought to launch a general election campaign based on frivolous matters rather than on the deep policy issues which divide the two sides of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The question must be asked, why is the country performing so well?  It is doing well because it is riding on the crest of a Fianna Fáil wave which began in 1987 when the then Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, introduced a very tough budget.  I remember a Fianna Fáil minority Government being supported by sensible Deputies on the Opposition benches, but not by the Labour Party or members of Democratic Left.  I also remember Fine Gael abstaining but the Labour Party voting against everything that was good for this country.</P>
      <P>I paid tribute before and I do so again to Minister Dukes for the way he acted responsibly during the term of that minority Fianna Fáil Government. He knew from his time in Government with Labour that he could not do what he wanted as Minister for Finance because of objections from Deputies Spring, Quinn and other Labour Party colleagues.  Credit must be given where it is due.  It was not easy for Fianna Fáil to put the country back on the tracks following those four and a half disastrous years, but if the present Minister for Finance had been in that Department at that time the national debt would not only have doubled but trebled.  Deputy Quinn is Minister for Finance at a great time.  We left Government when the finances of this country were in good order and I want to see that continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first Sunday of January this year I accompanied a friend who brought his son to the departure lounge of Knock Airport to board a plane bound for Manchester airport.  I could not help but notice the number of young people who were boarding flights for London and Manchester. They were in their twenties or thirties.  Young people are still being forced to leave the west to seek employment.  In the past two and a half years 12,500 new jobs were created in Dublin, but only 150 were created in Connacht, Ulster and Clare. Last week 1,249 new jobs were announced, but there was no mention of any jobs for the west save for a few in Galway.  Under this Government <Col N="571" /> no jobs were created in Sligo or Mayo.  That is unbelievable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Leitrim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>If one were to visit a rail terminal or bus station in my constituency on a Sunday evening, one would see a large number of young people boarding buses and trains to return to school and work in Dublin.  The Minister for Education recently sanctioned an inadequate amount of money for a library for Sligo regional technical college.  The library facility was erected many years ago at a time when there were fewer students and a new library and administration block is needed urgently.  I support the governing body of Sligo regional technical college in its campaign to achieve institute of technology status which is made stronger by the fact that 46 per cent of the students come from the west.</P>
      <P>The Government is not doing enough for education in County Sligo.  The county has an excellent third level home economics school in St Angela's College of Education but successive Governments have not recognised it.  It is time the temporary lecturers working in that college for the past seven or eight years were made permanent.</P>
      <P>The IDA policy has not been successful in achieving industrial development in the west.  In 1995 the IDA announced a total of 57 major investment projects but few of the jobs went to County Sligo.  Twelve per cent of the projected jobs went to the north-west region while 52 per cent of them went to the east.  Twenty per cent of the population lives in the west and, therfore, 20 per cent of the projected jobs and not 12 per cent should be allocated to this region.</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil was in Government under the leadership of Charles Haughey, Albert Reynolds and Ray MacSharry, many jobs were created in County Sligo.  Shortly before Deputy Albert Reynolds left office he sanctioned the Masonite project, which has a staff of 500 people and is one of the best employers in County Leitrim. It was wonderful to see so many jobs being created in County Leitrim, where they are badly needed.  Galway city and the east coast are overpopulated. If we diverted such jobs to Sligo town, the capital of the north-west, more young people would live there.  There are few young people living in rural Ireland because they must leave to find jobs in overpopulated cities, such as Dublin and Galway.  It is unfair that Sligo is not getting the number of jobs it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In earlier years, the efforts of Seán Lemass led to the establishment of many small industries which provided essential employment for families who otherwise would have had to emigrate.  Nowadays, the western region is discriminated against in the allocation of regional development funding and Cohesion Funds.  When the Tánaiste had an opportunity to distribute Structural Funds he gave Farranfore Airport £6.3 million but Sligo <Col N="572" /> Regional Airport received only £250,000.  The airport in County Kerry received over £6 million more than the Sligo airport.  Was that fair?  Why should one person, the Tánaiste, hijack all the money for an airport in County Kerry and forget about the other regional airports, such as Knock Airport which has been a great success and which makes a profit?  When Knock Airport was being developed, a Minister from another party described Knock as &ldquo;the foggy bog&rdquo;.  That is not the case.  It is a success story.  What is needed is more employment in Knock which would be of great benefit to County Mayo, which borders my constituency.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned the reclassification of Ireland in the EU in 1999.  I hope the Government will not be in office at the turn of the century to negotiate the next allocation of Structural Funds because God help the west of Ireland if it is.  Ireland holds Objective One status at present and the western region should maintain that status after 1999.  If it does not and Ireland looses Structural Funding, everyone, not only the young, will leave the west.  It is the subsidies that are keeping the towns and villages of the west alive at present.  Objective One status is the most favourable classification possible and EU funds have enabled the Irish economy to grow significantly over recent years.</P>
    <P>The introduction of national heritage areas has huge implications for farmers who are affected directly.  In some cases farmers will be obliged to agree not to graze on to their land.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has done a considerable amount of damage to the mountainous areas affected and something should be done about that.  It costs millions of pounds to pay the spin-doctors employed by Ministers of this Government.  If that money was spent on industry in the west, it would make a great difference.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill which gives legal effect to the provisions of the budget.  It is also a watershed debate if we are to believe the expectations of an election in the near future.  This debate should be about political parties putting down markers as to where they stand on economic policy and I am proud to stand by the achievements of this Government's economic policy.  Many Members commented on the excellent economic record of the past two and a half years, one of the most fundamental ingredients being a stable political environment.  That is one of the key attributes the Taoiseach, and the three parties in Government, have been able to bring into the political arena from which will emerge confidence among the business community and the public to engage in the type of long-term investment and commitment in our economy from which we all benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> I do not need to list the impressive economic indicators to confirm that those fruits have flowed from that stable political environment. However, there are some key indicators worthy of repetition. For example, there are some 100,000 more people working today than there were when this Government came into office and inflation and interest rates are at record low levels.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the bankruptcy of ideas emanating from the Opposition benches <i>vis a vis</i> taxation in general &mdash; personal and business taxation which have been significantly reduced.  Due to increased economic activity the Government has been able to reduce the amount of tax it takes from individual companies, serving as an incentive to further investment.</P>
    <P>Clearly what has been absent from any of the contributions from the Opposition benches has been any credible, coherent alternative voice or policy approach than that being pursued successfully by the present Administration.  On the one hand, we listened to Deputy Séamus Brennan castigate the Government for failing to rein in public spending.  On the other hand, daily on the Order of Business, including this morning, Members of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench castigate the Government for not having spent more.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business this morning Deputy Joe Walsh sought at least £70 million of Exchequer compensation &mdash; to which I am to a large extent sympathetic &mdash; while, on the other hand, castigated the Government for not expending sufficient on social welfare, health and so on.  If this Government is to be criticised on its record of spending excessively, where does the Opposition propose its cuts be implemented?</P>
    <P>I listened to a review of the Dublin South-East constituency on an interesting radio programme on Monday evening last when an Opposition Deputy was put under the spotlight.  He wilted and was unable to identify where he believed the axe should fall.  If Fianna Fáil is returned to Government are we to take it that the axe will fall on the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board and its attendant hepatitis C compensation payments?</P>
    <P>Equally we are daily castigated by the Opposition spokespersons on Justice for allegedly failing in the Department of Justice.  In the broad thrust of Fianna Fáil policy, notwithstanding the agenda Deputy O'Donoghue pursues from the freedom of the Opposition benches, will the progress made on justice issues, for example, the recruitment of an additional 1,450 Garda over the past two and a half years, the announced additional recruitment campaign from the beginning of next year, the prison places building programme, the improvements effected in the administration of justice, the £30 million invested in improving Garda technology, all have the axe fall on them if its expenditure cuts are to be effected?  Can it be taken that the equality payments agreed by this Government, championed by the Minister for Social Welfare, will also be axed?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> In terms of a requisite watershed debate on where parties stand in the lead up to a general election the question must be posed: is there any coherent, alternative approach emanating from the Opposition benches?  Clearly, the answer is no, in itself an endorsement of how this Government has successfully managed the public purse and created an environment within which the type of record and economic indicators from which we are benefiting arose.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that two and a half years is not a sufficient tenure in office.  I am of the strong belief that the true potential of our economy and people will be fully realised only within a further period of political stability from which additional economic benefits will accrue.  That is the key advantage this Government, and the Taoiseach in particular, offer, in stark contrast to the alleged Government in waiting.  It is true that previous attempts at coalescing between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil and Labour ended in political disaster.  A stable political environment is essential if we are to encourage the type of investment and industrial confidence from which many new jobs will flow.</P>
    <P>But from the fruits of a successful economy there is an obligation to ensure that sectors that fall on difficult times are compensated and adequately catered for.  Undoubtedly the past 12 months has been one of the most difficult years for the agricultural community resulting from the BSE crisis, not of any political-making, a problem which does not lend itself to quick-fix solutions, as some commentators would have us believe. Rather it calls for constant lobbying to restore consumer confidence in beef and beef products, for negotiating and political skills in order to extract maximum compensation payments at EU level and for vigilance in protecting and reopening markets for our beef.</P>
    <P>The Minister has performed admirably in those three areas but additional difficulties are being encountered from the culmination of three specific incidents, one being export refunds, second, the revaluation of the green £ and, third, the difficult environment being experienced in terms of third country markets for our beef products. Because we do not ship live animals there is at present no competition between the factories and third country markets; that triple whammy has inflicted considerable pain on the beef sector in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case to be made &mdash; no doubt the Taoiseach, Minister for Finance and Government will give it serious consideration &mdash; for some Exchequer compensation to match EU compensation for the green £ devaluation.  That EU compensation is triggered automatically as is the revaluation process, yet some commentators have attempted to imply that lack of vigilance on the part of the Minister has led to that revaluation, which is not the case.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Mary O'Rourke knows there <Col N="575" /> is in place a trigger mechanism that brings about that revaluation process.  Of course, there were previous occasions when devaluations which represented a windfall, or good fortune, for Irish agriculture were thoroughly enjoyed.  However, the shoe is now on the other foot, inflicting considerable pain, particularly in the case of winter fatteners.  I recall the December immediately preceding the BSE crisis, meeting producers of winter fatteners who were extremely agitated about receiving £1 per pound for the finished product in the factories and could not survive.  Today one is lucky to get 80p per pound.  Perhaps the agricultural community has suffered from crying wolf too often to enable us and the broader community to recognise a real problem.  I know from my experience of direct involvement in agriculture and meetings which I have had with the IFA and other farming organisations in recent weeks there is real pain in the agricultural community in the beef area.  The first step towards ensuring something is done is to recognise the problem.  If there was a problem at a £1 per pound in the meat factories.  That triple whammy of the export refunds which restricts exports to third countries which is a consequence of the GATT negotiations, with which the Deputy opposite is familiar, and the difficulties in markets which were previously open to us prior to the BSE crisis make it incumbent on the Government to give serious consideration to an Exchequer contribution to alleviate the worse excesses of the problems posed here.</P>
    <P>I contributed previously on the budget debate and have covered much of what was announced at that stage and what is being given legal effect in the Bill.  I concur with Deputy Brennan's plea for real debate on issues that should be material to a general election but I have found from listening to Opposition contributions there was a real bankruptcy about an alternative.  That is the greatest vote of confidence the Government will get.</P>

      <P>I agree with the earlier comments of my colleague Deputy Creed.  All Government Deputies and backbenchers are singing merrily from the same hymn sheet which sums up why the Government is working so effectively and why a record number of people throughout the country are satisfied with its performance. The Government is led by a cohesive team.  There is an effective group of Ministers and results are being delivered and felt throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill, which has been described as a watershed, is the third and final Finance Bill introduced by the Government during its terms of office.  We can still harbour thoughts of November and December.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;leads me to the point that we urgently need a fixed term of parliament.  No business would run its affairs on the basis of not knowing when the term of office of the chief executive or chairman will come up for renewal. If an Oireachtas should sit for a set number of years it would eliminate all the idle speculation as to when the next election will take place.  Perhaps we will have another Finance Bill but the chances are this will be the last Finance Bill of the Government and one I am proud to support.</P>
      <P>Deputy Seamus Brennan, who knows much about Government having served in a number of them, made the plea that the election should be fought on issues and used to highlight the differences between the Government and the Opposition on various matters, namely management of the economy, social policy, Northern Ireland, etc. In a sense I agree with him.  We can have great philosophical political debates but the man and woman on the street will decide who should form the next Government on the basis of the strength of the economy and the stability of the Government. I am confident to go before any constituent on those factors and say the Government and the economy are performing well.  Since the business of Government is being managed effectively, we do not have daily crises and disputes between Ministers, which was evident during the period from 1989 to 1994 in particular.  The former Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who is looking aghast&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;without being involved in any of those disputes, was aware of the difficulties Fianna Fáil faced in its Coalition arrangements with the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party.  Given that Fine Gael never had a leader who could look into his heart and read the minds of the people, we do not have the view that we were born to rule or have all the answers.  The parties in Government are working well together because the three leaders realise nobody is right all the time, that it requires consensus and agreement and what has worked in the past two and a half years can work in the next four or five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bottom line as far as the public is concerned is the Government's record on job creation.  Deputy Mattie Brennan bemoaned the fact that not enough new industries had opened in his constituency or in the west.  We would all like to hear an announcement of a factory for our town or constituency every month but we must recognise that up to 150,000 extra jobs were created in the past two and a half years.  It is not <Col N="577" /> always a question of a new factory but whether the factory which had employed ten people now employs 11 or a factory which employed 100 people, employing 120 or 130 people.  There has been steady employment growth across all sectors because of the sensible way in which the economy has been managed.  The growth in jobs is reflected in increased tax buoyancy and increased revenue for State coffers.  That is the type of successful economic management which has transformed the fortunes of the economy and the political fortunes of the Government in the past two years. Extra jobs have been created and there has been siginificant tax reform.  It is not always a question of the reduction in the rate of tax.  There has been a significant widening of the tax bands and we can say with certainty that every single taxpayer paying tax in the 1997-8 tax year will pay significantly less than two years ago.</P>
    <P>The Government's record in the short term has been significant.  Hundreds of extra pounds have been put into every taxpayer's pocket.  That is what genuine tax reform is all about: reducing the rate but also widening the tax bands and trying to spread the fruits of the economic boom as widely as possible.  That has been achieved to a degree in the past two years and can be achieved to an every greater degree if the same Government has the reins of power during the next four or five years.</P>
    <P>I reiterate what my colleague Deputy Creed said in relation to company and business taxation. There has been a significant reduction in the tax rates of companies, particularly small companies. It shows that the Government fully recognises the small company has a major role to play in job creation and has been delivering on job creation in the past number of years.  This record of job creation, tax reform, social policy and social advancement can stand the test of comparison with any previous Government.  The election debate and the choice the public must make will focus on stability, which has helped to bring about sound economic policy and real economic success during the Government's term of office. The country will require such stability in the next four to five years.</P>
    <P>When we discuss income tax reductions and Deputy Brennan refers to putting additional money into taxpayers' pockets, we cannot ignore the fact that tax cuts or budget reductions will make no difference if interest rates rise and mortgage rates return to the huge levels last seen when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats shared power.  Mortgage rates are at a record low and everyone hopes they will fall even further. However, they will not remain consistently low unless there is a stable political environment.  The environment created by the present Government, from the point of view of economic and political stability, has helped to reduce income tax rates. Mortgage holders are benefiting to the tune of £10, £15, £20 and, in some cases, more per week as a result of the Government's success in creating economic and political stability.  The <Col N="578" /> economy requires more of the same during the next five to six years.</P>
    <P>The Government elected in the coming months will lead the country into the next millennium. The next Taoiseach and Government will face a major political and economic task.  However, I strongly believe that the present Government's record during the past two and a half years will stand it in good stead and the public will request more of the same.  I have not met any constituents who demanded that Deputy Bertie Ahern should replace Deputy John Bruton as Taoiseach or believe that the former could represent this country at home and abroad as effectively as the latter. Likewise, none of my constituents has requested that Deputy Joe Walsh should replace Deputy Yates as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry or that Deputy McCreevy should replace Deputy De Rossa in the Department of Social Welfare.  No one has informed me that anyone could do a better job than Deputy Richard Bruton as Minister for Enterprise and Employment but I would exclude Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is about who will best run the country and the present Government has a record of which it can be proud.</P>
      <P>Section 6 relates to tax relief in respect of third level fees, something which everyone has advocated from time to time.  The fruits of the economic success people are currently enjoying must be used to build a better Ireland and education will play a key role in that regard.  We can try to put in place social welfare schemes and new methods to deal with disadvantage but nothing can solve this problem as well as education.  Every possible resource must be utilised to expand the education base.</P>
      <P>Third level education is the key towards people gaining additional qualifications and job opportunities. Section 6 will introduce tax relief on third level fees for certain undergraduates which is an important development.  During the past 20 years, growing numbers of people have attended third level institutions.  However, we must aspire to send every second level student to third level. People sometimes encounter financial as opposed to academic problems when applying to enter third level education and the introduction of further tax relief in that regard is significant and will produce results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the provisions in section 6 will extend relief to those pursuing distance education courses.  He made the point that this is designed <Col N="579" /> to facilitate open university courses.  I support that concept because we must move away from the old perception that a third level institution is a large building situated in a major town.  In the future, third level education will be much more off-campus.  A strong focus must be placed on the concept of the open university.  We should do everything possible by way of changing the tax system to make such options more interesting, affordable and rewarding.  I welcome the fact that section 6 sets out to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the concept of the developing companies market and the establishment of the special BES fund.  In his capacity as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Small Business and Services, Deputy Creed has highlighted the need for such a fund on a number of occasions.  As a result of the excellent management of the country to which I referred, there are now large sums of money available for investment in business.  It is rewarding to see such money invested in large companies to help them enlarge their operations further.  However, we must try to put the maximum amount of money from this fund in the direction of small business and new enterprise.  The provisions put in place in the relevant sections by the Minister will help and the creation of the developing companies market concept will encourage advances in this regard.</P>
    <P>We have a long way to go in developing small business and enterprise.  I hope the Minister's efforts to do so through the Finance Bill are successful and that increasing amounts of money will be invested in small companies.  This will produce jobs and real economic benefits.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the fact that the debate on the Finance Bill and all political debate between now and the election will be concerned with the Government's record and the alternative on offer from the Opposition.  The Government can confidently inform the electorate that its policies have worked because it has created employment and opportunity, spread the benefits of the economic boom across the different sectors of society and encouraged major advances in social welfare, education and employment.  The Government has succeeded in its work during the past two and a half years and the public will vote for more of the same.</P>
    <P>I have spent more time than I would have wished in Opposition.  Political scientists inform us that politics is a grave philosophical game and people are meant to have strong arguments in favour and against certain issues.  Everyone is aware that Irish politics is about delivering results.  I sometimes feel sorry for Opposition spokespersons and leaders when they are criticised because all they can do is wait for the Government to drop the ball.  The bad news for the Opposition is that this Administration has not dropped the ball.  The Government is working and succeeding and the Opposition will be obliged to wait for another term when things <Col N="580" /> might improve.  It is unfair that last week's opinion polls showed Opposition ratings have fallen significantly.  I do not believe this should have happened because the parties involved are doing the best they can in difficult times.</P>

      <P>That is more than enough.  The Government has succeeded in creating employment and has done effective work during its term of office and I have no doubt that the public will request more of the same.</P>
      <P>This is the last Finance Bill that the Minister for Finance and the Government will put through the House in 1997.  However, it is significant legislation because it builds on what was achieved during the past two years.  It is a forerunner to what can be expected in the next four to five years.</P>

      <P>Customarily, the Finance Bill is an opportunity to talk about matters of interest in the political, commercial and social scenes.  Listening to Deputies Creed and Bradford, who are hard working representatives for their communities and whom I wish many long years in Opposition, I was struck by their repetition of what was said by practically every other Government speaker. They pride themselves that they all think the same way about everything.  Is that not most extraordinary?  They are all &ldquo;Dolly-like&rdquo; clones.</P>

      <P>If every member of each party in the rainbow Government thinks the same on every matter there is something very wrong in society, although I mean no disrespect to any Member.</P>
      <P>I was at a farmers' meeting last night and a topic of conversation was how the leader of Democratic Left constantly abuses the farming community.  If the Democratic Left was true to its ideology that would be a true expression of its feelings in that regard.  How can the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, claim to have the same view on agriculture as the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa?</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister of State could have the same views as the Leader of Democratic Left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally extraordinary is the barrenness and futility of each Deputy opposite saying that he or <Col N="581" /> she thinks the same on every matter as each other Deputy on the Government benches.  I never came across a similar approach in even the most rigidly politically controlled countries.  Creativity, imagination and ideas should form a part of political philosophy and not a desperate search not to be different from anybody else in a group of three parties ranging from the far left to the far right.</P>
    <P>The cartoon on the front page of last Saturday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> was interesting. It showed the three leaders of the Government parties astride a bicycle.  The Tánaiste was in front with perspiration rolling down his brow with his hand pointing left.  Behind him was the Minister for Social Welfare, equally distressed, with his hand pointing further left.  On the back of the horse was the Taoiseach with his hand pointing far right and he was extremely distressed.  To give balance to my point, I would point out that on the other side of the cartoon was the leader of my party on a tandem with Deputy Harney and they had quizzical looks on their faces.</P>

      <P>There are almost daily glitzy announcements of new jobs from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  He should be referred to the Director of Consumer Affairs for false advertising because the headline may announce, for example, 800 jobs coming on stream but the small print indicates that they will come over the next ten years.  If one was around long enough one might find the numbers of jobs greatly diminished.  The hopes are never matched by the numbers of jobs produced.  The recycling of job announcements is also interesting.  An investment in my constituency announced more than two years ago was re-announced three weeks ago.  There was much local amusement about it.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is almost as high as crime on the list of the public's concerns as we approach the election.  These are the two major issues of concern despite the Minister for Enterprise and Employment's &ldquo;flúirseach&rdquo; gestures.  His announcements must not be making their way into the public consciousness because if they were there would not be such strong concern on the issue of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced the strong concern is based on facts.  There is no reduction in the number of people who seek advice at my clinics on how to get jobs for themselves or their children.  If Deputies from all parties were to talk freely on the matter we would agree that these jobs are not reaching the women and men we meet in our constituencies. No matter what party we are in we all try to help; it is a part of what we do as public representatives, be it in Government or Opposition. I regularly meet young people with good graduate qualifications and I try to advise them <Col N="582" /> on postgraduate or other training courses.  There are large numbers of unemployed people.</P>
    <P>Although he is regarded now as somewhat old-fashioned, J.K. Galbraith talked about a &ldquo;culture of contentment&rdquo; in which people were content with bearable levels of unemployment.  The point is similar to the zero tolerance issue as Deputy O'Donoghue has outlined it.  Why should we put up with what the culture of contentment would consider a &ldquo;bearable&rdquo; level of unemployment of 260,000?  It is a high figure and I accept the level was also high during my party's period in Government. When the unemployment figures were announced the other day I thought it interesting that one of the Government's propaganda handlers made the point that they constituted the best record of employment since 1991.  Incidentally, 1991 is when Fianna Fáil was last in Government with the Progressive Democrats, yet the Tánaiste constantly tells us of the misery list he intends to prepare of those years of Government.</P>
    <P>There is a strong feeling that there is much amiss in society.  Studies show that the poverty gap has grown steadily under this and previous Governments.  It is our duty as public representatives to redress the balance and render society more equitable.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has been in Government for almost nine of the past 15 years, yet it continues to take the high moral ground and lecture the rest of us on what we should be doing.  Unless there is a willingness across party lines to tackle long-term unemployment, this society is headed for chaos.  I wish the members of the Government could hear the hollow laughs in the pubs and homes of Ireland when the phrase &ldquo;we are living in a Celtic tiger economy and the wonder of the West&rdquo; is repeated <i>ad nauseam.</i> I am glad there has been industrial growth but this should not be at the expense of the less well off.  That would be at our peril.  People need to be given the opportunity to earn to contribute to the economy, otherwise their lives will be wasted.</P>
    <P>The cycle of deprivation is evident in many communities.  When one looks at television one can see what is happening in places such as Tallaght where people express their fears and concerns at huge public meetings.  They have no faith that the State agencies will guide and help them and show them the way ahead.  Long-term unemployment is part of the cycle of deprivation which leads to crime.  There are families where fathers and sons, mothers and daughters have never had a job and wake up knowing they will never have one.  The unemployment figure has fallen but this makes the long-term unemployment figures look even worse.  The numbers of long-term unemployed continue to grow as a percentage of the total.</P>
    <P>In a display of contentment, the three partners in Government constantly state that they think at one on every item.  This is an extraordinary phenomenon which, in political terms, is dangerous and will have a destabilising effect on society. I would prefer to see in Government strong individuals <Col N="583" /> with definite ideas which can be incorporated in a programme for Government.  Parties in Government should be able to express their opinions without being afraid of upsetting their partners.  Every morning the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, says to himself, &ldquo;today I will be nice to everyone in Government&rdquo;.  That is a barren philosophy.  The coming weeks will show that the electorate does not like the rainbow.</P>

The barren nature of the Government's philosophy and thought is nowhere more evident than in this Bill which lacks foresight in its failure to set out a strategic plan for Ireland's economic and social development. This Bill, with the Social Welfare Bill, should set out measures to steer the economy and the people of the nation in these good times and in the more difficult times that lie ahead. However, it represents little more than a reckless pre-election spending spree and a gamble with the health of the economy.</P>
      <P>Increased spending has been the hallmark of this Administration which has been spending money like a druken sailor.  Spending will increase this year by 6.5 per cent, three times the rate of inflation.  Between January 1995 and end December 1996 current spending increased by over 20 per cent against a cumulative inflation rate of 6 per cent.  Over 50 per cent of taxes in 1996 were used to service the national debt which the Government has failed to reduce.  My colleague. Deputy Michael Woods, yesterday repeated the comment made by the leader of my party, Deputy Bertie Ahern, that there is an urgent necessity to cap the national debt at £30 million and then reduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened to the policy of the Minister for Finance outlined in the programme for Government prepared by the ill-matched three to restrict growth in expenditure to 2 per cent?  The reality is that it was discarded during the Government's spending spree.  This has major implications for the taxpayer.  There has been much talk about the Celtic tiger and the progress made on the strong foundations laid by Fianna Fáil in 1987 but it is the taxpayer who has been penalised <Col N="584" /> most.  Money continues to roll in as there is no relief for the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The rainbow coalition of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left halted the process of reductions in income tax initiated by Fianna Fáil and reneged on its commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> In three successive budgets the standard rate of tax has been reduced by a mere 1 per cent in a time of plenty.  By contrast, the previous Fianna Fáil Government reduced the upper rate from 60 per cent to 48 per cent and the lower rate from 35 per cent to 27 per cent but much more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Why has the Government failed completely to reduce significantly the tax burden in a time of economic prosperity?  The answer is simple.  Once it had completed its spending spree, the coffers were empty and it was unable to reward the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Despite its claims to the contrary, the Government has failed to address the problem of unemployment and to meet its targets in this area.  Furthermore, the claim by the Minister for Finance that the issues of drugs and crime do not come within the parameters of the Department of Finance highlights the Government's attitude to the disadvantaged in society.  If the rainbow coalition does not regard a reduction in drug abuse and crime as central to economic and social development then it does not deserve to be in office.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I have been meeting my constituents and seeking their support in the forthcoming general election.  The clear message they are giving is that the Government has failed society in terms of dealing with crime and drugs and has failed the taxpayer in terms of reducing the level of tax.  The first duty of a Government is to provide security for its citizens in their homes and business places and on the streets and to ensure their children are safe from the appalling effects of drugs.  The Government has failed miserably on both counts.</P>
    <P>The policy on justice has been driven by my party's spokesman, Deputy John O'Donoghue, who has introduced most of the amending legislation in this area.  He introduced the legislation under which the Criminal Assets Bureau, which has been so successful, was set up.  The budget failed to make any provision for those in society who are least able to provide for themselves.  It represents a total sell out of the so-called Labour and Democratic Left ideals in this area.</P>
    <P>The semi-State sector is very important to the economy.  My party leader referred to the proposed break up of FÁS, about which the unions have been notified.  There is a total lack of concern in this proposal for the less well off in society.  Of course, this matter is of no interest to this Administration or its supporters.  My party is determined that the semi-State sector should be properly supported.</P>
    <P>In the commercial semi-State sector, the Government's proposals in regard to Aer Lingus are scandalous and totally at variance with what it <Col N="585" /> said it would do prior to the last general election. Yesterday on the Order of Business the Taoiseach made it clear that the sale of Aer Lingus was currently under examination by the board of the company and any legislation required to give effect to its decisions would be promptly introduced. The management and workers of Aer Lingus worked hard to make a trading profit last year and it is totally unacceptable that the Government should reward them by selling off part of the company.  This proposal does not give any recognition to the efforts of the workers and management of the company.  It is totally wrong that decisions on the future of the national airline should be made by the board of a semi-State company. This matter should only be decided by the Government and the Dáil.  However, by passing the decision over to the board the Government can say the board made the decision and all they are doing is bringing in legislation to ratify it.</P>
    <P>When Deputies Spring and De Rossa visited Dublin Airport during the last general election campaign they gave solemn commitments to the staff that the airline would not be sold.  Despite those promises and the commitments given during the negotiations on Partnership 2000 and the programme for Government which stated that strategic alliances would only be pursued when it was in the interests of the staff, negotiations are taking place on the sale of part of Aer Lingus. Deputy Seamus Brennan issued a statement today in which he says that Aer Lingus is back in profit thanks to the work of the staff and the former Minister, Deputy Brian Cowen, and to a major injection of taxpayers' funds which was principally brought about by Deputy Bertie Ahern when Minister for Finance.  Now that the profits are flowing in, the Government wants to sell out on the taxpayers and sell part of Aer Lingus to a foreign multinational.  If the Government follows this course there could be major implications for the staff of Aer Lingus.  In his statement Deputy Brennan said:</P>
    <P>We have already seen that the Telecom strategic alliance has meant that 1,200 jobs are to be shed with another 5,000 in danger.  There is no doubt that the same will happen at Aer Lingus.  Some multinational player will want a return on their money and will shed jobs and cut routes and possibly close down TEAM.  The Aer Lingus deal will turn out as bad as the one the Government has done for Telecom when a price of just £183 million was achieved for a stake worth between £4 million-£5 million and Aer Lingus workers and tax payers will end up being short changed after making such a huge investment in the airline.</P>
    <P>The staff who have made this investment in the airline deserve better from the Government than to be treated in this way.  They will not forget the empty promises made by the leaders of Labour and Democratic Left on this issue.</P>
    <P>The duty free industry is vitally important to airports, the travelling public, manufacturers and <Col N="586" /> Aer Rianta workers.  During its six months Presidency of the European Union the Government did not put on the agenda of EU Finance Ministers the future of duty free shopping or carry out a study.  I assure this House, Aer Rianta workers and duty free suppliers that Fianna Fáil in Government will fight hard to retain this very important industry.  We are the only country in Europe with no land connection to mainland Europe and it is very important that we have a duty free industry.  The Government has failed Aer Rianta, its workers and suppliers.  However, the incoming Fianna Fáil-led Administration will do what should have been done by this appalling Administration.</P>

      <P>Having listened attentively to the previous two speakers one can see just how divided the Fianna Fáil Party is.  Deputy Burke complained about the level of spending, while Deputy O'Rourke wanted more spending.  It shows clearly the difference between the Fianna Fáil philosophy on privatisation and that of the Progressive Democrats.  If and when the Progressive Democrats Party gets into power it has promised to privatise as many companies as possible, yet statements from Fianna Fáil speakers today indicate it is totally opposed to even the partial involvement of any partner with Aer Lingus to ensure the company's future.  Contradictions are emerging daily in the statements from Fianna Fáil depending on the audience it is addressing &mdash; local people in Ballymun or the business sector in Dublin 4.</P>
      <P>There was a reference by Deputy O'Rourke to the fact that the Government partners are very much in agreement.  That is because the Government is being managed well.  There is total coherence among the three parties.  We are adhering to our programme and, as a result, the country is benefiting considerably.  The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government collapsed following various scandals and inquires, and the Fianna Fáil-Labour coalition collapsed because Labour could no longer trust its partner in Government.  This is one of the most successful Governments in the history of the State and I am sure the people will vote confidence in it in the next election, whenever that may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to Telecom Éireann but failed to acknowledge its recent announcement of substantial decreases in the cost of international telephone calls which will make our industry far more competitive.  That reflects the cost cutting exercise undergone by Telecom in recent years and the fact that it can be competitive <Col N="587" /> which will help industry and tourism and boost our overall competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Burke, who makes very little sense, and Deputy O'Rourke, to whom I would tend to listen a little more attentively, it is obvious there are wide differences in Fianna Fáil in regard to its future policy.  There is no resemblance between the utterances of Fianna Fáil speakers and those of speakers from the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>I wish to examine specifically the sections of the Finance Bill which impact most directly on the agri-food sector.  It is important to examine how these measures fit into the broader picture of the performance of that sector and its contribution to the national economy.  I will commence by looking back at 1996, in particular the performance of the national economy and the way agriculture performed in that buoyant economic climate.  I will briefly examine capital investment in agriculture during the 1990s.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1996, agreement was reached with the social partners on a new programme, Partnership 2000, and I will refer to some of the main items contained in the agreement as they affect agriculture.  Partnership 2000 provides a framework for the development of our economy over the next three years and it was a significant development on which to conclude 1996.  From this agreement arose many of the Government commitments subsequently dealt with in the budget and which gave rise to the 1997 Finance Bill.  I will refer to the various sections of the Bill dealing with Partnership 2000 commitments as I discuss them and conclude with a brief look at the prospects for agriculture, and the economy as a whole, for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In 1996, the economy performed exceptionally well with output growth of 7.25 per cent compared to an OECD average of 2.5 per cent.  As in 1995, the strong growth was underpinned by low inflation and a low interest rate environment.  I am sure Deputy Cullen received his copy of <i>The Week in Europe</i> today, the first item of which deals with the Irish economy.  It is headed &ldquo;Ireland tops EU growth rate&rdquo; and reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Ireland's economy grew in 1996 at five times the EU average growth rate.  Irish GDP growth was 7.8 per cent compared to 1.6 per cent for the EU as a whole.  Apart from Ireland, the next best performer was the Netherlands at 2.56 per cent.  Most Members States saw reduced growth rates.  Italy had the weakest growth at 0.77 per cent.</P>
    <P>Despite that good news, Deputies Burke and O'Rourke told us the country was in trouble and that our economy was in a poor state.  The indicators are that the economy is currently prospering and is likely to continue.  Ireland is called the Celtic Tiger because it is perceived, not only in Europe but throughout the developed world, as a properly managed economy going in the right <Col N="588" /> direction.  That is the reason we are creating more jobs than ever through international investment. I spoke to a number of international investors recently who were very positive about Ireland and the way we are managing our economy.  That is to the credit of this Government, although I would be the first to recognise the contributions of previous Governments.</P>
    <P>The growth in the economy is impressive in the context of economic uncertainty in Europe and the difficulties associated with the negative impact of the BSE crisis.  The underlying strength of the Irish economy has been achieved by a focused approach to fiscal, monetary, income and employment policies by the Government.  The strong performance has been achieved without any upward pressure on inflation which has been held at 1.6 per cent &mdash; the lowest since the 1950s &mdash; and compares very favourably with an EU average of 2.6 per cent.  The economy was driven in 1996 by strong domestic demand, with capital investment in construction rising strongly.  The most significant development of our economic performance has been the increase of 50,000 in the numbers at work last year.</P>
    <P>Despite the buoyancy of the economy, 1996 was a difficult year for agriculture.  There were many difficulties which needed to be tackled by the Government in preparation for the budget. Although aggregate farm income throughout the year as a whole was maintained at just below 1995 levels, which was a very creditable performance, the benefits were not distributed equally across all sectors.  There was very strong growth in output values in the pig and sheep sectors while there was a good performance in milk output values and, despite signs of a weakening of the international market for dairy products, milk prices were more or less maintained at the high levels achieved in 1995.  Cereal producers suffered a sharp price decline which caused their output value to fall, although this was compensated to some extent by a very good harvest.</P>
    <P>The main difficulties faced in 1996 related to beef production.  Deputies hardly need reminding that from March 1996 onwards the BSE crisis threw this sector into turmoil, with a decline in consumer confidence in beef and the closure of certain international markets to Irish beef.  The Government moved swiftly and made every effort to maintain stability in the market, to support producer income once the crisis emerged and to minimise income loss.  The emergency market support measures adopted went a considerable way to assist with this.  The special BSE package of £70 million which was secured in June last year was both timely and helpful.  Included as part of this package was an amendment to the rules governing the deseasonalisation premium, worth £16 million, to guarantee its continuation this year. The additional £31 million package agreed in October will further cushion producers.  The reopening of international markets and the recovery in consumer confidence within the EU helped stabilise the sector towards year end.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> Since the 1992 CAP reform changes, direct payments have become a vital element of farmers' incomes, and 1996 was no exception with payments of over £904 million being paid out by my Department during the year.  These equated to over 44 per cent of aggregate farm income in 1996 without which farmers would have found themselves in very poor financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>Investment in agriculture increased by over 27 per cent in nominal terms and over 12 per cent in real terms between 1991 and 1995.  Expenditure on farm buildings peaked in 1991, helped by grant aid available under the Operational Programme for the Control of Farmyard Pollution 1989-92. The pace of on-farm investment weakened during 1993 but recovered by 1995 reflecting in part the strong uptake of the new CFP scheme under the OPARDF 1994-9, and strong growth in farm incomes over the period.  Favourable taxation incentives, introduced as part of the special package of measures for farmers in the 1997 budget, should further boost investment on necessary capital works for pollution control on Irish farms over the medium term.  Investment in farm machinery has increased dramatically &mdash; by 50 per cent in the two years to 1995 &mdash; reflecting increased on-farm mechanisation and buoyant farm incomes.  However, the 1996 out-turn may well show a levelling off of investment in response to the uncertainties caused by the BSE crisis.</P>
    <P>The successful conclusion of Partnership 2000 provides the framework for social and economic progress and cohesion over the next three years. Partnership 2000 addresses three essential economic and social challenges: maintaining an effective and consistent policy approach in a period of high economic growth; significantly reducing social disparities and exclusion especially by reducing long-term unemployment; and responding effectively at national, sectoral and enterprise levels to global competition and the information society.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of macro-economic policy is identified so as to secure and strengthen the economy's capacity for sustainable employment, economic growth and social inclusion.  In this regard it was agreed that fiscal policy should incorporate the following: an action programme on social inclusion involving extra expenditure of £525 million; tax reductions of £1 billion, in a full year equal to over 0.55 per cent of GDP; annual growth in gross current supply service expenditure to be kept as close as possible to 2 per cent in real terms; a general Government deficit of not more than 1.5 per cent by 1999 and a debt-GDP ratio of 70 per cent by 1999.</P>
    <P>As one of the major social partners the farm organisations were involved in these discussions and I believe that the agreement with these organisations provides a blueprint for developing a competitive sector over the coming years.  The overriding concern in the short-term is to ensure that our high animal health status is maintained and that consumer confidence in livestock products <Col N="590" /> is strengthened both at home and in our important export markets.  Therefore, to provide for effective traceability of cattle we have agreed, in Partnership 2000, that the computerised animal monitoring system currently being developed will be fully implemented during 1998.</P>
    <P>The production of low-cost high quality products that can compete in the more liberalised trading environment of the future is essential. The long-term competitiveness of the agri-food sector will depend crucially on attracting new entrants to farming, providing the necessary training, advice and research backup to all farmers and encouraging productive and non-productive investment throughout the sector.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 contains commitments to improve existing arrangements for education and training for farmers.  It also makes provision for an independent review of advisory services to ensure a more effective and efficient delivery of Teagasc programmes in this area.</P>
    <P>Incentives to encourage new entrants into farming include a commitment to seek the continuation of the early retirement scheme after 1997.  The agreement also provided for significant tax concessions to encourage investment and early transfer of land.  The relatively high age profile of Irish farmers has been a persistent obstacle to structural change within the agriculture sector over many years, and I am very pleased that this year's Finance Bill has put in place a coherent set of tax incentives which will greatly assist the entry of young people into farming and encourage investment generally among farmers.</P>
    <P>The targeted set of measures agreed in the context of Partnership 2000 and contained in the Finance Bill is as follows: the renewal of the special stamp duty relief for transfers of agricultural land and buildings to young trained farmers for a further three years is dealt with in section 98.  This concession will save young farmers £4.5 million in a full year and will continue to act as an important incentive to early transfer and, in turn, structural change within the farming sector.</P>
    <P>The Government is very much aware of the investment needs of young farmers and this was the subject of much discussion during the talks on Partnership 2000.  Section 17 deals with concessions in this area and I consider that, for example, the continuation of 100 per cent stock relief for young trained farmers for a further two years will continue to benefit new entrants who have to invest heavily in building up stock numbers.</P>
    <P>Section 18 allows all farmers to continue to avail of the 25 per cent stock relief which will release resources for productive investment for the upgrading and replacement of facilities necessary to reduce production costs and enhance efficiency.</P>
    <P>One of the Government's main objectives is to maintain an environmentally sound farming sector. During the discussions on the new programme, the farm organisations pressed very strongly for the introduction of incentives for <Col N="591" /> investment in necessary on-farm pollution control works, and it was agreed that some incentives were needed to encourage larger farmers within the tax net to undertake pollution related investment.</P>
    <P>The commitment in Partnership 2000 to improve the existing very generous capital allowances available to farmers has been honoured. Under section 18 provision is made for a special one year allowance of 50 per cent of the expenditure incurred on necessary pollution control measures up to an expenditure limit of £20,000, with the balance of expenditure written off over the following seven years.  This concession is the most favourable countrywide relief in the economy, and we are confident that it will make a very significant contribution to the protection of the rural environmental in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The commitment of small to medium sized farmers to environmental protection is clearly demonstrated by the strong uptake of the control of farm pollution scheme which attracted some 18,500 participants at the time of its suspension in 1995.  To ensure that the momentum of on-farm pollution control investment is maintained over the coming years we agreed, in the context of Partnership 2000, to give priority to the reintroduction of the control of farm pollution scheme, if additional funds become available at the mid term review of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Other changes of benefit to farmers and the food industry contained in the Finance Bill are also worth highlighting.  Despite the fact that 1996 aggregate farm incomes were more or less maintained at the 1995 levels, many farmers were badly affected by the BSE crisis during the year, and continue to be affected.  The decision to increase the VAT refund again this year to 3.3 per cent at a full-year cost of £14.1 million, and for which provision is made in section 78, should boost the income of farmers who are not currently registered for VAT but are required to pay VAT on their inputs.</P>
    <P>Section 104 provides that farmers will also benefit from the increase in agricultural relief for Capital Acquisition Tax from 75 per cent to 90 per cent for those transferring land, buildings, livestock and machinery.  This and other incentives will further ease the transfer costs for farmers, and young farmers in particular.</P>
    <P>Under sections 37 and 38 the reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax from 38 per cent to 36 per cent and from 30 per cent to 28 per cent on the first £50,000 of company income will reduce tax on non-manufacturing activities.</P>
    <P>Farmers, as taxpayers, will also share the benefits of what has been, by any standard, a well thought out and comprehensive Finance Bill.  The further cut in the standard rate from 27 per cent to 26 per cent coupled with the widening of the bands increased personal allowances and the increase in the income tax exemption limit should all put more money into the pockets of farmers this year.  The integrated package of measures for <Col N="592" /> the farming sector contained in this year's Bill should boost income, promote on farm investment, particularly necessary investment in environmental protection, and help improve the structure of the Irish agricultural sector.  The new measures, along with the renewal and improvement of incentives for investment and the orderly transfer of land, are important elements in the drive for improved competitiveness in the sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very positive for the farming community. It honours many of the commitments made in Partnership 2000.  This morning I heard a prominent trade unionist refer to the fact that many of the agreements entered into were not being put in place.  They have been honoured in the agricultural sector and some are contained in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Rourke's last remark was peculiar.  She said the Taoiseach gets up every morning and says to himself he is going to be nice to everyone today.  She found this very unusual.  It is a good philosophy to have in life but is completely alien to the Deputy.  Deputy O'Rourke then went on to say that all Government TDs spoke from the one hymn sheet, were clones, were determined to stay in power at any price and were afraid to upset the other partners. Deputy Burke then said exactly the same.  The cloning is not all one sided.</P>
      <P>Together with the Social Welfare Bill, the Finance Bill gives effect to the provisions of the budget.  It is also a tidying-up operation addressing some of the issues not referred to in it or which have surfaced in the intervening weeks. The budget was the third in a package of three presented by the Government.  Changes were deliberately targeted at people on low incomes, whether on social welfare or in low paid employment. It continued the work and family friendly approach adopted by the Government since entering office in December 1994.</P>
      <P>One matter which has still not been addressed is the tax status of corporate donations to charities.  It is not an issue and has been debated for as long as I can remember.  I urge the Minister to table an appropriate amendment when the Bill reaches Committee Stage.  As demands on charities grow heavier, the pressure on their resources increases.  In over two years I have spoken five times on this issue but we are no closer to a solution.  With buoyant tax receipt, it is an ideal time for the Minister to make a gesture in the direction of the organisations which have made their case so well such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which so often picks up the pieces for many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as providing material assistance, charities by their very existence reinforce the concept of community.  They are an affirmation of our responsibility for one another, of our existence as a society rather than as a collection of individuals. A potent argument has been put forward by the Irish charities tax reform group for relief to be introduced on corporate donations from £100 to £10,000.  According to its calculations such an <Col N="593" /> initiative, which could be introduced on an initial pilot basis, would increase corporate donations to charities by around £7 million to a total of £11 million per year, while costing the Exchequer approximately £3 million.  Given that there is already an existing list of charities which benefit from revenue exemptions and that corporations already obtain tax relief under a variety of headings, there is no practical obstacle to introducing such a measure with a built in review date.  The charity review group says this should happen in three years.  Providing relief on corporate donations would substantially increase the funds available to charities.  Even more important, however, it would increase the connection between corporations and the communities within which they operate which is as important. I urge the Minister to address this matter when the Bill reaches Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The budget gives us an opportunity to reflect on what needs to be done as well as what has been achieved.  It also provides us with an opportunity to reflect on alternatives, for example, if the Bill were presented by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil.  The Progressive Democrats and the McCreevy wing of Fianna Fáil have a clear vision for which they must be congratulated because they constantly crow about ideology to the Government.  They equally have an ideology. They would probably grant tax relief to corporations on charitable donations and I welcome Deputy McCreevy's support for this measure, which he stated earlier.  They would have to take such an initiative when one considers the increased burden which would be placed on charities if we were to have a rerun of the PD-Fianna Fáil Government of the 1989-92 vintage.</P>

      <P>It had long lasting consequences, including the infamous social welfare cuts introduced by Deputy McCreevy, the effects of which were finally reversed recently by Deputy De Rossa.  Deputy McCreevy indicated he favours revisiting the taxation of social welfare.  Are we to look forward to another &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts?  The 1989-92 Administration was plagued by instability with Deputy McDowell prowling restlessly outside the gates of Government buildings to ensure his colleagues did not deviate from the PD gospel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The choice facing the people later this year will not simply be between the progressive vision offered by the current coalition or the right wing <Col N="594" /> vision of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. They will be asked to choose between stability or chaos, between three parties working together for the common good or a Government where policy is made not in Cabinet but on <i>Morning Ireland.</i> Last week Deputy Harney said if returned to office her party would revisit water charges.  In a few brief moments she reduced her potential coalition partners to stunned silence, and the rest of the country with them, and finally demolished her party's claim to be the guardian of tax reform.  An analysis of PD policy proposals ranging from increased road tolling to the reintroduction of water charges indicates clearly that PAYE workers would find themselves paying more in indirect taxes under any PD influenced Government.  When it first donned the mantle of fiscal rectitude it marketed itself as the party of no tax and no spend.  It did what it promised and the rhetoric became reality when basic services were subjected to savage cutbacks during the 1989-92 Administration.  The Progressive Democrats may want people to have more money in their pockets, but that is not the case when it comes to water charges or travelling to work. Their leader should definitely avoid early morning interviews.</P>

      <P>I will start by referring to the Taoiseach's ebullient form this morning when he referred to Waterford and the south east.  I was trying to attract the Chair's attention to respond to his remarks but, because of the number of Members trying to contribute, I was unsuccessful. The Taoiseach gave credit to his new found colleague in the city for the new bridge.  If he had taken time to look around he would have seen the stunned expressions on the faces of Deputy Deasy and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea. While he had the courtesy to mention my name, it was in a rather condescending manner.  The Taoiseach is foolish if he believes the public will accept that one individual was the driving force behind one of our most important new infrastructures. He was grossly unfair to his former friend, Deputy Deasy.  The Taoiseach appears to have many former friends in the Government these days.  He was also extremely unfair to Deputy Kenneally.  In playing his games this morning, he forgot that there was a united front on the project. The real commendations are due to Waterford Corporation, Waterford and Kilkenny County Councils and the officials who worked tirelessly with public representatives, particularly during the past 18 months, to ensure the project was ready for the mid-term review.  That is what the Taoiseach should have concentrated on this morning instead of making a mockery of the National Roads Authority, the Minister for the Environment and all those involved in the project. <Col N="595" /> He should think twice before being flippant about such important matters.  I hope he hears my response because unfortunately I was not unable to respond this morning.  I can only reflect on what Deputy Deasy may think, but the forthcoming general election may prove a bridge too far for the gentleman the Taoiseach mentioned this morning because he certainly will not unseat Deputy Deasy.</P>
      <P>It is frustrating that public commentators and the public seem to accept that we can no longer question public expenditure.  There appears to be little interest in the current high levels of public expenditure at a time of tremendous economic growth.  Political commentators put more weight on trivial matters that make a banner headline for one day and are then forgotten, but when matters turn around in the years ahead they will lecture all and sundry about what happened in the mid-1990s when levels of public expenditure reached 20 per cent and inflation was running at 6 per cent.  The current high expenditure levels will have a major effect on the economy in future years.</P>
      <P>While an air of confidence among people is understandable, they should be careful not to get caught in the comfort zone and believe that current growth levels will remain, irrespective of what we do.  That is not the case.  People tend to have short memories.  Similar policies, although pursued at a time of serious economic downturn in the mid-1980s, almost bankrupt the country.  If a case could be made for increasing public expenditure and prime pumping the economy, a secondary school student studying economics or accountancy would know that adopting such policies might be wise and fruitful at a time of economic slump&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but to do so at a time of unprecedented economic growth lacks vision and leads to serious problems in the future.  I hope there will be a change of Government in the next few months to redress the incredible changes in fiscal policy that have occured under this Government.</P>
      <P>As I have stated on many occasions, this is highly masked by the increasing levels of revenue inflows.  This year the tax take is running at 15 per cent ahead of expectation.  Where do PAYE workers figure in all of this?  What have they gained in the past three years?  They have gained by a mere 1 per cent in direct terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Members of the House, the Central Bank or economists from the right or left talk about the economy, the key concern is to maintain competitiveness in our economy.  We must be more competitive than any other economy in Europe as well as compete in the world arena in terms of multinational investment.  We are aware that substantial changes will take place in the <Col N="596" /> years ahead.  Structural funding will be radically altered in less than two years' time and the onrushing train of monetary union will have serious implications for us.  We are not using the current fiscal instruments available to us to even cushion some of the problems we will face in the next few years.  Rather than using the inflows to the Exchequer in recent years to reduce tax rates and cushion the effects of currency fluctuations if the UK does not join economic and monetary union in the first round, we rushed headlong to raise expenditure to astronomical levels.</P>
    <P>One could make a case for high spending if it involved capital projects from which there would be long-term benefits.  However, we are spending money on unsustainable projects and I am sure no Member would disagree with that.  Current expenditure levels are sustainable only in the context of a booming economy.  That is the only context in which we could get away with it.  However, that only prolongs the day when the Irish, European or world economies will experience a downturn. We do not want to go from boom to bust. That is the one thing we simply cannot afford.</P>

      <P>Through our many fiscal instruments we could already be planning ways of cushioning its effects. Instead, however, we are doing nothing in real terms to prepare for the effects on jobs and to underpin the competitiveness of our economy which grew off the backs of workers over the last decade.  They took a lot of hard hits, yet they increased their productivity to unbelievable levels compared to some years ago.  They have not been given the reward for the effort, work and productivity levels they achieved.  It is a shame on the Government and the Labour Party who sees itself as the great defender of the PAYE sector. That is another myth that has been exploded.</P>

      <P>Question must be asked about the way the IDA operates and the way jobs are being created and dispersed.  Politicians and Government cannot interfere when companies choose a particular location.  They do so in the first instance, and rightly so, on economic grounds depending on where their markets are located, whether they are domestic or international, European or American.  That is a big influencing factor on where companies locate.  Clearly, however, when one coldly analyses the job statistics for where jobs are being created today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;based on the Government's own statistics presented by the IDA, my own region of Waterford and the south-east generally has been seriously disadvantaged.  That is not to cast aspersions on those involved in the regional office in Waterford or in looking after the south-east. I have no doubt they are doing the best they can with the resources available.  However, I will never forgive &mdash; until it changed, and I hope that when back in office we will change it &mdash; the decision to remove the regional director of the IDA and base him in Cork, and to put the south west and south east regions together.  It is an impossible and intolerable task for one individual to straddle a third of the country.  That is not a specific commitment to job creation.  One must concentrate on the regions but doubling the size of a region in the way the IDA did, has greatly diminished our prospects in the south-east.  It was a serious error of judgment.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, should not have tolerated this decision.  He was courteous enough to meet me and other local Deputies from Waterford to discuss the matter, but in spite of his best efforts I did not find one solid argument to convince me it was a good decision.  It may have been all right for Cork but <Col N="598" /> Cork was doing fine without it.  I do not see any reason Cork needs the south-east attached to it. We need the competitiveness between the various attributes within the IDA, both domestically and internationally, to ensure there is a focus in each region.  There are competing and conflicting interests in having an IDA director based over such regions including Cork and Waterford, particularly in the port areas.  It is wrong to put anybody in that position and I want to see the situation reversed, although I have no confidence that the Government will reverse it.  Nevertheless, on Fianna Fáil return to Government it will be one of the issues that will be examined within that Department.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill is a bit like the budget this year; it is all very predictable.  We knew most of it, having read about it in the newspapers, long before the budget was announced. There is nothing new, no forward planning and no real direction in the Bill.  I accept what a number of speakers have said; that there is a &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor around.

However, just because there is a &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor around does not mean that Governments or individual Ministers should be throwing money in all directions.  There has been far too much of that in recent times.  As I see it, in recent months every problem is being headed off at the pass by the Government and every issue is being sorted very quickly.  We even see it here in Private Members' Time when all of a sudden everything is accepted.  The Government cannot say no to anybody.  I hope the election comes quickly or the country will be broke.  One can do that for a couple of weeks coming up to an election but one cannot do it for very long, no matter who is in power.  Sooner or later that sort of problem will come back to haunt you.</P>

      <P>While things are going well, it is important to reflect that we will be paying out £200 million extra on the national debt this year. We will still borrow £637 million according to the budget figures, or over £2 billion in the three year programme of the Minister for Finance.  That is an awful lot of money.  We can manage it as long as the economy is going well but economies swing one way and the other like a pendulum.  Sooner or later, no matter who is in power, things will not be as good and we are not providing for the rainy day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk today about this cohesive Government and all that nonsense.  It is easy to keep everybody happy when you are throwing money in all directions.  Deputy <Col N="599" /> Broughan was a school teacher.  It is the same as if you are handling children, give them sweets and lemonade.

I am sure there are many other items but we will probably not find out for three or four years.  Then we will realise the sort of long-term strategic planning issues which should have been dealt with in 1996 and 1997 but were not.  If you are prepared to avoid issues you can keep everybody happy.</P>
      <P>A big spin was put on the budget saying that everybody did very well out of it.

      <P>The issue I am talking about is the unfair way in which the exemption limits were treated.  If I was a 70 year old ex-TD or ex-school teacher, as a married man I would have received an increase of £500 in my personal allowance, plus £400 in my age allowance from the budget. That is £900 added to my tax free allowance. According to a recent reply to a parliamentary question, 27,000 pensioners are paying the marginal rate.  They have been conned because they only received a tax free allowance increase of £200 while others got £900.  I do not know why 27,000 pensioners were singled out and victimised. A hallmark of any society is how it treats its elderly.  If the economy is doing well, surely we should look after the elderly who struggled through more difficult times?  I do not know if it was a mistake or deliberate, but those tax paying pensioners have been treated shabbily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of jibes about Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Water rates are not an issue in my constituency because we have not paid any since 1986 when Dublin City Council, controlled by Fianna Fáil under the leadership of Deputy Bertie Ahern, abolished them.  Next year my constituents will have to pay increased car tax as a result of the Government's decision.  Deputy Broughan is riding two horses &mdash; he has one foot in Dublin Corporation area and one in Fingal County Council area.  I will tell my constituents that they will have to pay increased car tax next year thanks to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Shortall and <Col N="600" /> Deputy Flaherty.  If those three Deputies do not tell their constituents, I will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy sat on the fence on the water issue.  It is important to keep a deal negotiated with another political party no matter how strong the views are on the issue.  However, when Deputy Bertie Ahern shook hands with the Leader of the Labour Party two years ago, the deal was broken after a couple of days.  It is important to know that the person with whom a deal is made has the authority to make the deal and is not a puppet on someone else's string.</P>
      <P>Many Members mentioned the economic boom and said it was concentrated in Dublin rather than in Donegal, Kerry or Cork.  However, many parts of Dublin have not experienced it either.  I read statements by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and IDA Ireland about the number of new jobs being created.  I hope some of them will be in Dublin North-West.  It is represented by three Government Deputies, including the Minister for Social Welfare, yet it has got sweet nothing.</P>

There was another proposal many months ago to designate Finglas technology campus a tax free area.  However, that did not happen.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The budget, the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill usually highlight the Government's priorities.  The Minister for Finance said this Bill will enable the Government to reward work, safeguard jobs, reduce business tax and stimulate enterprise.  When I heard that, I wondered if I was in Disneyland or Ireland.</P>
      <P>What will this Bill do for the country in the long-term?  It seems to be a case of spending more to solve our problems.  There have been no tax cuts except a reduction of 1p.  When Fianna Fáil was in Government during more difficult times, the lower rate of tax was reduced from 35 per cent to 27 per cent and the higher rate from 58 per cent to 48 per cent.  We are disappointed the Minister did not reduce taxes further.  Our national debt is £30 billion, yet we are still borrowing money.  We seem to be making no effort to reduce that.  Public spending increased by 22 per cent over the past three years when inflation was 6 per cent.  If there is a downturn in the economy, it will cause great hardship for many people.</P>
      <P>This Bill will not stimulate growth in County Mayo, particularly the Ballina region which I represent. There are 3,000 unemployed people in Ballina a number which has not decreased over the past couple of years.  We have talked about urban renewal, but we should also consider rural renewal.  The Finance Bill does not provide a stimulus to improve rural Ireland.  Is it not possible to extend business expansion schemes to these areas or to create tax incentives for places such as Knock Airport?  Rural areas have fared badly under this Government.  Agriculture has also been hit with beef prices dropping from 107p per pound in 1995 to 80p per pound.  Unfortunately, the measures adopted by the Government are not helping to solve these problems.</P>
      <P>The Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds have not been spent in the right regions.  Objective One was mentioned by a few speakers.  This is a time of boom, but in 1999 Objective One may not include the entire country.  We should target places such as the west, the north-west and the south-east which need a capital injection if they are to survive after 1999.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> While I share Deputy de Valera's broad objective in bringing forward these proposals, as we examine the detail of the Bill some questions arise with which I hope she will deal in her response to the debate.  In drawing up her proposals did she consult sporting organisations here and, if so, what was the outcome?  The Minister in his contribution paid tribute to the efforts of those involved in organising events in the past and I have no reason to believe those who are in charge of those organisations are less responsible and committed than those who have gone before them.  It is undeniable that the increased competition for sports programming represents an opportunity for and a threat to sporting organisations.  While it is our job to legislate, those involved in organising sports events have a valuable contribution to make and we should seek and listen to their views.</P>
      <P>This Bill takes its lead from the 1996 UK broadcasting Act.  As the Minister said, this is complex legislation that deals with many different issues.  It is designed for a broadcasting environment that is very much different from ours.  For example, the British can apply their legislation to broadcasters who come within their jurisdiction. Thus, they can prevent BSkyB from acquiring exclusive rights to FIFA matches &mdash; that is World Cup finals, not qualifying matches.  Irish legislation cannot be applied to BSkyB with regard to British premiership soccer or the Ryder Cup or any event organised outside this jurisdiction.  The fight in which Steve Collins won his world championship was organised to some extent by BSkyB. It is questionable whether it would have taken place without the presence of that company or some other subscription television service. Although he fought in Ireland it is most unlikely it would have taken place in this country if BkyB did not have the exclusive coverage rights. Premiership soccer is not an Irish event, Steve Collins's fight was not arranged by an Irish organiser and the Ryder Cup in golf is an international event.  None of those would be covered by the terms of Deputy de Valera's Bill, and for that reason it needs to be examined in detail in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also interesting to consider the environment in which sporting bodies in the United Kingdom are negotiating broadcasting rights.  The code of practice drawn up by the independent television commission under the terms of the 1996 Act acknowledges a voluntary code on broadcasting rights drawn up by a number of major sporting bodies in the UK under a central body known as the Central Council for Physical Recreation.  The type of sporting body that has agreed to apply the voluntary code includes the <Col N="603" /> FA, the British Athletics Federation, the Lawn Tennis Federation, the Premier League and other bodies which govern golf, rugby, racing and cricket.  Those bodies have come together and recognise in a voluntary code that there is a balance to be struck between maximising the benefits from the sale of broadcasting rights and procuring the widest possible coverage of their events in the interests of sports development and the wider sporting public.  The code recognises the desirability of providing for the availability of coverage on both channels which are received free of charge and at the same time on subscription channels.  The sports bodies acknowledge, as we all do, that the increased broadcasting capacity coming on stream in the near future can provide increased opportunities to generate income for the sporting bodies and that some percentage of the income thus generated should be used for the development of their individual sports.  I draw attention to the code simply to illustrate that sports bodies in Ireland may have something of value to say on this topic and that we should listen to them.  A forum for such consultation should be set up.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that legislation is not necessary, but we should not rely entirely on implementing legislative provisions without listening to those who organise the events.  I am sure there are many committed fans of particular sports, such as hurling or Gaelic football, who would welcome the opportunity to follow most of the games at club or league level throughout the season and who would be prepared to pay a modest price to receive the service.  Using current analogue broadcasting technology, it is simply not possible to provide this service.  However, with the advent of digital technology it may well be technically possible for an Irish broadcaster to provide such a service for committed sports fans without any loss to the more general viewer whose interests tend to be confined to the major events which have a broader appeal.  We should not be afraid of the new technologies and try to restrict their uses.  It is far better to try to legislate comprehensively for the new broadcasting era that is upon us, as the Government proposes to do with its new legislative proposals recently published. However, we must be seen to be as inclusive of those who have a legitimate stake in these matters, including sports bodies, participants, viewers and listeners alike.</P>

      <P>The Government's decision not to oppose this Private Members' Bill must be welcomed.  We were all worried that we were quickly nearing a position where we would have to pay per event to tune into sporting and cultural events and wondered what we could do about it. It is in that context Deputy de Valera's Bill must be welcomed.  It does not have all the answers, but at least it is an attempt to address this matter and to start the process of consultation and the putting together of a framework within which we <Col N="604" /> will be able to protect the broadcasting of certain national events for which people should not have to pay in excess.  This decision is another indication of the co-operative attitude adopted by the Government on legislation.  Sometimes that co-operation is not mirrored very positively by the Opposition benches.  I have been a Member of this House for the past two and a half years and I believe things should be done a different way. If I have the honour of being elected to this House for another few years I may also fall into the rut, but I believe our business should be organised through co-operation on legislation.</P>
      <P>Since television was introduced into Ireland in the 1960s it has become a universally accepted service.  There are few households without at least one television and we are increasingly relying on it not only for entertainment but for information about politics, social and cultural events.  I am not certain this is a good development but it is a fact. In the past much of that information was provided by broadcasters operating in the broad public service tradition.  I include the UK channels to which many Irish households now have access. With the advent of cable and satellite television the range of stations available to viewers at a price has increased dramatically.  I still find it hard to believe that I can flick through channels in Cork city and tune into a Spanish or French channel. For a period viewers in Cork city were able to tune into a soft porn channel, but objections soon put paid to that, and that was only right as television is very easily accessed by children. However, despite the number of channels now available there has not been a corresponding increase in the choice available to viewers.</P>
      <P>Many of the new channels offer an interchangeable mishmash of third rate programmes with a heavy reliance of reruns of old shows sandwiched between American talk shows of the true confession type.  It is said that whatever happens in England will happen here five years later and what happens in America will happen here ten years later.  Television, easy access to information technology and being exposed to other cultures ensure those timeframes will continue to lessen, but I am not certain that is good.  I hope when it comes to public or private broadcasting we will never see the day when ten or 12 people from Dublin, Cork, Galway or other cities or towns will appear on shows to tell us about the traumatic events in their lives, whether they married a man who turned out to be a woman or married a woman who turned out to be a man, as happens on the type of American chat shows that now seem to be all the rage.  It is incredible that people expose their lives in that way and that such programmes should be broadcast.  They are neither entertaining nor educational and television should be one or the other.  I do not know how one would stop it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been reports that European viewers may soon have access to 200 or more channels, many of which will be devoted to niche markets such as sports, hobbies or film.  There is also <Col N="605" /> an increase in the number of shopping channels. I have a great deal of empathy with people who shop from home using television and a remote control because I do not like shopping.  Shopping channels have created a market where none existed and I am sure people are spending money which they do not have and there is no visible way of checking it.</P>
    <P>Shopping channels, being able to flick through 200 channels, Spanish channels, French channels and other niche channels do not fit into the tradition of public service broadcasting exemplified by RTE or the terrestrial UK channels, whether public or private.  It is because of these developments I agree with the Minister Deputy Higgins that the coverage of sporting and cultural events needs to be addressed in the context of a wider package on the development of broadcasting. However, I fully agree with the aims of Deputy de Valera's Bill and I am delighted the Government has decided not to oppose it.</P>
    <P>It is becoming increasingly difficult for people to attend many sporting or cultural events.  The increased practice of corporate block-booking has reduced the number of seats available to the general public while the cost of travel can be prohibitive. It has now become commonplace for people to watch events ranging from entertainment to major sporting events in the comfort of their living rooms with their families and friends.  Television has provided the vast majority of people with easy though limited access to national sporting events and to international events, such as the Oscars.  Where the televising of major sporting events is awarded to pay per view satellite channels which charge a special fee to subscribers, it has threatened to reduce this limited access to world events.</P>
    <P>Nobody in Ireland or, anywhere else in Europe would want the all-Ireland finals to be seen only on Sky Sports or a designated pub channel.  I welcome the fact that this Bill allows the Minister to designate sporting or other events which must be available for general reception.  It would be bad in the case of the all-Ireland, but could anybody envisage having the Munster championship available only on a pay per view channel?  That is the one thing which would make the people of Munster rise up in revolt whatever about bad Government or high taxes.</P>
    <P>This is only one part of the solution.  Many of the events which people had traditionally been able to view are not national but international events.  The World Cup, the Olympics, Wimbledon, the Eurovision Song Contest are examples of events over which we do not have national control and, as matters stand, there is nothing to stop the International Olympic Committee concluding a contract with, for example, NBC Superchannel for live broadcasts leaving national broadcasters with nothing more than the crumbs of relays.  This is an issue which can only be addressed at an international level in consultation with the various bodies organising such events. Deputy de Valera's Bill is not the whole solution <Col N="606" /> but it is an attempt to address an issue which is likely to become more and more urgent and I wish her success with it.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I applaud the decision of the Government not to oppose this Bill.  This continues a welcome trend established be this Government of responding positively to Opposition suggestions and Bills.  However, this has often proven easy because much Private Members' time of late has been used by the Opposition to try to put a stamp on Government proposals already announced and at an advanced stage of preparation.  I suppose the Opposition is now resigned to using the old adage &ldquo;if you can't beat 'em, join 'em&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>They should not panic unduly as there is still everything to play for.  Both football and hurling all-Ireland finals are cultural events, sporting events in the broadest sense.  It would be a tragedy if these games and other major sporting occasions were no longer available to the public at large.</P>
      <P>In Teilifís na Gaeilge, there is now a unique opportunity for the proponents of the minority sports in Ireland to have their games shown live on that station.</P>
      <P>I often wonder at the rationale behind the people involved in sporting organisation who have sold the broadcasting rights to their sports to the satellite channels.  By doing so, they immediately deprive themselves of an audience the importance of which should never be underestimated. For example, were it not for &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Big Match&rdquo;, English soccer would never have attained the level of popularity it enjoys today.  It is this exposure which down through the years has fed the ambition and enthusiasm of a new generation of players of football, basketball, etc.  It is most important to make these sports available on television.</P>
      <P>The Minister correctly pointed out yesterday evening that many large sporting events transcend sport.  All-Ireland finals, for example, have been played for well over a century.  The Epsom Derby, one of the protected events under the latest British legislation, was first run in the 1700s.  The list is endless.  It is not by accident that the latest cowardly act of the Provisional IRA was the disruption of the Grand National.  If the Grand National was merely a horse race, would the Provisional IRA have taken such action?  Of course not.  It did what it did because by disrupting this race it could strike a blow against the British people so it was critical that the race was finally held.  I congratulate all those involved in running the Grand National on Monday afternoon last although I had not backed any winners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment Deputy de Valera on her Bill. She is correct in saying that events such as the Grand National, the All-Ireland final and so on <Col N="607" /> should continue to be regarded as public events and afforded widest possible exposure and coverage. Nonetheless I am sure she realises, as we all do, there are two competing rights, that of the public to take part in such activities and that of any sporting organisation to secure a fair price for its product.  It would be wrong to suggest that sporting organisation act solely out of greed. Many rely on television deals to funds their organisation and their training and coaching programmes which produce the stars of the next generation, a legitimate concern and aspiration.</P>
    <P>Some sporting organisations have sought to strike a reasonable balance.  I understand the International Olympic Committee sold broadcasting rights for last year's and future Olympic Games to the European Broadcasting Union, the umbrella agency for public television in Europe. of which we are a member, thus guaranteeing that the Olympic Games would continue to be the greatest sporting event worldwide.  I should like to think other organisations would follow suit.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed to have this Bill debated in Committee.  It has been suggested that Irish sporting organisations should be allowed attend to air their views on what is a crucial issue for many of them, a course of action I support so long as none seeks to sell rights to any event while negotiations are in train.</P>
    <P>We must also address the international dimensions of this debate since many events now regarded by the general public as central to its television enjoyment of sporting activities are internationally-orientated, of which the FIFA World Cup is probably the best example.  If FIFA took a unilateral decision to sell television rights to that event to one or more satellite providers it would be difficult to envisage how any Irish Government could influence such a decision. Similarly, many sporting events considered sacred by our people are staged in England.</P>
    <P>While there is widespread scepticism about pay per view channels, they present viewers with the possibility of increased choice.  For example, a Leeds United fan may soon be able to watch its games at home or away and I understand the major beneficiaries may not be Rupert Murdoch but the club itself.  If such a team was able to avail itself of new technologies to provide such a service to its supporters, then a pay per view system may not be all that bad.  We can hope that trend will develop to the benefit of sporting activities here also.  Nonetheless we must learn from mistakes which were greed driven and engage in a comprehensive debate on the issue overall.  Hopefully the introduction of this Bill and the Government's response thereto will ensure that such debate will take place.  Deputy de Valera and the Minister are to be congratulated.  No doubt the Committee Stage debate will attract greater public attention.</P>
    <P>The Irish cherish their sporting stars and activities. If the introduction of this Bill results in the necessary debate taking place here and abroad, <Col N="608" /> ensuring that major sporting and other cultural events are made accessible to our people for the payment of the ordinary television licence fee, it will be good.</P>

      <P>In view of the mounting concern about this sector this Bill is timely.  We on this side of the House considered the time opportune for decisive action, which is why this Bill was drafted, bearing in mind especially the many impending changes and technological advances so germane to the sector overall.  Its introduction forced the Minister to accept its necessity and urgency.  We look forward to any amendments he may propose on Committee Stage.  There is no more rapidly developing technological sector than that of broadcasting.</P>
      <P>In this part of the world, where satellite television has only become available in recent years, there has been some complanecy.  Since its inception it has become obvious that the overall objective of Sky satellite television is to focus on major sporting events.  No doubt a certain number of sporting activities can and will be carried on satellite television.  This development cannot be stymied.  Soccer fans will readily appreciate the merits of upgrading the United Kingdom premier league stadia and amenities for spectators attending matches.  Television coverage of such events has been of tremendous financial benefit to the sport in general.</P>
      <P>There is real concern that events such as the All-Ireland final, FA Cup, Grand National, rugby internationals, etc. will not be afforded sufficient television coverage.</P>
      <P>Initially it had been assumed that satellite television would work its way through the cable network but, with ever advancing technology, digital compression of channels and the like, the vast number of channels now being offered place tremendous pressure on the system in general.</P>
      <P>I visited RTE some six months ago when I was briefed comprehensively by that organisation's technical personnel.  It was staggering to see what a little black box was capable of transmitting through one's television set, how it will be controlled, who will control it and how it will be made available or restricted.</P>
      <P>This Bill aims to address that matter and, as Deputy de Valera said last evening, ensures that national broadcasting organisations do not end up with a &ldquo;cheque book&rdquo; option but guarantees that major national and international sporting events are not denied to licence-paying viewers. There is a fine demarcation line which the enactment of this Bill will ensure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the House is supporting this Bill is to be welcomed.  While the Minister has produced <Col N="609" /> his &ldquo;Clear Focus&rdquo; document, he has not appeared to follow it up with the requisite detail or urgency in bringing forward his proposals in respect of which he mentioned a timescale of the order of six months.  While this matter is left unaddressed there is a possibility that some legal and contractual arrangements could be entered into which could be difficult to overturn.  There is a real urgency to ensure this Bill is put on the Statute Book.  There is no doubt Sky and various other organisations can have access from mainland Europe, based on the number of channels that may become available.  It could be difficult to make legislation apply retrospectively without running into a web of legal complications.</P>
    <P>As outlined by Deputy de Valera we are following the proposed amendment of the EU Directive.  Other countries have felt the necessity to address this matter and have done so with competence and urgency.  We are trying to protect those national sporting occasions that should be available on the national channel and also on other channels which may have some access but not on a pay-per-view basis.</P>
    <P>The area of public service broadcasting needs Government protection.  The potential of satellite television, as referred to by Deputy Lynch, the US experience, the use by Sky of programmes from the US and the growth of the shopping channel, subject to quality, is desirable and progressive and should not be controlled other than by the level of acceptance by the population.  It is obvious that if Sky TV wants to promote the use of its channel here it will sign up with a sporting organisation and get exclusivity.  Having achieved that it would then have the power to introduce the pay-per-view concept.  That would be most undesirable and the sooner this legislation is put on the Statue Book the sooner we ensure that does not arise.</P>
    <P>The Bill is timely and needs to be dealt with swiftly by the House.  If the Minister can improve or strength the Bill on Committee Stage we look forward to hearing what he has to say.  His co-operation in accepting the Bill will be reciprocated. If improvements can be made to the Bill with the support of the expertise available to the Minister they will be welcome.</P>
    <P>For many years radio was one of the great methods of communication.  The hallmark of the national broadcasting service has been the concept of Government financial support, setting up and developing what RTE is today.  It has been released into a number of commercial areas to grow its business. Given the impending threat and the potential of advancing technology it is necessary to put this Bill on the Statute Book.  I support the Bill and welcome the Minister's commitment to it.  It deals with the Television without Frontiers Directive and the European concept of what is necessary to ensure there are some restrictions in the availability of television channels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>With the agreement of the House, I wish to share the balance of the time with Deputy Brennan.  I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Síle de Valera, our party spokesman on arts, culture and the Gaeltacht, on her initiative in bringing forward this Bill and castigating the Minister for his failure to move on this legislation.  There is three in a row for us.  Tonight we are talking about sporting occasions.  Three Private Members' Bills have been accepted by the Government and a Private Members' motion is being accepted in the Seanad today.  This is not a Government.  At this stage it is merely trying to hang on to whatever projected date it has in mind for an election.  It will accept anything, bow to anybody, bend in the face of any breeze blowing from outside just to get to its target date.  This is not governing the country.  The country needs a Government and the sooner this lot face the inevitable judgment of the people the better.  It is not only the Government, it is its backbenchers.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party Deputy in my constituency, Deputy Ryan, had not much to say but agreed with the Bill and congratulated the Minister on accepting it.  That was gracious of him.  Did he ever think his role would be to ensure the Minister and the Government bring forward legislation which is its duty rather than leave the governing of the country and the initiation of legislation to this side of the House?  It is a difficult concept for Democratic Left, Labour and Fine Gael to come to terms with but it is the Government's job to bring forward legislation and it has failed miserably.</P>
      <P>I am pleased Members intend to support the Bill.  I call on all those who have not yet declared their intention to support it.  The objective of the Bill is as simple as it is important.  It aims to protect access by the public to the televising in the State of events which are deemed to be of national and cultural importance or of value to the country's heritage.  The Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill succeeds where the Minister has failed, as in so many areas.  It succeeds in coherently addressing the problems issuing from the growth of subscription and pay-per-view television, problems which have been consistently ignored and neglected by this holder of office. The Bill succeeds without coming into conflict with European competition law.  That is a vital factor and one that deserves credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to introduce broadcasting restrictions to ensure certain sporting and cultural events will be available to all without additional charge or cost other than those which relate to the regulation of licences made under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts.  The Bill proposes to introduce anti-siphoning legislation which would prohibit the purchasing of exclusive broadcasting rights of sporting events by any single broadcaster and thus remove the profits accruing from pay-per-view and subscription television.  While pay-per-view television is not prohibited the Bill effectively removes the public incentive to pay <Col N="611" /> additional television subscription to watch events freely available on other channels.</P>
    <P>The benefits which would issue from such legislation cannot be underestimated.  This legislation would ensure RTE and other smaller television broadcasting companies are not forced out of the market by giants such as BSkyB broadcasting.  It would guarantee the free availability of access to the wealth of cultural and sporting events scheduled for 1998, such as the All-Ireland series, rugby and soccer internationals, the World Equestrian Games, the Tour de France and the Tall Ships Race, to name but a few.</P>
    <P>The Bill fills the void left by the inactivity of this vocal Minister.  He has unsuccessfully attempted to camouflage that inactivity through the publication of his pamphlet Clear Focus. Despite promises made as long as November 1995, the Minister failed to introduce legislation which deals specifically with this issue.  His broadcasting Bill remains six to nine months down the line at best.  This Minister has a record in respect of these Bills.  I recall introducing a broadcasting Bill and he had such an urge to go to the restaurant for a cup of coffee that he missed the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>The waiting period is over and this Bill must be supported.  It is fully compatible with the EU Commission's Television without Frontiers Directive and European competition law. Although the Bill is prudently modelled on legislation with a proven track record, it is also innovative in its proposal to invite submissions from the public on which events should be designated. Sporting events are as much a part of our cultural heritage as the contents of our museums and galleries and they must be equally cherished.  Before I leave the House to watch Manchester United win this evening, I call on every Member who values Ireland's heritage to support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I will share that time with Deputy Quill.  I congratulate Deputy de Valera on placing a Bill on the stocks which is no mean feat.  Our spokesperson's achievement is a great matter of honour and satisfaction to the party.  I accept the Government's gracious decision not to oppose the Bill.  However, as Deputy Burke stated, it is the Government's responsibility to introduce such legislation in the first instance.  In the absence of the necessary action from the Government in that regard, my party has taken the lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record should show that Deputy de Valera has achieved a historic landmark in introducing this Bill.  I would not like this legislation to be <Col N="612" /> viewed as a minor technical measure for the arrangment of television programme timings. The Bill is deeply fundamental to the kind of society and country Ireland represents.  Without this legislation, American style television will be encouraged, RTE will be discouraged and media moguls will be prompted to use their cheque books to capture our minds with their kind of television is the most important, dramatic and potent influence on society.  As a result, Deputy de Valera's Bill strikes a blow by bluntly stating that we will no longer accept the picture projected on our screens at the whim of the media moguls and we intend to protect our culture and citizens in future.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a landmark and represents flagship legislation.  I sincerely believe that it will be seen in the coming years as fundamental defence of the kind of society we are attempting to develop. When Ireland joined the European Union there was much debate about culture and its protection. It became increasingly obvious that, within the Union, we needed to take steps to protect our culture.  With the advent of satellite television it is clear that the programmes and events beamed into Ireland are being deliberately broadcast in a certain fashion by those using the cheque book approach.</P>
    <P>In that context, it is important that RTE is given much more support than it receives at present.  For a licence fee of approximately £70, or a little in excess of £1 per week, RTE provides five to six different broadcasting services.  That represents remarkable value for money and, if compared to the fees people pay for Sky Television, Sky Sports and cable television, it would result in two to three times that value.  It is important that, when passing the Bill, the House reflects on the need to protect and develop RTE. I did not always hold that view.  There was a time when I believe RTE would benefit from competition. However, I never envisaged the open floodgate of competition it currently faces from across the globe.  It must be remembered that the national television station will also face competition from 30 to 40 channels broadcasting <i>via</i> digital television systems.</P>
    <P>This Bill is fundamental and it seeks to reassert our control on the nation's airwaves.  To that extent, it is a flagship.  People criticise RTE from time to time and as Minister for Communications I sought to engender competition with the station. However, I did not envisage the type of global competition which has now emerged.  With that intense competition, the only way we will be able to protect modern Irish culture is to ensure that RTE remains strong, is not obliged to follow the commercial route to any great extent and does for Ireland what the BBC &mdash; which is a bulwark against tabloid television and the trivialities that beset American and privately owned channels &mdash; is able to do for the UK.</P>
    <P>This Bill is more important than most people imagine and that will be seen to be the case in <Col N="613" /> the future.  This House and the nation must continue to support RTE so that it forms a bulwark against the tabloidisation occurring on a world scale.</P>

      <P>I warmly congratulate Deputy de Valera for introducing the Bill, initiating the debate and giving the Government no option other than to support the legislation.  That is a magnificent achievement on her part.  The issue she has confronted in the Bill is complex.  Nonetheless, the Deputy had the courage, insight and foresight to tackle it and realise that any further effort to place it on the long finger would put much of what is important in Irish life in serious jeopardy.  It gives me great pleasure to offer my party's support to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am deeply disappointed that, at the conclusion of the lifetime of this Dáil, proper, modern broadcasting legislation will not be on the Statute Book.  When the Green Paper was published, the clear impression was given that there would be widespread public debate on the future of public service broadcasting, and that of broadcasting in general, which would lead, in turn, to the publication of a White Paper to further enhance the quality of the debate.  Armed with that White Paper the Minister would publish legislation and have it debated in the House to put in place modern broadcasting legislation which would give our existing channels the protection they need for the era in which we live. That has not happened.  The Minister's abdication of his duty to protect the quality and calibre of our broadcasting service deserves severe criticism.</P>
      <P>We live in a time when &ldquo;tabloidism&rdquo; is coming at us via digital television from all sides like a rain storm in a forest.  There is not a lot we can do to stop it but we ought to put in place legislation to protect, preserve and promote what is worthwhile so that discerning viewers can make decisions on what is worth watching.  That has not happened and it disappoints me.  As matters stand it may be Deputy de Valera who will bring forward the comprehensive broadcasting legislation and that may be for the good, provided too much time is not allowed to elapse.  A good deal of the Minister's recent proposals would not be acceptable to my party.  It may well be better to start all over again to prepare legislation at variance with the scheme of the Minister's Bill.</P>
      <P>In the long term it may turn out to our advantage but time is not on our side.  It is worrying that we have left ourselves so vulnerable in the face of the inevitable onslaught from digital television. It is said that nature abhors a vaccum.  A vacuum exists in this matter and Deputy de Valera's proposals close off a specific and important section of the vacuum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we reach the twilight of this Dáil I will cast my mind back to the Bill which I introduced to give proper protection in law to the built environment. It was judged to be a very good Bill and I am sorry that the Minister for Arts, Culture and <Col N="614" /> the Gaeltacht did not display the same generosity towards my Bill as towards this one.  We have the prospect of putting legislation on the Statute Book and I hope this legislation is proceeded with urgently.  It will be visited again in a broader context but we should identify these elements of the broadcasting service which are in particular danger in the manner in which Deputy de Valera has done and give them the protection needed. This generation and future generations will be grateful if this Bill is passed.  This Bill affords protection to a fundamental part of our culture, identity and recreational entertainment, in short part of what we are.  It should not be endangered lightly; we should not stand idly by and allow it to go by default.  That default is the failure to put in place proper legislation.</P>

      <P>As the Minister of State with responsibility for sport I have a special interest in this issue.  If clichés could solve this complex problem it would have been solved long ago.  We must balance the rights of the public to have access to major sporting events which are dear to us and the rights of sporting organisations to market their sports in whatever way they choose.  I welcome Deputy de Valera's Bill to address this issue.  It must be addressed in a national and pan European fashion.  We must work with our European partners to deal with the issues involved.</P>
      <P>With the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht I welcome this discussion and the particular attention being paid to the question of the broadcasting and availability of sports events.  It is important that certain sports events remain available to the general public free of charge. Many of our major sports events have a significance beyond the intrinsic value of the events themselves.  They are firmly rooted in the cultural and social traditions of our country and people. It is proper that the rights of the citizen to have open access to special events should be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already many major sports competitions in neighbouring countries are available only to those people who have purchased the necessary receiving equipment or who pay to view the competitions in clubs or bars.  Concern has been expressed on behalf of the person who cannot afford to buy the equipment or the elderly or infirm who may not be able to travel to a club in order to enjoy sport on television.  While there has been a major increase in the level and quality of sport on television and the potential to expand dramatically in the future with the advent of digital television and pay-per-view, the paradox is that less choice may be available to the ordinary viewer and the majority of the population.  On the other hand, the rights of the sports organisations <Col N="615" /> must also to be borne in mind in the context of this complex and rapidly changing environment.</P>
    <P>Given the complexity involved, and with the agreement of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment &mdash; this issue involves considerations of free and open competition as well as broadcasting rights &mdash; I established an interdepartmental committee to explore and monitor developments in this area.  The committee has been put in place to ensure that there is ongoing co-ordination between the three Departments in keeping up to date on developments here and abroad.  The committee is also helping to ensure that the needs of sports organisations and sports fans are kept to the forefront.  I thank the other Ministers for their willing assistance in this regard.</P>
    <P>During the Irish Presidency of the European Union last year I formally placed the question of television and sport on our agenda and called for a pan European approach on the part of governments and sports federations throughout the EU.  I also addressed the issue at the European Sports Forum in Brussels during our Presidency and I am pleased that our Troika partner, the Netherlands, has carried our agenda forward for attention during its Presidency of the EU.  The issue will be discussed at a meeting of EU sports directors in Amsterdam next week.  In this context it is vital that across the EU, governments, sports authorities and, most importantly, the sports federations themselves act in a co-ordinated way in the interest of sport and sports fans.  Sports federations and all involved in sport need to be ready with clear policies and, working together, be better prepared to meet the demands and challenges coming from the multinational media giants. They should position themselves to take more control and not just react in a haphazard way to the agenda set by the private media interests. Last year one global organisation reacted in a disjointed way to the challenges posed by the multinational media giants.</P>
    <P>I again commend the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for the leading role he has played with his fellow Ministers at EU level.  At home he has ensured that the special place of certain major sporting events as essential cultural occasions in Irish life is addressed.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that in this most difficult and complex area we achieve a fair and reasonable balance between the rights of citizens and the legitimate needs of sports organisations.  With understanding and co-operation, this balance can be achieved.  We have an opportunity to ensure there is a full opportunity for all the interests involved to make their case in a spirit of openness and co-operation.</P>
    <P>Our sports organisations have made an enormous contribution to the enrichment and development of our society and communities during the years.  I am confident they will bring the same sympathetic and positive approach they <Col N="616" /> have brought to the sporting, cultural and social life of the country to the area of broadcasting rights and the availability of major sporting events to the millions of people who follow sport and have made a contribution to it during the years.</P>
    <P>I look forward to giving detailed consideration, in co-operation with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht who has published his own proposals, to the objectives outlined in this Bill. In doing so I intend to assist in ensuring a fair balance between the rights and needs of all concerned &mdash; the sports organisations and members of the public who follow sport with such dedication and commitment.  This is a pan-European challenge which has to be addressed at national and EU level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey) Minister of State at the Department of the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to debate the important issues raised by this Bill.  As the Minister and other speakers indicated, the Government will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage because it supports &mdash; and has always supported &mdash; its broad objectives.  As Deputy de Valera pointed out, many countries have taken steps to ensure important national sporting and other events are televised on services which provide them free to air to viewers.  It is important to remember that these countries have a broadcasting environment where a number of categories of broadcaster exist, including those which provide free to air broadcasts funded by licence fee and advertising revenue and private broadcasters established in these countries which provide services on a subscription and pay-per-view basis. They have also developed or are developing a legislative structure for this environment.  As I understand it, the laws in these countries are designed to regulate the activities of the different categories of broadcaster which come under the jurisdiction of the countries concerned.</P>
      <P>We have to bear in mind that the national broadcasting environment here is very different. We must, therefore, ensure any legislative measures enacted are comprehensive and suitable to our broadcasting environment.  The reality is that one television broadcaster, RTE, operates here at present.  Teilifís na Gaeilge will be established as a separate body and attempts are being made, which I hope will be successful, to establish an independent national television channel.  No operator based here offers subscription or pay-per-view services, although this may change in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transmissions of a number of UK broadcasters, including subscription and, on occasion, pay-per-view services, are widely available to viewers here.  As a national administration, we have no direct jurisdiction over the activities of these broadcasters.  While all broadcasters in Europe are subject to the provisions of the television without frontiers directive, one of its primary objectives is to ensure broadcasters, including <Col N="617" /> those who engage in transfrontier broadcasting, are subject only to the regulatory regime of the country where they are established. I would like Deputy de Valera to deal with this important point when she replies to the debate.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic about what we hope to achieve through legislation.  In addition to mentioning events such as the All-Ireland finals and rugby internationals, Deputy de Valera referred to events such as the Grand National, the Cheltenham Festival of Racing, English premier league soccer and Ryder Cup golf.  The reality is that such events are organised by bodies outside this jurisdiction and if they choose to sell exclusive rights to a broadcaster not established here, this Bill, if enacted, or any other purely national measure, can have no effect.  As we are all aware, premier league soccer in England is not protected in Britain under the 1996 Broadcasting Act.  It would, therefore, be futile to think in terms of trying to protect it through national measures for Irish audiences.  I do not know if Rupert Murdoch pays much attention to national legislation, even in Britain, but the reality is that he regards Irish audiences simply as audiences to be targeted as part of an English speaking audio-visual market.</P>
    <P>Apart from the likes of Mr. Murdoch, the digital revolution may bring about even more fundamental changes in the way sporting and other events are brought to our screens.  There have been reports that major British soccer clubs &mdash; I am not sure the term &ldquo;club&rdquo; is appropriate as many are now companies controlled by a group of investors whose sole aim is to make a profit &mdash; are considering the development of their own private television channels rather than selling coverage rights to a broadcaster.  The expertise which a professional broadcaster brings to a sports event, in terms of providing technical coverage and distribution of the signal to an audience, may no longer be required.  I have seen reports that one club, Leeds United, has concluded a separate deal for the distribution of its matches via the Internet.  In Holland, a contract between the Dutch Football Association and a broadcaster was undermined when the courts ruled that the home club &mdash; not the Football Association &mdash; held the television rights to games.  I hope the foregoing illustrations outline the complexities involved in drafting workable and constitutional legislation to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>Like other contributors to this debate, I believe measures should be taken to prevent the migration of important national events to subscription or pay-per-view services.  Pan-European measures which can be taken at EU level and which ensure substantial numbers of the population are not prevented from viewing international events in which there is a significant interest on free to air television services should and can be brought forward.  However, any measures enacted must be comprehensive and address all the issues concerned, including the different types of coverage rights which can be <Col N="618" /> offered, and be flexible enough to comprehend a completely different broadcasting environment and context.</P>
    <P>As with the broadcasting area, sport at all levels is becoming more competitive.  We are not that far away from the famous &ldquo;moral victories&rdquo; of the Irish soccer team when it drew support from a small hardy band of not easily disappointed supporters, so beloved of one of our more well known pundits.  The passion of the Irish rugby team was often regarded as the only necessary attribute for international competition. Followers of county teams which qualified to play in All-Ireland finals often came away with extravagant stories of the outrageous adventures of the players on the night before a winning performance in the final itself.  Nowadays, expectations are much higher.  Success at international level has bred the expectation of success and the highest level of performance at every level.  The demands in terms of commitment on participants, trainers and organisers from the most basic level to the top are ever increasing.  Athletes in every discipline are expected to achieve astonishing levels of fitness and skill.  With such demands and commitment comes the expectation of reward or, at the very least, compensation.  The organisation of training and coaching is also becoming more expensive.</P>
    <P>One has to accept that the prospect of using television revenues to fund the development of sport is not an unreasonable expectation for sports bodies.  It must be accepted that the digital revolution in broadcasting will bring with it opportunities for much more extended coverage of games and competitions at all levels.  These opportunities and the opportunity for sports bodies to use television rights revenues to develop their sprots and facilities cannot be denied them entirely.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we must be clear as to the exact type of event we want to protect.  Events such as the All Ireland Final, the exploits of the national soccer team at qualifying matches and at the European and World Cup Finals and the success of athletes at Olympic and other premier international events have been shared experiences because of their free availability on national television. We would be poorer as a nation if these events had not been available on television.  For many viewers the event transcends the sport.  For example, how many of those who stayed up until all hours to watch Michelle Smith's outstanding success in the Olympic Games ever attended or took part in a swimming competition and how many of those who watch the Irish soccer team in action have ever attended a League of Ireland match at any level?  We must ensure the measures which are enacted respect the public interest in a way that allows our sports men and women develop and enjoy a reasonable reward for their efforts.  The power to protect events must be directed at those events which are outstanding importance to us as a nation.  The Government supports the broad principle of the Bill and will <Col N="619" /> not oppose it on Second Stage.  I hope Deputy de Valera in her reply will address some of the points raised during the debate.</P>
    <P>During the EU Presidency the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht moved on this aspect of pan-European television coverage on a number of occasions and secured agreement from all member states on the free televising of some major sporting events.  He also attended special meetings of Ministers for Culture in Maastricht to discuss this issue.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister for moving quickly on all aspects of this issue and deplore the negative comments made by Deputies Burke and Brennan.  They constantly throw negative phrases across the floor of the House.  The generosity shown by the Government in accepting Private Members' Bills far exceeds the generosity shown by Fianna Fáil during its 16 years in office.  The Government has generously agreed to accept Deputy de Valera's Bill and Deputy Burke, a former Minister, should not make negative comments. The measures taken by him in office did nothing to enhance his reputation.  On the Order of Business today Deputies referred to deflector systems and MMDS, areas where Deputy Burke did not cover himself in glory.  He developed a monopoly in the broadcasting area and has nothing to crow about.  The only point on which I agree with him is that I would like to see Manchester United win.  I wish the Irish players on that team well and hope they excel themselves.</P>
    <P>I also wish Deputy de Valera's Bill well and hope she can give me a positive response to my queries.  We will work strenuously on Committee Stage to ensure the Bill can be put on a proper footing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate and, in particular, my colleagues on this side of the House who have supported the Bill since it was initiated.</P>
      <P>Having listened attentively to the two Ministers of State, the same questions must be asked.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, said he is very pleased with the performance of the Minister, Deputy Higgins, in the area of broadcasting.  Yet the Minister has admitted publicly that it would have been another six months before the Government would have introduced broadcasting legislation. The Minister said last night he had given consideration to proposals similar to those put forward by Fianna Fáil and he would encompass them in his broadcasting legislation.  However, all he has are heads of a Bill which has no legal standing and we will have to wait six months for his Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Carey and others refer to the generosity shown by the Government in accepting the Bill. The simple reason it is doing this is that it is devoid of ideas and the necessary commitment to introduce such legislation.  It is the business of the <Col N="620" /> Government, not the Opposition, to initiate legislation. However, Fianna Fáil is very pleased to do this work on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Allen, referred to the complexity of this issue.  However, the Government has used this as an excuse for inaction. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, for getting the three ministries together to discuss this complex issue but I would like to know how long we will have to wait before the deliberations are completed.  Given the importance of this issue, it must be dealt with forthwith.</P>
    <P>He also referred to competition law.  I outlined how we can get around this issue and how the Minister's initial proposals would have created problems.  The way we have approached the issue will ensure that we will get over any of the difficulties which might be posed by competition law.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, referred to the events which Fianna Fáil believes should be protected.  These events are not set out in the Bill and are merely examples of what we regard as important events from a cultural point of view. While responsibility for drawing up the list of events to be protected will rest with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht of the day, it may be decided after consultation with RTE, the Independent Radio and Television Commission and other bodies.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State that Rupert Murdoch regards the Irish audience as part of the audio-visual market because we speak English. This is the precise reason we must decide whether we want a balance or are prepared to allow profit-making without taking into account the cultural implications.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, would agree that when Clare wins the next All-Ireland we want to be in a position to watch the match on our televisions, if we cannot watch it in Croke Park.  If those types of matches could only be seen on pay-per-view TV, one can imagine the distress it would cause to many older people and others unable to afford either the tickets or the cost of travelling to Croke Park.  That would cause exclusion rather than inclusion which should be part of our social policy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's decision to accept my Bill to protect sporting and cultural events from satellite operators.  I welcome also the Minister's support for this Fianna Fáil initiative.  It was rather ironic to hear the Minister say in his contribution that this is a major issue confronting broadcasters, yet an Opposition party is bringing forward the necessary legislation.  This surely must be one for the history books.  Nevertheless, I am glad the Government has recognised the necessity for this Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition to the almost daily technological advances in broadcasting and telecommunications, represented most evidently by the digital television revolution, there continues to be a parallel development in the manner in which those who control broadcasting present their service and product to the television public.  Arguably, <Col N="621" /> the most significant recent development has been the concept of pay-per-view TV which this Bill addresses.  Such a development has major implications for RTE.  If RTE lost coverage of major sporting events, it would lose significant audience and earning potential.  It would also be seen to fail in its public service remit.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is of the view that the State has an obligation to ensure that the televising of certain events should, in the public interest, be available free of additional charge, irrespective of commercial interests.  This Bill achieves that objective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of priorities. We must either decide to allow the current situation continue, where profit wins the argument, or identify a list of cultural events that will be protected.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has reminded me of another point.  He stated earlier that this issue must be seen in a pan European way.  I agree with that.  It is precisely because of the approach that has been taken by the EU Commission on this issue that Fianna Fáil decided to introduce this legislation.  Like the legislation already introduced in Britain, France and Australia, we believe this measure will be effective.</P>
      <P>The central aim of the Bill is to protect sporting and cultural events from satellite television providers. The move of coverage of events of national and international significance from traditional public service television services to satellite delivered subscription and pay-per-view services is not in the public interest.  Organisers of events find themselves in a seller's market and this can result in public service broadcasters being outbid for the rights to cover events.</P>
      <P>Our aim is to ensure that the public interest in broadcasting continues to be served.  Ireland has been the exception in taking action on the protection of sporting events.  Many other countries have already addressed or are in the process of addressing the problem, namely Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Britain, Australia, Spain, Italy, Germany, Finland, the USA, Australia, and Denmark.  I do not understand why Ireland should be the exception.  Ireland must take its own lead and our Bill is designed to address the lack of activity so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil does not want millions of people to be disappointed when they cannot see a major event because they do not have the gadgetry or the resources.  What is proposed in this Bill is close to the hearts and minds of the Irish people who cherish sporting events, especially those like the Grand National, the Derby, Cheltenham, the All-Ireland hurling and football finals, the Tour de France, rugby and soccer internationals, major boxing matches and athletics finals.  The Eurovision Song Contest, especially the voting section, is keenly viewed by Irish people.  The public except to be able to see these events on terrestrial <Col N="622" /> television, without having to pay a dividend to Rupert Murdoch's companies.  We envisage that as many of these events as possible should be protected.</P>
    <P>In its approach, the Bill complements the recent attempts by the European Commission and its audio-visual affairs Commissioner to ensure, by way of proposed regulations and amendments to the television without frontiers directive, the free televising of major sporting events for the public of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Despite the additional financial cost to the viewer of subscription-based television, this Bill is not aimed at any one broadcaster but is universal in its application and is predicated on the cultural importance to the nation of certain designated events.  It deals specifically with the exercise of the televising rights of an event.</P>
    <P>We have proposed what is known as an anti-siphoning system which overcomes the competition difficulty.  Our key is universality.  The listed events are not reserved exclusively to any one type of broadcaster, but its <i>de facto</i> operation would mean that a pay-per-view system would have no commercial gain because the exclusivity would be taken out of the equation.</P>
    <P>Our reason for bringing forward the Bill is the inactivity of the Minister, from whom we have had nothing but aspiration.  Rather than giving more detail in his Clear Focus document, there is less than that contained in the Green Paper of 18 months ago.  Fianna Fáil believed the matter could wait no longer and that there was a need for urgency, so we took action.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that the Minister, Deputy Higgins, did not have the courage to bring forward this Bill.  The Minister's legislative track record is abysmal.  In his four years in office, he has graced this House with very few legislative measures, three in all if I recall correctly, two of which were planned before the Minister took office.  I have said on previous occasions that few Ministers were dealt such a good hand.  Even before he took up office and became a national cultural institution, and a national monument in his own right, Minister Higgins had the go-ahead for Teilifís na Gaeilge via the Fianna Fáil-Labour programme for Government.  He also had a ready-made plan for the film industry, a newly established heritage council and a strong legacy left by former Taoisigh such as Charles Haughey who gave tax breaks to artists, established Aosdána, founded the Museum of Modern Art, saved Temple Bar and created a thriving cultural quarter there, removed VAT from books and developed Government Buildings.  The bulk of the work was already done.  It is welcome, therefore, that the Minister has seen fit to accept a Bill he was unwilling to produce himself.  His acceptance that the matters the Bill addresses are of fundamental importance to the cultural pursuits of the citizens is only an acceptance of reality.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in stating that the Bill owes much to the UK Broadcasting Act, 1996.  I make no apologies for stating that, in the formulation <Col N="623" /> of the Bill, the position of many countries was examined in great detail.  The Minister's &ldquo;revelation&rdquo; that there is a different constitutional, legal and broadcasting environment pertaining in Britain is self-evident.  If this is the extent of the Government's criticism, the Minister must equally state that there is a different constitutional, legal and broadcasting environment in each member state of the European Union. Should this enlightened observation stop the proposed amendments and similar initiatives emanating from the Commission?  The answer is patently no.</P>
    <P>There are different constitutional, legal and broadcasting environments operating in France, Britain, Australia and Ireland.  The long title to the UK Broadcasting Act, 1996 illustrates the aims of that legislation of which provision in relation to the televising of sporting or other events of national interest was but one aspect. This Bill illustrates the importance of the issues dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Minister's criticism of sections 5 and 6 is misguided.  In the formulation of the Bill, I was aware of the technological advances being made in broadcasting and telecommunications.  If the Minister reads the Bill in its entirely, including the definition section, he will see that the provisions apply universally to any contract.  The fact that RTÉ is currently the only player in the field would not render invalid a contract between RTÉ and an organiser of an event to which section 3(1) applies.  Section 5(1) comes into operation if the Minister designates an event pursuant to section 3(1).  A designated event cannot be televised exclusively by one person if there are other persons who are entitled as a matter of law to acquire the rights to televise such events.  The penalties for breach of the provisions are severe, and we make no apology for that.  The terms of reference of this Bill and all its provisions illustrate the commitment of Fianna Fáil to this objective. The organisers of events will not see these provisions as a threat.  On the contrary, pursuant to section 3(2)(a) their most valued role is recognised, and there is a legal imperative on the Minister to consult with such persons before an event is designated.  I look forward to debating this Bill on Committee Stage in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened as Deputy Cullen trotted out the old mantra which we have come to expect from Fianna Fáil regarding the incredible levels of public spending in recent years.  Once again this evening we heard there has been a 20 per cent increase in public spending and only a 6 per cent rise in inflation.  The so-called economists on the far side constantly draw this comparison between the inflation rate on the one hand and the levels of public expenditure on the other. However, in recent years, the growth in our economy has been truly spectacular.  We have had cumulative growth rates of the order of 30-35 per cent which is unparalleled in Irish history.  Is it not fair that a significant portion of that 30-35 per cent should be spent on our people, to reduce hospital waiting lists, to provide extra facilities for people with learning disability, and on education? Nobody in this Government will ever apologise for trying to do something about the terrible school buildings that served to accommodate primary and second level pupils over many years and about which Fianna Fáil Governments did nothing.  We have increased public expenditure, particularly in health and education, and we do not apologise for it.  Why should we?  We have taken a relatively small portion out of the massive growth in the economy and applied it to useful developments for our people.  Surely that is what a Government is for.</P>
      <P>Deputies Cullen, McCreevy and others are, in Deputy Rabbitte's famous phrase, &ldquo;the PD cuckoos in the Fianna Fáil nest.&rdquo;  They are trying to create a situation whereby a &ldquo;slash and burn&rdquo; Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government will return us, as my party leader, Deputy Spring, said the other day, &ldquo;to the misery years of 1989-92&rdquo; when the social services were decimated by this harsh, conservative, relentless cost-cutting Government which left so many people &mdash; among them constituents and friends of mine &mdash; waiting for heart by-pass operations.  Terrible damage was done during those years to our social infrastructure. There is no way we can allow our country to be returned to that, particularly after the wonderful progress we have made in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, on introducing his third Finance Bill.  It is an historic development for the Labour Party and the left wing of Irish politics that at the helm of our financial affairs is a man steeped in the history and traditions of the Labour movement. Given his outstanding record he must be the best Finance Minister since the foundation of our State.  It has to be hoped that he will be asked by the people to continue in this rainbow coalition after the forthcoming election, whether it happens sooner or later this year.  Our overall growth rates are incredibly impressive.  We have just passed out the United Kingdom in terms of income <i>per capita</i>, and our economists tell us that <Col N="625" /> over the next four or five years, if we sustain this development, and I believe we will, we will approach German levels of GDP <i>per capita.</i></P>
    <P>There will be difficulties in the coming years in regard to the timetable for economic and monetary union.  Members on the Opposition benches lamented how little we have done to prepare for it.  However, Deputies get endless invitations to seminars organised by IBEC, the banks, ISME and other groups in the business area who are providing information in an effort to get people as ready as possible by 1 January in two years' time when the locking procedure will start to come into play.  The Minister has led an important and general information drive throughout Irish business and the workforce to get us ready for this important development.  It may well suit us best if, despite recent developments in the election campaign and despite what commentators say, a new Labour government does lead Britain into economic and monetary union beside us.  It certainly would make things easier for our exporters, particularly those involved in the food area, some of whom I know will be concerned about the possibility of a deviation between our currency and the British currency.</P>
    <P>In the early sections of this Bill the Minister has translated into effect a very responsible package of tax cutting measures.  He has attempted in a very prudent way to redistribute, by way of taxation measures, the benefits of our economic growth and development to the broadest possible section of our people, particularly the lowest paid.  Most people in this House would commend him for that and support him.  The reduction in the standard rate of tax to 26 per cent is an important development as is the raising of exemption limits to £8,000 per annum for a married couple.  At one stage in its history my party implemented a 20 per cent basic rate of income tax. As our growth continues we could look at keener rates of personal taxation.  That is something we must keep in mind as time moves on.  However, we cannot do it at the expense of devastating the social infrastructure. The Labour Party will never support such an approach.  I commend the Minister for his moves on personal taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern referred earlier to an informal all-party committee which meets to deal with the problems of our senior citizens and which I had the honour to chair for a number of years.  This committee, with the trade union retired workers' group, put forward a major programme of tax reform particularly for our senior citizens.  I commend the Minister for listening to Mr. Mattie Merrigan and his friends on that committee, as he has done over the past three years. The doubling of the age allowance, which was static for many years under Fianna Fáil Governments, is a testament to his concern.  I also welcome the moves to ease the taxation provisions in unemployment and disability benefit.</P>
    <P>It is important that many of the measures introduced during the ill-fated 1989-92 Government, <Col N="626" /> encapsulated in Deputy McCreevy famous dirty dozen cutbacks, are unravelled.  I am heartened that in this Bill we have taken another step forward in doing so.  This has also happened with the Social Welfare Bill where Deputy De Rossa introduced a sickness allowance.  It is one of the most important reforms of the past four and a half years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the moves by the Minister for Finance to assist second chance education at third level.  In section 6 he introduces tax reliefs to assist people who wish to continue on to third level.  As one who took advantage of second chance education through distance learning, I am heartened by this attempt to respond to older people who did not have a chance to complete second level education.  I urge the Minister in subsequent budgets, over which I am sure he will preside, to develop this measure and assist mature students in terms of tax relief.  It will give them encouragement and support in their studies.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach is responsible and prudent when contrasted with the erratic, greedy, crazy and ludicrous taxation proposals of the Progressive Democrats Party, especially in recent weeks.  Not alone does its figures not add up, but it puts forward proposals to levy a new series of taxes.  I was proud as leader of the Labour group on Dublin City Council over the years to staunchly and bitterly oppose the imposition of service charges.  I introduced, with the assistance of the Minister who was on the council at the time, the last six budgets and did not include service charges.  We did not agree with double taxation. We felt that working people who had paid for vital services should not be subjected to an additional charge.  In Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle in my constituency, there has been a massive struggle against these vicious service charges imposed by Fingal County Council.  The vast majority of people objected to the unfair nature of the tax.  The Progressive Democrats Party demands that the people of Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle pay service charges.  It is an appalling and disgraceful development and has to be condemned. That party is telling the people of Donaghmeade, Raheny, Kilbarrack, Airfield, Darndale-Belcamp, Priorswood, Bonnybrook and Coolock that they will also pay service charges.  It wants to burden the working people with another new massive tax.</P>
    <P>Over the past week, Fianna Fáil has been hiding behind the skirts of Deputy Harney.  It should tell us whether it also agrees with the reimposition of such charges and tell people in rural areas whether the assistance which the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, has proposed with the support of the Government will be whipped away from them and whether it will go along with the Progressive Democrats Party in an unholy alliance to impose these dreadful charges.  The campaign against service charges was led from urban areas, especially Dublin, but Deputy Howlin's recent moves tried to encompass the country's entire water supply.  The Progressive Democrats <Col N="627" /> Party is divided and it is remarkable how Deputy Molloy could possibly support the ludicrous and crazy proposals upon which Deputy Harney has embarked.</P>
    <P>The people of Dublin and their public representatives will never agree to the reimposition of service charges.  Recent debate has shown the real agenda of the Progressive Democrats, which is to privatise the water supply.  The best model they use for comparison is the United Kingdom where a series of water supply systems were privatised. Key management teams received huge increases in salary and additional moneys, very little of which was translated into reinvestment in the water system.  The result is that an average English family in the Midlands receives a bill for £1,000 per annum.  In the north of England, there are water tankers on the streets, a ludicrous denouement of a crazy policy.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party is at least consistent in its taxation policy.  It is clear increased development is part of its belief in low wage, non-unionised, socially divided societies with all public services privatised.  When one reads the notorious document &ldquo;Tax and Spend&rdquo; drafted by Deputy McDowell, there is a gap of £2,000 million to be made up and this will be done through the sale of all public sector companies and the public service itself.  It is no wonder the leader of the party eulogises about economies such as Hong Kong where people are low paid. This is the society Deputy Harney wants here, where workers would be on short-term contracts without trade union support.  People would be on low pay and liable to be dismissed or hired at a moment's notice.</P>
    <P>The document also refers to the New Zealand model where the Government introduced the type of reforms which Deputies McDowell and Harney wish to inflict on us.  The fundamental development there has been the translation of that society from a high income economy with almost total employment to a low salary, insecure, service economy with the highest proportion of millionaires <i>per capita</i> in the world but where the New Zealand churches say that one-third of children live in poverty.  While investment income rises steadily, wages have been cut by £2,000 billion since 1991 and its economy has the highest level of debt in the developed world. I hope that is not a road down which Fianna Fáil would want to lead this country in conjunction with the Progressive Democrats Party.  It is a crazy, socially divisive road and one which will end with tears.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's moves to assist business, particularly small and medium sized enterprises.  His cut in the levels of corporation tax in section 33 must be welcomed.  It is part of an ongoing programme which he intends to pursue. His continuance of the 10 per cent rate of manufacturing corporation tax is also to be commended. I welcome the reduction from 30 to 28 per cent in the levels of corporation tax for those <Col N="628" /> businesses with under £50,000 profit.  Three years ago the Minister, Deputy Quinn, set out to strengthen enterprise and to create work and social partnership.  The many interesting and innovative measures introduced in the Bill to assist business are typical of his policies.  In drafting section 12 he listened carefully to the comments of business interests and trade unions regarding companies that need to restructure and, as a result, exempted from income tax lump sum payments made to employees in return for extra efficiency.  In sections 19 and 21 he increased the thresholds for capital allowances.</P>
    <P>One of the most important innovations in the Bill is contained in sections 7, 8 27 and 51.  Those sections provide important reliefs for access to BES for DCM companies.  I hope the Stock Exchange supports this move because up to now many small companies were unable to get assistance from the Stock Exchange.  The Bill in an important development in that regard.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 to 18 contain many important provisions for the farming community.  The Minister listened carefully to the representations of farming interests so that he could make their enterprises more efficient.  I welcome in particular section 23 which extends the deadline for the urban renewal scheme to 31 July 1998, with a specific extension to the Custom House Docks area.  We are all aware of the great success of the IFSC in creating hi-tech jobs in the financial services area.  The provisions in section 24 will be an important development to the north bank of the Liffey which, until recently, was one of the most deprived areas in Europe.  It is now the nucleus of an important earning capacity for this economy and has contributed enormously to our success rate in recent years.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear Deputy Cullen refer to problems in the regions.  FÁS recently published a report on regional trends in the labour market in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a fundamental conclusion of which is that the east region lost out heavily in terms of job creation up to 1996.  While we did well in terms of services, we fared worse than other parts in terms of manufacturing.  The east region is made up of Counties Dublin, Meath, Wicklow and Kildare.  Up to 1996 the industrial base of that region increased by only 6.6 per cent compared to an average growth rate of 10.2 per cent across the country.  In some areas, such as the west and the midlands, the overall growth rate in manufacturing was approximately 16.8 per cent.  There has been a great deal of comment in the newspapers, particularly in the midlands and the west, about the number of jobs that have been created in the Dublin area.  They have been created mainly on the northside and in the Blanchardstown area, which were starved of jobs for many years.  The Government has tried to redress the imbalance in job creation.  I welcome the findings of this report.  While the east region is still not getting its just deserts, we are faring a little better in recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> I welcome the provisions in section 26 to assist the film industry.  Even though nearly every time one visits an historical building in this city &mdash; such as Dublin Castle last Friday &mdash; a film is being made, the major developments of the past few years have slowed somewhat.  The increases in the threshold for corporate investment from £7.5 million to £15 million and from £2 million to £3 million are welcome.  Because of the success of our writers and film makers in recent years, the House should continue to give a lead in this area and, in this regard, the Minister has obviously listened to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and film industry.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's move in section 57 in regard to excise charges and penalties for the sale of illegal cigarettes.  The large scale sale of illegal cigarettes on our streets is very annoying when we know the Exchequer is being defrauded. Also, as evident from recent Garda reports, some of the people pushing the sale of these cigarettes have close connections with serious drug related crimes.  I also welcome section 65 which empowers the Garda to seize those cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Some time ago <i>The Economist</i> reported that the majority of illegal cigarette imports to Europe was produced by American tobacco companies, who are experiencing difficulties selling their product in America.  Consequently, they are illegally pushing massive quantities of cigarettes into Europe.  Is it possible for the Government to discuss this matter with the American Government? As evident from recent news reports from America, the American public is concerned about the hazards of smoking and is making life difficult for cigarette manufacturers who have lied repeatedly to the public about the danger to health of cigarette smoking.  If the report in <i>The Economist</i> is correct, that problem is now being inflicted on us.  The American Government should take some responsibility for the sale of this tobacco here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision to reduce capital gains tax and the Minister's attempt in section 83 to clarify the position in regard to commercial child minding.  He has made a fair attempt to exempt registered childminders and créches from VAT and that is to be commended.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's attempt to close the loopholes which defrauded us of revenue in the past.  I welcome in particular the provisions in sections 9 and 11 regarding scholarship payments and C2 and C45 certificates, respectively. However, he should re-examine the position regarding C2 certificates because many building workers are still not satisfied with the position. Section 22 deals with the abuse of capital allowances for hotels.</P>
    <P>Section 101 finally abolishes the residential property tax, an unfair tax imposed primarily on Dublin householders.  Deputy McDowell spoke about increases in stamp duty.  Auctioneers have claimed that has had a dampening effect on the huge explosion in house prices but, unlike the residential property tax, it will not be ruthlessly <Col N="630" /> applied.  I am pleased the RPT has been abolished.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Finance Bill and hope it is the third of many Bills the Minister delivers to the House.  He has been a good steward and guardian of the nation's finances.  I look forward to that continuing in this rainbow Government and I hope we do not go down the Progressive Democrats road which would destroy our economy and turn us into another New Zealand case, which would be detrimental to the interests of Irish workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Finance Bill gives legislative effect to most of the provisions in January's budget.  That budget and its two predecessors are supposed to have made progress on the road to tax reform.  Any objective observer of the scene would say the progress which has been made is minimal.</P>
      <P>Consider the record of this Government on personal tax reform over the last three years.  It has brought in three budgets at a time when the economic and fiscal climate was never more favourable since the foundation of the State.  Low interest rates reduced the impact on the Exchequer of a steadily rising national debt.  Low inflation reduced the upward pressure on public spending.  Low increases in nominal pay rates, through national agreements, reduced upward pressure on the public pay bill.</P>
      <P>All this, in the context of sustained economic growth on a par with the tiger economies of South East Asia, served to create the most favourable climate for reforming our personal taxation system, but that is not the way things turned out.  In 1992 the present Tánaiste promised change, and very small change we got &mdash; just a penny off income tax in five years.</P>
      <P>Compare this with the record of the 1989-92 coalition in which the Progressive Democrats participated with Fianna Fáil.  Economic circumstances were by no means as favourable as they are now.  For one thing, our major trading partner, the UK, was in the throes of a severe recession.  Yet, remarkable progress was made on tax reform within a relatively short period.</P>
      <P>In just three budgets that Government cut the basic rate of income tax from 32 per cent to 27 per cent, cut the higher rate of income tax from 56 per cent to 48 per cent, and increased bands and allowances significantly.  Those tax cuts were strongly criticised at the time by the parties which are now on the opposite side of the House.  Yet, does anybody believe we would be creating jobs at our present rate if those cuts had not been introduced?  Does anybody believe we should turn the clock back and return to the very high rates we had in the late 1980s?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> These questions are particularly relevant in the context of the higher rate of income tax.  Both Labour and Democratic Left were trenchant in their opposition to the eight point cut in this rate which occurred between 1989 and 1992, but if that cut was such a bad idea why have they not sought to reverse it in Government?  The left-wing parties still have an obsession with resisting any reduction in the higher rate.  In fact, there has been no reduction in the higher rate in any of the five budgets since the Progressive Democrats left office.</P>
    <P>This might make some sense in political or economic terms if the higher rate was paid only by some wealthy elite, or even if it was paid only by those on relatively high incomes, but this is not the case.  More than half a million people pay tax at the top rate in this country &mdash; that is 40 per cent of the workforce.  A single person becomes liable for the top rate of tax at an income of just £261.50 per week.  In other words, the typical industrial worker faces a marginal tax rate, including PRSI and levies, of 55 per cent.  How can it be right that, if a person earns an extra tenner, the State gets £5.50 while he or she only gets £4.50?</P>
    <P>Labour has always resisted any cut in the top rate on the basis that what is really needed is a steep increase in the standard rate band. However, why is it that after five consecutive budgets under Labour Governments, a person on £261.50 is still paying tax at the top rate?  We must apply at least some of the fruits of economic growth to reducing both the standard rate and the higher rate.  If we do not, we run the risk of losing our international competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Take the example of the United Kingdom.  The Conservatives have given Britain a standard rate of 23 per cent and a top rate of 40 per cent.  There was a time when an incoming Labour Government might have been expected to change that but not any more.  Consider what the shadow Chancellor, Gordon Brown, has had to say about tax policy in the run up to the British general election.  On the basic rate he has said: &ldquo;A Labour Government will not increase the basic rate of income tax&rdquo;.  On the top rate he has said: &ldquo;It is because we understand the importance of work that there will be no return to penal marginal rates at the top.  As a signal of the importance we attach to rewarding work, I want to make clear that I will not increase the top rate of tax&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Showing the extent to which the British Labour Party has modernised its outlook on economic issues, Mr. Brown went even further, saying: &ldquo;My tax cutting ambition is to introduce a new lower starting rate of tax of 10p [in the pound] to encourage people to go back to work and help all hard-working families&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is now something approaching a political consensus in Britain on the need for a low tax economy.  All the indications are that Germany is beginning to move in the same direction.  Chancellor Kohl's Government is now talking about <Col N="632" /> bringing down its top rate of tax to 39 per cent in a bid to regain some of the competitive advantage which the German economy has lost in recent years.</P>
    <P>Do we want a low wage economy in Ireland? If not, why do we insist on taxing well paid, and even modestly paid, jobs so highly?  Does anyone believe we can sustain a 48 per cent rate indefinitely while the British have a 40 per cent rate and when the Germans are moving towards a 39 per cent rate?</P>
    <P>Ireland has to compete for international investment in sectors such as financial services and computer software.  These sectors produce high quality jobs, offering good earnings to well qualified specialists.  We will not attract this kind of labour-intensive activity if our top rate of tax makes us uncompetitive in the international market. It is time we faced up to economic reality on the issue of personal taxation.  We must use our current period of rapid economic growth to get our tax rates down and improve our international competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to an item I had hoped would be in the Bill but which, unfortunately, is not. That is the question of roll-over relief in capital gains tax for particular activities.  That relief generally applies at the moment to agriculture and industry.  It does not apply to a very limited number of activities, one of which concerns race courses.  At present, Limerick Race Course is endeavouring to sell its property for the purpose of building a new course on a more suitable site some miles away.  Its owners discovered recently that if they sell the property and if they reinvest the entire proceeds, as is their intention, in the development of the new course &mdash; the land for which they have already bought &mdash; they will be subject to capital gains tax on the entirety of the sale price of their existing property, even though they will get no benefit themselves from that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>They have had it for 70 or 80 years, yes, but they are subject to the tax, unfortunately. If they were to get, for example, £2 million they would be liable for £800,000 in tax.  This was confirmed recently by the Revenue Commissioners. It was pointed out that the roll over relief in these circumstances is available to virtually everybody and the Revenue Commissioners agreed.  However, for some reason, through oversight or otherwise, the original legislation failed to apply it to a company of this nature. This important matter has been brought to the Minister's attention and I understand he is sympathetic to it.  If this cannot be done, it may mean the end of racing in Limerick which would be a great tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make this plea on behalf of that company on the day that its chairman and my friend, the late Mr. Hugh McMahon, was buried.  It was one of his last wishes that this would happen.  Nobody <Col N="633" /> did more for racing in Ireland, particularly in Limerick, that he did.  I hope the Minister will introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with this issue.  Nobody, not even the Labour Party, could object to it because it already applies to virtually every activity where assets are rolled over.  It seems anomalous that it does not apply to a company which owns a racecourse.  An amendment, which I understand has already been submitted to the Minister, would be sufficient. Perhaps the Minister will indicate in his reply that he will meet this reasonable request.</P>
    <P>I make a plea on behalf of the economy to change our attitude to competitiveness.  Allied to taxation, I cannot think of anything which will make a better contribution to the advancement of our economy than a competitive atmosphere, which we lack.  Where competition has been introduced in many monopoly activities, particularly State-owned activities, it has been done thanks to the European Union forcing us, frequently against our will and with great reluctance by successive Governments, to do so.  Within the past few days, Telecom Éireann, for example, announced its third reduction in 18 months or two years in overseas telephone charges.  These reductions, 15 or 20 per cent in many cases, are confined to overseas calls because that is the only area Telecom Éireann is open to competition. There are no reductions in the extraordinarily high charges it levies for local calls and internal trunk calls.</P>
    <P>Another State monopoly which operated in a cartel &mdash; an even more dangerous form of monopoly &mdash; in the mid 1980s was Aer Lingus.  The average fare between Dublin and London in 1984, when I fought in this House for the introduction of competition, was £208.  The average fare between Dublin and London 13 years later is £69 and it is possible to get fares as low as £49 return.  We would now be paying approximately £300 on the Dublin-London route if it had not been for the introduction of competition.  I was almost hounded out of this House for arguing for that.  I was told that the national interest and the interest of Aer Lingus were synonymous.  Within two years of the removal of that monopoly and the breaking up of that cartel, the number of passengers on the Dublin-London route increased by two million.  If that is not in the national interest, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>If I had time, I could detail many other areas where that form of competition and the break-up of monopolies and cartels of State-owned companies must stop.  It will stop, not unfortunately, because the Government wants it to stop, but because it will be forced on us against our will at times by the European Union.  I wish the European Union would force these things on us more quickly because they are for our own good.  When it stops, we will look back and ask how we put up with it for so long without changing it ourselves. We are penalising and depriving ourselves of tens of thousands of jobs by our failure to grasp that obvious truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to discuss national and local issues. There is a major crisis in farming.  Evidence of this crisis has begun to reach the public consciousness in recent weeks but its effects will be more acute in the autumn when families involved in beef, dairying and cereal production begin to suffer. As times goes on, it will have further negative impacts on agribusiness generally, factory workers and the haulage industry.  I am sure all Deputies, particularly those in rural areas, are aware of the problems because the IFA and other farming bodies contact us twice and three times a week.  I tried to raise this issue in the Dáil over the past two days but I was deafened by the silence on the opposite side of the House.  Perhaps the IFA felt it was a worthless exercise to contact the Government.  I assure the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Doyle, that we will raise this issue at every opportunity until we have a full debate on it.</P>
      <P>People should compare Fianna Fáil's record on agriculture with that of the rainbow coalition.  It has been suggested that the real Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is Deputy De Rossa.  Before we left office cattle prices were 107p per head; they are now 78p to 80p.</P>

We have lost the Egyptian and Libyan markets and the Russian market is closed to 40 per cent of beef exports.  The Iranian market is closed to the Irish beef exporters because the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, will not agree to a reconvening of the Irish-Iranian commission.</P>

As the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, is a close personal friend of the Minister, Deputy Yates, she might ask him who <Col N="635" /> paid for it and let the county and the country know.  I wonder about the close personal relationship between the three Fine Gael Deputies representing County Wexford.  Despite reading carefully through this document, as if with a magnifying glass, I cannot see the names of the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle or Senator D'Arcy, but I am sure that was an oversight by the Minister, Deputy Yates.</P>
      <P>He covers a fair period in the document as he has gone back ten years in claiming credit for various things that happened in the county and gone forward two years &mdash; 1999 is mentioned.  During my 15 years as a public representative, I cannot recall the Minister, Deputy Yates, being involved in very much prior to the end of 1994.  His record in office speaks for itself.  This document was circulated to every house in County Wexford which is heavily dependent on agriculture and the word &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; is not mentioned in it.  That is a reflection on his ability.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the matter of personal assistants for the handicapped.  Mr. Kenneth Kilduff wrote to me requesting that I ask the Minister of State to insist that the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Quinn, provide personal assistants for the handicapped. His letter states that prior to 1995 he was very depressed, had a significant physical disability and was killing time in sheltered employment, but he has moved on since with the help of a personal assistant under a FÁS scheme, which I recommend to the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State will favour the inclusion of Rosslare Strand in the tourism resort scheme.  It is statistically proven that Wexford has less rainfall and more sunshine than any other part of the country and one million visitors pass through the county on the way to and from Rosslare Harbour.  If merit were the criterion for inclusion in the scheme, Rosslare should have been included.  Because of time constraints I cannot outline all the reasons.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to Bridgetown Vocational College which is close to the heart of the Minister of State.  I understand the proposed extension which was due to proceed is now off the agenda.  Why is that the case?  That college which was built a few years ago to cater for 500 pupils now has 700. Although the baby boom seems to be over the numbers attending that college continue to increase.  For that reason it is successful and we should be seen to support it.  I ask the Minister of State to take a personal interest in this matter and to press for the approval of the college extension.</P>

      <P>There is very limited time to debate the Bill due to the Government insisting <Col N="636" /> that Second Stage should be dealt with in just two days, which is unprecedented in my experience as a Member of this House.  The Finance Bill is the most important one to come before the House in any year.  The arrogance of the Government in respect of this Parliament is evident to all.  It is an arrogance that will not bring many political plaudits when its Members talk to the people, if they are not already doing so as we face into an election.  One would have expected that even as motley a crew as this lot would show some sense of imagination on the basis that we are on the eve of an election.</P>
      <P>I found this to be the most boring Finance Bill I have ever had the misfortune to read.  There is very little in it.  It should be used as an instrument not simply to implement the budget proposals.  If there was any political cohesion in this Administration as to how we could improve the private sector to ensure the provision of more long-term jobs in the economy, one would have expected some assistance to the risk takers.  The reason we do not see that is because we have a left wing Administration.  The Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste are dictating the pace.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's party, by his admission, has no policies as a separate and distinct party.  Fine Gael came into this Administration for the purpose of saving its leader's political skin.  Having hidden him in a wardrobe for the past two months, more and more people think he is doing a good job, but when he goes out on the hustings we will expose him for what he is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attempt being made by proponents and supporters of this Government who suggest this Administration is economically competent is galling. The thrust of this Administration is towards increased public spending by reason of its political composition and particularly where the power in it lies.  It produces far more lax financial targets than the compromise proposals we had to produce in the Fianna Fáil-Labour Administration. They were more lax than if a Fianna Fáil Administration had been in office on its own. Unfortunately, the gains made since 1987 are being put at serious risk.  There is considerable growth in the economy based on decisions made as far back as then which are now coming through in terms of the performance of the economy, but unfortunately we are whittling away the gains made over those years prior to this Administration coming into office.  An objective criterion to determine if a Government is economically competent would be whether it is meeting its targets.  Despite the laxness of the targets this Administration set itself, it has exceeded them fourfold on the expenditure side.  That is an extraordinary performance.  One would think it would be beyond the ability of this incompetent group to come up with as many ideas for spending taxpayers' money and seeking to bribe the public with their money.  Not only are they doing that, but they continue to mortgage the future.  The prospect of real tax reform and tax relief for workers in this economy is being put at risk <Col N="637" /> because of the large increase in the budget base, which is not sustainable in the long-term.  We saw in yesterday's <i>Financial Times</i> that even if our economic growth is reduced by 1 per cent between now and 1999 in terms of the projections built into the three multi-annual budget projections brought forward by the Minister for Finance, we may not meet the Maastricht criteria of staying within the 3 per cent current budget deficit. That is criminal.  That is the result of three parties, which one would have thought had very little in common, coming together.  Fine Gael is happy to be a partner in this Government because it does not have a distinct policy.  The Taoiseach has said Government policy is Fine Gael policy so they make it up as they go along.</P>
    <P>I heard the contributions of Deputy Broughan and other Labour Party Deputies during the debate.  It is interesting to see Labour Party Deputies coming in to debate in this House because there have been many occasions in the recent past where they refused to come in because of their political embarrassments, but now people like Deputy Broughan, a graduate of the Mao Tse-tung school of economics, seek to take credit for the abolition of the ridiculous residential property tax which was imposed by the Labour Party under the previous Administration. Labour Party Deputies are now seeking to save their electoral faces having walked away from the middle class who elected them in the first place. Many people in urban and rural Ireland are waiting for Deputy Spring and his band of malcontents to give their judgment on who should run the country in the future.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary how quickly Democratic Left has taken to democratic Government like ducks to water.  These reformed Marxists, who gave us the impression they had an alternative view of how the economy should be run along the lines of Deputy De Rossa's friends in North Korea and elsewhere, have become the best supporters of the Taoiseach in this Fine Gael led Administration.  Of course they have been exposed as political careerists.  While some of them may know the price of a pint, they are in the extraordinary situation in a western democracy where only a minority of their parliamentary party would know the price of a gallon of petrol since four of them are being driven around in State cars.</P>
    <P>All this clearly dictates that nothing is being done for the small business sector in this Finance Bill.  Fianna Fáil has set out in its policy document &ldquo;Rewarding the Risk-takers&rdquo; the many basic, practical steps which could be taken to improve that dynamic sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>On agriculture, the Minister of State berated her constituency colleague.  Will she ask the Minister Deputy Yates to undo the damage he has done by destroying the live export trade?  Despite the fact that Ireland is the biggest exporter of cattle in the EU, it was the Irish live cattle exporters, such as the Purcells and the Horgans, and not the Department of Agriculture, Food and <Col N="638" /> Forestry who went out and won markets in Egypt and Libya.  They did so not on the basis of a telephone call from a politician in Merrion Street to President Mubarak or anybody else.  An extraordinary situation now exists in Ireland as a result of a unilateral decision of the Minister, Deputy Yates, and this Government that Irish exporters of live cattle must fill the contracts they have gained in Egypt and elsewhere by buying and shipping cattle from Australia because they cannot get a shipper to take cattle from Ireland.  The main reason cattle is 78p and 80p per pound is that exporters are the only ones in a position to buy cattle at the marts at present.</P>
    <P>This is supposed to be an Administration which has some semblance of affinity to workers.  The less imperialist elements of Democratic Left, the Labour Party and Fine Gael would claim to have some recognition of what a worker looks like but the workers have been sold down the river because of the excessive public spending in which this Government has engaged.  Tax reform has been delayed and denied and we must wait for a change of Administration and a Fianna Fáil led Government to ensure workers get their deserved reward for bringing about the economic progress we have seen in recent years.</P>

      <P>Ireland is going through a period of profound economic and social change.  It is an independent and sovereign State working towards greater prosperity, increased affluence and a true and meaningful role in building a dynamic and economically secure future within the European Union.  Crucial issues of administrative change and development, and the creation of greater responsibility and accountability within the institutions and systems of Government, loom large within this process.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;Celtic tiger&rdquo; has frequently been applied to our recent economic performance. While this may seem something of a cliché, the recent successes of the Irish economy surely merit such superlatives.  This is particularly true in light of our relatively poor performance during the 1980s.  The rates of growth in output and employment achieved in recent years have surpassed all expectations and have not been bettered by any other European Union economy.  At the same time the Government has consistently maintained a position of fiscal stability sufficient to ensure this country fully satisfies the Maastricht nominal convergence criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> The figures speak for themselves.  During 1996, real gross national product rose by more than 6 per cent while the total numbers at work grew by about 50,000.  The volume of consumer spending &mdash; a crucial measure of well-being in any economy &mdash; increased by 6 per cent while inflation was at a low of 1.6 per cent.  On the Government finances, borrowing for current budget purposes was entirely eliminated: we actually recorded a current budget surplus of £292 million.  Moreover, in absolute terms, the national debt fell by almost £300 million, the first such reduction in almost 40 years.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the beneficial impact of the measures taken in this year's budget and with the new national programme, Partnership 2000, in place, the outlook for this year and the medium-term looks bright indeed.  Gross national product is forecast to rise by about 5.5 per cent this year and employment is expected to rise by a further 45,000.  Taking into account the pay provisions of the national programme, inflation is not expected to exceed the 2.25 per cent forecast at budget time.  Indeed, on the basis of figures for the first two months of this year, some commentators believe inflation will be lower than that.  Moreover, early returns on the public finances indicate a continuation of the good performance achieved in recent years.</P>
    <P>However, this is a small open economy, which is more dependent on exports than even Japan or Korea, and we are operating in a more cut throat competitive world.  We cannot, because of our EU obligations, give preference to home producers and, with the onset of European Monetary Union, we lose the cushion against economic shocks which can be provided by the devaluation option.  The age structure of our population means we must produce a substantial number of new jobs each year even to hold unemployment at its current level.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have been spectacularly successful &mdash; Europe's only &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; economy &mdash; but we cannot stand still.  Hungry nations in Eastern Europe with lower popular expectations, lower wages but strong determination to make up for lost years are getting their acts together.  Our markets are their targets and as the EU expands we face competition for EU resources from other poorer and largely agricultural nations.  Competitiveness, and not just competitiveness in wages but the ability to anticipate, plan and get our produce there first, is the key to survival.  Indeed, it has become fashionable in recent years to extol the virtues of the market economy and its ability to regulate human affairs.  We, in Ireland, have always had a certain reluctance to fully embrace those Reaganite and Thatcherite dogmas.</P>
    <P>The Great Famine of 150 years ago reminds us of the hollowness of the idea that the market on its own can solve the many human problems of a complex modern society.  In America and the UK we are increasingly witnessing the costs of capitulating to a narrow and callous version of the primacy <Col N="640" /> of the market.  The costs include social disintegration, rising crime and drug dependency, a massive increase in homelessness and a sharply declining participation in democratic institutions. In essence, a focus on the market alone and expecting the market to solve the problems of society can allow a two-tier society to emerge.</P>
    <P>We cannot allow the creation or institutionalisation of an economic underclass in Ireland &mdash; a division between the haves and the have nots. Our programmes of Government, our highly successful systems of social partnership and our commitment to welfare programmes all strive to ensure inclusiveness while not creating a dependency culture.  As far as I am concerned, to truly create a just society is the essence of good government.  What is the connection between this and public service reform?  First, virtually every pound spent on or by the public service must be obtained by taxation, levies and borrowing which has to be paid back with interest.  They are all charges on individual taxpayers or business concerns. Each charge increases the cost base of businesses and can damage, in some cases fatally, their competitiveness not just on the export market but on the home market, with consequent implications for job creation and job maintenance. We must ensure that money is not spent wastefully, that for every pound spent the community gets at least a pound's worth of value.</P>
    <P>It is important to remind ourselves of the numbers involved.  There are at present 192,380 people employed in the public service with a pay and pensions bill of £4,792 billion.  Overall total Government expenditure, current and capital, accounts for some 38 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>I mentioned taxation as a potential brake on business and its development but there is another, the abundance of regulations and endless form filling which usurp the time of management and workers, possibly to the detriment of more productive activities.  As part of its overall reform of the public service this Government has initiated a systematic programme of regulatory reform.  If regulations are unnecessary and serve no useful purpose they will go; if they are essential and ultimately helpful to the community, they will remain.  Not all regulations are undesirable &mdash; some and their stringent enforcement are essential to protect the community.  As we have discovered to our cost, laxity in the administration of others can cost lives, lose export markets and damage the good image which must be maintained by any exporting country if it is to have any success in developing fresh outlets for its products.  In this regard the emphasis on quality in those parts of the public service which service or regulate key sectors of the economy is particularly important.  I hope to announce shortly the arrangements the Government is currently putting in place to ensure that the quality of service provided by public employees measures up to the best in the private or public sectors anywhere in Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> We must remain competitive and achieve that balance between the private and public sector to ensure more jobs and enterprise.  This means we must continue the task of reducing personal taxation to facilitate the abolition of poverty traps and give more of our citizens access to the benefits of economic growth.</P>
    <P>Maintaining strong growth in output and employment with low inflation in a small open economy like Ireland is a complex business.  Getting the right mix of macro-economic, monetary and fiscal policies makes demands on every sector of the economy and on all aspects of how we conduct business in the public service.  The kinds of reforms in the structures of public administration provided for in the Public Service Management Bill &mdash; introduced in the Seanad today &mdash; are needed to ensure that our economy is well equipped to meet the challenges of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>In the modern world there are no hiding places for structures and institutions not geared to delivering a top quality product, goods or services, in the public as well as the private sector.  As in any modern mixed economy, the public services absorb resources produced in the market sectors of the economy &mdash; through the taxes and charges needed to fund them. The pay-back is seen in the services delivered by Government to the citizens &mdash; customers &mdash; whether security, economic, social or regulatory.  Where the burden of financing these services outweighs the benefits delivered, an open economy can very quickly become mired in a vicious circle of mounting indebtedness and declining output and jobs.  We saw this kind of problem all to clearly in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>While much has changed over the last decade, there is no room for complacency.  In Government, we have pushed forward the strategic management initiative precisely because we recognise the centrality of public service reform to the achievement of wider macro-economic objectives. The Public Service Management Bill represents a crucial phase in this continuous process.  It is important to keep in mind the close connections between public service reform and the maintenance of high-growth, high-employment, low-inflation performance.</P>
    <P>In any organisation not governed by the bottom line of commercial success or failure, there is a risk that managers and staff might lose consciousness of cost and value for money, which can and has already occurred within the public service. In response to that risk, we need to ensure that every civil servant who has control of a particular activity knows what it costs down to the last postage stamp.  Those who spend public money must know what is expected of them and held accountable for success or failure.  The provisions in the Public Service Management Bill will ensure that in each Department and office clarity and transparency will be brought to bear on these crucial issues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> The Great Famine was undoubtedly the single greatest catastrophe to affect our people.  In commemorating the tragic events of 150 years ago we should always ascertain what we can learn from how people at that time coped and responded.  It is true that when the Famine struck in 1845, there was very little that contemporaries could have done about its main underlying causes.  Excessive population pressure on the land and natural resources, particularly in western seaboard areas, had been building up for generations.  The reliance of a huge proportion of the poorest segment of the population on the potato as a staple food was not something that could have been changed quickly.  Moreover, when the potato blight struck hardest, even the best agricultural scientists and most progressive farmers of the time could do nothing to prevent its spread. Where human failure was clearly seen to have had most impact &mdash; and where any culpability attaching to the Famine lies &mdash; was in the total inadequacy of the response of those in authority to the emerging crisis of hunger, disease, death and displacement.</P>
    <P>Yet in truth, this failure was not simply the result of the contemptuous disinterest of a remote Government and a rapacious landlord class &mdash; although the attitude of the British Government of the day towards what they saw as a disruptive and unruly colony was certainly a factor.  Many individuals &mdash; English as well as Irish &mdash; at all levels of Government at that time, both political and administrative, tried to respond as best they could and sought with the utmost dedication to ameliorate the effects of the calamity.  Yet despite the best efforts of these dedicated individuals the failure of the structures and institutions of Government to respond adequately to our people's needs, the Famine was catastrophic, leaving an indelible mark on our society, economy and the psychology of our people to this day.</P>
    <P>Why did they fail?  One very important reason was the utter inadequacy of the institutions, structures and systems of government in Ireland in the face of this national disaster.  In other regions of the then United Kingdom also badly affected by potato blight &mdash; such as Scotland &mdash; the efforts of local landlords helped to compensate for official indifference and incompetence.  Ireland was not so lucky, where the Government failed to serve the public and people starved.  No one was asked to explain why; no one was called to account to the people.</P>
    <P>Somewhat ironically, this abject failure of public administration largely coincided with a period of significant and worthwhile reforms of government in this country initiated during the 1830s with the introduction of the poor law system. People recognised there were serious inadequacies in the structures of administration but the reforms brought forward were too little and too late to have any significant impact during the Famine.  Lethargy, complacency and the dead hand of vested interest played their part in slowing down and preventing positive change.  The lesson <Col N="643" /> for us is obvious.  Recognising the need for reform of the structures of public administration and promising change is one thing but delivering on that change is a different ball game.</P>
    <P>One hundred and fifty years on from that dreadful time, Ireland is again going through a period of profound economic and social change. Happily, this time we are an independent and sovereign State.  Now the people are working towards greater prosperity, increased affluence and a true and meaningful role in building a dynamic and economically secure future within the European Union.  Coincidentally, the crucial issues of administrative change and development and the creation of greater responsibility and accountability within the institutions and systems of government again loom large.  Of course this time administrative inefficiencies will not lead to miseries on the scale of those of the mid-19th century. We can say that with some comfort in Ireland and in Europe, perhaps in most of the developed world.  However, the real lesson of the Irish Famine and the <i>laissez-faire</i> market-led economic system responsible for the lack of interference and provision for the people at the time of the Great Famine has not been learnt.  In many parts of the developing world today, we of the developed world still extract cash crops from the people to repay international debt and monetary aid rather than allow them to grow food crops to feed their hungry millions.  Little has changed in terms of the overall philosophy of the developed world towards the undeveloped world.</P>
    <P>Even though the major risks of administrative inefficiencies should not lead to anything like the problems experienced here 150 years ago, we must not be complacent about the risks we would run if we left reform of the public services off the agenda.  The kinds of reforms of the manner in which we conduct business in the public services are needed to ensure that our economy is well equipped to meet the challenges of the new millennium. Much has changed in the past decade. We are now the fastest growing economy in Europe and our debt ratio is not much above the EU average, yet there is no room for complacency. In Government we have pushed forward the public service management initiative precisely because we recognise the centrality of public service reform to the achievement of wider macro-economic objectives.</P>
    <P>We have achieved much thus far, but much more remains to be done.  Public service change is not something we can achieve overnight.  It requires commitment, not alone from the public service and the Government of the day but also from the body politic as a whole.  From my experience of the past two years I am satisfied this commitment exists and that the process of change is heading steadily in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the comments my colleague and friend, the Minister of State, made in her contribution to this <Col N="644" /> debate.  In the other House today she introduced the Second Stage of the Public Service Management (No. 2) Bill which will give effect to some of the matters to which she has referred in this House and for which she will have responsibility when it comes to this House.</P>

I have a series of comments which have been carefully put together on the various points made by Deputies yesterday and today.  I thank Deputies on all sides, particularly the Opposition parties, who have borne the brunt of the contributions and, by and large, for the constructive way in which they have dealt with this issue.  In the course of my remarks I suspect I will not be able to deal with all the points raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points were raised which I wish to address.  Much comment was made on tax reform.  This theme was taken up in several contributions with calls for further, more extensive and radical reform.  Some comments naturally sought to understate or minimise what has been achieved by the Government.</P>
      <P>In relation to the general tax improvements provided for in this Bill, basic personal allowances are being increased by £250 for a single person and £500 for a married couple, which is the largest single increase in personal allowances since 1984.  This represents an increase of over 9 per cent compared with an expected CPI increase of 2.2 per cent.  The standard bands are being increased by £500 for a single person and £1,000 for a married couple, or by over 5 per cent.  The standard income tax rate is being reduced by 1 per cent.  This year employee's full PRSI contribution rate which is paid by over 70 per cent of PRSI contributors including public service and public sector workers, has also been reduced by 1 per cent.  In real terms, 70 per cent of PAYE tax contributors are getting a 2 per cent reduction in income tax rates as most people regard PRSI as income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to set in context where tax policy has been heading in the past few years. Viewed in this light, there has been a significant reduction in the income tax and employee PRSI burden as a result of the measures introduced in the last three budgets.  For example, over the last <Col N="645" /> three budgets basic personal allowances have been increased by almost 23.5 per cent, compared to an estimated CPI increase over the period of around 6.5 per cent.  This represents a real increase of about 16 per cent; the general tax exemption limits have been increased by 11 per cent and the standard bands have been increased by £1,700 for a single person and £3,400 for a married couple.  This represents an increase of almost 21 per cent or over 13 per cent in real terms; both the standard income tax rate and the main rate of employee's PRSI has been reduced by 1 per cent and a new PRSI-free allowance was introduced in 1995 and increased to £80 per week for most employees in the 1996 budget.  Given the changes made in the past couple of years one wonders where the Progressive Democrats have been.  When one looks at the MORI opinion poll that ranked issues of priority in recent times, income tax is not where one would have thought given that thousands took to the streets in 1979 over the perceived PAYE burden.</P>
    <P>Through these measures the tax and PRSI burden on employment is being reduced.  For example, in 1994-95 the average tax burden, including employees' PRSI and levies, for a single employee earning the average industrial wage was 31.3 per cent, not 54p as stated by the Progressive Democrats.  In the tax year 1997-98, after allowing for wage increases, the tax burden is expected to fall to just below 27.2 per cent.  Let us contrast 1994-95 with 1997-98.  In 1994-95 the average tax burden for a single employee earning the average industrial wage was 31.3 per cent.  For that same person in the same circumstances this year, following the budget and this Bill, the tax burden has been reduced from 31.3 to 27.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>For a married couple on the same level of income, the tax burden is expected to fall from 23.4 per cent in 1994-5 to 20 per cent in 1997-8. The propaganda put forward by Opposition spokespersons, not from the Fianna Fáil Party who is represented here but the Progressive Democrats who are not present, is not in accord with reality.  That is not to say any of us like paying tax but by the same token we all like getting the services which our taxes pay for.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell again called for the introduction of a tax credit system.  In Partnership 2000 the social partners recognised the complex policy and other issues involved in any move to tax credits and standard rating of personal allowances and agreed the issue should be the subject of further examination before the end of September 1997.  I would hope to get this process under way in the near future.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies questioned the Government's policy on public expenditure.  This is not the time or the place to get into a detailed discussion on the history of public expenditure in Ireland.  However, there are a number of comments I want to make in response.  I was present to hear Deputy McCreevy's entire contribution in this regard.  Anyone looking at the Government's <Col N="646" /> record on spending will acknowledge it had to meet a number of exceptional and unavoidable spending pressures, for example, the court rulings with regard to equal treatment, hepatitis C compensation, the beef disallowances or fines and the very significant cost which arose last year following the BSE crisis.  No Deputy would have said we should not have met our obligations.  Consequently, these have all added significantly to spending in recent years.</P>
    <P>Moreover, we must not lose sight of the fact that there are many economic and social priorities which must to be addressed.  I am sure Members are aware of pressing needs which can only be met properly by Government intervention through such programmes as health, education and social welfare. As a Labour Minister for Finance and a member of a three party coalition which shares a common philosophy in most if not all of these areas, I make no apology for the action that we, as a Government, have taken to meet these priorities.  If we have been the subject of criticism from the Opposition it is not to the effect that we have been doing too much rather that we have not done enough.  There is an inherent contradiction which seems to be a genetic component of Opposition politics.  Out of the same mouths come two contradictory messages: &ldquo;Spend more but spend less&rdquo;.  It is for the parties opposite to reconcile or resile themselves to this contradictory stance.</P>
    <P>Despite the apparent free run of expenditure of which the Government is wrongly accused, dramatic improvements have been made in our overall economic performance.  The 1997 general Government deficit will again be well below the 3 per cent level required for qualification for European Monetary Union.  This will be the ninth consecutive year in which Ireland's fiscal performance has satisfied this criterion.  I pay tribute to the minority Fianna Fáil Government, which held power from 1987 to 1989, the subsequent, Administrations of which the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party were members and the present Administration for collectively changing the culture.  That process of change was, nevertheless, put in place by Fianna Fáil and the parties that supported it during the period 1987 to 1989.</P>
    <P>The kind of performance to which I refer could not have come about without a change of intellectual rationale among all parties.  Tribute must be paid to the various political leaders who had the courage to make that change.  I have no hesitation, sense of false modesty or any other inhibition in recognising that because decisions of that kind have enabled us to make collective progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to Punchestown. The three most recent years have seen what can only be described as spectacular progress regarding our fiscal position, against a background of accusations of gross irresponsibility.</P>
      <P>During the period to which I referred, and for which I retain some responsibility, Ireland's performance has ranked among the best in the EU with regard to the Maastricht budgetary criteria. From 1994 to 1996, I remind the House that the general Government deficit averaged 1.5 per cent of GDP, being reduced from 2.4 per cent of GDP in 1993 to 0.9 per cent in 1996.  The debt to GDP ratio declined by almost 22 percentage points during the same three years.  This maintained the good progress established in previous years.  It is particularly worth noting that the general Government debt to GDP ratio, which was over 94 per cent in 1993, had, by the end of 1996, fallen below 73 per cent.  It is now below the European Union average and is expected to continue to decline this year to approximately 69 per cent.</P>
      <P>In my Budget Statement, I made it clear that public expenditure is a key element in the achievement of the Government's medium-term budgetary goals.  I also acknowledged that we must improve our performance.  Expenditure growth in recent years has not been constrained as effectively as I would wish.  In that context, I accept much of the criticism made by Deputy McCreevy and others regarding my personal ability to restrain the increase in public expenditure. It is a fair point but the Deputy has received no support from any of his shadow Cabinet colleagues in respect of this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has reduced the real increase in expenditure, when consecutive years are taken into account, but this is not good enough.</P>
      <P>During his contribution, Deputy McCreevy made the observation that we are building a series of expenditure expectations into our cost base. He stated that, unless these are addressed in due course, it will all end in tears.  Fianna Fáil was obliged to deal with such tears between 1987 and 1989.  The party's then leader was not aware what caused tears to come to the eyes of the electorate in respect of problems that existed in the area of health at that time.  We must learn from our experiences.  While I reject the political criticism, I recognise the accuracy of the observations from the point of view of accountancy.  I will make no further statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>The recently published revised volume of Estimates included specific measures to offset the cost of the nurses' pay package.  I made the point that the Government reluctantly accepted the Labour Court recommendation that the nurses' pay award was unique to their particular circumstance. Approximately £50 million in additional finance was required to finance the package above and beyond that provided in the PCW provisions. I obtained that money through a combination of savings.  Given the upturn in labour market performance, approximately £25 million came from the Department of Social Welfare's live register and a further £25 million was obtained, on a pro rata basis, from every other Vote.  That has been agreed and acceded to as part of the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>The message being sent out in that particular exercise to my Cabinet colleagues, Members of both Houses and the wider community is that if people want increased pay they will receive it at the expense of the provision of services within the wider budgetary constraints.  That message was accepted by my colleagues and it will also be reluctantly, perhaps silently, accepted by others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as expenditure is concerned, the aim is to put in place a strategic planning framework under which there will be agreement on overall spending limits.  Settling departmental financial allocations within such a multi-annual framework will allow Departments to plan and to manage their spending programmes more effectively than at present, with consequent improvements in efficiency and value for money.  This year's budget saw the publication for the first time of a medium-term budget outlook.  This will be extended and deepened in future budgets in line with the programme of financial reforms set out in Delivering Better Government, to which the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, already referred.  The intention is to publish, with the <Col N="649" /> 1998 budget, expenditure projections for 1999 and 2000 disaggregated to Vote group level.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with another matter to which the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle referred, namely the strategic management initiative.  In doing so, I will refer to some points by Deputy McCreevy regarding my Department's recently published <i>Statement of Strategy,</i> to which he devoted a considerable part of his contribution. During yesterday's debate, the Deputy expressed concern that the statement may, in his opinion, have strayed into the political arena.  In particular he cited objectives relating to taxation, the budget deficit and the control of numbers employed in the public service.</P>
    <P>At the outset I must state that the <i>Statement of Strategy</i> is not a restatement of Government policy, rather it is a statement of what a Department sees itself doing in the process of implementing Governments policy.  This is an important distinction. I agree with the Deputy that political matters ought to be settled by politicians and not by civil servants.  However, it would not be satisfactory if, in setting out its objectives, my Department was merely to include, as suggested by Deputy McCreevy, a general statement that it is the job of the Department of Finance to carry out the Government's objectives.  This would be of little help in showing how the Department goes about meeting its objectives.</P>
    <P>The fine line between the political and the administrative is often very fine indeed, but I cannot accept, as the Deputy suggested, that it has been crossed by my Department in framing its SMI objectives in the strategy document.  For example, the objective under &ldquo;Expenditure Policy&rdquo; on page 10 of the strategy statement states:</P>
    <P>To ensure that Government policy in relation to control of numbers employed in the public service is implemented on a sector by sector basis by the responsible Departments.</P>
    <P>This must be a central objective for my Department given its mandate.  The Deputy was also critical of my Department's taxation objectives which are set out on page 9 of the strategy statement. However, these should be distinguished from the indicators of success which are set out on page 11.  These indicators of success are necessary to show how well the Department is meeting its objectives.  The Deputy would agree there is nothing political about my Department's taxation objectives.</P>
    <P>In framing indicators of success a Department must have regard to prevailing Government policy and likely future directions in policy, including those likely to emerge from a change of Government. It should be remembered that the statements <Col N="650" /> of strategy prepared by each Department are intended to operate broadly within a three year framework.  It would be remiss of my Department if, in setting out its indicators of success for the three taxation objectives, it did not endeavour to give a realistic appraisal of the position in the light of the prevailing economic climate and future developments.</P>
    <P>The three indicators of success which the Deputy regards as &ldquo;political&rdquo;&mdash; reduction of the tax burden on employment, reduction in the number of taxpayers on the higher income tax rate and broadening of the tax base are realistic and apolitical yardsticks of success.  Hardly any party could find them either politically or administratively unacceptable.  While they may have a political intent or seem to be driven from a political source of inspiration, I put it to the Deputy who is an experienced member of Government, that because of their shared support among all parties they can no longer be regarded as political in a partisan sense.</P>
    <P>We all support a reduction in the number of taxpayers on the higher income tax rate &mdash; how one achieves that is open to discussion &mdash; and a broadening of the tax base.  Reducing the tax burden on employment is also acceptable to most parties.  The Green Party &mdash; our absent friends &mdash; would argue that the tax burden should be shifted from labour to energy and other environmental impact activities.  The Progressive Democrats &mdash; our permanently absent friends; &ldquo;when in doubt leave them out&rdquo; I think was the phrase coined by one of Deputy McCreevy's colleagues &mdash; would argue that we should simply slash expenditure to reduce the tax burden.  However, broadly speaking, there really is not a dispute on the objective.</P>
    <P>After Deputy McCreevy's contribution I had a discussion with senior Department officials, who listen to what Members say.  There was concern that a strategy statement could be seen as a partisan political statement rather than a management statement designed to implement a set of management objectives which reflected the shareholders interest, to use that analogy.  I assure Deputy McCreevy that the strategy statement, to which I subscribed fully and which I did not feel was partisan &mdash; I would not have signed it had it been partisan in a party political sense &mdash; reflected from a management perspective the implementation of a set of broadly shared goals which are not owned by one political group or party.</P>
    <P>Tere are other points made by Deputies which I may address in detail on Committee Stage.  I thank Deputies for their constructive and helpful comments.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>On Tuesday, 4 March last I tabled a parliamentary question to the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and all Ministers in which I asked if they would be prepared to be accountable to taxpayers for money spent on what can only be described as pet projects. In some cases these projects were essential and necessary.  My question related to projects which cost £500,000 or less and which were grant-aided by the State between Christmas 1996 and 4 March last from national lottery funding and departmental budgets.  I also asked for details under a number of headings.</P>
      <P>The refusal of the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and most Ministers &mdash; the Minister for Social Welfare gave me details for 1996 only and did not really address my question &mdash; and the smart alec answer given by the Minister for Finance who attempted to fob me off is a blatant example of an arrogant negation of democracy.  This is a total contradiction of the basis on which the Government came into office in January 1995.  At that time the Taoiseach stated that he would operate behind a pane of glass.  However, instead of doing this the Government immediately erected a wall of arrogance and cynical indifference to the democratic right of taxpayers to know how their hard earned money is spent.  The only thing that is clear about the Government's behaviour is its concealment of monstrous and reckless overspending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is leaving with his letter.</P>
      <P>If ever there was an example of blatant arrogant refusal to be accountable and do the opposite it is the refusal by the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Ministers to answer my question. They denied me the right to have my question answered, and this from a Government which has no public mandate and was formed as a result of a modern day Irish style <i>coup d'état.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not ask for something special, unreasonable, unnecessary or inessential.  I asked the Government to be accountable to taxpayers for the manner in which it spent moneys on special projects between Christmas 1996 and 4 March last and to give an aggregate comparison in <Col N="654" /> amount terms between Christmas 1996-97, Christmas 1995-end February 1996 and the corresponding period for the previous year.  Everyone knows that the Government spends money like it is going out of fashion; it throws it around like snuff at a wake.  All one has to do is to give a pet project to a Labour or Democratic Left TD or, latterly, a Fine Gael TD and it will be funded on the spot.  This puts the stroke politics of yester-year in the shade.  All we are short of witnessing in this spending spree is grants for pooper scoopers.</P>
    <P>My question sought information on each and every one of these projects in the interests of taxpayers who want the Government to be open, transparent and accountable and to justify the rampant overspending which seems to have consumed Ministers.  I ask the Taoiseach to state honestly what the Government is doing.  The decision to deny my question represents blatant dishonesty by the Government and is a deliberate concealment of how, where and why taxpayers' money is being spent.  I ask the Taoiseach at this late stage to ensure my question is resubmitted to all Departments so that taxpayers have an opportunity to study the details on how, where and on what basis their money is spent.  If these details are provided we will have a much clearer view of the criteria, if any, used by the Government and the Minister for Finance for the spending of taxpayers' money.  I am firmly convinced that there are no criteria.</P>
    <P>The Government does not have vision, and while the Minister for Finance had one it has been diverted to other interests.  The ultimate objective and motive of the Government is to buy votes during the next general election.  The Culliton and FORFÁS reports on how the economy should be managed have been ignored, cast aside and consigned to dust filled shelves in Departments. We all know that taxes are folowing into Government coffers.  However, I ask the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Ministers to stop spending them in the current manner.  They are spending money as if it is going out of fashion.  They cannot believe their luck in getting their hands on the loot and they are throwing it about like snuff at a wake.  It is not their money, it has been entrusted to them by the people for the specific purpose of forging their destiny, but the Government seems to want to forge its own destiny by buying votes.  It is funding every pet project in every community.  The Government is indulging in the worst form of self-delusion but the people are not fools.  They will take the money but they will not deliver the vote.  They will give the Government its answer at the earliest opportunity because they know they are not getting value for the billions of pounds the Government is spending.  They know the Government is mortgaging away their children's destiny.</P>
    <P>I have a professed regard for the Minister for Finance but he has been slaughtered by his leader, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Welfare.  The manner in which this Government <Col N="655" /> is being mismanaged was best illustrated recently in a cartoon in <i>The Irish Times</i> which showed the Tánaiste on a bicycle firmly holding the handlebars and pedalling with fury.  Minister De Rossa was pedalling desperately to keep up with him while the poor Taoiseach, armless and with no handlebars, was floundering behind.  The cartoon clearly illustrates a Taoiseach who is directionless and out of control having totally capitulated to his junior partners.  Not alone has he lost the handlebars of State but he has lost the hands with which to attempt to control them.</P>

      <P>I wish to respond to the wider comments made by the Deputy.  I understand the frustration of a Fianna Fáil Deputy who is confronted with a certain set of factual economic statistics.

      <P>It might be helpful to explain that allocations of national lottery funding are decided by the Government as part of the annual Estimates process.  The 1997 allocations, amounting to a total of almost £93 million, are summarised in an appendix to the recently published Revised Estimates for Public Services.  The allocations are in accordance with section 5 of the National Lottery Act, 1986 which sets out the categories for which lottery funding may be provided.  These include sport and other recreation, national culture including the Irish language, the arts and the health of the community.  Additional purposes approved by Government under the 1986 Act include youth, welfare, national heritage and amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I, as Minister for Finance, have overall responsibility for the operation of the national lottery, once the lottery allocations have been approved by Government the responsibility for <Col N="656" /> the disbursement of grants rests with the relevant spending Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also point out that lottery funded expenditure is subject to the same rigorous financial controls and procedures which apply to voted expenditure generally.  The only person who was found to be offside in respect of lottery expenditure was a former colleague of mine and Deputy Fitzgerald, the former Minister John O'Connell.</P>
      <P>Lottery-funded expenditure is administered by a number of Departments and related agencies and covers a wide range of programmes and schemes.  Details of lottery-funded expenditure are contained in the annual Appropriation Accounts, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  As indicated by me in response to Deputy Fitzgerald's parliamentary question, there is also the Compendium of National Lottery Grants, recently published by my Department after much delay and procrastination by people in various Departments, which brings together in one volume details of all lottery spending for the years 1987-94, inclusive.  The Deputy's party was in office during all that time, either in Coalition or on its own, yet it did not manage to do this.  This massive document, which none of the Deputy's party colleagues produced when they were in the Department of Finance, provides detailed information and gives a comprehensive picture of the allocation of lottery funds.  Similar information for 1995, based on the Appropriation Accounts for that year, will be published shortly.  The 1996 data will be published as soon as possible following publication in the autumn of the 1996 Appropriation Accounts.</P>
      <P>Because of the wide range of activities and spending programmes covered by lottery funding &mdash; as summarised in the appendix to the Estimates volume &mdash; it would, as indicated in the reply, require an inordinate amount of time and expense to compile the information in the format requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>This would involve extracting information in relation to isolated periods of time over a large number of schemes and programmes for each of the years 1995, 1996 and 1997 and would require the allocation of many staff in the Departments concerned.  If certain projects successfully obtained by Labour Deputies in Deputy Fitzgerald's constituency have caused him offence, I would be happy to provide him with the details, but if he wants details for the period indicated by him it will require a great deal of time.  If the Deputy wants to confine the information to his own area I can provide him with that.  I am simply giving the Deputy the standard format of reply that has been given on many occasions to Government backbenchers and Opposition Front <Col N="657" /> Bench spokespersons, something to which Deputy Davern may testify.  I am sorry our success is causing Deputy Fitzgerald so much distress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for letting me raise the need for an adoption contact register.  It is unacceptable that an adoption society such as St. Patrick's Guild has deliberately misled people by giving grossly inaccurate information, both to adopted persons and to birth mothers, with regard to the background to their adoption.  It is almost beyond belief that an adoption society deliberately set out to tell adopted persons the wrong names, wrong dates of birth and the wrong ages of the birth mothers.  That behaviour must be totally condemned by Members of this House.</P>
      <P>It is an extraordinary indictment of the lack of humanity shown to persons with a genuine need for information about their background that they were subjected to such conduct.  I say that as someone who is well aware of the good work our adoption agencies have done over the years and the great deal of care many agencies, including this agency, have shown over the years with regard to adoption placements and ensuring families with whom children were placed were suitable.</P>
      <P>It is simply unacceptable that the events which have now come into the public arena occurred.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the behaviour of this adoption society is rectified and to seek assurances from that society that it maintains accurate records that can be utilised in circumstances where both adopted persons and birth mothers are trying to establish contact with each other.</P>
      <P>The events that have been reported in our newspapers have yet again highlighted the need for a national contact register to be provided for by way of legislation.  For some 20 years I have been talking about the need for such a register. That need was highlighted in 1984 when the adoption review group reported and set out clearly in a definitive report on the adoption process. I find it difficult to understand why it is taking so long to produce necessary legislation. There seems to be a bureaucratic logjam in addressing this issue.  I am not saying that in criticism of the present Minister.  It is a logjam that appears to have been within the relevant Government Departments, certainly since the review group reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to nail the suggestion that this is a hugely complex issue.  It is an issue that has been properly and adequately addressed in a variety of other countries with the degree of insight and sensitivity necessary to ensure that birth mothers can make contact with adopted children where adopted children wish for such contact and to ensure that adopted children can trace their birth mothers and, indeed, their natural fathers where the information is available and where the natural <Col N="658" /> parents wish for such contact.  I urge the Minister to proceed hastily with bringing the necessary legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>I listened with a great deal of unease and unhappiness to a broadcast on RTE today with the former registrar of the Adoption Board.  He seemed to regard it as an acceptable practice that in years gone by mothers gave the Adoption Board false names in signing agreements to place children for adoption.  I am well aware of the pressures mothers were under in the 1950s and 1960s to give up children for adoption.  It seems this former registrar suggested that the board had no duty to ensure that the names they were being given were accurate and had no duty to maintain proper records.  The 1952 Adoption Act required the maintenance of proper records.  Will the Minister of State at the Department of Health correspond with or make contact with the Adoption Board to ascertain whether, in the view of the current board, full and accurate records are maintained on adoption procedures implemented in the years from 1979 back to 1952.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms. F. Fitzgerald Ms. F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms. F. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is universally accepted that denial of access to information about one's origins is denial of a basic human right.  That right is enshrined in the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child, and our own constitutional review group has recommended that Article 41 of the Constitution should be amended to make it abundantly clear that Ireland unequivocally subscribes to that view.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that I should have to seek the time of the House this evening to draw attention to the lack of action in providing arrangements for adopted persons and their birth parents to get information about each other.  It is regrettable because this is an issue that has now been in the public domain for a long time.  The sad cases publicised during the past week have revealed the extent of the obstacles and misleading information confronting persons trying to make contact with each other.  These were not the first of such cases.  There have been many others.  They keep surfacing in the media with continuing regularity. These cases coming to public attention reveal considerable human unhappiness and heartbreak, and the Minister must now introduce measures to deal with this.  We must have action at official level.  We need to introduce a sensitive, properly supervised, professionally staffed system to help persons seeking information or making contact.  We must have a contact system for those who were in the past placed in adoption, in long-term foster care or who were reared in institutional care.  Such a system would give access to the original birth registration, to background information and to advisory and supportive arrangements.  I hope the court case does not have to hold up all action.  I hope it will be possible for the Minister to give some broad details so that interested persons will be assured of his intention to tackle the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> I fully realise this is not an easy matter to resolve, and there will be conflicting situations arising in relation to adopted persons and the persons who placed them in circumstances of confidentiality. However, we have to face up to the situation.  We live now in a different social climate than that of over 40 years ago when adoption was first introduced.  The original remit was quite clear.  Adoption societies were established to place children for adoption and to conceal their origins.  It is very difficult for some of these societies now to lift the aura of secrecy when they have no guidelines from the State which established the system.  The current revelations are deeply disturbing and action must be taken to move on to a new era and a new approach that respects the rights of both adoptees and birth parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie):</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement with regard to the important area of post-adoption contact, and I thank my colleagues, Deputies Shatter and Fitzgerald for raising the matter this evening.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware there have been enormous changes in the whole area of adoption in recent years.  There are three changes that I would particularly like to highlight.  First, there has been a dramatic fall in the number of adoptions. Second, attitudes towards adoption have changed.  Up to recent times adoption was seen as the perfect solution to the problem of unwanted pregnancy, and a culture of secrecy surrounded both.  Today, we live in a more enlightened age where the stigma attaching itself to unmarried mothers and their children has been removed. Third, we have a generation of well informed adult adoptees seeking access to information about their past.  It is incumbent on us to address the problems that arise due to excessive secrecy and over-protectiveness in the past.  However, we should bear in mind that people in other times acted in accordance with other mores, and we should not attempt to judge them with the benefit of hindsight.</P>
      <P>The many demands for access to birth information have led to the situation where all adoption societies currently provide tracing for all parties to an adoption.  Deputies will be aware that adoptees seeking to trace their birth parents usually contact the adoption agency which arranged the adoption.  Where circumstances permit, an adoption agency will do what it can to facilitate contact between adopted persons and birth relatives by mutual voluntary consent, provided it is satisfied, through counselling, that both parties are fully cognisant of the considerations and implications involved in such a step.  The volume of requests to societies in recent years is an indication of the strength of feeling and strong desire for information by the parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out that the issue of an adoption contact register cannot be dealt with in isolation and it has to be considered in the overall <Col N="660" /> context of the right of access to birth records by adopted persons.  Internationally, debate has come to concentrate on this latter issue and it is seen as particularly important by adopted persons in helping them to complete their own sense of identity.  I have had detailed discussions on this matter with organisations representing adopted persons, adoptive parents, birth mothers and adoption agencies, and I have received a very clear message that the establishment of a contact register on its own would not be sufficient to meet the needs of adopted persons.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a comprehensive legal framework for access to birth records is a priority of the Government.  It is my intention that the necessary enabling legislation will be brought forward as quickly as possible.  A number of legal and constitutional issues remain to be resolved. However, a case which is due before the Supreme Court within the next few weeks by way of case stated from the Circuit Court may help to clarify these matters.  The case relates to persons who were informally adopted before the introduction of legal adoption.  However, it raises three issues which relate to access to birth records generally. In brief these are: (i) Whether a child has a legal or constitutional right to know the identity of his or her natural parents?  (ii) Whether the natural mother has an absolute constitutional or legal right to have preserved the confidentiality guaranteed her at the time she placed the child for adoption?  (iii) If the child has a constitutional or legal right to the information sought and the natural mother has a constitutional or legal right to insert that the information should not be disclosed, what are the correct criteria to determine which should be applied in the circumstances of the case?</P>
    <P>I hope the supreme Court will provide clarification of these constitutional and legal issues so that the way can be cleared for the introduction of legislation in this very sensitive area of human relationships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Allen, is answering for the Minister.  This is the third occasion I have raised this matter in the House and I object to the Minister not being present.  It is one of the reasons I raise this matter for the third time in the past few months.  The Minister does not have the courtesy to reply to me, a long standing Member of the House, about promises she allegedly made on radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Clonmel High School project has been ongoing for the past four to five years.  Last year, an old building in the grounds was belatedly refurbished.  Work began and continued through the summer into September and October.  Four classes could not be held because there was no room for them.  Fianna Fáil offered them rooms nearby but they were unsuitable.  It meant that <Col N="661" /> children were unable to attend school during that time and an essential part of their schooling was lost.</P>
    <P>This year, through the verbosity of Deputy Ferris, there was an announcement that work was going ahead.  The Minister said that work on the school was going ahead and money would be provided. To date the school has not been notified in writing that this is so.  Stage four was submitted in 1996.  The amendments and queries to builders, etc. were only made in December 1996.  Replies to all of those were sent that month yet there was an announcement that there were still some minor queries.  There has been no written communication with the school authorities or architects about the position regarding the new school. Was this part of an early panic attack when it was thought the election might take place earlier this year?  The Fine Gael Member was only on the hind teat of this announcement.  It was made by the Labour Party with a great flurry and panache, but no substance.  Even if the Minister goes ahead with the next stage this year, it will be late July to September before building will begin.  The school year will be disrupted again and it will be 1998 before the additional 100 places are provided. This school has 700 pupils and was originally built for 300.</P>
    <P>It is arrogant of the Minister not to come in to reply after what she promised to a town with a population of 17,000.  Is it not extraordinary that there has not been one written communication to the school authorities about moneys for this project?  We still have not moved from stage four to five.  The tenders will not be ready before June 1997.  The Department will not be in a position to do anything until next September or October. Work will not start until late this year and classes will be disrupted again.  It is extraordinary that the Minister would not come into the House and inform us about what she has done on this matter. I do not blame the Minister of State as he is not involved, although he has replied to me three times in the House on this matter.  He did not make the announcement.</P>

      <P>There are four secondary schools in the Clonmel post primary centre, two of which cater for boys &mdash; the high school and the vocational school.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Christian Brothers' high school the school authorities submitted a number of proposals to my Department, one of which included the provision of additional accommodation. The Department's planning section examined this application and decided that additional temporary accommodation should be provided to cater for projected enrolments of 650 pupils in the short-term and 600 in the long-term.  In reaching its conclusions, the planning section was conscious that while some temporary accommodation might be necessary to cater for the existing short-term enrolment, there would be sufficient places in the centre to cater for all pupils seeking school places.</P>
      <P>The school authorities accepted the various schedules of accommodation on 29 September 1994 and the architectural planning for the proposed new extension of 1,358 square metres was initiated.  The Department provided one general classroom in prefabricated accommodation to cater for the school's short-term needs on 6 September 1994 and a further two general classrooms were sanctioned by the Department on 6 July 1995.</P>
      <P>The present position concerning the planning of the new extension is that the building unit of my Department is examining the detail design for the project and when this has been found to be satisfactory the project will proceed to the next stage which is the preparation of the bill of quantities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 150,000 farmers have been affected by the crash in cattle, beef and milk prices.  In 1994 cattle prices averaged £1.07 per pound whereas today they average 82p or less per pound. In 1994 milk prices averaged £1.10 to £1.25 per gallon, depending on the constituent of the milk, but today the price of milk has decreased to £1.00 per gallon.  Dairy farmers have lost 25 per cent of their incomes.</P>
      <P>We are locked out of essential third country markets.  According to a recent reply from the Minister, in 1993 we exported 372,000 head of cattle and in 1994 we exported 400,000 head. However, a Bord Bia publication <i>Market Monitor</i>, dated 5 April 1997 states there was a 76.3 per cent reduction in exports of live cattle in the first quarter of this year.  Exports have decreased from 53,787 to 12,741.  That is the extent to which the farming industry has ground to a halt.  We exported 100,000 head of cattle to Egypt last year but we no longer have access to that market.  The Libyan and Iranian markets are also closed to beef exports.  There is no competition between our factories.  In the UK and other European countries farmers are getting a reasonable price for beef, but our farmers are losing money.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister embark on an action programme to secure the future of family farms?  In an editorial in this week's <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> Matt Dempsey stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The collapse in beef prices that has followed last week's revaluation and cut in export refunds is the clearest indication yet that we have lost our way in the day to day dealing with <Col N="664" /> Brussels and its critical management of the beef market.</P>
    <P>He went on to talk about the fact that at least three-quarters of our steers go to third countries which contributes to our unique vulnerability to export refund changes and that beef is very expensive to produce at this time of year.  He also stated:</P>
    <P>Ultimately the blame for this debacle has to end up on the desk of Ivan Yates.  It will take more than recycled compensation announcements to quell farmers' anger and sense of betrayal at this time.</P>
    <P>Not only have we lost out to third country markets, we have also lost out this year to continental markets because of inadequate ferry services. Last month the Minister announced a weight limitation of 400 kilos on upper decks which was reversed within two days.  I fail to understand how those artificial impediments can be put in the way of exports.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister deliver on his commitment to the IFA to pay compensation, to farmers?  A press release from the IFA headquarters dated 20 March 1997 states:</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Malley said IFA would be holding Minister Yates to the very specific commitment he gave to livestock farmers to deliver National Exchequer funding to match EU monies on Revaluation Compensation.  &ldquo;Farmers are disappointed that the Minister had not succeeded in securing the exchequer funding he promised at the IFA Beef Forum on February 4th before he made this week's announcement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to do something for the farming community and not allow Democratic Left and The Labour Party to rule the roost in Government.  We do not have to listen to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, stating that farmers are rolling in it.  That is not true.  They are very upset and want the Minister to do something about their problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity of setting out the current position in the beef market and my continuing efforts to ensure that the incomes of beef producers and, in particular, winter finishers are underpinned.  Since the beginning of the year the difficulties as a result of the BSE crisis have been exacerbated by the reduction in refunds made by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed the Commission has again resorted to this approach in the management of the beef market.  I do not believe cutting refunds is the best solution to the problem, which is one of excessive applications for export licences.  This, in turn, stems from the GATT ceiling on subsidised beef exports which was introduced some years ago in the context of the negotiations of the Uruguay Round agreement.  When this ceiling was introduced there was a reasonable <Col N="665" /> prospect it would not create major problems for the European Union because of an improvement in the beef balance in the EU market.  However, the announcement of a possible link between BSE and CJD on 20 March 1996 undermined consumer confidence in beef and precipitated a sharp drop in beef consumption across the European Union.  While consumption has recovered somewhat, the unfortunate reality is that in spite of the best efforts of all Governments in Europe, beef consumption is still approximately 8 per cent lower than in 1995.  This means the quantity of beef available in the European Union for export to third countries is now substantially in excess of the GATT ceiling and it explains why the volume of applications for export licences is so high.  With 25 per cent of the GATT year to go, only 17 per cent of the licences remain.  Nevertheless, I do not believe the Commission's approach to the problem, which involves cutting export refunds, is the best solution.  I spoke today to Commissioner Fischler about this matter and suggested that a better approach would be to apply reduction co-efficients to applications, as applies to the beef tenders for intervention.  I also sought the introduction of a fixed price intervention system, particularly for the forthcoming tenders.  I do not want to underestimate the difficulty in securing these changes and I will speak to the Commissioner again in the next few days.</P>
    <P>Of course, the long-term solution to the problem is to rebalance beef markets in the European Union by reducing beef production, increasing consumption or a combination of both.  As far as production is concerned the European Union took measures last October to reduce beef production in the short to medium term.  Member states are now obliged to introduce either an early marketing premium for veal calves or to implement the calf slaughtering premium.  The intention is that the combination of these measures will reduce by 1 million the number of calves available for beef production, thereby reducing beef production by approximately 350,000 tonnes per annum.</P>
    <P>My immediate concern is to protect the income of beef producers through adequate marketing supports and direct payments.  At my request the higher 360 kilogrammes weight limit for intervention was retained.  In addition, I succeeded in having the 04 category grade retained.  These flexible arrangements allow for some 40 per cent of the Irish steer kill to be eligible for intervention. The achievements I made in improving the DSP eligibility which we would otherwise have lost have been worth £20 million and we secured £100 <Col N="666" /> million through BSE compensation.  Payments of the combined BSE and revaluation expenditure will be made in May this year.  Notwithstanding the further £11 million which will be payable to the beef sector further to the latest revaluation of 27 March, I am pursuing a number of issues on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I wish to take up a number of points made by the Deputy.  He spoke about the ferries in relation to European transport.  Irish ferries and Pandoro are carrying bovine and sheep animals, all except calves under a few weeks old.  I intend to be in Cairo on 6 and 7 May at a major trade fair, at which Ireland will be represented for the first time.  We have secured large volumes of beef for export now we have agreed a new certification and the focus is on the live trade.</P>
    <P>The combined effects of BSE are complex. When Deputy O'Kennedy was Minister nine out of every ten animals went into intervention and we were shut out from access to some of these markets for three years.  I note the editorial in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> to which the Deputy referred.  Any analysis that lands everything on my desk is too facile and it is not a full analysis of the position.</P>
    <P>I condemn in the strongest possible manner the exploitation by the meat factories since Easter in dropping the price of beef by 5p per lb when there were prefixations in the system prior to the revaluation to maintain prices for a few weeks and when, with an even stronger revaluation of sterling against the punt, they are paying a higher price in the UK when Irish steers are eligible for the UK market.  That is inexplicable.  If ever there was an argument that live exports are needed for a competitive balance to avoid abuse of a dominant position by the meat factories, the spring of 1997 has proved that argument.  I am determined, notwithstanding the veterinary difficulties, to do everything possible to regain our position in those markets.  I am pleased to inform the House that today the Standing Veterinary Committee approved our BSE eradication plan, which will open the door to refunds, rebates and our market prospects.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for his patience.  Unfortunately there are not instantaneous solutions to this problem, but on the question of refunds, intervention, national compensation and market activity, the full resources of the Government will be deployed over the coming days and there is an action plan on my behalf to ensure that all that can be done will be done to restore farmers, particularly beef farmers, to viability.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.15 p.m. until 10.30 on Thursday, 10 April 1997.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my answer to written Question No. 191 on 5 March, the annual cost of the operation of the prison system per head of the prisoner population was approximately £46,500 in 1996, based on the 1996 provisional outturn.  This figure excludes capital expenditure and expenditure not connected directly with the running of the prisons, such as costs incurred by the probation and welfare service.  The figure does, however, include pay costs and relevant costs borne on other Votes, such as superannuation and teachers' salaries.</P>
      <P>The estimated annual cost in respect of each institution in 1996 was as follows:</P>

      <P>The definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; as set out in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996 follows the wording of Article 1 of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the status of refugees and it includes persecution because of membership of a particular social group.  In fact we have gone a stage further and have amplified the definition by an explanatory provision at section 1 of the Act to the effect that membership of a particular social group includes <i>inter alia</i> membership of a group of persons whose defining characteristic is their belonging to the female or male sex.</P>
      <P>I consider that this amplified definition is adequate to ensure that persons seeking refugee status in the State on the basis of gender related persecution will receive a fair and compassionate hearing.  I am sure that the Refugee Applications Commissioner will ensure that his or her guidelines will cover this issue adequately.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities, who are responsible for the allocation of Garda personnel to different areas, have informed me that in 1990, the Garda Commissioner appointed four members of garda rank as welfare officers for An Garda Síochána.  I assume it is these positions that the Deputy is referring to.  The country was divided into four regions and each welfare officer was allocated a region.  This is still the current situation.</P>
      <P>In addition to the support provided by the welfare officers, the Garda authorities have at national level a national welfare committee.  This committee is chaired by the A/Commissioner in B Branch and comprises representatives of all the different representative associations and other interested parties.  They meet throughout the year to discuss relevant matters.  Each Division also has a divisional welfare committee which is composed of the divisional officer and representatives of all the Garda associations and meets as required.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána also operates an employee assistance programme which aims at the early identification of members with personal problems that may adversely affect their work performance and to help them to obtain the best professional assistance available so as to retain their services within the force.</P>
      <P>In addition, members of An Garda Síochána may avail of the services of trained peer supporters within their division or section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> The Garda Commissioner has informed me that he is not aware of any recent appointment of four welfare officers by the Garda Representative Association.

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Pilot trials on the use of audio and audio visual recording of interviews with suspects are ongoing in four selected Garda stations &mdash; the Bridewells in Dublin and Cork and Tallaght and Portlaoise stations. These trials are being overseen by a steering committee under the chairmanship of Circuit Court Judge Esmond Smyth whose task it is to assess them and report to me on whether an effective and economic basis can be found for a national scheme.  Up until recently the pilot trials had been in operation at these stations on a non-statutory voluntary basis.  However, on average, only 8 per cent of suspects agreed to have their interviews recorded.  The steering committee advised me that they would be unable to reach definitive conclusions on the effects of electronic recording on the basis of such a low percentage take-up and they accordingly recommended that I make regulations under section 27 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, making it mandatory that interviews in the pilot trial stations be recorded, subject to the gardaí having a discretion to discontinue electronic recording where a suspect objects to continued recording.</P>
      <P>Having accepted the recommendation of the steering committee, I made the Criminal Justice, 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations, 1997 on 11 February of this year, copies of which are available in the Library.  These Regulations provide for the electronic recording of interviews with suspects detained under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 and, as adverted to by the Deputy in her question, section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, in the four Garda stations participating in the pilot scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the regulations are in place the committee expect that the pilot scheme will begin to produce the data on which a proper evaluation can be based.  In this regard, the services of a research consultant have been engaged for the purpose of carrying out the necessary statistical analysis of the data emanating from each of the pilot scheme stations.  Unfortunately, because the operation of the trials on a voluntary basis proved <Col N="670" /> unsatisfactory, the time needed to compile data and evaluate results will be greater than originally anticipated.  It will probably now take at least another year before the steering committee will be in a position to report to me.</P>
    <P>However, I believe that it would be wrong to try to introduce a generalised system for the audio-visual recording of interviews ahead of the completion of the pilot trials.  Once the pilot scheme has been completed and the steering committee submits it's report to me, the Deputy can be assured that there will be no delay on my part in moving to the introduction of a national scheme of electronic recording of interviews with all persons detained at Garda stations if the pilot scheme shows that an effective and economic basis can be found for so doing.</P>

    <P>This initiative was reviewed in January 1997 by the Garda authorities and is considered effective in the context of the large number of successful searches carried out and the consequent number of seizures, arrests and prosecutions since its inception.  Based on its effectiveness, from October 1996 to January 1997, a decision has been taken that operation Dóchas will continue for the foreseeable future in its present format.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that the gardaí receive information on a daily basis, from a wide variety of sources, in respect of alleged drug dealing and other related activities at many locations across the city.  How this information is dealt with depends on the circumstances of each particular case.  It is important to note that all members of An Garda Síochána who are on duty, in uniform or plain clothes, deliver the full policing service to the community to which they are allocated.  Costs associated with providing this service to the DMA cannot, therefore, be attributed to any particular incident, type of incident or operation.  Similarly, the time spent solely on drug related matters is not specifically monitored and is difficult to quantify.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Title VI of the Treaty on European Union provides, in Article K1, that asylum policy shall be regarded as a matter of common interest for the purpose of achieving the objectives of the Union.  Title VI also lays down clear rules and procedures for co-operation in this area, in addition to spelling out the respective roles of the member states, the Commission and the European Parliament.  This <Col N="677" /> formal commitment in the Treaty on European Union enshrines, in a binding instument, co-operation in the area of asylum which was already happening in a more informal way to deal with problems agreed to require a joint rather than an individual response.</P>
      <P>In 1991, for example, the European Council adopted a work programme aimed at harmonisation of the asylum policies of the member states. Although the work programme did not contain any definition of the term &ldquo;harmonisation&rdquo;, it was generally understood to mean the development of common rules and practices.  This was a recognition of the fact that it is not sufficient for member states to develop harmonised legislation but that their implmentation practices should also be similar.</P>
      <P>Initially, it was agreed by the Council that the protection of persons who are victims of persecution should be re-affirmed and the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees applied. As regards the tasks to be performed, priority was given to preparing the implementation of the Dublin Convention and harmonising the substantive rules of asylum law in order to ensure uniform interpretation of the 1951 UN Convention. Work also concentrated on specific aspects of asylum policy and, in particular, on practices that would counter the abuse of asylum procedures.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the programme has continued following the entry into force of the Treaty on European Union.  Co-operation was further enhanced by a plan of action approved by the European Council at its meeting in Brussels in December 1993.  During Ireland's recent Presidency of the European Union, the working agenda in the area of asylum included measures aimed at ensuring appropriate conditions for the reception of asylum seekers in general and unaccompanied minors in particular.  These measures were considered under the Irish Presidency in consultation with concerned agencies such as the UNHCR, for example, which acknowledged Ireland's progressive contribution in this area and they continue to be developed by the member states under the Dutch Presidency.</P>
      <P>Progress has been made in setting out the guiding principles of the 1991 and 1993 work programmes in various resolutions and positions adopted by Council.  However, these instruments are not of a legally binding nature and their implementation is a matter for each member state.  The development of common rules and practices is not advanced, therefore, and could best be described perhaps as having reached an approximation stage rather than a stage of harmonisation of policy.</P>
      <P>The Refugee Act, 1966 provides a statutory basis for the implementation of the State's obligations under the 1951 UN Convention and the related 1967 Protocol.  The Act takes due account, where necessary, of measures adopted at EU level.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that motorway and national primary roads are patrolled on a day to day basis by the special traffic corps which are, for the most part, based at each divisional headquarters. Local garda mobile units also, of course enforce traffic laws in the course of normal duty.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Justice I have endeavoured to ensure that the traffic corps is adequately resourced in terms of manpower and equipment to detect and deter motorists from breaking the law.  I will continue to provide these resources as required.</P>
      <P>The traffic corps throughout the State is equipped with 109 vehicles, including motorcycles, which are used to patrol our roads. Presently the traffic corps at Dublin Castle is using a four wheel drive Isuzu Trooper equipped with the necessary equipment to deal with a motorway emergency or a major emergency.  The Traffic Department's management plan for 1997 includes the acquisition of additional specialised vehicles.  A final decision on the purchase of these vehicles is expected shortly.</P>
      <P>The traffic corps is equipped with speed detection equipment and specially equipped vehicles adapted to monitor speeding.  In addition the Garda has also acquired a sophisticated speed detection unit called GATSO.  This unit contains a camera, video, radar system plus a computer and is fitted to an unmarked car.  It is in operation since June 1996.  It is designed to detect large numbers of speeding vehicles in quick succession and it can be located on any of our roadways including motorways.  There have been many prosecutions arising from the use of GATSO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda is committed to the strict and sustained enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts and I will continue to ensure that it has the latest and <Col N="679" /> most sophisticated equipment to enable it to do so.</P>

    <P>I recently published the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Bill, 1997 to amend the criminal law dealing with non-fatal offences against the person and criminal conduct involving syringes. The Bill will restate the law relating to various forms of assault, threats to kill or cause serious harm, coercion, poisoning, false imprisonment and abduction of children and will provide for increased penalties.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also provide for a range of new offences to combat criminal conduct involving syringes, including offences of possession of a syringe or container of blood with intent to threaten or injure, placing or abandoning a syringe in any place in a manner which injures or is likely to injure any person, injuring a person with a syringe or threatening to do so, and throwing or putting <Col N="680" /> blood on another person or threatening to do so. The penalties provided will range from 5 years to life imprisonment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that every possible effort is made to locate missing persons.  In this regard, the Garda has a particular responsibility in tracing those persons who are under 18 years of age or physically or mentally handicapped or whose disappearance occurred in circumstances which give rise to fears for their physical or moral safety.  It has to be borne in mind that some adults may decide, in effect, to go &ldquo;missing&rdquo;.  While this undoubtedly gives rise to great concern on the part of their families and friends, it is a personal choice for the person concerned.</P>
      <P>The Garda put substantial resources into tracing those missing persons for whom they have a particular responsibility.  In 1995, the last year for which figures are available, the number of such persons reported missing to the Garda was 1,444. Of these, 1,432 persons were subsequently traced.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will appreciate, the detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources is a matter for the Garda authorities.  In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that all reported cases of missing persons are followed up and that in the vast bulk of cases the persons concerned have been located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All files on missing persons are kept open and are regularly followed up to ascertain if any new <Col N="681" /> evidence of their whereabouts is available.  Where the Garda have any reason to think that a person's disappearance is suspicious or is linked to a possible crime, I have been assured by the Garda that investigations remain ongoing leading sometimes to prosecutions many years after the person has gone missing.  This can happen where new evidence becomes available or where in the investigation of another matter a link is made to a missing person.</P>
    <P>All the resources and units of the Garda Síochána are brought to bear in the investigation of a missing person and the Commissioner has assured me that this is the appropriate way to investigate such missing person cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the procedures for making divorce applications to the Circuit Court which are prescribed in the Circuit Court Rules (No. 1), 1997 (S.I. No. 84 of 1997).</P>
      <P>Section 70 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936 provides that the power of making, annulling or altering Rules of Court for the Circuit Court shall be exercisable by the Circuit Court Rules Committee with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice.  It is not, therefore, open to me to make any amendments to the Rules of the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>The Rules are based on the provisions of the Constitution regarding divorce and the provisions of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the Family Law Act, 1995 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Rules and, <i>inter alia,</i> the question of how they apply to already legally separated parties, were the subject of an adjournment debate in this House on 27 February, 1997 &mdash; the day the Divorce Act and the Rules came into operation.  During the course of that debate I undertook to raise those issues with the Rules Committee.  This has been done and I am awaiting a response from the Rules Committee.</P>

      <P>Arrangements have been put in place in the Department of Justice to ensure that the necessary transition work for the establishment of the new prisons agency can be carried out while ensuring that ongoing essential administration work is also performed. As I announced on the publication of the report on 26 March last, this transition work will be intensive and will, if it is to be done properly, take some time.  The work is at a very early stage and I cannot be definitive about the timescale involved.  The best advice I have, however, is that, with the commitment which I know will be forthcoming from the Department, about 18 months would be required to put in place the appropriate systems, consult with staff associations, allow for management development etc.</P>
      <P>In relation to the establishment of a parole board, the expert group recommended that such a board should be set up on a statutory basis.  In parallel with the above work, the necessary legislation, including that to establish a parole board, will be prepared in the Department.</P>

      <P>My Department has been monitoring the progress of electronic tagging schemes being run on a pilot basis in Britain and Sweden.  I understand that the Swedish authorities are preparing a second report on their pilot scheme and I am awaiting its publication. Trials in selected areas in Britain are continuing, and I understand that they too will publish their findings.  When both of these reports are <Col N="690" /> available I will be in a better position to decide on whether electronic tagging could be satisfactorily used in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>As I stated to the House last May, there are certain factors that might impact on the success of a tagging scheme in this jurisdiction.  For example, some of the available research suggests that any electronic tagging system would need to have over 1,000 participants for it to be value for money.  In addition, every person placed on a tagging order would need to have a telephone or a dedicated line installed in their home.  Each offender would need to be assessed for suitability and the offender's consent would be required.  An assessment would also have to be made of the offender's domestic environment.  Apart from all of this it would, of course, be necessary to consider the legal issues involved.  The examination of this issue is ongoing in my Department and I will make a decision on the matter once I have received all available information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation remains as set out in my answer to the Deputy's Question No. 83 of 27 February 1997.  The question of the appropriate sentence which is to be imposed in any particular case is a matter for the court to determine in accordance with law.  It would not be appropriate for me as Minister for Justice to comment on sentences in individual cases.  It should be borne in mind, however, that where a sentence appears to be too lenient the law does allow the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal that sentence.</P>
      <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission both in a consultation paper and their report last year on the matter.  Action has already been taken on a number of recommendations contained in the report and other recommendations are being examined in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned in my earlier reply, chapter 6 of the Commission's report refers to the type of issue which I assume the Deputy has in mind.  In particular it discusses the Supreme Court decision in D.P.P. <i>v.</i> G [1994] I.R. 587 and related decisions relating to the weight to be given to guilty pleas when imposing sentences.  Essentially, the Commission appears to be of the view that the relevant rulings of higher courts did not necessarily oblige a court in all circumstances where a guilty plea had been entered to impose less than a life sentence.  The Commission, which was of the view that it would not be appropriate to address this matter by way of legislation, indicated that &ldquo;the situation is confused and should <Col N="691" /> be clarified as soon as possible by the Supreme Court&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Law Reform Commission report on contempt of court, which raises many complex issues and contains a wide range of recommendations, is being examined in my Department at present.  The report, which has to be read in conjunction with the Commission's earlier consultation paper on the subject, contains a recommendation that a statutory <i>sub judice</i> rule should apply to any publication which creates a substantial risk that the course of justice in proceedings would be seriously impeded or prejudiced.  In the course of my examination of the issues involved I will consider specifically what new measures, if any, may be necessary to deal with the publication of photographs which may prejudice the outcome of a trial.  Given the complex issues involved it is not possible to say at this stage when this examination will be completed.  However, any proposals for legislation which may be necessary as a result of that examination will be announced in the usual way.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to Government <Col N="692" /> Ministers and the Minister of State to the Government.</P>
      <P>Official State cars are allocated to the Minister of each Department at the time of his-her appointment for use on official business.  There are 47 cars in the Ministerial fleet of which 28 are permanently assigned to the Taoiseach, Tanaiste, Government Ministers, the Chief Whip and the Minister of State to the Government, the President, former President, former Taoisigh, Director of Public Prosecutions, Chief Justice, Attorney General, and the Ceann Comhairle. The remaining 19 vehicles are not specifically allocated but are used as replacements when vehicles are undergoing repairs, maintenance, etc.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities who are responsible for the allocation of Garda personnel have informed me that Garda drivers who are allocated to drive Government Ministers receive a Ministerial driver's allowance.  When these drivers are absent due to leave, illness etc, they are relieved by drivers from Transport Details who receive a transport allowance together with overtime for any duty above their normal eight hour tours of duty.</P>

      <P>The right to a trial by jury is provided for in Article 38.5 of the Constitution.  It permits a derogation from that right in three instances only, that is to say in the case of minor offences which is not relevant to this question; in the case of military offences, which again is not relevant to this question; and in cases where it is determined in accordance with law the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order.</P>
      <P>Provision has been made by law for this last category of exception, so that offences may be tried before a Special Criminal Court in the circumstances envisaged in Article 38.5.</P>
      <P>The constitutional right to a trial by jury, subject to the exceptions set out in Article 38.5, was recognised in the report of the Advisory Committee on Fraud, whose general conclusion was that serious fraud trials &ldquo;must, therefore, be held before a jury&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission, in its report on the law relating to dishonesty, also considered the question of dispensing with the jury in serious fraud trials.  It specifically made no recommendation for the replacement of juries in serious fraud trials, concluding that &ldquo;the constitutional reality of Article 38.5 spared us from making a recommendation on the matter&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am currently studying the recommendations of the Advisory Committee and the Law Reform Commission as part of a wide-ranging reform of the law on fraud and I expect to bring proposals for legislation to Government shortly.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas.  They have expressed concern, and I share that concern, about providing the kind of detailed information sought by the Deputy on the grounds of security and in the interests of crime prevention generally.  However, I can tell the Deputy that the total number of staff attached to the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation is 63.  This comprises 52 Garda members, two civilian accountants and nine clerical staff.  In addition there are four members attached to the Cork Fraud Squad, under the supervision of the Detective Superintendent in Cork City Division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation does not have a budget and that all expenditure relating to its operation is met from the Garda Vote. Two civilian accountants are employed by the bureau to augment its expertise in this area.  The <Col N="696" /> office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Director of Public Prosecutions provides legal services to the bureau when required.</P>

      <P>Statistical information in the precise form sought by the Deputy regarding the number of cases in 1993, 1994 and 1995 in which legal aid was granted is not readily available.  The criminal legal aid payment system is geared towards the payment of solicitors and barristers on foot of claims and there may be a number of claims arising in an individual case.  The information requested in relation to cases could only be compiled by the allocation of a disproportionate amount of staff time.  However, the following information is available.</P>

      <P>In all approximately 4,500 short-term temporary releases were granted in 1996 with approximately 4,000 prisoners receiving full temporary release.  I stress that one cannot simply add these two figures together to arrive at a total number of individuals <Col N="697" /> who obtained some form of temporary release in that year as there would be a significant overlap of individuals between the two groups.  A prisoner may have been granted one day's temporary release to attend a funeral and subsequently been given full temporary release later in the year.  This prisoner would be counted in both sets of figures.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say the number of temporary releases in which pressure of accommodation was a major factor.  It must be said, however, that in a substantial number of cases the timing of the consideration of a prisoner for temporary release may have been affected by pressure on prison accommodation.  Great care, involving consultation with prison authorities, the gardaí etc., is taken in selecting individuals for release.  The overriding factor is always the likely risk which may be posed to the community by any release.</P>
      <P>The extensive prisons building programme which I have initiated will when complete provide over 800 extra prison places reducing the current deficit in prison accommodation and alleviating the consequent need to consider granting temporary releases to offenders because of a shortage of prison accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The offence commonly referred to as &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo; is a criminal offence under section 112 of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1984, which prohibits the taking of a vehicle without the owner's consent. The term &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo; does not feature in any legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of cars and other vehicles robbed from <Col N="698" /> their owners, and often used in the commission of crime, continues to be an ongoing problem.  The vehicles are usually driven recklessly and contribute to road deaths, serious injury and extensive damage to vehicles and property.  They are often stolen by very young people under the age of 16.</P>
    <P>The problem is not new and in fact had diminished somewhat from the high figures in the mid-1980s. However, in recent months the problem has manifested itself very graphically through the deaths of four people who died as a result of being hit by stolen cars.  I would like to convey my sympathy to the families of those who so tragically lost their lives.</P>
    <P>The problem of &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo; is one manifestation &mdash; clearly a seriously worrying manifestation &mdash; of the disorderly and criminal tendencies of a minority of young people, most of whom come from backgrounds where disadvantage of various kinds is a factor.  Disadvantage clearly does not excuse criminal activity, but it does point to the need for a broadly based response to the problem.</P>
    <P>In saying that there is a need for a broadly-based response, I am not trying to downplay the importance of the direct law-and-order response to joy-riding.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this matter at some length with the Garda Commissioner and am in no doubt of his commitment and determination to tackle this problem head-on.  It is not always easy to apprehend offenders because of the attendant risk to the general public, but no effort will be spared by the gardaí to stamp out this extremely dangerous, anti-social form of criminal activity.</P>
    <P>There have been many arrests over the years and sentences both to prisons and to Department of Education detention centres of youths convicted of robbing cars and using them dangerously.</P>
    <P>The Garda are deeply conscious of the need to secure the support and co-operation of the vast majority of law abiding citizens in the areas worst affected.  This is why, side by side with a policy of acting firmly to thwart the young criminals involved, the Garda are and will continue to focus special attention on meeting local community groups who are understandably outraged by the activities of the small minority of unruly criminal elements in their midst.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Justice I have supported and funded programmes which are community based with the support of the Garda Síochána, and which are designed to divert young people from crime, including joy-riding.  Eight such schemes are currently in existence in areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford and plans are advanced for the introduction of two further schemes in Dublin and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>These programmes are aimed predominantly at young people and involve various activities, sporting and otherwise, counselling, informal group work, education, group family and after care support programmes, anti-vandalism and pro-environment programmes and other activities <Col N="699" /> deemed appropriate in each of the specific catchment areas.</P>
    <P>Also last year my Department's Probation and Welfare Service set up the Cork Auto Crime Prevention Scheme which is aimed at diverting young offenders from joy-riding.  It is designed to teach young offenders basic mechanical and driving skills while addressing their offending behaviour. The project is being run in conjunction with local business in the area.</P>
    <P>The aims of these projects are to prevent crime, to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal or anti-social behaviour, to improve the quality of life of young people, to provide activities aimed at improving life and communicating skills and personal development, and to support and improve Garda-community relations.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have been assured by the Garda authorities that they are taking all possible steps to deter so called joy-riding and will continue to work closely with local communities, local authorities and state services to do so.</P>

      <P>The question of establishing a Garda mounted police unit has been considered many times over the years. Records in my Department indicate that, back in 1953, the idea was proposed by the then Deputy Commissioner but the matter was not progressed. Over the years successive Ministers for Justice have rejected the idea.</P>
      <P>However, I have again been looking at the whole question of the introduction of a mounted police unit for the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Commissioner has recently set up a small group within An Garda Síochána to examine the feasibility of establishing a Garda mounted unit and to assess the operational benefits of having one. I understand that deliberations and research by this group are ongoing and a final report is not yet available.  I will, of course, consider any proposals put to me by the Garda authorities arising from this study group's examination of the issue.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that for some time now special court sittings have been arranged to hear family law cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Partnership Government &mdash; A Government of Renewal &mdash; gives a commitment <Col N="700" /> to complete the steps necessary to ensure that the family courts are strengthened.  The Law Reform Commission in its report on family courts examined the best type of judicial/courts structure for dealing with family law and have recommended &ldquo;a combination of structural and legal reforms together with a major injection of resources.&rdquo;  My Department is studying the implications of these recommendations at present.  The report will, it is expected, also be examined by the Working Group on a Courts Commission who are examining the courts system in general.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I have taken, and will continue to take, measures to improve facilities for hearing family law cases.  For example, a major courts refurbishment programme is under way by my Department and an integral part of that programme is the provision of family law court facilities. These include separate courtrooms, consultation rooms and private waiting areas to meet the needs of those attending the courts in family law related matters.</P>
    <P>Separate family law facilities are now available in Athlone, Arklow, Bray, Ballina, Ballinasloe, Clonmel, Cork District Court complex, Donegal, Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Galway, Kilkenny, Loughrea, Waterford and in the District, Circuit and High Courts in Dublin.  These facilities are being made available in all major refurbishment projects so that there will be a network of family law courts throughout the country which will be accessible to people in their own areas.</P>
    <P>I am committed under this refurbishment programme to providing the best possible facilities with the resources available to me for the expeditious transaction of family law business.</P>
    <P>In addition eight additional judges have been appointed to the Circuit Court since July 1996 and this has resulted in a substantial reduction in the length of time family law cases, <i>inter alia,</i> take to come to a hearing in the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>The crime rate is usually measured with reference to the number of indictable offences reported or known to the Garda, i.e. those offences which must be tried before a judge and jury in the Circuit Court. Summary offences, i.e., those offences which are dealt with at district court level &mdash; these are in the main traffic related offences and the less-serious criminal offences &mdash; are not included.  This measurement of crime is in accordance with standard international practice and has always been used in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will probably be aware, provisional Garda statistics for 1996 indicate that the number of indictable offences reported or known to the Garda decreased in comparison to the 1995 figure.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is no evidence to indicate that the <Col N="702" /> decrease in the number of indictable offences recorded by the Garda in 1996 is in any way associated or connected with a decrease in the level of the reporting of such offences by the general public.</P>

      <P>As I previously stated, the review of the scheme and consideration in this context of its possible modification and-or extension involves a comprehensive and detailed consultative process including discussions between Garda management, the Garda representative bodies and, most importantly, local community interests.  By its nature, this process will take some considerable time to complete.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the following property has been the subject of various orders under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996: £289,000 in cash, one house set in flats, value £164,000, one apartment, value £60,000, six houses, one equestrian centre, three motor vehicles and one motor vessel.  Monetary values are given for two properties for which sales have been agreed but it is not possible at this stage to determine the realisable value of the other properties with any degree of accuracy.</P>
      <P>The bureau is staffed by 31 personnel and this number will increase as required.  Staff may be drawn from the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare but for security and strategic reasons it would not be appropriate for me to give any breakdown of the categories of staff employed.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen):</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be contrary to standard public accounting procedures to transfer particular revenues to particular purposes.  All revenues are taken in by the Exchequer and such allocations as are necessary are made through the normal Estimates process. Of course such moneys as are necessary for purposes of the kind referred to by the Deputy will be provided in the normal way through relevant Votes.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the provisions contained in the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, and the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in relation to criminal assets is to deprive criminals of the assets gained or acquired through criminal activity. Obviously any assets gained by the State can be utilised for any form of public spending.</P>
      <P>Under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, at least seven years must elapse from the time property is subject of an interlocutory order under section 3 of the Act before the High Court may make an order that will result in funds accruing to the Exchequer.  The State, therefore, cannot depend on using such assets to fund any project until at least seven years has elapsed, i.e., from now until 2003.</P>
      <P>Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which I as Minister brought into operation, assets can be frozen upon arrest of a person and confiscated as a result of prosecution.  This procedure is clearly more likely to yield assets to the State much sooner and clearly I would like to see the realisation of criminal assets being used for the criminal justice system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funding of treatment centres which is a matter for the Department of Health is something that this Government provides at present and will continue to make the resources available <Col N="704" /> over the coming years.  It would be a backward step if we were to depend totally on provision of resources based on the uncertain and variable revenue sources coming from seizures.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice, I am constantly seeking and receiving from central Exchequer, resources required for my resolute and determined actions against crime.</P>

      <P>I am aware that for many years, pre-dating the foundation of the State, individual judges, from time to time, have ordered that contributions be paid into the court poor box or be paid directly to a named charity rather than convicting and fining a defendant in the usual way.</P>
      <P>The decision on the appropriate penalty is taken by the judge, within the maximum prescribed by law, by reference to the conclusions he has reached after trying the case, hearing the evidence presented and assessing the culpability and situation of the accused.</P>
      <P>The court poor box is used predominantly in the District Court.  In the year ending 31 December 1996, there was a total of 1,956 contributions made to the court poor box to total value of £305,481.18.</P>

In particular, I refer the Deputy to Question No. 57 of 25 March 1997 and Question No. 77 of 22 January 1997.  The situation is unchanged since then save in respect of the increases due to all staff under <Col N="706" /> the national pay agreements.  The comparative figures for 1993 and 1987 are contained in the answers to the following parliamentary questions:</P>
      <P>&mdash; Question No. 6 of 30 October 1996 (Deputy Callelly)</P>
      <P>&mdash; Question No. 1 of 24 March 1993 (Deputy Gilmore)</P>
      <P>&mdash; Question No. 43 of 14 October 1987 (Deputy De Rossa) </P>
      <P>The answers to the more recent questions include information on the civilian drivers assigned to the Ministers of State.  Although they are not mentioned in the earlier answers, I am assured that the appointments and salary arrangements were made in accordance with the Department of Finance guidelines.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer has a retirement pension from the United Kingdom.  The pension is taxable in Ireland under the self-assessment system which requires a taxpayer to pay a preliminary tax, file a tax return and pay any balance of tax due. Returns were made by agents acting on behalf of the taxpayer for each of the years 1992-93 to 1994-95.  These returns showed that a balance of £2,584.80 tax was due.  This amount has not been paid.  The preliminary tax due for 1995-96 and 1996-97 has not been paid and the taxpayer has not made a return for 1995-96.  The deadline for making this return expired on 31 January 1997. The Commissioners have issued demands for the <Col N="707" /> tax and returns which are outstanding and legally due.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners will contact the Deputy and give him the name and telephone number of the inspector of taxes dealing with this case so that the meeting the Deputy has requested can be arranged.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Notes:</i>
    </P>
    <P> (1)  It is vital in interpreting this table that the mechanism for reviewing both the family income supplement and the rent subsidy under the shared-ownership scheme is understood. FIS is renewable on a 12 monthly basis: once awarded it will not be reduced or withdrawn until the end of the period, regardless of any upward movement in pay during that period. The rent subsidy under the shared ownership scheme operates in much the same way: all cases are reviewed annually (in July) and the rate for the coming year is based on the income of the recipient in the previous tax year.  Therefore, gross income from employment can increase significantly during the course of a year while adjustments to both FIS and the rent subsidy may not occur until some time later.</P>
    <P>(2)  In relation to the fuel subsidy, it should be noted that this is paid in addition to the family income supplement while the person is eligible for this.</P>
    <P>(3)  The medical card is shown here as being withdrawn as the income increases by £20 per week.  However, if the person had previously been long-term unemployed, the medical card can be retained for three years, irrespective of earnings. </P>
    <P>In addition to the improvements in income tax and PRSI provided in my 1997 budget, families in low paid employment will benefit from this Government's commitment in Partnership 2000 to improve the family income supplement by adjusting the method of calculation from a gross income to a net income basis.  As a first step towards fulfiling this commitment, from June this year, family income supplement will be calculated on a basis net of PRSI and the health and employment levies.  The current income thresholds are also being increased.  These changes will alleviate the extent of the poverty trap for the categories concerned.</P>

The cost of the proposal from the Mater Hospital which would include additional cardiac surgery is: capital cost, £2.6 million; revenue cost, £2.4 million per annum.</P>
      <P>This would involve the employment of an additional 45 staff.  In addition, the Mater Hospital has informed my Department that it considers that it would be uneconomic to initiate a lung and heart-lung transplantation programme on its own without incorporating extra open heart surgery.</P>

    <P>These figures show that the incidence of meningococcal disease remains high in the Eastern Health Board area but has not shown a marked increase over the figures for the past three years. The first quarter of each year is usually associated with the highest incidence of this disease.  I am informed that recent cases are sporadic in nature, i.e. have occurred individually and are not related clinically or epidemiologically to each other.  The nature of this condition is that it can strike with great rapidity, the patient can deteriorate very quickly and there is a mortality rate of up to 10 per cent.  The recent report of the Working Group on Bacterial Meningitis and Related Conditions pointed to the necessity for early diagnosis and immediate treatment of this condition by doctors with a view to reducing the mortality.  The report also makes a number of further recommendations in relation to the surveillance, treatment and control of meningitis and those recommendations are being pursued with the health service personnel most actively involved in this area.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the advice offered to parents through the Health Promotion Unit leaflet on meningtis that if they are concerned their children may be suffering from meningitis to bring them immediately to their doctor for assessment and further action if necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The original aim of the scheme was to ensure that persons with a scheduled long-term disability or disease which is treatable by drug therapy would not have to suffer expense in order to obtain their required drugs and medicines.  The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are now met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition such as spinal injury, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend <Col N="712" /> more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
    <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from conditions such as spinal injury.  Accordingly, I have no plans to extend the number or range of illnesses currently covered by the long-term illness scheme.</P>

      <P>Expenditure on the project referred to by the Deputy for the years 1994, 1995 and 1996 was £181,000, £198,000 and £340,000 respectively.  An allocation of £300,000 has been made to continue with the conservation work in the present year.</P>
      <P>The detailed works carried out from 1994-6 included the following: completion of the reroofing of the castle, reinstatement of some internal floors, carving and cutting of stone mullions for windows and decorative limestone chimneys, conversion-restoration of the Gothick Gate as a visitor reception building for access to the formal gardens and castle surrounds, detailed research into the archaeological-architectural and historical background of the project, and opening of ground floor exhibition to public.</P>
      <P>In 1997 it is proposed to: provide public access to upper floors of the castle and extend the exhibition area, carry out works to present the 17th century courtyard buildings adjoining the castle and secure the 18th century complex, adapt the former forestry-estate accommodation on the site for Heritage Service conservation works purposes, commence reinstatement of the historic herb garden in association with a local community group, present and secure the historic features at the main entrance area and screen modern development, provide car-bus park adjacent to the courtyard complex, and carry out routine maintenance and ancillary service works which have been ongoing at the site i.e. provision of lighting, security and road resurfacing to both enhance the presentation of the historic landscape and secure the National Monument.</P>

      <P>The building regulations, which came into effect on 1 June 1992 prescribe the minimum requirements to be observed in the construction of new buildings and the alteration or change of use of existing buildings.  Since the introduction of the regulations, insulation levels are estimated to have increased by 50 per cent.  I intend to amend and consolidate the building regulations and revise the accompanying technical guidance documents shortly; the revisions will yield additional savings of 5 per cent of energy used for space heating.</P>
      <P>In April 1996 my Department requested local authorities to give greater priority to the need to improve energy efficiency in their rented dwellings. The Irish Energy Centre, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, has the particular remit of promoting energy saving in all sectors of the economy.  Conservation of energy in houses and other buildings feature strongly in the centre's advertising, educational and promotional activities including the very successful annual Energy Week.  The centre has produced a series of leaflets dealing with all aspects of energy conservation in existing houses.  Energy conservation in buildings is also promoted by the energy utilities, especially the ESB.  Residential energy use is targeted through advertising and other promotional activities, including reduced prices for lagging jackets, attic insulation and low-energy lights.</P>

      <P>The day-to-day operation of their swimming pools is a matter for individual local authorities. The authorities can also make by-laws for the regulation of swimming pools, whether in their own or private ownership, in relation to matters such as the provision of life-guards and safety equipment, hygiene, etc.</P>
      <P>My Department has requested and received from the Consumers' Association of Ireland a copy of the report referred to.  The report states, in summary, that overall, the standard of safety at the pools inspected was quite good.  Nevertheless, I will carefully study the report and consider what action I might take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total expenditure by local authorities on swimming pools, from their own resources, is estimated to have been almost £8 million in 1996.  My Department has a capital allocation of £3.5 million for 1997 out of which grants may be made for <Col N="716" /> the provision of new pools and the refurbishment of existing pools.  This represents a significant increase on the 1996 provision of £2 million.  It has never been the practice to make grants towards the maintenance of swimming pools.</P>

    <P>The reports available on road accidents do not provide information in relation to the number of <Col N="717" /> accidents involving tourists driving on the wrong side of the road.</P>
    <P>Last September, I introduced a new multi-lingual road traffic sign to warn drivers of the requirement to drive on the left-hand side of the road.

    <P>The National Safety Council's information leaflet for tourists is distributed to the major car hire firms, including all of the firms operating from the airports and ferry terminals.  This leaflet provides information on the Rules of the Road in three languages, including clear advice that all traffic must drive on the left.  While I have no immediate proposals to hold discussions on the matter with car hire companies or the Car Rental Council, I will continue to keep under review the question of what further action could be taken to minimise the risk of accidents of the kind referred to.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the cases made by the schools in question in support of their applications for a remedial teacher service.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools, by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and <Col N="721" /> the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
    <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
    <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

Following receipt of this report the Revenue Commissioners undertook a detailed examination of the deduction of PAYE and PRSI in respect of a former officer of County Westmeath vocational education committee.</P>

    <P>I am informed by County Westmeath vocational education committee that the examination conducted by the Revenue Commissioners identified underpayments in respect of PAYE and PRSI on behalf of a former officer of the vocational education committee for the period <Col N="722" /> 1985-96.  The amounts of the underpayments in respect of PAYE and PRSI are £13,683.81 and £452.35 respectively.

There are two such schools at present.  St. Joseph's Special School, Drumcondra, caters for boys at primary level.  St. Mary's Special School, Merrion, caters for girls of primary and post-primary age.  Boys of post-primary age are catered for at Pobal Scoil Rosmini, Drumcondra.  My Department makes special grant support available at both primary and post-primary level to facilitate the purchase of special equipment such as computers and braillers to assist children with visual impairment.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education I have reduced the pupil teacher ratio in special schools and classes for children with visual impairment from 10:1 to 9:1.  I have also substantially increased the special rate of capitation funding payable in respect of such children.  Prior to my appointment, the special capitation rate for visually impaired children was £132 per child.  It now stands at £307 for children under 12 years and £372 for children of 12 years or over.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial improvement across the entire spectrum of special needs, including provision for children with visual impairment.  I would be anxious to continue this process.</P>

      <P>There are a number of services available in the prison system which provide counselling and training to offenders with a view to their rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The psychology service provides a service to offenders in prison.  The psychologists provide pre-release programmes for offenders, specialist treatment for sex offenders and, in general, participate in the positive management of their sentences.</P>
      <P>The probation and welfare service provide a counselling service to offenders in prison, helping them generally to cope with their sentences and preparing them for release and their reintegration into society.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the vocational education committees, the Public Library Service and other outside agencies, operate an education service which offers a wide curriculum to offenders and allows them access to education while serving their sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work-training service operated by my Department provides training for offenders in <Col N="728" /> different skills which meet the requirements of the modern workplace.</P>
    <P>A chaplaincy service is also provided to offenders in custody, providing counselling not just in spiritual matters, but in everyday human activity.  In addition, voluntary organisations like Alcoholics Anonymous and similar organisations visit the prisons and provide counselling and other services to prisoners.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these various programmes have a significant role to play in the rehabilitation process of these offenders and help them to reintegrate into society on their release from custody. I am in receipt of the recommendations of various prisons visiting committees who, from time to time, make recommendations for improving rehabilitative facilities and services in the prisons. I adopt, where possible their particular views on this matter.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that instructions are issued to all gardaí concerning road traffic accident cases.  The decision as to the appropriate action and manner of the investigation to be taken by the gardaí in a particular case depends on the circumstances surrounding that accident.</P>
      <P>The fact that a motor vehicle is in collision with a pedestrian is not in itself an offence.  The garda will collect all evidence and take statements from witnesses in order to complete the Garda file for the information of the DPP who, in turn, will issue his directions in regard to the question of prosecutions.  The motorist may or may not be arrested at the scene, again depending on the circumstances and the evidence available at the time.  If a person is not arrested, he may or may not be interviewed at the local Garda station.</P>
      <P>He may go there by appointment but there is no obligation on him to do so.  The question of urine or blood samples does not arise unless the investigating garda has arrested him for drunken driving in which case the arrested person is obliged to provide a urine sample or have a blood sample taken from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On completion of the Garda investigation file, which would consist of statements by the parties involved, statements of witnesses including forensic <Col N="732" /> scientific or vehicle inspection reports, it is forwarded to the DPP for his direction as to the question of prosecutions.</P>
    <P>All driving cases involving death are submitted to the DPP except accidents where there is no surviving driver.  It is the case that there are occasions when dangerous driving charges are preferred when no collision has occurred.  It is also the case that very serious accidents involving death or serious injury can occur without any prosecution being warranted.  The fact that a person is killed or seriously injured has in itself no bearing on the decision to prosecute or not.  That decision depends entirely on an appraisal of the evidence of the manner of driving involved.</P>

      <P>The latest period for which statistics for the small claims procedure are available are for the 12-month period up to 7 December 1995.  During that period, 2,470 new applications were received and 495 cases were brought forward from the previous period.  The statistics indicate that 1,420 cases were settled by the small claims registrar, 245 cases were withdrawn, decrees of default were issued in 233 cases and 596 cases were brought before the court.  Of the cases brought before the court, 93 were dismissed, 96 were struck out and small claims decrees issued in 303.  The remaining cases were adjourned.  At the end of the period <Col N="733" /> there were 458 cases under the small claims procedure ongoing in District Court Offices.</P>
      <P>Statistics are not available in relation to the number of awards paid on foot of court orders primarily because in many cases the small claims registrars are not informed of the settlements which take place between the parties following court procedures.  With regard to the length of time taken to process cases under the small claims procedure I am satisfied that the procedure is generally providing an efficient service to customers. However, as the Deputy will appreciate the circumstances of each individual case dictates the length of time which the case requires.</P>
      <P>Statistics for the period up to 31 December 1996 are currently being compiled in my Department and will be completed shortly.  I will ensure that the Deputy receives a copy of these statistics as soon as they are available.  A review of the statistics being maintained in relation to the small claims procedure is also under way.</P>
      <P>With regard to the particular case mentioned by the Deputy, I have had inquiries made and I am satisfied that this case was properly dealt with by the small claims registrar.  I understand that this case was heard in the District Court and a decree issued in favour of the claimant.  This decree has now been lodged with the sheriff for execution.</P>

      <P>The Judge's report is under examination but in the meantime he made recommendations as to how the probation and welfare service should deal with such cases should they arise in the future.

These new guidelines came into effect for probation and welfare service staff on 15 January 1997.  Having concluded my deliberations on the report, I will take whatever further action or legal advice is required.</P>

      <P>The CORI part-time job opportunity programme is a three-year pilot programme which was scheduled to end in June 1997.  Given that there will be wind down issues and that some individual projects did not start on time it will be end September before the programme is completely finished.  CORI's involvement with the programme will cease at the end of May, as is their wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An evaluation of the pilot programme has been completed and considered by the Government. The evaluation points to a number of positive outcomes from the proposal such as allowing participants to remain on projects for three years and the introduction of spousal swops.  These aspects have already been mainstreamed into Community Employment.  Other innovations of the CORI concept such as the rate for the job approach are under consideration and discussions are ongoing with CORI to explore the feasibility of absorbing further elements of the pilot programme <Col N="736" /> into mainstream programmes.  The rate for the job approach has already been adopted in the pilot whole-time job initiative programme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the existing sponsors-participants in the pilot programme, the Government has decided that: all suitable CORI sponsors who wish to convert to community employment will be allowed to do so, participants receive special guidance and counselling before the project comes to an end to help them get employment in the open labour market, and that the option of allowing participants a further year on community employment be maintained if it becomes necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates):</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 1988, the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced a national programme for the development and servicing of the non-thoroughbred horse industry.  This programme included an Exchequer funded scheme which was to run for the five year period 1990-94 and which involved the payment of a grant of £400 to the breeder of each pure bred Irish Draught foal registered in the Irish Horse Register. The purpose of this scheme was to maintain a viable Irish Draught nucleus population.  That the scheme was successful is evidenced by the fact that in 1994 727 Irish Draught foals were registered <Col N="737" /> in the Irish Horse Register as opposed to 137 in 1988.</P>
      <P>A foal registration incentive scheme was one of the measures included in the Operational Programme for Rural Development 1989-93 to assist the non-thoroughbred horse industry.  This programme was co-financed out of Structural Funds. The scheme provided for the payment of £150 to the breeder of each foal registered in the Irish Horse Register or in the Connemara Pony Stud Book subject to a maximum of five grants per breeder per annum.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the scheme was to encourage breeders to register their foals in accordance with EU policy.  The number of foals registered increased between 1988 and 1993 from 2,626 to 6,582.</P>
      <P>As these schemes have achieved their purposes I consider that their reintroduction would not be justified.  However the non-thoroughbred horse industry is at present being supported through a range of schemes under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-9.</P>

It is a condition for eligibility for headage grants that herdowners comply with the provisions of the Diseases of Animals Act 1966. As the person named failed to comply with the said provisions his grant under the 1995 cattle headage scheme is being withheld.</P>
