      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The British Prime Minister and I had a useful 15 minute telephone conversation on Friday last. On the North review, I emphasised the importance of speedy implementation of the recommendations &mdash; in particular, with regard to putting in place as soon as possible the proposed independent parades commission with the functions and powers recommended.  I put it strongly to the Prime Minister that in view of the overriding imperatives regarding parades the suggested eight-week consultation period was too long. Implementation of the recommendations by a group which had already consulted widely should proceed without delay.  The Government believes this is particularly important because of the urgency of the need to take pre-emptive action if we are to avoid a repetition or worse of last year's bitter confrontations.  In that regard there is an onus on all sides to exercise the maximum responsibility and restraint and to engage in dialogue with a view to optimising the extent of agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On matters relating to Bloody Sunday, I undertook that the Government would examine the additional material which was not taken into account by the Widgery Tribunal.  Our assessment of that material will be forwarded to the British <Col N="394" /> Government in connection with a fresh look at the matter we are pressing them to take.  It is important, for many reasons, that the tragic events of that day should not continue to be an unnecessary source of additional grievance for the loved ones of those who died.  The Government wants to see an unequivocal statement by the British Government that the victims were totally innocent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated that he raised the North report with the British Prime Minister and pressed for its early implementation. Will the Taoiseach tell us the response he received during that conversation, which I welcome? I stated in the House last Thursday that there should be direct contact at a high level.  Is he concerned by the impression given at the weekend by many members of the British Government that they are engaged in a long fingering exercise for party political reasons at Westminster?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The North report was prepared on the basis of widespread consultation.  It was made very clear that those producing the North report were being asked to report in January so that action could be taken in time for spring and summer of this year.  An eight-week consultation period is too long and I told the Prime Minister that.  A two to three-week consultation period would be sufficient given the extent of the consultation that has already occurred.</P>
      <P>I also pressed on the British Prime Minister the view that legislation should be introduced quickly.  I know there are aspects of the North report which can be acted upon straight away without legislation but there are also aspects of it which require legislation and it is important that the complete apparatus for mediation and regulation should be in place before any significant preordained marches take place.  I put that view strongly to the British Prime Minister.  He is of the view that the eight-week period is the normal period for consultation in respect of documents of this kind and he felt it would be difficult for him to depart from that.  This is not a normal situation and we need to act in a different sense. However, the British Prime Minister indicated that once the consultation period was over, the matter would be dealt with speedily and that preparatory work during the consultation period was not being put on hold.  I hope a great deal of work will be done during the consultation period but it need not be as long as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept the British Government is long fingering action on the North report because it is afraid of upsetting the Unionists who hold the balance of power in Westminster and that it is for selfish, domestic reasons that this long consultation period has been agreed by the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much profit in my <Col N="395" /> becoming involved in speculation of that kind. The facts are well known.  We had difficult marching seasons in the last two years and the problems which are likely to arise are now foreseeable.  The North committee was asked to examine the matter because it was felt that we needed new procedures, and if that is so they are needed for this year's marching season.  All who have responsibility in this matter &mdash; whether they are in Government or Opposition, in this jurisdiction or the neighbouring jurisdiction &mdash; have an obligation to do everything possible to put in place effective arrangements to avoid a recurrence of what happened last year.  I would prefer to concentrate on the urgency of that matter rather than speculate on anyone's motives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair point.  Would the Taoiseach agree that it is in the interests of both Governments to defuse tensions surrounding the marching season?  It is clearly in the interest of the Irish Government to do so, given the impact of those tensions on relations in the island last year.  Would he also agree that we are dealing with a clash of rights?  Does he feel that, in the implementation of the report, the proposed marching commission should have a stronger, more explicit emphasis on minority rights?  I have spoken to people from the Garvaghy Road and the Lower Ormeau Road and, while they welcome the report, they point out that this question is not well dealt with in the preamble.</P>
      <P>Based on his discussions with the British Prime Minister and on his own reflections, could the Taoiseach give us his views on the report?  It states that the marching commission's findings should be binding on both residential communities and the marchers, on pain of criminal prosecution, but can be over turned at any time by both the police and the Government.  Given what has happened on previous occasions, does the Taoiseach believe that is rather too loose?  The British Government will cite security reasons, as they have continually done throughout the years.</P>
      <P>It would be totally wrong of us to ignore the views of the organisers of the Orange marches. They continually state, at Drumcree and other events, that the Irish Government has an input into whether a march takes place.  Could the Taoiseach put on the record the factual position, which is that while the Irish Government expresses its views on parades it has no part in any decision to allow or to ban marches?  This is unjustified Orange paranoia about the role of the Irish Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should probably avoid using words which have any pejorative connotation when describing anyone whose rights are being sought to be balanced in this matter.  I agree with the Deputy that this is a matter of balancing rights.  As the North report says, there are two conflicting rights &mdash; the right to peaceful free assembly, subject to certain qualifictions, and the <Col N="396" /> obligation to exercise that right with certain responsibilities, in particular taking into account the way in which the right is exercised in relationships with other parts of the community.  It is important to temper the exercise of the right to free assembly with reference to the impact which a particular method of exercise of that right would have on relationships within the community. It is fair to say that in the exercise of all rights &mdash; such as the matter of recent controversy about what should and should not be published &mdash; having the right to publish something or walk somewhere does not mean that one is obliged to exercise that right in a particular way in all circumstances. There is a margin for judgment, discretion, humanity and decency and every individual who has a right has an obligation to remember that margin when deciding how he will exercise that right.  To say that people have exercised a right in a way which was mistaken in a particular instance is not to say that they do not have the right, just that they have exercised it wrongly; nor is it to say that the right need necessarily be taken away from them.  One could be satisfied that they will exercise it in a decent and humane way.</P>
      <P>The North report contains a lot of useful recommendations apart from the ones referred to by the Deputy.  It suggests a longer notice period of 21 days and the creation of a new offence which would penalise the conduct of individuals who set out deliberately, through force of numbers or threat of disorder, to contravene the legal determination of the parades commission in defiance of its authority.  This recommended new offence is of considerable importance because it means that people who exercise a particular right in a way which has the effect described would be open to prosecution.  There is also provision for a code of conduct in regard to parades, a band registration scheme and a control on the sale of alcohol in association with parades.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the decision the Secretary of State might make to vary, on appeal from the Chief Constable of the RUC, a determination by the parades commission.  Under the recommendations the Secretary of State could only make that decision in accordance with the same criteria &mdash; which would ultimately be statutory criteria &mdash; which would guide the commission in making its original decision.  He could not make it using other criteria.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government does not become involved in decisions about individual parades and that should be understood by all in Northern Ireland.  However, we have a legitimate interest in protecting the rights of both communities, particularly the minority, in Northern Ireland and in the avoidance of disorder, which could cause problems for people both within Northern Ireland and elsewhere, and we offer advice and counsel on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that if the parades issue is to be resolved, not only will <Col N="397" /> it require action from the British Government but the Unionist community will have a huge role to play, as they played such a major part at Drumcree last year?  Does he also agree that Unionists would be far better to confront everything involved in the parades issue rather than complain about President Robinson's visits to Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I might well have a view on that matter but I am not certain it is necessarily productive for me to become involved in telling other political parties what they should or should not be talking about.  I would not attempt to advise the Deputy in respect of what she might say and, as I am seeking to reach an amicable conclusion to this matter, I do not think I should point the finger at other parties and tell them where they are wrong.  That approach, which I would characterise as megaphone politics, is not useful.  I would see my responding to the question put by the Deputy as an invitation to engage in megaphone politics, and I am not sure why the Deputy put the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The President should not be referred to and most certainly should not be involved in controversy in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Chair.  She should not have been the subject of such abuse either from certain Unionist politicians complaining to the British Foreign Office.</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that Unionist politicians should confront the parades issue? Also, does the Taoiseach really believe that we will see some action by the British Government on this issue before the British general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an obligation on everybody, and there is a particular obligation on the Unionist politicians because they have considerable involvement with the Orange Order, to deal with the issue of the effect that certain marches have on community relations, and to deal in particular with the situation where what is supposed to be a local march to a church in Drumcree, with a capacity to hold no more than 500 people, attracts a crowd of 6,000 people who claim that they want to march to the church.  It is not as if there are not a sufficient number of churches elsewhere in which they could worship. The fact that they all need to march to this particular church raises questions in the minds of some as to whether it is purely a matter of worship.  That issue needs to be dealt with in a way that is consistent with the principles of liberty and freedom that are claimed to be principles by all of the parties in Northern Ireland, including the Unionist Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the second part of the question, some action will be taken before the general election on some matters.  The parades commission will be established, and the mediation process will be under way.  Other aspects of the North report <Col N="398" /> require legislation.  I am not so certain that the legislation will be passed before the general election, but it is not for me to make a comment on when a general election might occur in another jurisdiction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that we have no desire to prevent the vast majority of Orange parades but are endeavouring to deal with those that continually cause controversy? Given what the Taoiseach has just said, would he agree that, as there are two routes of equivalent length and convenience, one controversial, the other non-controversial in relation to Drumcree, that the non-controversial route should be taken by future marches?  Will the Taoiseach state that clearly and urge people to take the non-controversial route?  Six thousand, or even 16,000 people, could march on the alternative route and it would not upset the minority.  Would the Taoiseach agree that the alternative route should be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain inconsistency between this question and an earlier question put to me by the Deputy.  In an earlier question the Deputy invited me to confirm his understanding that the Irish Government is not involved in consultations about individual march routes, and this is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he had a view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in response to a question by Deputy Harney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not have a view on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should maintain discretion in the matter.  The position is that the Irish Government is not involved in the routing of marches.  Deputy Ahern sought reassurance on this point for the benefit of the people in Northern Ireland who feel we are involved in the routing of every march.  The Deputy presumed that previous Governments were not involved either and asked me to confirm that.  I did so.  The Deputy is now asking me, in a separate question, to become involved in a discussion about the routing of an individual march.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty and a tension between the two things the Deputy is driving at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question is that the Taoiseach has no direct involvement and nor did any previous Government.  In answer to the second question, the Taoiseach stated that he believed the matter of why 6,000 people march in a parish of 700 people should be looked at. That is a very good question.  Is it not a logical <Col N="399" /> conclusion that the parade should not march through an area that is 99 per cent Catholic? Would the Taoiseach not agree that the alternative route should be taken thus avoiding difficulty? Let us be honest and agree that the parades commission and all of the other matters will not be completed in time for the next marching season.  This issue should, therefore, be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must look at this in a realistic way.  Part of the difficulty in Northern Ireland is that the Unionist community feel we are telling it what to do in regard to particular matters.  While I might have an opinion on the matter, as suggested by the Deputy, it might not necessarily be constructive for me to be drawn into making prescriptions as Head of Government of this State on the detail of the matter put forward by the Deputy.  Anybody with a common-sense understanding of this situation understands well that we need to avoid confrontations in this area.  I have no doubt that all those involved will take account of the considerations mentioned by the Deputy &mdash; and they are valid considerations &mdash; with regard to routes so as to avoid unnecessary confrontation.  They should do so, and this should be taken into account by the organisers of marches and also by the forces of law.  There is a risk that any attempt by the Deputy or any other Deputy to draw me as Head of Government of this State into making recommendations about individual march routes would be counterproductive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an unbelievable attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Ahern might explain that to Deputy Cowen who seems to be unable to understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I found that last reply quite extraordinary.  The Taoiseach has emphasised the balance of rights at some length.  Would he accept that the Unionist/Loyalist/Orange rights are well balanced when they have 50 other parades in Portadown to which the minority community do not object because they have little right to object? Would he accept that those 50 marches are a fair commemoration of the culture and heritage that we hear so much about in the North, and that the march from Garvaghy Road and back from Drumcree Church is merely a demonstration of supremacy by the Unionist community and the Orangemen?  Does the Taoiseach agree that it would not be counterproductive for him to express a view in this House on the undesirability of a march which led last year to nearly 6,000 plastic bullets being fired over a weekend, to people being murdered and to demonstrations throughout Northern Ireland?  Does he not feel it would be appropriate for him to express a view in this House to the effect that it is wrong that the rights of the minority should be trampled into the ground through a demonstration of <Col N="400" /> supremacy, with a march of 6,000 through their community?  Does he not agree that he would be doing the minority and the majority a service?  Is it not a fact that no matter what he says he is going to be misrepresented by the Unionist community? He should not be naive about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I also expect to be misrepresented by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Hectoring by the Deputy is not helpful but only exacerbates the situation.  The Deputy's intervention shows that he does not understand the nature of community relations in Northern Ireland.  Each community has an appropriate sense of its dignity, and it is important that anything that is said is designed to achieve agreement on this matter.  The provocative, one sided approach which the Deputy is adopting is counterproductive and will do no good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is so difficult to have questions on the North taken that I am delighted we get some latitude.  Does the Taoiseach agree that, notwithstanding the fact that the talks process is not as successful at this stage as we would wish, it is important that those talks continue?  Can I take it that the Government would not support the suspension of those talks in the run up to the British general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government wants to ensure that those talks continue.  It is very important that they continue as they represent the largest assembly of different views and opinions gathered together in <Col N="401" /> recent years to deal with one of the most divisive and difficult conflicts of allegiance in western Europe. Nobody expected that these talks would be easily concluded.  It is very important that they continue and move into the three strands of negotiation.  If we, as a Government, are to have influence in moving them in that direction, it is important that we do not adopt an exclusively one sided approach in regard to matters of the kind referred to.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter with the British Prime Minister.  I said to him that there was widespread disquiet about this matter, arising from recent publications such as the books by Mr. Mullen and Mr. Walsh and the Channel 4 television programme, all of which suggested new evidence, and that a new look at the matter was required.  Furthermore, the evidence from Dr. Maclean about the trajectory of the bullets calls into question the official version of events.  It is very clear that the people who were shot were entirely innocent of any wrongdoing and they deserve an unambiguous apology for the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Prime Minister indicated to me that he would take a fresh look at any evidence presented.  I said that the Irish Government would assemble evidence and present it.  He undertook to look at that evidence.  In light of that evidence, it will be then a matter for decision on what the next step should be.  Perhaps a further inquiry might be the appropriate course but that may not be necessary if the evidence is <Col N="402" /> sufficiently clear to persuade the British Government to do what is necessary to assuage the concerns of the relatives.  I hope that satisfactory outcome will be reached.  As I said in the House in reply to questions on three consecutive days, I intend to pursue this matter vigorously and consistently.</P>

      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing GNP, GDP and GNDI <i>per capita</i> for Ireland in 1995. The statement shows the relevant figures, both on the basis published nationally, following the introduction of an updated methodology for the national income report last year, and also on the former ESA79 basis which is used by member states for reporting results to the EU Commission. The figures are preliminary estimates and will be updated over the next couple of years as further annual reports on national income and expenditure are published.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Does he agree that, while our productivity per head of population may now be well ahead of that in Britain and Northern Ireland, as was recently stated in the House by the Minister for Finance, living standards and personal disposable income still have a long way to go?  Will he confirm that is the case?  Does he agree that until the disparity in tax rates between Ireland and Northern Ireland and the UK is ironed out we will have great difficulty in catching up with these statistics?</P>

      <P>I agree that we are straying into the area of policy.  However, the figures speak for themselves.  For example, the national definition of GNP <i>per capita</i> in 1995 was £9,394; GDP was £10,733 and GNDI was £9,703.  Using the old basis of ESA79, which is to be updated shortly, GNP was £9,636, GDP was £11,155 and GNDI was £9,945.  Comparison with other countries is the subject of the next question.  I will be glad to give the comparative figures on that basis.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question in relation to the table of the regions refers to the income <i>per capita</i> in those regions, which is the subject he addressed by way of supplementary question.</P>
      <P>The latest definitive EU comparative figures for GDP <i>per capita</i> at regional level relate to 1993.  I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing GDP <i>per capita</i> for Ireland, Northern Ireland and the regions with the UK for the year 1993.</P>
      <P>GDP <i>per capita</i> in Ireland in 1993 was £13,191; it was £15,717 in the United Kingdom and £12,559 in Northern Ireland.  We are pitched between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I am sure the Deputy does not want to go into the statistics now, but the table also shows the regional breakdown.  In terms of GDP <i>per capita</i> in 1993, based on the EUR of 15 equalling 100, Ireland rates 83, while the United Kingdom rates 99 and Northern Ireland rates 79.</P>

      <P>I am glad these figures do not relate to a company in which my personal money is tied up because we are being given 1993 figures in the spring of 1997.  I do not expect the Minister of State to physically collect the figures himself but perhaps he could tell me why such basic economic data, which should be available for 1995, is so back dated?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State ask the CSO to give us the GNDI <i>per capita</i> figures for the UK and Northern Ireland for 1995?  Figures from 1993 are far removed from what I was looking for.  There is no point is using figures which date back so far.</P>

Rather it is an integrated Operational Programme, agreed with the European Union, and it will be supported through the Structural Funds until 1999.  It is designed to help communities in targeted urban areas to tackle their problems through working with their local authority, State agencies and social partners.</P>
      <P>As announced previously, some £21 million will be available, over the life of the programme, for the three urban areas, that is Ballymun-Finglas-Darndale, west Tallaght-Clondalkin and the northside of Cork City.

In relation to the second part of the question, I agree fully with the Deputy in this matter.

I have asked each partnership company to confirm to my Department that that is in place.  Where there is consultation <Col N="407" /> and involvement with public representatives, the public representatives are the best advocates but where they are ignored they certainly take an alternative view.  When something is funded by the Exchequer or the EU there should be consultation with public representatives. I agree fully with the spirit of the Deputy's question and I have taken action to try to deal with it.  I will be happy, at some stage in the future, to report progress to the Deputy.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The very strong performance of the economy stimulated by the policies of this Government has been reflected in a similarly strong growth in employment across all the regions as reported in the recent labour force survey. This has been supported by the work of the industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department, who have been recording unprecedented levels of job creation.</P>
      <P>I am fully conscious of the need for regional dispersal of industrial investment and the corresponding new job opportunities.  This is a core element of the statutory mandates of the industrial development agencies and, while I am satisfied that they are not overlooking this aspect in carrying out developmental activities, I have emphasised the importance I and the Government attach to this with the relevant chief executives. I have also focused particularly on this issue in my recent addresses to the annual staff conferences of both IDA Ireland and Forbairt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To achieve a better regional distribution of jobs across the country requires a strong co-operative approach between the development agencies, local authorities and infrastructure and services providers.  For its part, the IDA in 1997 is favouring locations outside the larger urban centres in every way it can, including with higher grant levels as appropriate; with the involvement of private sector investors, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations; and working <Col N="408" /> closely with local authorities to have available quality sites at priority locations for new industrial investment.</P>
    <P>Forbairt also has a specific regional mandate and its organisational structures reflect this.  That so much of its work involves helping existing Irish companies to develop their potential, and helping start-up projects throughout the country, means that it is in a sense more suited to the regional development task than IDA Ireland, which must respond to a competitive international marketplace. In this regard, Forbairt's specific activities in the area of links, technology transfer and a strengthening of executive resources in the regions to focus on the services sector are all geared to maximising development potential at regional level.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development is the embodiment of regional development and has over the years piloted many valuable initiatives in this regard.  My officials are currently exploring with them whether there are ways to tap the potential of smaller mobile investment projects not currently targeted which might be more amenable to locating in areas outside the larger urban centres.</P>
    <P>County enterprise boards were established precisely to ensure there was a balance of small enterprise at local level throughout the country as a counterpoint to the increasing trend of bigger investment projects to be concentrated on the larger population centres.  With 7,711 full-time and 1,624 part-time jobs created in 6,061 projects assisted by 35 boards up to the end of 1996, across the length and breadth of the land, their value and success in this regard cannot be overestimated.</P>
    <P>However, there are clear constraints on our ability to direct investments to particular locations.  There is a fundamental shift in the mix of IDA's business in recent years.  More than half of all job creating investment are not mobile because they come from existing overseas companies expanding their operations and these companies usually expand on their existing site. Second, many of the new technology based and large scale investments have requirements that can only be met near larger urban centres.  If Ireland as a country does not provide the support services, infrastructure and logistics they require at or near large urban centres, they will go elsewhere in Europe.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, having had the discipline and resourcefulness to put policies in place which have led to the current levels of economic and employment growth, we must now find the ingenuity to ensure there is a reasonable spread of the economic benefits deriving from that growth.  I have accordingly asked the agencies to look at the scope for a greater dispersal of industrial investment projects in the context of the fact that choice of location is ultimately a matter for the promoter, responsible use of Exchequer resources and maximising the input and contribution of local interests.</P>

      <P>My question related to the IDA, not to Forbairt, the county enterprise boards etc.  On the greater regional distribution of new employment, is the Minister aware of generally available statistics which show that of the 17,000 jobs announced by the IDA in 1996, 71 per cent were in Dublin, 7 per cent were in Cork and 6 per cent were in Limerick, while there were none in the midlands and the west and 152 of the new projects announced for the west in 1996 were for existing industries?  In 1995 80 per cent of new overseas industrial projects were located in four major cities and this increased to 89 per cent in 1996.  What does the Minister intend to do about the IDA's clear Pale mentality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer only to the IDA, but to regional distribution and new employment. The labour force survey clearly reveals a better regional spread in employment creation in all regions during the past two years than during the previous two years.  There has been an improvement in employment performance in all regions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the IDA position.  I am surprised she quoted announcement figures as she is usually very sceptical of these.  Suggestions that one year's figures for the IDA summarise the regional position are very misleading.  The approach adopted by the Government has led to the creation of employment not only by overseas industry and the manufacturing sector but also by indigenous industry and various areas in the service and tourism sectors.  The overall picture shows there is a very strong regional spread.</P>
      <P>I also recognise, however, that the IDA must take particular cognisance of the need for a regional spread.  I have specifically discussed this matter with the chief executives of the IDA and Forbairt and their executives in other areas with a view to achieving a better regional spread.  This is part of their mandate and the Government is eager to make progress in this area.</P>

      <P>The IDA is not the entire story in the regional employment strategy.  There has been a very good regional spread in employment performance during the past two years, with all regions experiencing substantial employment growth.  There is a need for balance in this debate and I can give the Deputy figures which show the very strong performance not only by county enterprise boards and indigenous industries but also by the service and tourism sectors which have contributed to the overall balanced employment performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Credit Union Bill, published before Christmas, will consolidate existing credit union legislation and set out an updated framework for the development and regulation of the credit union movement.  The terms and scope of the Bill were the subject of detailed discussions over a number of years culminating in a broad measure of agreement between the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  I have had six formal meetings with ILCU representatives since taking responsibility for this Bill.  In addition, I addressed each of the last two AGMs of the league.</P>
      <P>The published Bill contains certain changes from the broad agreement arrived at between the league and the registrar.  In some cases these arose from policy decisions made by me about certain provisions, including ceilings on holdings in shares and deposits and on loans.  In other cases, the parliamentary draftsman, supported by the Attorney General, decided that for legal or technical reasons the wording which formed part of the agreement with the league was not appropriate or workable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as published, offers a number of improvements for credit unions and their members.  First, the existing shares limit of £6,000, set in the mid-1980s, is being increased to £20,000, an effective doubling of the limit in real terms. Second, the Bill meets the long standing demand of the credit union movement to expand the range of services offered by credit unions to their members.  Third, it updates and consolidates existing legislation in a variety of areas, many of which were identified by the movement as out of date.  While the league has raised some concerns, it should also be stated that the league board has <Col N="411" /> generally welcomed the Bill and specifically welcomed many of its features.</P>
    <P>Following Government approval to publish the Bill, I met the board members of the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Credit Union Advisory Committee on 18 December last.  General appreciation was expressed for the clearance of the Bill by the Government.  I invited the league and the advisory committee to study the Bill and make their views known to me.</P>
    <P>At further meetings with the league on 22 January and with individual credit unions, concerns were expressed to me about certain aspects of the Bill.  I also spoke and took questions at the open session of the league's special general meeting in Limerick on 26 January at which I heard at first hand the comments of many credit union representatives on the Bill.  I have made it known that I will consider well reasoned arguments for change or improvement to the Bill, but generally we have got the balance right.  I have also indicated my preparedness to review the published ceiling for loans.  I anticipate that it will be some weeks before any specific changes I might propose to the Bill will be available.  I have recently arranged for officials of my Department, together with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, to meet regularly with league representatives this month to review the Bill.  I also expect to receive the advice of the Credit Union Advisory Committee on its terms shortly.</P>
    <P>The Bill safeguards the social and mutual purpose to which the credit union movement is dedicated and underlines its community self-help principles.  I am determined it should achieve a good balance, facilitating the growth and development of credit unions without undermining the essential character and ethos of the movement as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the concerns expressed by the credit union movement about the proposed changes in the regulatory structure?  Previously credit unions regulated themselves and did so very efficiently and with stunning success over many years.  However, there is considerable concern about the regulatory structure proposed in the Bill.  What is the Minister's view on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy correctly stated, the credit union movement had stunning success in terms of the prudential supervision of its members' investments over the years.  However, the credit union movement has grown beyond all expectations over the past 30 years and will grow further after the enactment of the Bill.  Already they have approximately £1.3 billion in savings and 1.4 million members throughout the country. It is important, therefore, that the regulatory environment is such that credit union members can be assured the prudential supervision of their affairs is beyond doubt.  There is merit in having a watchdog of the State, in the person of the <Col N="412" /> Registrar of Friendly Societies, to do that.  The point Deputy O'Rourke makes is probably more related to the credit union movement's objections to what it sees as the day to day intrusion of the Registrar into the way it manages its affairs as distinct from the regulatory provisions as we know them in certain other areas.  I have invited the credit unions to enter discussions with my officials and the Registrar directly to see whether I can make changes in that area.  I would be minded to do that but, having regard to what we have seen elsewhere in the financial services sector, and acknowledging the exceptional record of the credit union movement, I want to ensure we would not be vulnerable to the kind of incidents we have seen elsewhere in the financial services sector.</P>

      <P>I am also conscious of the need for a balance as we are currently examining what can only be described as extraordinary carry-on in another financial sector.  The Minister of State is correct in that I was referring to the day to day intrusion and over-regulatory approach by the Registrar of Friendly Societies, particularly when such a regime never obtained for credit unions and having regard to the fact that the Registrar is strapped for resources.  I want to put two brief points to the Minister of State.  The first concerns the element of voluntarism which was always at the heart of the work of credit unions; people joined them voluntarily and worked for the mutual good of their members and one another.  Will the Minister of State ensure that spirit is expressed in the new legislation, although I realise that will be difficult if it becomes too obtrusive in everyday matters?  The second point is one that has been put strongly to me by members of credit unions in the midlands region and concerns the use of buildings.  Many credit unions have moved into new buildings, put them in proper order and rented them to enterprise groups or other well meaning groups helping the community.</P>

      <P>The notion of my squeezing out Deputy Harney in any context would never enter my mind.  First, there is a misunderstanding of the Bill as it relates to buildings.  I am satisfied as a result of the meeting in Limerick that I can satisfy the requirements of the credit union movement as it relates to the management of buildings for their use.  There is no problem in that regard. Second, on the point of voluntarism, everything in the Bill is designed to protect that principle and others that have been at the heart of the credit union movement over the years.  Third, additional staff have been provided for in the Government decision to support the work of the Registrar; when the Bill was approved by Cabinet it approved the provision of additional staff. Fourth, it is the expectation of the league that the 2,500 people currently employed in credit unions throughout the country are likely to increase to approximately 5,000 within a few years.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's definition, if any, of what constitutes low paid employment in the context of Irish industrial policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no definition of what constitutes low paid employment in the context of Irish industrial policy.  I am conscious of the interaction between the attractiveness of lower paid employment and the relative level of social welfare entitlements, the existence of both poverty traps and the tax wedge having been the subject of much analysis and debate in recent times.</P>
      <P>Concerted and determined Government action has been taken to address those problems in successive budgets and in a variety of ways with a view to making it easier to create a job and more attractive to take one up.  Such initiatives have included improvements in income tax and employers' and employees' PRSI, the family income supplement and the retention of social welfare benefits in the context of the back to work scheme and the local employment service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> In ensuring that those seeking work will be willing to take up employment at wage levels employers can afford, these initiatives also help businesses to face the competitive challenge from lower cost locations.  Having said that, however, the overall success of Government policy in raising living standards to European levels means we cannot hope to compete in the long-term on cost alone, and a variety of programmes are in place to facilitate industry to cope with this problem by moving up the value chain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not generalise in that way.  A variety of wage levels are being paid in our economy and we must be conscious of that. We must ensure that the interaction of the tax and welfare codes does not unwittingly create situations where it is impossible to find employment. That has been a consistent theme in what the Ministers for Social Welfare and Finance have done in reforming the social welfare and tax codes.  The Minister for Social Welfare has introduced major improvements in the family income supplement which makes it more attractive to take up employment.  He developed the back to work scheme which has facilitated the long-term unemployed taking up employment in addition to a number of other measures we are supporting. On the other side of the equation, the Government has reduced employers' and employees' PRSI as part of a process of making it easier to create employment.  A balance must be taken in ensuring that job opportunities can be filled and employers can be competitive in respect of the wages those jobs secure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept &mdash; I am sure some of the representative organisations such as SFA and ISME have made this point to him already &mdash; that many employers believe the Department of Social Welfare is their greatest competitor; they cannot afford to compete with the levels of remuneration given to people, particularly those with dependants?  Will the Minister accept also that £200 per week is low pay, yet we take almost £50 per week from a single person earning that salary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Small Firms Association has complained about the interaction of tax and social welfare.  Addressing that problem has been a recurring theme in this Government's previous budgets, and significant progress has been made in that area.  For example, employers' PRSI has been significantly reduced to a point where two-thirds of all employees are on the 8.5 per cent rate of social insurance. Equally, we have reduced the employees' share with the £80 allowance and the reduction in the rate from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent.  Those specific <Col N="415" /> measures make it more rewarding for individuals who take up work paying the salary to which the Deputy referred.  I am conscious also that this year's budget has been targeted specifically at low levels of pay and rewarding people on low levels of pay.  For example, a married couple with four children and one earner in the household, taxed at the rate referred to by the Deputy, gets a net gain from the budget of £754 or a 6 per cent increase in net income.  A conscious effort was made when introducing the social welfare and tax reforms to specifically target the groups to which the Deputy referred and I have no doubt further progress can be made in this area.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>if he intends to launch a fresh investigation into the spiralling cost of motor insurance following the 10 per cent increase in premiums since November 1996; and his findings in relation to the bearing investment income has on insurers' underwriting targets.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3112/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I question the Deputy's assertion that the cost of motor insurance is spiralling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer him to the reply which I gave to the House on 22 October 1996 in relation to an increase in insurance premiums by Guardian PMPA which has 30 per cent of the market.  That increase was of the order of 5 per cent on average with effect from 1 November 1996 and I cited the reasons given for the increase by the company at that time.  However, for the benefit of the House, I will reiterate that the insurer in question had stated that deteriorating road accident statistics during the course of 1996 will lead to an increase in the number of claims and a consequential increase in the overall cost of claims.  To make adequate provision to meet this rising cost, the company decided it was necessary to generate additional premium income in the form of an increase in its premium charges.  There were premium rate reductions announced by this company <Col N="418" /> of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent during the course of 1995 and early 1996.</P>
    <P>The other major insurer, the Hibernian Group, with 12 per cent market share has recently announced a 4.8 increase in premiums which, according to the company, will affect up to 60 per cent of its customers.  That company has also stated that, as part of a rebalancing of its risk portfolio, it will reduce rates for some categories of mature motorists.  Furthermore, it has indicated that young people as named drivers on family insurance policies will get more favourable rates under this new pricing structure.  Customers who have other insurance policies with Hibernian will be offered discounts of up to 10 per cent on their motor insurance.  The Hibernian Group has cited a 12 per cent rise in the number of claims arising from motor accidents as necessitating an increase in premiums and has made reference to the fact that in its experience the younger male driver continues to pose a bigger risk than those of more mature age.</P>
    <P>With regard to accident rates, figures produced by the Garda Síochána for the 12 month period October 1995 to October 1996 indicate that, on a provisional basis, there was a 6.6 per cent increase in injuries incurred and an increase of the same order in road accident fatalities.  Unfortunately, over the Christmas holiday period, the figures showed a 50 per cent increase in injuries over the corresponding period in 1995.  These disappointing statistics must inevitably result in higher motor insurance costs in 1997, especially for those drivers at fault and for the categories of driver which the accident statistics indicate are a higher risk.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has raised the question of the relationship between insurers' investment income and their underwriting targets.  The issue of insurers' investment income strategy in relation to underwriting targets is a fundamental and complex question involving solvency and profitability considerations.  The Deloitte and Touche report suggested that the supervisory authority might review the relevancy or the efficacy of taking into account investment income and its bearing on insurers' underwriting targets and their consequent effects on insurance costs.</P>
    <P>The insurance annual report for 1995, the Blue Book, provides for the first time a company by company indication of attributable investment income related to specific classes of insurance. The new Blue Book information showed motor insurance business for some major underwriters to be quite profitable, with premium and investment income considerably exceeding underwriting costs.  The implication was that this class of business might be considerably healthier as a class of business than Governments and supervisors had previously been led to believe.  Accordingly, I requested that an examination be undertaken of the annual returns of insurance companies for the previous ten years on the basis of the new reporting formula.</P>
    <P>While complete figures for previous years are <Col N="419" /> not available from all insurers, preliminary analysis of the figures received shows that annual investment returns have been very volatile. Investment income fluctuates for a variety of reasons, such as movements in the level of claims reserves, interest rate movements and investment strategy.</P>
    <P>The compulsory disclosure of investment income by class of business from 1995 onwards, together with the results of the Department's own examination of the last ten years, will provide greater transparency for the purpose of assessing the overall profitability of the various types of insurance and of the individual companies, especially in the context of insurance premium levels.  It is my intention that this increased transparency should provide a valuable basis for the Department to evaluate the contribution of investment income, its bearing on insurers' underwriting targets and the consequent effects on insurance costs, as recommended by the Deloitte and Touche report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has often spoken about young drivers and referred to them in his reply.  What investment income is derived from premiums paid by young drivers and what is the cost of claims in which young drivers are involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the preliminary findings of the review referred to in the Deputy's question, the motor insurance market incurred underwriting losses, before investment income is taken into account, in all of the years from 1984 to 1995.  Underwriting losses decreased steadily from 1989 to 1995, but remained high at £41 million in 1995.  Investment returns are volatile and fluctuate for a variety of reasons, such as movements in the level of claims reserves, interest rate movements and investment strategy.  The overall results of motor business, after allowing for investment income, showed that while substantial profits were made in some years, substantial losses were recorded in others.</P>
      <P>The performance of individual insurers differs widely.  Even in those years when investment income was at a high level, some insurers failed to earn sufficient income in their claims reserves to offset their underwriting losses.  I do not have figures, not am I aware if there are any, for the impact of investment income on the specific category of young drivers to which the Deputy refers. However, the frequency of accidents, and the cost of the claims, put young male drivers in a category of their own.  That is the single factor most frequently quoted by the insurance industry for the disproportionately high cost of claims.</P>

What plans does he have to appoint an inspector from his Department to investigate the motor insurance industry? <Col N="420" /> What are his plans to improve the position of young drivers and to implement the Ontario model, where young drivers are assessed, undertake a series of classes and are only allowed daytime driving prior to being phased into full-time driving?</P>

If there is seen to be a response they give the benefit to the insured.</P>
      <P>An expert group is concerned with the question of a personal injuries tribunal.  It has set itself the end of February as a report date and I have no information that it does not intend to meet this date.  I hope this will have an impact on the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Deloitte and Touche report I have written and spoken to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, who is responsible for tackling the specific matter raised by the Deputy.  The Minister announced a number of initiatives under the aegis of his Department, which is examining this question.</P>
      <P>I have detailed the position regarding the general outcry at premium increases.  For example, the major insurer in the country announced substantial reductions in 1995 and 1996.  The increase of 5 per cent, effective from 1 November, was introduced to reflect the anticipated claims pattern arising from the deteriorating road accidents situation in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of disquiet that accident rates have increased.  Detailed figures show that, in comparison to the same period in 1995, road fatalities in the first ten months of 1996 increased by 23. These figures may not have a direct bearing on claims and their cost but the number of injuries on the roads over the same period increased by 542.  This is a more telling statistic in regard to claims costs.  Fatalities on the roads over the 1996 Christmas period decreased from seven to four. However, in comparison to the same period in 1995, injuries increased from 120 to 181.  These statistics are supported by the Garda Síochána and are relied on by the insurers in terms of prudentially providing to meet anticipated claims. <Col N="421" /> Unfortunately, nobody would have anticipated that pattern which is very disquieting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the number of accidents and the fact that young males are in a separate category, are there statistics which prove that Irish young people are more dangerous drivers than young drivers in other EU countries?  If that is case and it results in higher insurance costs, does the Department have a policy to address that issue and ensure we have safer drivers? Many insurance companies have branches in other EU countries and it would be a worthwhile exercise to see if there are more dangerous drivers in Ireland, which results in higher costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics isolate the category of young drivers as the main offenders in this area. Further statistics isolate young male drivers as excessively at risk, while other figures show the pattern is worse in Ireland than in other European Union countries.  I explained earlier to Deputy O'Keeffe that specific measures in this regard are predominantly within the remit of the Minister for the Environment and I referred to initiatives he has taken.  However, ultimately, it is difficult to combat an excess of testosterone, which is a contributing factor.</P>

    <P>For example, it is generally accepted by both sides of industry that the employment appeals tribunal, <Col N="422" /> with which the Deputy is familiar as she previously had responsibility for it, provides a more informal, speedy and less costly system of disputes resolution in the areas which fall within its remit.  Similarly in this area, where liability is not contested, the idea is that it would be a more flexible and faster mechanism to remove some of the cases from the court system entirely.  It is a complex area and this is why it was considered necessary to establish an expert group to advise the Government on how it should be implemented.  The intention is that it will make a contribution, remove cases from the court system and allow for a more flexible and speedy resolution.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>if he is concerned at the decrease in the numbers working in the clothing manufacturing industry; the plans, if any, he has to reverse this trend; and the numbers employed in the industry in each of the years 1965, 1975, 1985 and 1995.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2904/97].</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of the numbers employed in the clothing manufacturing industry in respect of the end of year periods requested by the Deputy are as follows: 1965, 23,000; 1975, 21,100; 1985, 16,300; 1995, 13,700</P>
      <P>The considerable drop in employment since 1965 is naturally very disappointing.  It must be recognised, however, that the clothing sector has undergone enormous changes and major restructuring over the past 30 years.  Clothing manufacturers in Ireland, in common with clothing manufacturers in other member states in the European Union, have incurred serious casualties arising from the rationalisation of the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clothing sector has always been, and continues to be very labour intensive.  However, the ethos and structure of the industry have changed radically over the years.  This was imperative to survive in a constantly changing climate.  The sector has had to cope with both dramatic and traumatic changes.  These include the effects of Ireland's accession into the EC, high inflation during the 1970's which led to substantial pay increases, completion of the internal market, increasing liberalisation of trade, currency fluctuations and changing market demands.  The competition <Col N="424" /> from low cost supplier countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the Far East in particular, has posed a major problem for the sector.</P>
    <P>The clothing industry, when faced with these challenges recognised that it had to undergo a radical restructuring process if it were to survive and remain a dynamic force in Irish manufacturing. It was widely accepted that the key to the sector's future was in its ability to become competitive. Unfortunately, not all clothing manufacturers survived the changes in the competitive environment and some were forced out of business with a consequential loss of jobs.  The sector, however, has made great strides in its restructuring drive.  A substantial number of manufacturers have moved away from traditional manufacturing methods in favour of quality and a quick response to customers' needs.  The introduction of world class manufacturing, new design technology and improved training measures have aided the sector in its competitive drive and helped many firms to secure a niche in the market which is less vulnerable to competition from low priced European and Asian exports.</P>
    <P>My Department and the industrial development agencies have made concerted efforts to encourage the sector to reorganise and rationalise. A number of initiatives have been put in place over the past few years.  During 1993-4 the sector benefited significantly from a specific research and development measure and a special FÁS training support scheme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that in May 1996, I launched a major initiative specifically for the clothing sector aimed at improving competitiveness and thereby increasing profitability in individual companies.  This initiative resulted from a co-ordinated approach by Forbairt, the Irish Clothing Manufacturers Federation, other industry representative bodies and my Department. It represents a highly significant and realistic effort to facilitate the process of building strong clothing companies capable of competing on both domestic and international markets thereby reducing the incidence of company closures and associated job losses.</P>
    <P>The main element of the initiative is the competitive improvement programme which will enable companies which meet the relevant criteria to implement specific business plans and action programmes.  This programme has been devised for the clothing sector as part of the EU funded CHANGE Programme which is designed to assist companies in traditional sectors of industry to adjust to competition.</P>
    <P>As well as benefiting under these various initiatives, the sector has also availed of other EU funded schemes in recent years, particularly under the RETEX programme.  While this is a horizontal measure aimed at reducing the dependency of particular regions on the clothing and textile sectors, some of the measures are appropriate in facilitating the necessary adjustment of commercially viable textile and clothing firms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> These initiatives are regarded as the best way forward.  The Government's commitment to address the issue of cost competitiveness which is vital for the future of the sector has been reflected in the last two budgets.  There has been substantial reform of both employers and employees PRSI, as well as a reduction in the income tax take.  These existing initiatives are designed to enable Irish clothing companies to overcome the intensity of competitive pressures and, combined with the full support of Government and the development agencies, it is hoped the industry can secure a long-term viable future.</P>

      <P>I would have preferred to have question No. 26 answered, but that is the luck of the draw.  I appreciate that because of our membership of the European Union traditional industries such as the clothing industry and the car assembly industry were bound to suffer &mdash; we were told that in advance.  I tabled the question as a result of an interview I heard with a member of the clothing industry last week who pointed out that he finds it very difficult to compete with Far Eastern manufacturers.  Has the Minister a specific strategy in mind to combat the problem of low cost imports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of low cost imports has been negotiated in the context of the GATT. We are in the process of reforming the multi-fibre agreements over the period to the year 2005, which will see a progressive opening up of European markets.  That is an inevitable development which is part of our world trade commitment.  In that context the approach taken by the federation and the industry interests together with Forbairt, of concentrating on areas where they can improve the competitiveness of the industry by improving technology and computer aided design and getting into niches where they can withstand competitive pressures, is the only way forward.  There are vibrant and thriving sectors within the industry which demonstrate that strategy succeeds.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to know what will happen next in regard to the report of a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I have only had an opportunity to have a brief word with Deputy Dempsey, the Fianna Fáil nominee on the sub-committee.  Can I take it that following moving the motion here, the report will be laid in the Library, that this is an interim <Col N="428" /> report and a more detailed one covering other matters will be completed at some stage in the future, that the committee will meet next week and Report Stage of the compellability Bill will be taken?  Last week I said I would like to get to the bottom of this, but we appear to be taking one step forward and three back.  Will the Taoiseach suggest some orderly way to proceed?  My views on what should have happened in the first place are on record.  I want to work with the committee of the House on this matter, but the process in this regard appears to be long drawn out.</P>
      <P>From the brief explanation I received from Deputy Dempsey, it appears 63 per cent of the names are not identified.  Presumably that means the other names can be identified, but only a handful are named in the report.  Given that we have waited more than two months for that handful of names to be revealed, how long will we have to wait for all the names in the barrel to be revealed?

      <P>I agree with what Deputy Ahern said.  The procedure established by the Government to inquire into the Dunnes Stores' payments is a nonsense.  It will not go anywhere.  The compellability Bill is stalled pending Government amendments and even when it becomes an Act people will be entitled to legally challenge it.  The only way we will get to the truth is by establishing a tribunal of inquiry along the lines of the hepatitis C tribunal.  Many of us spent two years in this House trying to get basic information about the hepatitis C scandal and it took the tribunal a matter of weeks to put the truth before us.  I urge the Taoiseach and the Government to set up a tribunal along similar lines on this matter to ensure the cloud that hangs over public life can be lifted once and for all.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of considerable importance that the cloud that hangs over public life should be dissipated quickly.  On receipt of this report, the Government will study it and will make decisions quickly.  It is very important that there be a quick determination of the ultimate <Col N="429" /> procedure to be used to get all the relevant information into the public domain, that the final decision as to the form of that be taken quickly and not postponed.  I have not seen the report, but from what I have heard I believe it presents the result of valuable work.  This report does not complete the inquiry as one would have expected, but it has presented the raw material for inquiry. It is a matter of urgency that we proceed to deal with the matter.  I intend we will do that.  The Government will consider this matter promptly with a view to making the requisite decisions to take the matter forward.</P>

We will co-operate with it in any way possible.  Judge Buchanan's work involved dealing with what was in the Price Waterhouse report, but we have moved on since then.  Under the rules of the sub-committee Deputy Dempsey was unable to show me the report, but told me the first page of it dealt with affidavits Judge Buchanan sought but was not able to receive, about which everyone has been talking and about which I read weeks ago. Will the Taoiseach and the Government, through the Attorney General and the legal aids available to the State, find a way to deal with this matter. There is agreement in the public domain that we want this matter dealt with.  I said that on 4 December, but we are now into February.  The matter should be dealt with.

The method we have taken, commissioning Mr. Justice Buchanan to do preliminary work, was the right and most economical way of doing that part of the work. At this stage, other methods may be necessary to bring the matter to finality.  I am determined to bring the matter to finality as promptly as possible so that everybody's reputation can be treated fairly.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for not guillotining or forcing through the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill, 1995.  All Members dealing with Committee Stage for the last few weeks appreciate that that was necessary, despite the fact that perhaps it would be necessary for this particular committee.  What are the Government's intentions for the Bill and when is it to be taken?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach seems to be suggesting that there are other ways to look at this issue.  Is the Government's intending to look at the tribunal route?</P>

      <P>Henceforth we must move with expedition to finalise the matter.  I appreciate what the Deputy has said about the Compellability Bill.  It is important to note that this legislation has been known to be necessary by every Government since 1970.  It was in 1970 that the Committee of Public Accounts was unable to do its work because of the lack of that legislation. Now, in 1997, this Government has introduced it and intends to pass it.</P>
      <P>It is also important to enact that legislation in a manner that is fair to everybody and that does not allow a Star Chamber to be established in the House but that allows a fair and full pursuit of required information in a just way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  Many people in County Mayo were annoyed last summer when they read letters in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i> by somebody from Dublin who had visited the county and saw that rubbish bins had not been emptied.  Mayo County Council has made every effort over the years to keep beaches and towns as tidy as possible.  I had intended to respond to that person at the time but I let it go. However, that person was not critical of the people who left litter on these beaches.  Some of them came from other parts of the country, and not all from County Mayo.</P>
      <P>I am annoyed by people who go to the beach for the day, particularly with young children, and change napkins, which council workmen have to go out next day to pick up.  Why will these people not bring a bag to dispose of them when they go home through the refuse service provided in their area?  I cannot understand why that cannot be done and why they expect Mayo County Council to clean up these beautiful beaches after them. The council does not destroy these beaches; it is the people using them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council is preparing a draft action plan to <Col N="436" /> deal with litter and hopes to work with the business community, schools and voluntary organisations to try to get this plan up and running.  I congratulate Mid-West radio, particularly Mr. Paul Claffey who has a mid-morning programme. For many months last summer, he sent roving reporters throughout the county to check on the dumping of litter and bags.  His investigators went through these bags until they got the name or names of people who might have been foolish enough to leave a reference by which they could be traced.  It worked well and on many occasions these people had to come back in the middle of the night to collect these bags and dump them. He created awareness and sparked discussion in the county on dumping.  There is no need for people to be dumping black bags and washing machines because in most areas a good refuse service is provided by the council or private sources. This Bill will be a waste of time if people caught dumping cannot be brought before the courts and prosecuted.  On-the-spot fines should be provided for in legislation for those who are caught.  The media has a part to play in this.  It must be highlighted locally and nationally.</P>
    <P>There are dog wardens in the county and when that system was introduced people said it would not work.  This Bill will not work if each county does not have a litter warden and if councils are not prepared to provide money to pay them. They must be able to issue fines, bring people before the courts and prosecute them.  It must be simplified and I hope the media will help with this.</P>
    <P>Every county should set up a similar plan to that in County Mayo.  The Bill states that people living within the 30 mile per hour zone in towns and villages have to clean the streets and roads outside their homes.  Every Sunday a priest in my area says that if everybody swept outside their own doors, there would be no problems. However, that does not happen.  The council has a part to play and so does the business community.</P>
    <P>One group of people has upset me for many years because of the late hourse they keep their shops open and the litter they create around their premises.  They get away with murder and it is time legislation was introduced to control their opening hours and to make them clean up outside their places of business.  I am talking about take-away restaurants whose owners make a lot of money.  Some of those in our town stay open until almost 5 a.m. and people are unable to get a decent night's sleep but that is another issue.  No Government has had the courage to take on this group and to stipulate that they should close by 2 a.m., they are allowed to stay open almost until morning if there are people looking for food, and they are allowed to throw their rubbish where they want.  Take-aways should be required by law to have a litter warden in the shop who will clean the street outside after the shop closes.  People going to Mass on Sunday mornings can see that these places are a disgrace.</P>
    <P>Who has to clean up after them?  The councils <Col N="437" /> must provide the staff and do the job.  We hear people talking about doctors and surgeons but probably the worst paid people in the State are council workers.  Many of them would be better off on social welfare but they want to work.  They have raised good families while working hard for the councils over the years, cleaning the streets and collecting refuse.  They must be complemented for doing an excellent job under terrible circumstances.  I have been in local politics since 1979 and at public meetings I have never let anyone criticise our council workmen.  They are badly paid and do a tough job.  When looking for litter wardens under this Bill perhaps we should consider giving council staff an opportunity to take these jobs, because they have gained experience from the service they have given to the councils.  The councils should provide at least one litter warden per county.  While one may not be enough at least it would be a start.</P>
    <P>A man who called himself the &ldquo;Gumbuster&rdquo; was cleaning up chewing gum in Dublin recently. I hope he becomes a millionaire because he was the first man I have seen doing this.  I challenge Members of the House to walk more than five yards down a street in Dublin without seeing chewing gum on the footpath.  This is a terrible habit.  Why do people not put their gum into a piece of paper and throw it in the bin instead of spitting it on the street?  Legislation should be introduced to prosecute people who are caught doing that.  I compliment this man on seeing a niche in the market and setting up his own business. I hope every local authority will give him some work because he deserves to be rewarded for his initiative.  Perhaps the Department of the Environment would notify local authorities about this man so that he can employ a few people.</P>
    <P>The councils also must play a part by providing more litter bins and collecting refuse more often. This will cost money but, in general, people are prepared to pay for a service to collect their rubbish. Private businesses are also willing to invest but they find that while the council is prepared to take on the easier urban business, it expects private companies to go to rural areas.  That should not be the case, there should be a mix. County councils should make a deal with private businesses so that they can make a livelihood.</P>
    <P>I hope that every council does the same as Mayo County Council and draws up a plan to educate young people about litter.  On the way from Mayo this morning I was driving behind an articulated lorry.  Every two minutes the driver was throwing out orange peels and apple cores and hitting my car.  I signalled to him when I overtook him but I will not tell the House what kind of signal he gave me in response.  People must be educated to bring their rubbish home.  Why should this man throw it away when he knows someone else has to pick it up?</P>
    <P>When travelling to Dublin I also observe many dead animals that have been hit by cars or lorries. If I see one when I travel up on Tuesday it is usually still there when I go home on Thursday <Col N="438" /> or Friday.  County councils will have to employ litter wardens so that these animals will not be left to rot for a week.</P>
    <P>I hope every council educates young people in school about litter.  Pupils now have civics classes and they are probably more civic-minded that older people &mdash; we did not get such training when we went to school.  We should set up competitions to make them aware of the environment.  In the next few months Mayo County Council will have writing competitions in which young people will be involved and prizes awarded.  If young people talk and think about litter they will think twice before throwing it away in towns or at the seaside.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The most important provision is the one making each council appoint a litter warden.  If that does not happen the Bill will fail and we will have wasted our time.  The Bill must have some teeth and allow councils to impose on-the-spot fines and bring people to court.  The public must know we will no longer tolerate people dumping litter in towns or at the seaside.  During the summer months people come into Westport and, when the litter bin is full, they will take their rubbish from the boot of the car and leave it on the street.</P>
    <P>People should be more conscious of the environment and not dump rubbish where they like. We have the best county in the world with one of the most beautiful environments, if people would only treat it properly.  Litter does not find its own way onto the street, people dump it there.  Local authorities are providing litter bins, refuse services and tipheads.  Why do people destroy our countryside and beaches or throw chewing gum on the street?  I cannot understand it.  We must put proper legislation in place and indicate that we will not tolerate this any longer and if people are caught they will be prosecuted.  We need more people like Mr. Paul Claffey and the media should highlight the matter.</P>
    <P>All last summer there was a major debate in Mayo about people dumping rubbish throughout the county.  That campaign was successful and after a few weeks the litter problem died away because people knew they were being watched.  If someone knows that his name or initials will be read out over the airwaves for dumping rubbish, he will not do it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Wexford</i>): Having spent some time in the environmental section of the Department of the Environment I welcome the Bill, although it is high on aspirations and intentions and does not have the teeth that it needs in order to deal with the litter problem.  It is frightening that we spend £25 million annually to clean up Ireland yet most Irish people dump litter.  We are wasting money cleaning up the country while people are indiscriminately throwing litter on our highways and byways.  Despite many years of campaigning by the Department of the Environment and by local authorities we seem to have learned no lessons.  When I was in the Department <Col N="439" /> of the Environment, up to £500,000 was being spent on litter campaigns.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, has been involved in such campaigns over the past couple of years, but they have had no major effect.  We are still polluting our beautiful country with litter at an alarming rate.</P>
      <P>What tactics should be adopted in the future to get the message through to people?  It might be a better idea to give local authorities more money to deal with the problem on a county by county basis. Most local authorities have an environmental section to deal with these issues and organise clean-up weeks.  Every year Wexford has a &ldquo;clean up Wexford week&rdquo;, a &ldquo;keep Wexford beautiful&rdquo; campaign, and educational projects in the schools.  Every other county has similar projects. They go part of the way to getting the message across, particularly to young people.  Most people agree that trying to change 40 or 50 year olds is a waste of time.  We should go to the schools and get the message across to people at an early age. Then they will grow up respecting the countryside, their towns, their streets and their homes.  If we do that we will eventually become a litter free country.  There must me something seriously wrong in the Department of the Environment and in the local authorities, and we are not dealing properly with the problem, if having spent £25 million in one year to clean up litter the problem is just as bad the following year.</P>
      <P>The Bill mentions that local authorities will have power to require owner occupiers of any property to take immediate action to remedy littering or to take specified precautionary measures.  It mentions appointing extra litter wardens and involving the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána are under pressure in dealing with crime, vandalism, etc.  To expect them to deal with litter as well is a bit much.  To enable them to get on with the work of protecting people from crime, vandalism, murder, etc., many of their minor duties, for example, collecting fines and checking up on dog licences, should be handed over to local authorities.</P>
      <P>The local authorities find it difficult to deal in a major way with the environment because of lack of funds.  The Minister spoke of having a litter warden in every local authority area, but if this is to be done he will have to make funds available because most local authorities are strapped for cash and are not in a position to appoint litter wardens.  Perhaps when a substantial number of fines have been collected by the local authorities the litter warden will become self-financing.  Instead of spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on the type of campaign we have pursued in the past, the Minister should seriously consider allocating the money to each local authority on a one-off basis to pay a litter warden for the first year, after which it would be the role of the local authority to finance him or her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> The litter problem is caused by people.  It is of major concern that people in Ireland do not seem to be able to adopt a policy like that of other countries and take litter home with them or dispose of it in litter bins or containers provided by local authorities, shops and public bodies.  For some reason best known to themselves, they throw chip bags, crisp bags, cigarette butts, matchboxes, cigarette boxes, etc. on the streets, and have no thought for the concerns of tourism bodies who are trying to encourage people to visit this country.  There is no doubt that it has an impact.  Surveys by Bord Fáilte, by the business associations and others indicate clearly that the greatest criticism of this country by tourists, probably the only real criticism, relates to the littering of our streets.  We should deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>We are developing as a tourism nation and only beginning to attract tourists.  We were very much dependent on farming and other areas of industry but, as those move into decline, there is tremendous potential for growth in tourism.  In fairness to the private and public sectors and successive Governments, they have made major funds available to develop tourism.  In every corner there are new developments that extend our tourism season into the winter and spring, and we must deal with the litter problem if we are to encourage more and more tourists to visit this island.  We have all of the glories that tourists look for &mdash; a green country, clean seas, nice cities and many places that people can visit.  However, there is concern about litter on the streets of our cities, towns and villages.</P>
    <P>I will certainly support the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, in any efforts she makes to deal with this problem.  It is not an easy problem to deal with, because of the major cost.  Wexford County Council recently had a review of the waste management plan for County Wexford.  An executive summary was prepared by Fehily, Timoney, Weston of Cork, and the cost to Wexford County Council of implementing Government policy on waste management over the next five years is frightening.  It will take major expenditure by the council and, at the end of the day, it is the taxpayer who will have to pay.  Therefore, it is incumbent on all of us to minimise litter and waste and to deal with it effectively and in a way that will not impose major costs on the public. The public has a major role to play and must accept its responsibility for dealing with this matter. If people do not accept responsibility for the disposal of waste they will have to pay the local authorities through the nose to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Every contributor has mentioned the problems caused by take-aways.  There is no doubt that chip shops in Dublin and provincial towns, such as Enniscorthy, cause major problems.  They sell their product after discos on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights and the streets are littered with chip bags, chicken boxes and so on the next morning.  The onus must be placed on such people who make large amounts of money.  The <Col N="441" /> majority of take-away owners exploit young people by charging them the highest possible price for a burger and chips.  They make money hand over fist but they will not accept any responsibility for dealing with the litter problem outside their doors.</P>
    <P>There is a number of chip shops near the church in Enniscorthy and on a Sunday morning Cathedral Street, the market square, Slaney Street and Temple Shannon are a disgrace.  They are polluted by plastic bags, chip wrappers and so on.  Criticism is levelled at the local authority for not cleaning the streets on Sunday mornings and making them beautiful for people coming into the town.  I do not see why the local authorities should have to pick up the tab for that.  A compulsory charge should be levied on such outlets to pay the local authority to clean up the litter on Saturdays and Sundays, which are not their normal working days.  Alternatively, the onus should be on take-away owners to clean it up.</P>
    <P>This situation cannot be allowed to continue.  It is not just the case in Enniscorthy &mdash; the streets of every town are littered on Sunday mornings because the owners of take-aways do not accept responsibility.  Most take-away owners do not even provide an adequate bin to encourage people to dispose of their litter.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to deal as toughly as she can with these people under the Bill.  I know that legislation must be fair and equitable. However, these people cause major problems at weekends.  They make vast amounts of money and should be made to pay for cleaning up the litter they cause, particularly at weekends.</P>
    <P>The principle of &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; was adopted by the EU some time ago.  If take-away owners are not prepared to deal with the problem they should have to make funds available to local authorities to deal with it.  We cannot allow our towns and cities to be polluted and then expect tourists to spend money here when they see such filth and dirt in our towns.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister of State to deal with the supermarket chains which have been getting away with murder for many years.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment I tried to deal with the supermarket bosses.  We had a number of meetings to which some of them came reluctantly.  It was very difficult to get any commitment from them, particularly the larger chains.  One or two of the major supermarket chains were very reluctant to get involved in cleaning up their act and usually sent someone to the meetings who was way down the management line.  We were never able to force them to make any major decisions to deal with this problem.  If we are going to deal with the problem of supermarkets littering our countryside with plastic bags, all the supermarket chains must be involved.</P>
    <P>In the region of one billion plastic bags are distributed every year by supermarkets.  Despite their huge pollution potential, very few bags are recycled and most of them end up on council <Col N="442" /> tipheads.  They do not decompose in the same way as paper and other material but stay in the ground for hundreds of years.</P>
    <P>Litter caused by discarded plastic bags from supermarkets is an even bigger headache.  The Minister of State travels from Wicklow on the same road as I do and all along that road one can see supermarket plastic bags in the trees, hedgerows and ditches.  They are extremely unsightly.</P>
    <P>Some of the supermarket chains tried their best to charge for plastic bags.  Feargal Quinn is very involved in the area of recycling and plays a major role in environmental protection. However, if one supermarket chain charges its customers for plastic bags and a rival chain does not, most customers will shop in the other supermarket. If nothing further has happened in that area since early 1994, will the Minister of State try to get all the supermarket chains involved in an environmental protection project to deal with the problem of plastic bags?</P>
    <P>There are alternatives to plastic bags such as reusable cotton shopping bags, cardboard boxes and paper bags.  I ask the Minister to State to encourage the supermarket chains to change to such alternatives as quickly as possible.  Supermarkets control 70 per cent of the domestic shopping market.  They have a major role to play and are uniquely positioned to have a major impact on environmental matters, particularly in relation to the plastic bag problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development on farm plastic recently announced by the Minister.  In 1993 I was involved in a pilot project on plastic recycling in the Minister of State's constituency of Wicklow and my constituency of Wexford through the cooperative movement.  It was successful but it only took place on a very small scale.  We hoped at that time that it would lead to great things.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has been involved with the farm organisations to deal with the problem of farm plastic.  Up to now, farmers have dumped farm plastic in their haggards or backyards. Eventually, the wind blows it onto the roads where it is a major embarrassment to farmers, farm organisations and rural groups which are trying to keep rural areas clean and tidy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative and I hope farmers and farm organisations will play a major role in developing this project.  The litter problem cannot be solved by the Department of the Environment or local authorities on their own but by the public, farm organisations, industry, local authorities and the Department of the Environment working together.  There is no way in which the Department of the Environment or local authorities can continue to fund the cleaning up of litter without support from those who are causing the major litter problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I hope, when enacted, it will contribute to a significant reduction in our litter problem.  I do not believe the absence of law is the problem or that local authorities, as constituted, <Col N="443" /> can be the vehicle to solve this worsening problem.  A whole range of laws give local authorities roles and powers but frequently, the same local authorities are the worst offenders under those laws.  Some of the worst derelict sites are owned either by local authorities or some other statutory agency, such as a health board.  There is a total lack of will and commitment in enforcing the Derelict Sites Act.  Notwithstanding the good intentions of the Litter Pollution Bill it will meet the same fate unless we provide for a sea change of attitude among the local authority management and workforce.  The city of Dublin has reverted to &ldquo;dirty Dublin&rdquo;.  There had been an improvement in the state of the city five or six years ago but it is dirtier now than I can ever remember.</P>
      <P>The shopping centres in the city and suburbs are spotlessly clean compared with the public areas immediately outside.  Local authority management, its workforce and the State have failed the electorate.  This is not just a problem in the high streets, it is a problem in the suburbs, on roadways, in public parks, walkways along rivers and canals.  I am one of many people who walk a great deal.  I walk with my wife and friends and we constantly encounter litter in practically every corner of every park, canal and walkway.  This is a fairly recent phenomenon in some areas.  When we complain to the local authorities they say the problem is caused by a shortage of staff or absenteeism and that their first priority is the bin collection. In other words, in the event of absenteeism or holidays staff is withdrawn from cleaning the streets and asked to do the bin collection because it is absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister inquired how many hours per day the bin men in Dublin work?  What time do they start work?  What time are they supposed to finish work and what time do they actually finish work?  Is there productivity?  Are we paying for a service we are not getting?</P>
      <P>One of the most reliable services in the city is the bin collection service, which usually takes place at the same time each week.  Often, the street cleaners arrive and sweep the streets before the bin collection service.  Despite repeated representations and telephone calls over the years this still happens.  It is something that irritates my wife and my neighbours' wives and all their friends.</P>
      <P>There are hundreds of people employed in the cleansing services in Dublin city and in the three administrative county councils.  I do not believe we are getting productivity from the service.  We are getting a good bin collection service but are we getting eight hours work per day from the workers?  Are staff who should be cleaning the streets diverted to the bin collection service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in favour of privatisation.  I have great respect for the public service and many of the traditions of the public service.  My fellow constituents throughout Dublin are deeply offended, <Col N="444" /> annoyed and irritated by the litter problem in the city and ultimately they blame the Government.</P>
    <P>For many years I was a representative for the Dublin West constituency.  We had a by-election in that constituency following the untimely death of our belated colleague, Brian Lenihan senior.  I was given the job for my party as director of elections in that constituency which I had left five years previously.  I was horrified at the state of the public areas, the streets and open spaces of the housing estates.  When canvassing in that area I said if I was living in those estates I would not vote for the Government candidates.  In the by-election not only did they not vote for the Government candidates but they did not vote for the established party candidates.  A huge percentage of the vote went to non-established independents or parties.  I do not blame the people because they are not getting public services of a standard which they rightly expect.  They say that if local authorities are not doing their job, ultimately it is a matter for the Government.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons no outgoing Government has been returned to power since 1969 is a growing dissatisfaction with Government over certain public services.  Many people regard the litter issue as one of the chronic problems in the State and ask what can you expect from &ldquo;the politicians&rdquo;&mdash; to use that infamous and irritating generic phrase.  They feel they will not get results from us, &ldquo;the politicians&rdquo;.  The reality is that despite having Governments of different hues in the past number of years and growing prosperity, there is no parallel improvement in the cleanliness of our streets, parks and open spaces.  The public should not expect the litter problem will be completely eliminated after the enactment of the Bill as other measures are also required.</P>
    <P>I am not a supporter of privatisation &mdash; I greatly respect the public service which is very good at carrying out many functions &mdash; but if local authority cleaning departments are not carrying out their functions then consideration must be given to dividing areas and awarding contracts for this work to private companies.  One or two contracts may be awarded to cleaning departments but it is important to award the majority of contracts to private companies so that there is some assessment of performance.</P>
    <P>We must urgently consider privatising this area as the culture in local authority cleaning departments does not allow for the radical and urgent change demanded by the public.  I say this because of the stark contrast between the cleanliness of busy private sector shopping centres and malls and the amount of litter in some public sector areas.  If those in the private sector did not keep their areas clean they would lose customers. In a sense, the Government is losing customers because of the appalling inefficiency of the public service in this area.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about the effectiveness of this legislation if there is not the necessary political will to ensure its enforcement.  We do not have to wait for the enactment of the Bill to seek <Col N="445" /> improvements.  Ireland is one of the major tourism destinations in Europe yet reference is constantly made to the dirt of many areas.  At a meeting last night some of my constituents told me an English person they met at a sports gathering the previous day had stated loudly in front of everyone, &ldquo;you Irish are a dirty lot&rdquo;.  What he said is true, not because the problem is impossible to deal with or we are endemically dirty but rather because we are allowed to be.</P>
    <P>In addition to the employment of more street cleaners for eight hours a day, there must be better management and supervision and more litter bins of an appropriate size and design must be provided in all areas.  While certain litter bins are appropriate in some areas they may not be appropriate in others.  For example, it should be made mandatory for litter bins outside schools to be of a type and design which are not easily vandalised. In the vast majority of cases there are no litter bins on the pavements outside schools and children throw their sweet papers on the ground.  The installation of ATM machines outside banks has also contributed to the increase in litter.  For security reasons banks install litter bins with small openings so that confidential bank slips cannot be retrieved or set on fire.  However, this leads to an increase in the amount of litter outside banks.</P>
    <P>The former Minister of State, Deputy Harney, used the powers under the Air Pollution Act to get rid of smog in Dublin.  During the 18 months prior to its introduction I asked on the Order of Business every morning when air pollution legislation would be introduced.  By cleaning the air in Dublin, Deputy Harney enhanced the lives of many sick people in places such as Ballyfermot which had been very badly affected by pollution. Prior to this many of these people had to leave their homes during the winter and stay with their sons and daughters in other areas.  The decisive action taken under the Air Pollution Act has meant they no longer have to do this.  I hope this legislation will be fully enforced as the problem of litter can be solved only through determined political will and action.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the introduction of on-the-spot fines.  However, very few of the millions of people who commit offences every week will be prosecuted.  We are the greatest in the world at enacting legislation but the worst at implementing it.  For example, very little was done about the drug barons before the murder of Veronica Guerin but much action was taken after her death.</P>
    <P>I assume the Bill will be debated in committee by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, which I have the honour to chair.  Without pre-empting any decision of the committee, I very much hope we will have an opportunity to ascertain from local authority managers the reason they cannot keep the streets of our cities clean and whether they believe the Bill will help them in doing this.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I agree with all the points made and am delighted that so many Members have contributed to the debate.  I hope the Bill will deal effectively with the serious litter problem, thereby ensuring the protection of our environment. I have no doubt that the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, will be successful in doing this.  We have reached the stage where litter pollution is no longer acceptable and the public will support the Minister in her efforts to deal with it.  It will take a firm hand and the implementation of legislation to bring people to their senses. Their carelessness is causing these problems which are affecting our environment and the appearance of our country.  If we protect the environment the appearance of our country will improve automatically.</P>
      <P>We had a problem with water pollution in County Cavan, particularly in Lough Sheelin, but through education and legislation Lough Sheelin has been restored to its former beauty.  The fishing in Lough Sheelin last year was as good as it has been for the past 25 years.  Environmentalists said Lough Sheelin could not be restored to its former glory but they were wrong.  Much of the damage to the lake occurred through ignorance and that is the reason I say it was restored through education and legislation in addition to the efforts of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Teagasc.  The problems of pollution were addressed and the lake was restored to its former beauty.</P>
      <P>The practice of discarding plastic bags, beer cans, mineral bottles and fast food containers on our streets is unacceptable and must be stopped. Local authorities should not have to pick up the substantial bill for cleaning our towns and villages in the early hours before people go about their daily business or tourists arrive.  It is regrettable that this litter is created by young people on Saturday and Sunday nights.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are doing a wonderful job in dealing with the problem of litter but the cost factor is unacceptable when there are more important jobs to be done such as the restoration of roads, upgrading our towns or improving footpaths. This cost factor can be reduced substantially if the problem of litter is addressed at source.</P>
      <P>The appointment of litter wardens is essential to dealing with this problem.  There is a cost factor involved in that wardens would have to be on duty between 12 midnight and 4 a.m. when the majority of litter pollution takes place.  If the message goes out that litter wardens are on duty during these hours, people will be more careful about dropping litter in our towns and villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A traffic warden, Mary Fay, was appointed in Cavan with successful results.  She has tapped me <Col N="447" /> on the shoulder more than once and I have been given my final warning.  That lady has done a marvellous job while maintaining a good attitude. Traffic is moving smoothly through Cavan town without the problems of double parking or parking on double yellow lines.  The bigger the car the more joy the traffic warden gets from issuing tickets. People in the town now park in designated areas.</P>
    <P>If we had more Mary Fays in this country, the problem of litter could be eliminated.  People who break the traffic laws should be given one or two warnings which, if ignored, should be followed by on the spot fines.  There is no other way to address the problem.  It is not good enough simply to give more money to local authorities.  That is the wrong attitude.  People should be encouraged not to discard litter.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy Browne's point that supermarkets have a role to play in addressing this problem. Plastic is a revolutionary product which has thousands of uses but hedgerows throughout the country are littered with plastic bags.  As those bags take years to disintegrate one wonders if their use should be banned.</P>
    <P>As a result of afforestation programmes forests are now coming on-stream that are suitable for making wood pulp.  Wood pulp can be used to make paper bags &mdash; I will not refer to brown paper bags &mdash; sufficiently strong to carry items bought in supermarkets.  Such bags are environmentally friendly.  Unlike plastic bags they will not be blown around by the wind and will disintegrate when wet.</P>
    <P>One supermarket &mdash; I believe it was Quinns-worth &mdash; came up with the novel idea of paying 1p to a charitable organisation every time customers reused plastic bags.  That is a step in the right direction although I know people may not always remember to bring their used plastic bags when heading to the supermarket to do their shopping.  Rolls of these bags are provided at the check-outs and it is convenient for customers to use them.  We must come up with alternatives to the packaging currently being used by shops and supermarkets.</P>
    <P>Great efforts are being made by farmers, farming organisations and co-operatives to recycle plastic.  A project in County Cavan, which hopefully will soon be grant-aided, recycles silage covers, bale wraps and other types of plastic to make brush and shovel handles.  That is a marvel-lous development for which there is a great market. If we are serious about addressing this problem we should encourage people to carry out research on it.  Due to their involvement in the REPS farmers are particularly conscious of the problems caused by pollution.  They know litter cannot be left lying around their farms.  Litter can find its way into rivers and streams and I understand it was the cause of a serious problem in the west two years ago.</P>
    <P>Mushroom compost is packaged in hard plastic and problems have arisen in discarding this <Col N="448" /> material which appears to be indestructible.  I understand there is a cost factor in removing the plastic from the compost and that is a problem our young scientists and environmentalists should be asked to address.  Surely machines could be developed to recycle this material.  That would be one way to deal with this problem.  Many of those who preach for hours about protecting the environment discard their rubbish along the road or throw it out of their cars when out for a drive. That is no longer acceptable.  On a recent walk down Grafton Street I noticed chewing gum all over the street and I am not sure if it can be removed.  As it is unhealthy as well as unsightly on our streets, chewing gum should be banned.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bille.  Tá sé thar am go mbeadh feabhas ar an scéal.  Tá an tír seo salach agus is orainn féin atá an milleán agus caithfimid rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi.</P>
      <P>Is féidir an milleán a chur ar an gcomhairle chontae, ar an Rialtas nó ar dhreamanna eile ach is sinn féin a chaitheann an bruscar timpeall na háite.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil iarracht á dhéanamh anois deireadh a chur leis an scéal seo.</P>
      <P>If cleanliness is next to godliness, this is a very poor nation.  A recent survey carried out by the Department which found that 80 per cent of the areas surveyed failed to meet proper litter standards is further proof that we have little respect for cleanliness.  While nearly all primary schools encourage pupils to pick up papers and keep their schools tidy, for some strange reason &mdash; perhaps it is a form of rebellion &mdash; those pupils appear to get satisfaction from throwing litter all over the place when they become teenagers.</P>
      <P>Many of our scenic areas are strewn with plastic bags and other forms of litter.  This shows a terrible lack of appreciation of nature in this wonderful country.  It is amazing that some people go to the bother of putting a plastic bag into the boot of their cars and stop along a scenic route to throw it out.  One would imagine that having gone to the bother of putting it in the boot, they would at least go to a dump with it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the implementation of on-the-spot fines.  It is futile appealing to some individuals to be good citizens.  An incredible amount of garbage is thrown around towns on Sunday mornings. As a Celtic breed, we appear to react only to punishment and the imposition of fines is the only way to make people adhere to proper litter standards. Appeals for tidy towns make no difference to some people.  I have great sympathy for members of Tidy Towns committees who, with a great sense of pride and much energy and devotion, go out early in the morning to pick up the litter other louts leave behind them.  It must be galling for those hard working citizens who take pride in their towns to lose marks in the Tidy Towns Competition because of litter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every county council should implement the £25 on-the-spot fine and litter wardens should be appointed.  As the money collected in fines will <Col N="449" /> go to the councils, litter wardens will be encouraged to ensure that those littering our streets do not get away with it.  However, there is little point in litter wardens walking the streets in the middle of the day when it is at night time that most people commit this offence.  Perhaps they should work during social hours.  Many young people sit on steps eating packets of crisps and chips and leave the empty packets behind them.  They should be hauled over the coals for desecrating our country.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation householders will be responsible for litter on the footpaths outside their premises.  While it is appropriate that a fine should be imposed on a householder who throws garbage in his or her front garden, a house at the end of a roadway could be the centre of gravity for litter on a windy night.  Councils should be careful in applying the penalty to private householders.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures proposed in respect of literature placed on car windscreens.  Even though politicians are responsible for much of this literature, it is an insult to have one's photograph thrown on the ground almost immediately after it is placed on a car windscreen.</P>
    <P>While there is always a danger that problems will arise during silage times, farmers have made great efforts in the area of pollution control.  They have learned the hard way.  Shops that sell sweets and ice cream should be obliged to place a garbage bin outside their premises for the wrappers. They should also be obliged to empty those bins.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm gur feidir liom cúpla rud a rá faoin mBille seo.  Nuair a thagann cuairteoirí chun na tíre is é an rud is mó a théann i bhfeidhm orthu ná an méid bruscair a bhíonn caite timpeall.  Agus nuair a théann Éireannaigh thar lear is é an rud is mó a théann i bhfeidhm orthu siúd ná a laghad bruscair a bhíonn timpeall.</P>
      <P>As publicity or embarrassment have not solved our litter problem, perhaps we should change our approach and examine other ways of dealing with the matter.  Some aspects of legislation have not been sufficiently followed through.  The Minister of State mentioned that the Irish business against litter campaign had commenced operations.  This is important.  The campaign has already stressed that litter is polluting both economic and environmental life.  I hope this message reaches those who may not think twice about litter but are concerned about other aspects of economic and social life.  I also hope they are reminded that this issue has a bearing on all, regardless of whether there is litter outside their houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said that litter is not as toxic as other pollutants.  While this is true in a chemical sense, it kills animals, and especially marine life, which for many is out of sight and therefore out of mind.  For example, occasional events involve the large-scale release of balloons filled with gas.  I am sure it does not occur to participants <Col N="450" /> that the deflated balloons have been found in the corpses of whales, turtles and fish.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to be a killjoy, it is important that there be a level of awareness that what is thrown away does not go away; it becomes a problem elsewhere, as in cases of unfortunate animal victims of careless human behaviour.  For example, I often notice gulls who have died or suffer badly from the effects of plastic wraps which hold beer cans together and which appear to be discarded in drunken stupors at outdoor drinking binges.  Dogs put their heads through them.  While many are luckily released, seals are often slowly and painfully strangled by plastic netting or plastic beer wraps.</P>
    <P>These aspects of litter need to be more widely publicised because while one may consider litter to be dirty and anti-social, one generally does not consider it to be a life and death issue, which is the case for animals and birds.  It probably arises through lack of thought rather than malice on the part of those who do not care what happens to their discarded litter.  While this is primarily a matter of publicity, it remains an important issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the performance of local authorities as uneven, which is a euphemism for bad in many cases and fair in others.  On paper, many local authorities are capable of asserting that they are serious about litter. However, as Members will be aware from their own local authorities, each authority has different sections with different responsibilities for dealing with litter.  For example, the environmental services section is responsible for litter wardens. When contacted, these sections will only deal with litter in so far as it relates to prosecution for littering, matters arising in connection with litter wardens or matters for which they are responsible. However, if other questions are raised, for example on litter bins, they will refer them to the roads department which is responsible for the bins but not for the litter wardens.</P>
    <P>Unless one is dedicated to the campaign against litter one quickly becomes disheartened with the effort which is required to go from department to department within a local authority, never mind going from one authority to another.  Dealing with local authorities becomes a hobby in itself.  They are often not organised to address matters of concern in a unified sense.</P>
    <P>The use of the Irish language on litter bins by local authorities is another example of where difficulties arise.  The word &ldquo;bruscar&rdquo; used to be widely featured alongside the word &ldquo;litter&rdquo;. However, there is a trend for designer litter bins, which often appear like imports from Romanesque English towns, the purpose of which is to generate an appearance of antiquity or grandeur. They often do not have any Irish word, only the word &ldquo;litter&rdquo; is appended.</P>
    <P>While this is fair enough for those who are only concerned with English or for visitors who are learning English, it is a shame that, in taking pride in our country, we must choose not to take pride in our language.  However, if we are trying <Col N="451" /> to generate a sense of self worth and pride the two become intrinsically linked.  We ought to be benefiting both our environment and our culture. The Irish language should not be omitted from signs which are displayed in the fight against litter. On the contrary, it would be encouraging for people to note that to be Irish means that one does not drop litter.</P>
    <P>The wider question which the Bill should tackle relates not just to ordinary citizens out for a stroll, a drive or a picnic who must bring their litter home with them or find a bin but to the business community.  It has developed the practice relatively recently, in Dublin in particular, of leaving large amounts of waste generated by packaging &mdash; I realise that is a separate debate &mdash; on the streets at early hours.  It may be due to be collected during the day but it is unnecessary for traders to leave waste lying outside their premises ready for collection so early.  This matter may have to be dealt with by legislation if it cannot be solved another way.  The waste takes up space and litters the streets for which, under the legislation, they are ultimately responsible for keeping tidy.  The message should be sent to traders that the waste should be left outside perhaps an hour before collection, preferably for recycling but, unfortunately, given that it is so minimal, for land fill disposal.</P>
    <P>From the small amount I read, the local authorities' litter plans, which the Minister mentioned, contain little more than platitudes in support of recycling.  It might be said that litter has nothing to do with recycling because it is a matter of removing bits of paper and tidying them away. However, the promotion of the reduction of waste, and where that is not possible, reuse or recycling, is part of the education process which must be taken seriously in addition to the enforcement of legislation.</P>
    <P>Much time was spent discussing the waste hierarchy when the Waste Management Act went through the House but great opportunities exist to get across the message of segregating waste. At present there are litter bins and the wheelie bin companies are trying to introduce a second bin for recyclable packaging.  However, the largest proportion of waste is still organic and compostable. Unfortunately, that is a poor relation in the waste hierarchy as practised in this country. We should be vigilant about this aspect at every opportunity and the Bill is another chance to get it right.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed it has been decided that the on the spot fine should continue to be £25.  As time has passed and prices have increased due to inflation, there should be a graded facility for fines in accordance with the seriousness of the litter offence.  Perhaps the on the spot fine is only meant for paper bags but this matter should be teased out on Committee Stage to ensure we have more meaningful fines and ways of enforcing them.</P>
    <P>The voluntary sector in this area, including tidy <Col N="452" /> towns committees, anti-litter groups and subcommittees of chambers of commerce, have been ungratefully passed over too often.  The work carried out at local level gets some notice during the Tidy Towns Competition but all too often it is a case of people complaining that the tidy towns group is not doing enough.  That is a travesty and, as Deputy Browne said, the people who are not involved in tidy towns groups are generally those who litter.  That is not always the case but often people who would not go near a tidy towns group think nothing of causing a mess through littering. I wish to put on record my appreciation of all the tidy towns groups that have battled against the overwhelming bad habits of their neighbours.</P>
    <P>In the Fingal area, from Balbriggan to Baldoyle and Howth to Blanchardstown, many people are considering the Bill with great interest and wondering if it will be any more than a well intentioned document.  Will it be sufficiently resourced so the people concerned about litter will see some difference?  I hope the Department of the Environment, which is now responsible for the Tidy Towns Competition, will engage in much more consultation with the groups on the ground.  The Department has a tidy towns section and I ask the Minister to consider making a formal link available, such as an open day for tidy towns groups.</P>
    <P>This would enable people to discuss the problems they encountered and their results in the competition.  For example, they could discuss why some very good tidy towns groups inexplicably lost marks last year and are so disillusioned that many are asking why they should bother entering the competition because it appears their efforts are not being repaid.  I hope the Minister will take the level of disillusionment among the tidy towns groups on board because they are a vital part of the fight against litter.  They have done so much and I hope they will not be passed over or taken for granted.  Only some groups win but many others make the effort to improve their areas. This must be recognised and I hope the Minister will take it on board.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will encourage those who produce products that cause litter to face up to their responsibilities.  This applies to chewing gum companies which, apparently, are not prepared to help clean up the remnants of old chewing gum, and other companies which make glass bottles but which are not prepared to embrace a deposit system for the bottles.  They have a role to play and if they are not prepared to play it voluntarily, the Minister should not be afraid to introduce regulations.  That is the purpose of the legislation and if the regulations are not introduced, we are reneging on our responsibility.  A voluntary code does not always work and I hope that will be taken on board in relation to litter.</P>

      <P>The Minister is anxious to conclude the debate and while Members want to contribute, it is important the Bill is not delayed because it must go through a substantial Committee <Col N="453" /> Stage debate.  I will be brief in order to allow my constituency colleague to contribute and the Minister to conclude.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is overdue.  Dublin city is thriving at present and looking its best on so many fronts.  Huge scale dereliction has been virtually eliminated and there is a tremendous social and cultural buzz.  It is a superb tourism destination and there is nothing but praise for Dublin in terms of its vibrancy and development in the last decade.  The only negative comment one hears about Dublin is that it still earns the title &ldquo;dirty Dublin&rdquo;.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  While litter legislation has been on the Statute Book and litter wardens have been working in the Dublin area for a number of years, to pursue a case through the courts is a joke because the level of penalty is ridiculously low.  It certainly would not encourage commercial enterprises to change their practice.  Litter wardens have been helpful in tackling specific problems but their hands are tied.  I hope the passing of this Bill will result in the elimination of litter from the city.</P>
      <P>The Irish countryside is the most beautiful in the world but it is marred by pollution.  The initiative taken in regard to baling bags is interesting and welcome.  Plastic is one of the great blights on the countryside.  Under this legislation it will be the duty of local authorities to deal with this matter.  I am glad the Department will maintain a monitoring role and will have power to call people to account in the event that certain counties are not maintaining the standard.</P>
      <P>I have a great aversion to littered wrecks, many of which are to be seen around the countryside. When I heard of the proposal to recycle baling bags, which are used mostly for storing silage, I hoped that a grant scheme, award scheme or good ideas scheme would be introduced by the Department to help tackle problems such as this which seem to be insoluble.  In some parts of the county one cannot travel a mile without spotting a wreck.  A specific programme is needed to tackle this problem and I hope local authorities will deal with it in the context of their litter plans. As a member of Dublin Corporation I look forward to the development of a litter plan, which has been under consideration in anticipation of this legislation.  There is much that can be done in that regard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that much of the responsibility for litter will be on the owners of property. One of my colleagues suggested that bin collection be privatised and that the workers in that area be redeployed as street cleaners.  Under best international practice, responsibility for large areas around public entertainment buildings and private buildings is on the owners of those buildings. Dáil Éireann is noted for providing opportunities to travel, and one city that struck me as remarkable for its cleanliness is Vancouver which I visited in the last year.  I was taken aback by the high standard of cleanliness there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who has to keep a house tidy &mdash; my <Col N="454" /> husband is a cleanliness fanatic and I am sure Deputy Ahern shares regularly in the household chores &mdash; knows the effort that goes into that job. Litter is created even in the best run cities and I welcome the requirement in the Bill that people who provide a service to the public, such as shop owners and flat owners, must factor in the cost of maintaining the premises and surrounding area. In Vancouver, people are to be seen outside each premises at night washing the paving and cleaning the area around their premises so that the city is spotless the next morning.  I hope the extra powers and increased penalties in the Bill will make it possible for us to tackle the problem of litter as we approach the millennium.</P>
    <P>People who have canvassed as regularly as I have in the past 16 years will have been struck by the fact that estates, even in the most deprived communities, which were once littered, have been greatly transformed by the work of ordinary people who sometimes take over the work of local authorities and work in co-operation with them to give their area a facelift.  They cut hedges, plant flowers, shrubs and so on.  My constituency has won many prizes in the tidy district competition. I am not clapping my constituents on the back but indicating that there is much goodwill towards the aims of this Bill.  It is important that politicians, locally and nationally, support this work and ensure that local authorities do their job.  This Bill is a sign that the State is doing its job.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the new powers and requirements for local authorities and the increased fines.  I would like to see continuing creative interest by the Department of the Environment in this matter.  I am not sure what section will implement this legislation or if there are people specialised in this area, but active monitoring and supervision of its implementation will be necessary. As with Operation Freeflow, there is public desire to have a clean city and countryside.  I would like the Minister to tell the House what structures have been put in place in the Department to implement and monitor the legislation.</P>
    <P>There are other related issues such as recycling, which is still in its infancy.  I hope this Bill is only part of a fundamental rethink on the elimination of litter and preservation of the environment with the limited resources available.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the legislation.  I hope it is implemented in the year ahead and that it results in a dramatic change in the city of Dublin, crowning its current glory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is good legislation which I am sure will be passed by the House, but will it be enforced?  To enforce any legislation we must ensure that the necessary resources are put in place.  Neither good intentions nor PR is enough. Much more is required to ensure this legislation is enforced.  I am sure the Minister will say we need to put a framework in place and it is another matter to enforce the legislation.  There has been too much anti-litter advertising and PR and not <Col N="455" /> enough law enforcement.  There has been too much carrot and too little stick.  As in any walk of life, when the balance is wrong measures will not work.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the elaborate anti-litter campaign last year did any good.  I am sure the advertising agencies did well out of it.  It may have helped to set the scene for the introduction of this legislation.  The theory may be to run a campaign, introduce the legislation and then enforce it.  If the legislation is not enforced, this will amount to little more than the Minister spending money on a PR campaign which will not benefit any of us.</P>
      <P>I am speaking on this legislation from a Dublin perspective.  There is much talk about young people's awareness of their environment.  Many of our young people who are knowledgeable about the ozone layer and the Brazilian rainforest are among the greatest litter louts in this city.  It is an easy option for young people to be concerned about the African jungle or the South American rainforest, but they do not appear to bring their concern for the global environment to bear on littering the streets.  It appears such awareness of global environmental problems has made young people worse in addressing local environmental problems.  They tend to think that by signing up to save the whale and so on they have done their bit for the environment, but they forget about it when they walk down the street.  Much attention has been focused on young people in terms of an anti-litter campaign, but they are not coming up trumps.  As well as the PR on anti-litter and promoting videos on Africa and Brazil, young people must be told about local litter problems.  They must be pulled up for littering for which they must pay a penalty.</P>
      <P>An adequate number of litter wardens is required to impose penalties.  Two or three litter wardens are based in Dublin.  I am sure they do a good day's work, but two or three is not enough.  With 270,000 people on the dole, why cannot a few hundred people, rather than a few dozen, be recruited as litter wardens on a commission basis?  There is plenty of work for them to do.  If recruited, they would make a big difference.</P>
      <P>The last speaker spoke about tourism in Dublin. The city is doing well, but surveys of tourists highlight their perception of litter as a problem in Dublin, which does not leave them with memories of a clean city.  We must tackle the problem in this city.  Dublin is the in city now.  We do not have to go to great lengths to attract tourists, but if we do not tackle our litter problem tourists will not continue to visit our city.  As well as having a memorable time here they will also need to be impressed by the appearance of the city as well as other aspects of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation is charged with responsibility for cleaning the streets of the city.  During the past ten years the Department of the Environment put a squeeze on local authorities and the resources available in this regard are greatly <Col N="456" /> reduced.  In the late 1980s the number employed in Dublin Corporation's cleansing department alone fell from 900 to 700.  While improving efficiency is welcome, the work formerly done by 200 men cannot be done by the remaining work force.  Bin lorries that collect refuse in residential areas are fully manned, corporation workers are assigned to collect litter in the city centre and main shopping areas, but virtually no corporation workers are available to collect litter in the residential areas.  I constantly raise this matter with my local authority, but I have been told that area X or Y is cleaned once a week on bin collection day.  However, we all know that if a worker is sick or on holidays and the litter is not collected on, say, a Tuesday afternoon, it will not be done until the following Tuesday.  A squeeze was put on local authorities in the late 1980s and many of the staff opted to take early retirement.  By and large local authorities have managed, but they cannot continue to manage on a permanent basis without the necessary resources.  While Governments in recent years have ploughed resources into other Departments of State, area partnerships and so on, local authorities have not recovered from the cut in funding imposed in the late 1980s.</P>
    <P>I hope the litter problems I encounter at local level are covered in the Bill.  Many litter problems in my area arise in houses set out in flats.  The Minister introduced regulations in this regard last year, but I do not know if they are being enforced.  Perhaps I should table a question about it.  Apart from those regulations, other problems arise in respect of other regulations in that houses set out in flats are not properly looked after. Regulations may place an onus on the landowner to maintain his property from a public health point of view, but the general appearance of those houses in my area is shabby.  I understand provisions in the Bill may address that problem and, if so, I welcome them, but much greater enforcement of the regulations is required.  I hope the Minister will collect £40 from such landlords and there will be greater enforcement of regulations governing not only the standard of accommodation offered to tenants, but of those governing the appearance of the front and side gardens of properties to ensure they do not drag down the appearance of an area.  These matters have not been given much attention over the years and many landlords do not look after their properties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions concerning sports grounds.  Dalymount Park, Croke Park and Tolka Park are close to my constituency.  In recent years an informal arrangement has been set up between Croke Park and the corporation where the GAA give the corporation a few thousand pounds to clean up the area after big matches.  It has been on a voluntary basis up to now and has worked to some extent.  However, the number of matches deemed to be major games is far too small as is the confined area that is cleaned up.  Some work is done in the late evening and more the next morning but the wind does not respect boundaries. If the GAA and the corporation agree to <Col N="457" /> do one side of Drumcondra Road and not the other, the scheme does not work.  I am glad this has been given legislative teeth and that local authorities will be able to work with sports organisations and groups running musical or theatrical events to deal with problems of this kind.</P>
    <P>There may be problems, however, when the agreement is confined to the stadium and the 300 to 700-metre area surrounding it.  There are problems for residents in the wider vicinity of Croke Park as litter is spread over an extensive area. People can be three quarters of a mile away &mdash; I am thinking of Glasnevin and Iona &mdash; and outside the area agreed between the GAA and the corporation, yet they suffer the nuisance of cars parking outside their driveways as well as litter. Sadly, some of our country cousins bring sand-wishes to Croke Park and do not respect the laws, leaving their trademarks behind them.  There will have to be generous scope to deal with this.  It is not enough for men to clean for two hours within 200 yards of the stadium.</P>
    <P>If money is raised by fines or the contribution of organisations, it should be ploughed back into the communities.  This came up in a submission on the Waste Bill last year.  In Baleally, Dunsink or Ballyogan, where the tipheads are, and the areas around the stadiums, money should be given to the communities, the local environmental or residents groups who are trying to improve the area.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill deals with mobile food outlets but the problem is that they are fly-by-nights who have no casual trading licences or status. When officials come after them the day after the event, they are gone.  They may be chased by the Eastern Health Board for food hygiene reasons but there does not seem to be enough people on the day of the event to pursue them.  I hope this happens after the legislation goes through.</P>
    <P>Dogs' dirt is mentioned in the legislation.  We have tried by-laws for this with Dublin Corporation but they have not worked and hopefully this legislation is better.  The corporation advise sending in a complaint form but neighbours do not like to go to court and say: &ldquo;At 9.15 a.m. on Tuesday 4 February, I saw Mrs. Murphy's dog&rdquo;.  They want to complain to the corporation or their local representative but it is unfair and unreasonable to expect them to give evidence in court about their neighbour's dog.  That will not and cannot happen as a neighbour only acts in severe cases and evidence is needed in court.  A man on the spot should deal with this and if there were plenty of wardens the problem would be solved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section dealing with dogs but the provisions should also apply to horses.  In parts of my constituency the dog problem is a major one but in other parts the problem is horse manure. It would be silly to pass legislation putting responsibility on the owner of a small dog while ignoring the horse.  This might be covered by an amendment on Committee Stage because it is a major problem.  While I attacked the PR aspect earlier, the tidy districts committees do marvellous <Col N="458" /> work.  I am more familiar with them than the tidy towns committees.  Some are professional because they have CE schemes, which may be unfair.  It compares with the work of dedicated amateurs, especially in country areas, where there is greater local pride and sense of identity.  Even in the city some do marvellous work and one could put a certain responsibility on them, but the local authority must also be there, backed up by the wardens.</P>
    <P>Others have mentioned the scourge of plastic bags.  In a certain part of my constituency there are about 300 people on CE schemes sitting in offices and flats thinking about how they can solve the problems of the world and nobody is outside picking these plastic bags off the bushes and trees.  Society has changed from the time people shopped with carrier bags.  There should perhaps be a scheme of charging for plastic bags as some supermarkets are overgenerous in giving out these bags, many of which end up in the street afterwards.  It would be good to have a charge and a refund for these bags.  There were refunds on many items long ago.</P>
    <P>In the legislation a responsibility is being put on shopkeepers to clean up outside their shops.  I thought it was already a law that not only did shopkeepers have to clean up outside premises but a householder also had to clean the path outside their house.  When I was young, in Dublin we regarded that as our responsibility and I thought it a by-law of the corporation.  It should be a responsibility and I am glad it is in the legislation. It should not be sufficient to brush up, as Deputy Flaherty said.  Shops should have to wash the pavement outside their premises also.  During last summer's dry spell I was in a cafe and something had been spilt on the ground some days earlier. Cafes and shops that sell liquids should have to brush and wash up during dry weather.  It is a great nuisance and chases business away when they do not.  It happens during summer and stains that are on the street for days look bad.  The section should be tightened.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who have contributed to this debate on the Litter Pollution Bill.  I am glad they have expressed strong views on the problem of litter and I agree that we must tackle the problem aggressively. Firm and vigorous action is required.  This is not an easy challenge but we are determined to take it on.  It is well established that the public feel more strongly about litter than any other environmental problem and they are demanding that something be done about it.  The Government has responded positively to these concerns through the action against litter initiative, one of the principal objectives of which is to improve local authority performance in the prevention and control of litter as well as taking better enforcement action against offenders.  The Bill facilitates this and contains provisions that meet the concerns raised by Deputies.  It puts in place a wide-ranging <Col N="459" /> legislative framework for that initiative, spells out clearly what occupiers of property must do to keep their property free of litter and sets out the duties of local authorities for preventing and controlling litter.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies referred to the issue of enforcement. The need to improve on powers and performance in regard to litter enforcement is one of the driving forces of this Bill.  Deputy Dempsey expressed concern over the cost to local authorities of taking enforcement action.  Under this Bill local authorities will be able to ask the courts to order that fines imposed by the courts be paid to the local authorities and section 25(5) instructs that this be done.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, a local authority will also be entitled to ask the court to award the local authority the cost of investigating, detecting and prosecuting offences.  This is set down in section 25(4) and it provides that, except where there are special and substantial reasons for not doing so, the court must order a convicted person to pay the local authority's costs.  Apart from a local authority benefiting financially from the proceeds of fines and costs which until now accrued to the Exchequer, this approach follows the &ldquo;polluter pays principle&rdquo;, which is one of the basic principles underpinning environmental legislation.</P>
      <P>Litter wardens need to be active on the ground to have effective enforcement.  This was mentioned by a number of Deputies and I am confident we will see more litter wardens employed by local authorities when this Bill is passed.  They will have a wider focus than just simply trying to catch people dropping casual litter.  The proposal in the Bill to extend powers of enforcement to gardaí was referred to by a number of Deputies. I do not see gardaí taking over the enforcement role from local authorities.  This will remain primarily as a local authority function for litter wardens. However, it is considered advantageous to extend the powers of enforcement against offenders to gardaí.  Many gardaí are involved in patrolling our streets and it is felt they could play a useful deterrent role simply by being recognised as an authority that can issue on the spot fines for litter offences.</P>
      <P>I also envisage a close level of co-operation between litter wardens and gardaí who, under the Bill, may be called on to give assistance to litter wardens who might feel this is necessary to deal with any obstruction.  If litter wardens are seen to operate from time to time with the assistance of gardaí the public will quickly realise that if one drops litter it is more likely that one may be challenged by a litter warden or a garda or both.  If there is a concerted effort by local authorities to take enforcement action against offenders, the public will quickly realise that local authorities are serious about the problem of litter and the involvement of gardaí to a limited extent will bring a great deal of benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ahern had doubts about the value of promoting public awareness but we need to engage the attention of the public in regard to litter.  It is apparent from surveys that attitudes to <Col N="460" /> litter consist of a complex mixture of aspiration and habit.  We recognise it costs taxpayers a significant amount of money to fund cleansing programmes and we readily recognise the economic value of a clean outdoor environment, yet we are not terribly conscious of our littering habits or motivated to change them.</P>
    <P>Advertising can help bring about change in peoples' attitudes.  A relatively small amount is being invested to promote public awareness and education.  Not all of the funding for the action against litter initiative was spent on advertising; a significant amount was spent on developing anti-litter materials which have been sent to all first and second level schools; a scientific baseline survey of litter was also produced.</P>
    <P>Tourism is affected by our bad litter habits. The quality of the Irish tourism product has improved enormously over the years in terms of accommodation and food.  However, one of the most frequent complaints made by visitors relates to litter.  If people take the time and trouble to write about litter we must assume they are telling friends about it and that can and does have a damaging effect on our tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Deputies Ahern and Quill raised the question of tenants as well as landlords having responsibility for litter control.  Throughout the Bill the responsibility to keep a place free of litter falls on occupiers &mdash; this could be an owner, a leaseholder or a tenant but in cases of houses in flats, an obligation is being placed on the owner in addition to the obligations of occupiers to keep the gardens around a house let in flats free of litter.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the issue of plastic bags.  New policy measures are already under way in relation to dealing with packaging waste. Regulations imposing obligations on businesses to deal with packaging waste will be published shortly.  A voluntary industry led scheme, REPAK, was launched last year to deal with the co-ordination and financing of recovering and recycling packaging waste.  The new regulations will give strong support to the efforts of REPAK. The Waste Management Act, 1996, already provides the Minister for the Environment with the power to introduce measures such as charging for plastic shopping bags but it is premature to consider this option at this stage.  I wish to see how we get on with industry led voluntary initiatives in tackling these problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to litter being created as a result of domestic and commercial refuse being put out too soon for collection and being badly presented.  Local authorities have a power under the Waste Management Act, 1996, to adopt by-laws to regulate the presentation of waste for collection. Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the formation of the IBAL group.  I very much welcome the establishment of this group.  The Minister has publicly commended their efforts, but to say that only for IBAL this Bill would not see the light of day is not correct.  The Minister promised the Bill independently and I am delighted it is before the House.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the recovery and recycling of farm plastics.  Recently the Minister announced details of a new scheme which <Col N="461" /> will implement arrangements whereby waste plastics will be collected free of charge from farmers and will then be sent for recycling.  The new scheme will be governed by statutory regulations which have been published in draft form.  It is expected they will come into effect in March.</P>
    <P>Many of the concerns raised by Deputy Ring are dealt with in the Bill.  He highlighted indiscriminate dumping.  Section 26 of the Bill addresses this issue.  If a local authority finds a bag of rubbish and it is established from the contents who owns it, the person can be charged with an offence and it would be up to the defendants to prove they did not dump it.  Deputy Browne also referred to this and I agree with him that we need more litter wardens.  I am confident more will be appointed.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate and I look forward to the detailed consideration of the provisions by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  Any reasonable points and amendments will be considered on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann notes with concern the turmoil at CIE which has resulted in the company's plans for change being in disarray, has led to a threat of an all-out strike at CIE and produced the recent massive disruption to services; condemns the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications for failing to take a hands-on approach to the crisis and for not developing a strategic plan for CIE and the semi-State sector; and calls on the Minister immediately to bring forward policy initiatives and a White Paper to chart a future course for the development of the semi-State sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been necessary to put down this motion because of the escalating industrial <Col N="462" /> relations crisis in CIE, which manifested itself most clearly on budget day when commuter services were massively disrupted by an unofficial stoppage.  On that day all transport services were disrupted in some fashion, with the train service particularly badly hit.  It was a long time since there had been disruptions of this nature but CIE workers are at breaking point because their concerns continue to be ignored by both the company and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
      <P>The risk of even greater disruption remains because of the continuing stalemate.  A national transport strike has been threatened if CIE management persists in its gung-ho approach.  Management's position is unprecedented and it turns back the clock on the principles of social partnership.  For the past year it seems to have been on a deliberate collision course with the company's workers. A confrontational approach has been adopted and management appears to want the end result to be a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; dispute.  It will get precisely what it wants unless the Minister and the Government finally pay attention to the time bomb which is ticking away and will explode on the public in the form of a widescale national dispute.</P>
      <P>Rather than adopting such an old-fashioned approach to its problems, CIE should be instructed by the Minister to negotiate change. The concerns of the workforce must be recognised and accommodated.  The trade union movement in the company has, in the past, shown itself to be capable and willing to negotiate change and it is again willing to play its part in managing the required changes.</P>
      <P>It is scandalous that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and a Government made up of parties claiming to be left of centre have turned a blind eye to everything that is going on in CIE.  The rot began before Christmas when the most ridiculous dispute ever was provoked by management.  This related to the non-payment of part of the pay awards under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the unilateral introduction of a pay freeze.  To provoke a dispute just before Christmas over a basic payment which was due to be made and was guaranteed under the social partnership was nothing short of madness.  Amid much controversy and comment the matter ended up in the Labour Court, where the company rightly had to back down and abandon its ridiculous scheme.  A similar piece of industrial relations by CIE management was its attempt to change the terms and conditions of bus drivers, which resulted in a High Court judgment.</P>
      <P>CIE management is now back with a series of plans to achieve cost savings of £44 million.  The unions have been told that these plans are effectively not negotiable, they must either take or leave them and the company claims to have the sanction of the Minister and the Government for their unilateral implementation.  I want to know whether this is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Rail is to have £30 million shaved off in <Col N="463" /> its cost-cutting plan.  This will mean savage reductions of £180 per week in train drivers' pay. Some 148 redundancies are being sought on the Inter-City routes, 198 in mechanical engineering, 114 in infrastructure, 144 in administration and 182 in freight.</P>
    <P>Similar swingeing cuts are proposed in the other companies of the group.  I was told that a blue manual has been produced to show what is proposed in Bus Éireann and it reads like a doomsday book.  One column shows a driver's reference number and the column along side shows how that person will lose up to £180 per week in many cases.  Other drivers are to receive increases, which means the company thinks they are underpaid at present.  Other measures in the plan include letting go 100 of the company's 250 engineering operatives and contracting out school operations.  There are also proposals for split shifts and part-time working.  All this was done with the blessing of a Government which includes Ministers who, from time to time, condemn these practices in private companies, yet the creation of a &ldquo;yellow pack on wheels&rdquo; operation is fine for CIE, a State-owned company.</P>
    <P>The situation has been exacerbated for the CIE unions by the comments made by the companies' consultants.  The consultants for Dublin Bus are reported as saying that the market for transport in the city is now mature and there is no more business.  This is inaccurate.  Dublin Bus has not reached its potential by a long shot and additional investment in marketing would prove that.  With initiative and leadership the company could develop even further, especially if its services were properly marketed and focused to cater for new, large, sprawling housing developments.</P>
    <P>CIE workers have made many sacrifices.  On the rail side, the workforce has reduced from 11,000 to 5,000 over a few short years and in the past three years 630 workers have gone.  The current plan is seeking too much too quickly and the end result may be that the company will not achieve what it most wants because of the appalling way it has been handled.</P>
    <P>The Government's aloofness is unprecedented. For the 12 months up to last November, the Minister's predecessor refused to meet the unions or to take any responsibility for CIE.  He made no comment on the matter in case he would have to answer about it in the Dáil.  The new Minister, Deputy Dukes, has turned out to be equally evasive. Although he has been almost three months in the Department he has given the dispute a wide berth.  He has refused to meet the unions, which is a worrying development.  I, and everyone on this side of the House, always have and always will meet the social partners.  We have never shied away from our responsibilities in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We met them then also.  I met them when I was in office.  Yesterday the Minister went a step further.  At the official opening of a bus lane, he made the fantastic claim that he felt the dispute could be resolved between the sides. The Minister is obviously more out of touch than I thought.  If he had even inquired about the latest state of play before making those comments he would have discovered that there is no basis for that view.  In the latest salvo in the war at CIE, the unions responded to the operations manager in Bus Éireann as follows:</P>
      <P>I refer to your correspondence through the medium of fax relating to your intention to introduce unilateral work practice changes on 31 March 1997.  I draw your attention to the following.  First, your stated intention will be resisted through the use of strike action by this trade union.  Second, the contents of your letter are totally contrary to the comments on RTÉ Television News today by the chief executive of CIE and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  Third, with regard to the meeting on 7 February, no delegation from this trade union will be attending.  We do not attend meetings convened on the basis of threats. Fourth, I remind you of the recent High Court judgment on the terms and employment conditions applicable to the staff involved in your unilateral proposals.</P>
      <P>From the tone of that letter there is no basis for any settlement nor for the Minister's comment yesterday that the dispute was resolvable. Trust between the sides is sundered and irreparable. It is now so bad that the trade unions in the CIE group of companies believe &mdash; and some have said privately &mdash; that some of the accounts have been specially designed to paint an awful picture.  They cite the fact that surpluses have suddenly turned into deficits and deficits have escalated.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt that this dispute is deepening and becoming more polarised but the Minister responsible for bus lanes but not buses, Deputy Dukes, has a different insight into industrial relations.  Perhaps he was recovering from the elements yesterday when he made those comments. I understand he experienced CIE management at first hand and discovered that even the bus shelters are inadequate because one side is exposed.  Double-ended bus stops are beyond the capacity of the management.</P>
      <P>The Minister has always been presented as a safe pair of Fine Gael hands and called a man who gets things done.  When he came into Government people said he would bring stability and intelligence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait for the next bit.  Since he went to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, he has shown few of these <Col N="465" /> attributes.  In his first Question Time he said, rather foolishly, that he would stand over all Deputy Lowry's decisions and would not unpick any of them.  That is interesting.  Then the Minister gave his first interview to the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>.  In this he repeated what he said in 1996, that the Government placed too great an emphasis on consensus.  He said &ldquo;personally I think we are overdosing on consensus&rdquo;.  That is exactly the problem in CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The way the new Minister has decided to carry on the legacy of the old Minister probably tells us something about why he is treating the unions in CIE with such contempt.  We have Deputy Dukes instead of Deputy Lowry, but the policy continues.</P>
      <P>The Minister was not always so silent about CIE.  When he was a backbencher, but by no means a humble one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he was much more forthcoming. For example, as reported in the committee debates of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy on 5 June 1996 at column 484 Deputy Dukes said:</P>
      <P>My constituents, and other people around the country, are of the view that Bus Éireann is providing an inadequate service.  In some parts of the country, including my own constituency, it frequently provides an inadequate service with very unreliable, outdated equipment, whereas there are a number of private operators who, it seems, under the right conditions would be prepared to provide a comprehensive service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear what Deputy Dukes is really at.  On that occasion Deputy Dukes also wanted something done about the Arrow, the DART and so on.  Now that he is Minister, what is he doing about these?  Not much, from what I can see.  With up to three months in office the honeymoon appears to be over,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;peering down from the back benches on all of us are now over and he needs to set himself a few tasks and get down to them with some vigour.  The Minister has the longest schedule of outstanding legislation in the <Col N="466" /> Cabinet with 11 Bills still pending but none forthcoming. The Electricity Bill was promised in 1996 and the other day the Taoiseach told me it would not be introduced until 1998.  It is clear that there is complete legislative gridlock in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications under this Minister who appears unable to move that legislation along.  Is the real reason ideological differences with his Cabinet colleagues?  I suspect it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;otherwise we would have that legislation by now.  While he says he is standing over all the former Minister's decisions, we recently heard his announcement that the former Governor of the Central Bank would act as an adviser on Luas.  Last night on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; the Minister, Deputy Dukes, said that Mr. Maurice Doyle's job was to be a thinker for him.  What does Deputy Dukes need to think about if he is not going to have an independent study on putting Luas underground in the city centre?  One either commissions that study or one does not.  The Minister does not need Mr. Maurice Doyle to think about whether he should do that.  He is able to make that decision himself.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is obviously developing Deputy Lowry's fetish for consultants. It seems to go with the job.  Even thinking is now being privatised by Deputy Dukes and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications. It is quite a luxury to bring in one's own private Plato&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at a cost of £10,000 to the taxpayer, especially when the Minister says he does not plan to change anything, that he is not going to unpick Deputy Lowry's decisions.  Why do we need consultants if the Minister is not going to change anything?</P>
      <P>The Minister also faces industrial conflict on the Aer Lingus front.  Again this is a State company where trust in industrial relations terms is at an all-time low.  Relations between management and unions are obviously septic, given the nature of the current rather silly dispute, but with a Minister who does not believe in consensus, the Department does not seem to care and the consumer will end up being the loser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister spoke at a Dáil committee last year, he was all for licensing private bus operators and others.  Telecom Éireann's staff had better watch out.  At the recent glitzy launch of the strategic alliance, combined with international beauties flown in for the occasion, the new owners were not pulling any punches.  They were not five hours into the deal when the new-share-holders said that they wanted to privatise Telecom Éireann within three years.  That is why I was <Col N="467" /> looking for the details of that deal for so long &mdash; I knew that was part of the deal, and if this House had been told it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil has been highly critical of the Telecom Éireann strategic alliance.  The price is scandalously low and the deal is heavily weighted in favour of the overseas investors &mdash; there are overseas investors, but no Irish need apply.

Indeed, according to Telia's chief executive, the deal also involved some &ldquo;tax planning&rdquo;. I would like the Minister to explain what the overseas investors mean by that.  Is it the former Minister's type of tax planning that he was thinking about when he referred to that?</P>

      <P>The new Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications should not have stood over this deal.  It has been a betrayal of the taxpayer.  From the outset, Fianna Fáil said that Telecom had the potential to herald a renaissance in the State sector.  We have always been of the view that rather than Telecom being a defensive player, it should have gone on the offensive and taken a stake internationally.  We believe it could and should become an Irish multinational overseas rather than adopting the defensive strategy begun by Deputy Lowry and <Col N="468" /> continued by Minister Dukes of selling off 20 per cent of it for a bargain basement price.  Now we are told by the new owners, with the company not a couple of hours in their ownership, that they want to sell the rest of the company within three years.  That is precisely why we have been objecting to this crazy deal.</P>

      <P>The Minister has also failed to throw any light on the way the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications does its business.  For the past two years report after report has been commissioned on the semi-State bodies.  Each one has remained secret.  Each development has been done by stealth.  I asked the last Minister, and I have asked this Minister, to release the consultants' reports, but we do not get them.  We get secret decisions, secret back room deals, secret selling off of State companies at knockdown prices, and we are not allowed to see the consultants' reports which apparently gave this advice.  If Deputy Dukes is not going to make some difference, if he is only going to carry on Deputy Lowry's policies, which have been so opposed by every company in the semi-State sector, then he should think again about the portfolio that he holds, because the strategy that is now being pursued has backfired, and it will backfire again.</P>
      <P>We see this again with the plan for a new peat-fired station in the midlands.  The former Minister refused to explain why the first competition for this was abandoned.  Another set of consultants were then appointed.  On top of this there appears to have been a deliberate policy by the last Minister not to spend the Economic Infrastructural Operational Programme.  Only 9 per cent of this programme, which is to fund the new power station, has been spent despite it being mid-term review time.  According to media reports, the peat plan is now in jeopardy, but the Minister is denying that.  I would ask him to explain tonight what happened with the consultants or with the spending of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same legacy of secrecy and neglect appears set to continue with the myriad other problems in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  The controversy about the second mobile phone licence does not appear to be going away.  We saw another set of revelations in a Sunday newspaper.  In the transcript of an interview, Deputy Lowry said that neither he nor the Department ever knew how the mobile licence deal was financed.  This cuts across what <Col N="469" /> the former Minister told the Dáil and what the Secretary of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications told a press conference on 19 April 1996.  He had said the list from which the potential investors was to be drawn was handed to and known by his Department. Which of his stories in this regard is true?</P>
    <P>The litany of problems grows even longer, with no resolution.  Regional airports are being ignored by this Minister, as they were by the last one.  The abolition of duty free shopping is going ahead, almost unchallenged.  Will the Minister, Deputy Dukes, shake himself and do battle on the duty free front?  The rainbow Government is putting forward EU plans which will lead to the closure of many rural post offices.  Shannon Airport's development remains at a standstill with no interest being shown by this Minister.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil always had its own distinctive approach to the development of the State sector and it always will.  The Fianna Fáil approach to the transport, energy and communications portfolio, and the many semi-State companies within it, is based on enterprise and pragmatism rather than outdated, sterile ideology. The needs of each company and each sector must be carefully examined because we care for the people who work in those companies, unlike the parties opposite.  Fianna Fáil's philosophy and history has consistently been one of support for the workers in semi-State companies and the companies themselves as engines of economic growth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We believe in the stakeholder concept, which we will actively develop.  We acknowledge, however, that it is a time of change in the State sector.  This change is being driven by technology, EU deregulation and competition. However, we do not advocate gung-ho privatisation policies for their own sake or for ideological reasons.  Under Fianna Fáil, there would not be any mass sell-offs.</P>
      <P>We believe in facing the challenges together in a co-operative spirit and maintaining the relationship of trust which Fianna Fáil has fostered with the social partners.  We recognise that the transition from monopoly status to competitive market player can be a demanding one for many State companies.  We are committed to the steady management of rapid change in the semi-State sector and &mdash; unlike the present Government &mdash; to fully involving management, unions and the social partners in the process of managing change.</P>
      <P>We recognise that if the companies are to perform and succeed commercially they must have commercial freedom.  Where there are costs of public services to be borne which are proper and unavoidable, these must be borne not just by the State companies but by all the players in the market. Any change deemed necessary by Government from time to time in the structure of particular State companies should take place if it is in the best interests of the public, the company and its employees, but only following full consultation with the social partners rather than in the absence of consultation as we have seen in this CIE dispute.</P>
      <P>Our approach has always been a case by case one, based on a deep philosophy of support for the semi-State companies as engines of growth and for those who work in them.  These workers have reared families over the years and are prepared to make changes in the companies, provided they are negotiated under the social partnership umbrella and not handed down as diktats from Ministers or insensitive management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our semi-State strategy is strongly founded on the stakeholder concept, where corporations are encouraged to pursue profit but not to the detriment of society.  We recognise employees and customers as stakeholders in State firms.  We give them access to developing the future of those companies.  That gives them real influence on <Col N="471" /> company policy in the event of any change to the structure.  Fianna Fáil has said before in many debates that we would like to reserve up to 15 per cent of the shares in State companies for the workers in those companies as a matter of policy.</P>
    <P>It is firm EU policy to insist on competition in all areas now covered by commercial semi-State companies.  We believe that competition is good for the economy.  We are opposed to non-essential monopolies in the long-term, be they private or public.  We are confident that State companies have the skills to meet the competition which faces them.  However, the pace and quantity of entry of new players to sectors must be carefully managed and in full consultation with the social partners.  This side of the House and the leader of my party were instrumental in developing the social partnership model.  It is madness to try to make major changes in State companies and sell off large chunks of companies without the precise, negotiated agreement of the social partners who have played a strong role in the management of change in these companies.</P>
    <P>What is happening at present in CIE, Aer Lingus and a raft of other State companies is that the social partnership model is being ignored. Instead, we have Ministers who will not meet unions; management laying down diktats, supported by the Minister, Deputy Dukes, and the Government; and the secret sale of shares in companies without any debate in this House or documentation laid before it or any consultants' reports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister continues to ignore the social partnership model for change in State companies, I am certain he will regret it.</P>
      <P>We will also look at the potential of restructured State companies as Irish multinational enterprises with significant export or overseas sales opportunities.  Their success and development will have to be considered from the same perspective as growing indigenous companies. Some, such as Aer Rianta, ESB and Telecom Éireann, have developed but there has not been a clear Government policy to promote them and allow them to expand overseas through offensive strategic programmes.</P>
      <P>Our aim is to reinvigorate the State sector and to create a renaissance in that sector.  That is why our motion states there is a necessity to develop a strategic business plan for CIE and the semi-State sector.  The Minister should bring forward policy initiatives and a White Paper to chart a future course for the development of semi-State companies.  Rather than negative comment from the Minister, we need positive action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> We tabled this motion because the level of distrust among workers in semi-State companies today is at an all time high.  They do not trust the Minister for Transport, Energy or Communications or the Government.  This Government has overseen the secret sale of shares in Telecom Éireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and stands idly by while the new partner in Telecom Éireann says it wants to sell the rest of the shares within three years. There has been no comment on that from the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications or any other party in this House.  I can only assume from their silence that that was on the agenda and agreed from the first day.</P>
      <P>The motion refers in particular to CIE.  The industrial relations atmosphere in CIE today is septic.  The Minister is sitting back and is not prepared to meet the unions or to take a hands on approach to resolving it.  He does not have a transport policy for that company or a vision of where it should be going, but only an insensitive demand for cost cutting with no negotiations.</P>
      <P>I met the unions in the past few days and they told me they cannot meet management.  They have difficulty in sitting down with management as long as it insists that changes will be made on a take it or leave it basis.  Is the Minister going to preside over a situation in CIE where the management lays down precisely what will be done and leaves no scope for negotiating that plan? Will he let the board lay down precisely what is going to happen for the workers in CIE with no room for negotiation or will he tell the board that it must negotiate change because changes were negotiated in that company for many years and were made?</P>
      <P>The Minister has been studying his brief for two months.  It is now time for him to get some work done in the very short time left to him as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. He should begin by ending the problems in CIE and restoring morale in that company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The present industrial turmoil in CIE, to which Deputy Brennan has referred, is largely the result of the shabby treatment to which the workers have been subjected for the past two years since the rainbow Government of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left took over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first target of the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, was the board of the company, appointed by his predecessors, and in particular the chairman. The company got caught up in an unseemly political controversy which had nothing to do with the staff, unions or management or its core business, but which took up so much time over many months that many other issues were left on the back burner.  The former Minister knew all about cosy cartels, but people who live in glasshouse extensions should not throw stones.  The <Col N="473" /> whole sorry business was damaging to confidence in the company.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have legitimately been concerned about keeping down costs in CIE and limiting the annual expense to the taxpayer. Given the need for some ongoing State support for an essential public service &mdash; I refer mainly to railways &mdash; this was no excuse for trying to deny bus and railway workers their basic entitlements under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> last autumn.  Where there is an exceptional situation, as happened in Aer Lingus a few years ago and in which I was deeply involved, workers are willing to make temporary sacrifices.</P>
    <P>In many years dealing with the industrial relations problems of the State from March 1987 to end 1994, I found State workers extremely reasonable about these issues.  They fight their case but are logical and understand the threats, strains, competition and difficulties in companies and always want to make the best decision for their workers and the company.  On many occasions they made satisfactory arrangements with me to which they were prepared to adhere. It was totally lacking in realism to suppose that workers would continually negotiate major productivity improvements just in order to get their basic pay entitlement.  I do not know who thought it up but that, effectively, is what happened and it is totally unjust, unreasonable, illogical and should be forgotten.  I blame the former Minister and the Government for encouraging the board to take up an untenable position.  All this inevitably soured industrial relations in the company before serious productivity discussions could begin.  Realism was lacking.</P>
    <P>Bus and train drivers are responsible for the safety of their passengers and the public and have demanding jobs.  The way in which total pay is calculated may be a bit antiquated, relating in some cases to work practices of a bygone era.  The bottom line is that, from the figures I have seen, I do not think either bus or train drivers are overpaid by any stretch of the imagination.  There may be a case for rationalising how pay is calculated so that it fully reflects modern working conditions. The staff in these jobs have to adjust to modern working conditions and do so to the best of their ability.  Train drivers have moved to the DART with all the problems that entails.  The Minister will realise it is no longer a question of operating the lines and that many other things happen in the modern way of life which put stress and strain on drivers.</P>
    <P>Public transport provision is a three way contract between the companies, the public and the Government.  To keep this country on the move public transport, both bus and rail, have an important role to play.  CIE has always been an easy target.  Those who criticise public transport most are often those who rarely, if ever, use it. Within the resources available, those who work in the different CIE companies try to provide a quality service.  When they do not, when buses are delayed by traffic congestion, it is often not <Col N="474" /> the fault of anyone in the company.  In the railways, and in recent times on the buses, the industrial relations record has been a good one.  It was not always like that.  When I was involved with many of its excellent negotiators at all levels they were reasonable and could not be described as they had been in previous years.  By and large we are not subjected to prolonged public service strikes and social partnership has sought to make that a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will continue to support larnród Éireann, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  The present Minister, when Minister for Finance, will remember the controversies that contributed to an economic plan called Building on Reality, published in 1984 by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition. It contained the sentence: &ldquo;There will be no new substantial investment in railways&rdquo;, thus condemning them to a slow and lingering death. Fianna Fáil reversed that policy when we returned to office in 1987 and in 1994 negotiated with the European Union the largest investment in public transport that we have ever seen here. It amounted to nearly £600 million in mainline rail and public transport for the capital.  Later this year a new modernised Dublin-Belfast rail service will be opened as a result of Fianna Fáil's success in those negotiations.</P>
    <P>CIE needs investment to remain competitive but also to help the country as a whole to be competitive. I have no doubt that productivity negotiations conducted on a sensible basis could produce gains for the workers, the company and the travelling public without placing further burdens on the taxpayer.  I have no doubt those involved in negotiations carried out in a proper fashion on behalf of staff would be glad to discuss these matters.</P>
    <P>Attempts at brow-beating never work.  The history of industrial relations in the State is such that any time attempts were made to force things they were bitterly rejected by staff.  We all know how vital a functioning public transport system is to this country.  An openness to positive change, which will have full Government support, is the frame of mind we need to create on all sides.  We have ambitious plans to extend and improve public transport.  In order to carry them out we will need, and I know we will get, the full co-operation of both management and unions.</P>
    <P>This is a small country.  In some areas we have had to devise our own model of advancement. The combination of economic policies introduced since 1987 on the basis of social partnership create a careful balance between wage moderation and tax cuts and between development initiatives and financial prudence.  They have laid the basis for the longest periods of sustained growth with a high rate of job creation.</P>
    <P>Changing conditions and European competition rules, in addition to the demands of the public for improvements in the service, will pose formidable challenges to all who work in our State companies.  These companies are of key strategic importance and need the support of a <Col N="475" /> friendly and sympathetic Government in helping them to overcome their difficulties and to adapt. Something they do not need is an unfriendly response.  In this motion we ask the Government to stop this type of response.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dukes, must have been horrified when he examined the files at some of what has happened in the past two years.  I am not here to criticise the Minister who has been in office for a short period but I ask him to adopt a different attitude.  My starting point, as we move forward, is the comprehensive statement on the role of the semi-State sector contained in the Programme for Economic and Social Progress which I negotiated.  There is no question, so far as Fianna Fáil is concerned, of dumping or getting rid of State companies just for the sake of it.  Pragmatism, not ideology of either right or left, will best serve the State companies and their customers. When it comes to the crunch, the ideological bark is often worst than the bite.  Where vital services are concerned, the interests of consumers and workers are paramount.  Fianna Fáil will put people before politics.  Workers need to have a greater sense of ownership in the companies in which they are employed and people need to have confidence in the service.  Structures are secondary.  The future can be exciting if we all work together and put behind us the divisive spirit which has been a feature of the Government's policy towards some semi-State companies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;notes with approval the Government's major investment programme in the development and enhancement of public transport; commends the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications on the significant progress which has been achieved in implementing the mainline rail investment programme and the public transport elements of the strategy recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative; supports the proposed introduction of public service contracts which will place the Government's financial relationship with CIE on a firm, medium term, objective and transparent basis; acknowledges that CIE has to reduce its cost base and improve its efficiency if it is to remain viable and competitive; agrees that the necessary change has to be achieved through direct negotiations between CIE management and unions with the assistance of the State's industrial relations machinery and that ministerial intervention would inhibit rather than assist these negotiations; considers that industrial action will only damage the interests of CIE and its workforce and accordingly urges CIE management and unions to negotiate neces <Col N="476" /> sary change on a basis of partnership and realism in keeping with Partnership 2000 and the Labour Court recommendation of 2 December 1996.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was going to dignify Deputy Brennan's comments by describing them as an attack but instead I will describe them as utterly futile.  He calls in his motion for initiatives and a White Paper to chart a future course for the development of the semi-State sector, yet he spent some time telling us how Fianna Fáil is so pragmatic in relation to the semi-State sector that it will deal with it on a case by case basis.  What does he want?  Does he want a mythical, illusory strategy for all the semi-State sector or does he want to deal with it on a case by case basis?  It is very interesting that he should have said the Aer Lingus dispute is silly.  I hope he is called to account for using that adjective.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A particular irony about this motion, with <Col N="477" /> which no one else in Fianna Fáil seemed ready to associate themselves until he wheeled Deputy Ahern into the House tonight&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The irony is that the State bodies to which the motion refers were set up in the main by Sean Lemass, who would turn in his grave if he knew the position his party's spokesman is taking in relation to State bodies.  Those bodies were set up as commercial State bodies.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; because that is what they always should have been and must be if they are to survive in an era of increased competition and deregulation, driven from Europe in the best interests of consumers.</P>
      <P>The second substantive point I want to make about these bodies is that they were set up as corporations or companies to ensure their independence from Ministers, Departments and politicians in their day-to-day operations.  All Governments have adopted a &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; approach in dealing with commercial issues in State bodies and even more so in dealing with industrial relations matters within them.  There are institutions and machinery of State for dealing with industrial relations matters in all companies, including State bodies.  Even though Deputy Brennan may not have noticed it when he was a member of a Government, it has been the tradition of successive Governments to encourage employees in all companies to avail of this machinery to solve industrial relations problems. I intend to keep to that tradition.  In this spirit, I am glad management and unions in all three CIE operating companies are using that machinery.</P>
      <P>Political intervention would only make the atmosphere more fraught.  The &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; approach which Deputy Brennan advocates from the safety of the Opposition benches is something to which Fianna Fáil Ministers for Transport rightly displayed a marked aversion in the past. For example, Deputy Cowen deployed the &ldquo;masterly inactivity&rdquo; principle to good effect when a national rail strike was threatened during his period in the office I hold.</P>

    <P>All State bodies, with the exception of CIE, have had to deal with the effects of EU deregulation on their sectors.  For some, such as Aer Lingus, it is already full blown deregulation, while for others, such as Telecom, it is partial deregulation now but with the prospect of full deregulation soon.  Management and trade unions in these bodies accepted the inevitability of change and agreed on measures to manage it.  It was not easy to achieve this agreement, particularly as it impacted on work practices and, consequently, on employee earnings, which had developed over decades under monopolistic shelter.  Employees in these bodies and their trade unions realised that they had to adapt or die in the new competitive environment they were facing.  I am glad to say that they adapted and used the Labour <Col N="478" /> Relations Commission and the Labour Court to help them do so.  I acknowledge the tremendous work done in this area by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which has shown a much greater grasp of the reality facing us than Deputy Brennan.</P>
    <P>Land transport is the last of these sectors to have to cope with deregulation.  The pace of deregulation has been slower than some member states of the EU would wish but there is no gainsaying that the process has already commenced and will accelerate over the coming years.  CIE management is already on record as saying it is not afraid of deregulation, nor should it be, and has informed me of its very clear strategic policies to cope with it as it comes.  These strategies are essentially investment driven, with substantial financial support from the EU and Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is the shared vision of CIE management and trade unions to make CIE a profitable customer focused company, delivering high quality public transport services at competitive prices to its customers. This was clearly set out in a joint communiqué from CIE trade unions and management to all CIE staff last September.  Deputy Brennan would do well to read that communiqué. I will quote some passages from the communiqué for the Deputy's delectation; it might encourage him to read all of it.</P>
    <P>They [trade union officials] and their members saw at first hand the effects of these and other changes in CIE's Markets [referring to deregulation].  They were concerned that these were not being addressed in a more urgent manner.</P>
    <P>The Trade Unions noted new pressures which are exerting themselves.</P>
    <P>The threat of deregulation driven by European integration.</P>
    <P>European restraint on State Aid.</P>
    <P>Public Procurement policy changes.</P>
    <P>Government is becoming intolerant of poor performance in some parts of the State Sector and is insisting on the adoption of more commercially focused performance criteria by these companies.</P>
    <P>The CIE unions accept that in order to meet the new competitive pressures and to survive in the new changed economic environment in which they will be required to operate CIE, like all Commercial Semi-State companies, must undertake the same type of re-organisation and restructuring as was embarked upon by both private and public companies over the past decade.  This has involved:</P>
    <P>Significant changes in management style</P>
    <P>changes in industrial relations processes</P>
    <P>changes in worker and union attitudes to meet the challenges ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> There is much more in the communiqué in which Deputy Brennan will find a far more enlightened attitude and insight into what faces the CIE group of companies now, than anything he has said here tonight.</P>
    <P>I seek to build on and develop the positive legacy of programmes and policies on public transport which I inherited from my predecessors.  I have no difficulty in acknowledging the positive contributions, both in practical and in policy terms, which have been made in public transport by several of my recent predecessors.  It is a pity to see those worthwhile contributions devalued by the kind of cynical political opportunism engaged in tonight by Deputy Brennan with his motion.  It is a pity to see the notable achievement of Deputy Cowen, when he was Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, in setting up the operational programme which is the framework for a major part of the investment programme now being engaged in by CIE, being devalued by Deputy Brennan.</P>
    <P>As a result of recent positive and progressive policies on public transport which this Government has developed and pursued with great vigour, the CIE group is undertaking levels of capital investment which would have been undreamed of ten years ago.  The projected investment programme for public transport between 1994 and 1999 amounts to more than £735 million and represents an unprecedented commitment by the Government to renew and develop public transport.  CIE has already received £50 million in EU aid under the current round of Structural and Cohesion Fund assistance and significant further transfers will follow in line with the Operational Programme for Transport until the end of the decade.  In addition, CIE receives annual subvention from the Exchequer which has been running at approximately £100 million in recent years.</P>
    <P>That CIE investment programme, which is well tailored &mdash; I pay tribute to all those involved in setting it up including Deputy Cowen, the management and the unions in CIE &mdash; makes maximum use of EU Structural and Cohesion Fund assistance.  However, neither the European Union nor the Exchequer can fully support CIE's investment needs.  The CIE group must find a significant proportion of the necessary investment from its own resources.  If it cannot provide the required matching finance, it will not be in a position to draw down all of the funding available from European Union sources.  In addition to EU funded investment, CIE is also committed to substantial capital expenditure which will have to be funded entirely from its own resources.  For example, £90 million of the planned £275 million mainline rail investment programme will not benefit from EU co-financing.  The company's bus fleet replacement programme must be funded entirely from CIE's own resources.  The CIE group is not in a position to fund investment through increased borrowing.  The group's borrowings <Col N="480" /> now stand at approximately £200 million. Servicing that level of borrowing is a serious enough burden on the group's finances and the CIE board has rightly decided that borrowing above and beyond that level cannot be undertaken. In addition, Members of this House and outside groups are constantly pressing for further worthwhile projects which are not included in the investment programme simply because all the available funding has been taken up.  That is not a criticism of the projects but there is a limit to the resources that are available.</P>
    <P>CIE's financial problems cannot be resolved by providing extra State subvention.  The idea that the Exchequer could provide additional subvention of £40 million to £50 million every year on an indefinite basis is both unrealistic and undesirable. If CIE is to become competitive, it must reduce its costs.  More State funds now to subsidise operational inefficiencies or restrictive work practices would simply postpone the necessary cost reductions, and at a considerable waste of scarce taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>The continuing need for restraint in public expenditure, arising from the Maastricht convergence criteria to which we are told Fianna Fáil also adheres, rules out any open-ended commitment to extra State financial support to fund an ever-increasing gap between CIE's expenditure and revenue.  Having said that, the 1997 subvention to CIE has increased by more than the rate of inflation for the first time in many years.  At £105 million, it is more than £5.5 million more than last year's provision.  This will provide a good basis on which to proceed with the introduction of public service contracts between the State and CIE.</P>
    <P>The other obvious quick fix would be to increase bus and train fares substantially.  I doubt if even Deputy Brennan is so native as to advocate that as a solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Fare increases of the order required are not the solution either as they would simply drive CIE's customers away to other modes of transport and to lower cost private sector competitors.  Such a development would be totally counterproductive, damaging the interests of CIE and its staff and undermining the Government's objective of attracting more users to public transport, reducing private car usage and relieving traffic congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; to the problems facing CIE.  The competitive climate within which the group operates is changing in line with what has happened in the air transport and road haulage sectors and in energy and telecommunications. The key feature of these changes is liberalisation which simply means the introduction of market forces and competition.  What this means for CIE is that competitors will seek to attract customers away from the company.  The competition CIE already faces will increase and intensify and the <Col N="481" /> changing regulatory framework will encourage this in the interest of the customer.  CIE will have to compete on cost, price and quality if it is to keep its customers.  I do not think Deputy Brennan could disagree with that.  The liberalisation of the aviation and road haulage sectors, to which I have just referred, has brought clear benefits for the economy and the individual consumer. While the pace of change in the public transport sector may be slower, the same imperatives are at work and the ultimate outcome is equally inevitable.  The only question is how quickly change will happen and how well prepared we will be to meet the challenges that change will bring.</P>
    <P>There is a growing recognition throughout Europe of the important part public transport can play in tackling the twin problems of congestion and environmental pollution.  There is also a recognition that this can only be accomplished on a basis which recognises the realities of the market place, and that it will require a fundamental reorganisation of the structures of public transport. A number of European countries have already embarked on this course.  Major restructuring of public transport has taken place in Britain; other countries like Germany, Sweden, France and the Netherlands either already have or are in the process of modifying the structures of their public transport systems.  The models may differ from one country to another but the direction of change is the same in every case.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish and simplistic to think the Irish economy or any significant part of it, such as the public transport sector, could ignore these developments.  Apart from anything else, the evolution of European Union policies and legal instruments will ensure that public transport liberalisation will happen here the same as everywhere else in the European Union.  While liberalisation will inevitably involve a period of painful and difficult adjustment in the sector, the degree of pain and level of difficulty will depend, in large measure, on the way those most affected decide to address the issues.  If the path chosen is that of denial, non-participation or blind resistance to change, then change, when it inevitably comes, will find the sector unprepared and new low cost market entrants, be they domestic or foreign based, will rapidly and permanently erode CIE's customer base.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan made an extraordinary suggestion that the pace of entry of new competitors must be carefully managed in consultation with the social partners. In saying that Deputy Brennan dribbled a bibful.  If we had a liberalised market, subject only to the type of regulation proposed by Deputy Brennan, there would be no question of carefully managing the pace of entry of new competitors.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil motion calls for more strategic planning and even, God help us, a White Paper. Deputy Brennan regularly uses the phrase &ldquo;paralysis by analysis&rdquo;.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's strategic objectives for the CIE group are to provide effective and high quality public transport services, to give value for <Col N="484" /> money to the public transport user and the taxpayer, to develop a new industrial relations culture based on realism, partnership and co-operation, to be more competitive and consumer driven and to meet the needs of customers.  I challenge Deputy Brennan and other members of Fianna Fáil to say they disagree with any one of those objectives or to outline a way to achieve them other than through investment-led growth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>Despite this, Fianna Fáil is calling for a strategic plan and a White Paper, the stock response of people more interested in platitudes and cheap jibes than the development of the company.  Politically motivated pot stirring of the kind indulged in by Deputy Brennan is bad for CIE workers, the companies involved, passengers, users of the services and for the country.  I hope at the end of this debate we will finally see the dawning of realisation.  I am not sure his colleagues can be blamed equally in this regard.  Most of them have a much better view of the reality.  I hope Deputy Brennan realises that if we are to have investment led growth in a company such as CIE, the cost base must be right.  It must match competition. The jingoism in which Deputy Brennan indulged is against the interests of the company, its workers and customers.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Deputy Dukes made an interesting contribution.  The Minister referred to the necessary changes being achieved through direct negotiations between CIE management and unions.  Having met many workers from Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, I am informed that there have been no negotiations.  This is amazing as we were told that the vision plan for CIE was proposed by the workers.  While CIE management has had numerous meetings it appears that the views of workers were not taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic pay of CIE workers is among the lowest in the semi-State sector.  Many public meetings take place in the run up to a general election.  This and water charges, the two biggest <Col N="485" /> issues in my constituency at present, will be discussed at them.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the cost review was to cease freight train operations on the Limerick-Claremorris line where savings of £250,000 would be effected.  The Minister is aware that Fr. Micheál McGréil and Councillor Martin O'Toole are two members of the Western InterCounty Railway Committee.  For many years they have attempted not only to maintain but to upgrade the line especially between Collooney and Sligo.</P>
    <P>The headline announcing that 800 jobs were to be lost at Iarnród Éireann, at a saving of £30 million, was a major shock.  Built into the proposal was the closure of two freight lines in the west together with 21 small freight depots.  There was much confusion about this because the Minister rightly said that while we obtained funding for the mainline rails, including upgrading of all the stations, there was another proposal to close the Limerick-Claremorris line.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who hoped that, given the small amount of money involved, the CollooneyLimerick line could be upgraded and possibly opened for a passenger service.  CIE has stated that it is not present policy to bring this western line into operation, but it will keep it in mind for the possible diversion of second-hand tracks to improve the line.  As we have heard nothing but comments on mainline rail, will the Minister indicate if this will happen?</P>
    <P>I questioned CIE on a number of occasions as to the possibility of increased timber transportation on these lines especially to Clonmel and Waterford.  I was told that Iarnród Éireann has been involved in the haulage of timber since 1994 and that 90,000 tons were transported to the Medite and Louisiana-Pacific plants in Clonmel and Waterford.  It is hoped to transport more than that, possibly over 100,000 tons, this year.  In addition, Iarnród Éireann plan to upgrade the stations in Tuam and Gort and to introduce railcars on the line.  Given this, we are receiving confusing signals from the company regarding its proposals for the railways in the western region.</P>
    <P>I hope that Coillte will decide to make greater use of the railway for timber transport.  In my meetings with the company.  I have found its approach positive.  It has referred to the transport of 100,000 tons this year, indeed given the Masonite project in County Leitrim, the Sligo-Leitrim area alone will produce 50,000 tons in 1997.  Great possibilities exist, given the transport of timber and timber residue, goods such as cement, coal, oil and the fish processing plants in the western region.  According to Coillte, four trains were used last year, whereas nine trains will be in operation per day in 1997.</P>
    <P>The transporting of heavy goods on the railways would also have the beneficial effect of saving our roads infrastructure.  According to <i>The Mayo News</i> of 5 July 1995, the Minister for Tourism and Trade announced the possible reopening of the Claremorris-Collooney railway line.  He is very positive about it.  I have met many previous <Col N="486" /> Ministers and I look forward to meeting the Minister. I hope he will support this project.</P>
    <P>Public and business support for our railways is needed.  The commercial State bodies report of May 1995 referred to the need to increase the overall numbers on the mainline rail.  It mentioned that the DART service had levelled off as regards passenger numbers.  There is great competition from car and coach transport.  In the context of European countries, Ireland has the second lowest number of railway passengers per head of population.  Many of the issues referred to in the report could be addressed if the train service was improved.  I look forward to the funding for mainline rail referred to by the Minister.</P>
    <P>More carriages are required on the Western services in addition to more flexible timetables, especially at weekends because there continues to be bottlenecks on the Galway road.  The business sector can also help, indeed assistance has been pledged at chamber of commerce meetings I have attended to ensure that a service is maintained on the railways.</P>
    <P>There is still a threat to the freight line from the cost review, despite lifting the deadline of 20 December.  An answer is needed on this.  If we cannot get the extra business and the line must go then jobs will be lost.  I have attended meetings, for example in Gort, where people spoke about the time when students commuted to second level schools by train and how they would do so again if the service was provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for western development, Deputy Carey, has attended many meetings with me.  I know he is very committed to providing funding.  He has referred to the provision of £200 million to help with the development of the infrastructure in the west.  I hope he will play his part to ensure that this part of the western development corridor will be maintained. In addition to passenger and freight considerations, it is a tourism project.</P>
    <P>The link from Rosslare to Waterford, Limerick and Sligo is important, both from the road and rail point of view.  There are also important links at Shannon Airport and at Horan International Airport, Knock.  If we are to have proper planning in the western region we must have this infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I hope this stretch of railway will not meet the fate of other railways, some of which were taken up years ago.  Indeed a stretch of this railway north of Tuam was to be taken up but was saved by the intervention of the then Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan.  The line was maintained with the help of FÁS schemes and voluntary efforts.  CIE and Iarnród Éireann had nothing to do with it, although they sent a bill for maintenance when none was undertaken.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will support this regional route and that there will be negotiations on the difficulties in Iarnród Éireann.  I hope there will be meaningful negotiations because if it is a case <Col N="487" /> of &ldquo;take it or leave it,&rdquo; no progress will be made. The Minister should intervene at this point and take a hands on approach to the difficulty.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his recent appointment.  I wish him well in what may be a brief tenure in office.  He has settled into a routine of invective with rapidity since his elevation to the Front Bench and I was amazed to hear him mention Mr. Seán Lemass.  I read the 1944 debate when the transport Bill was introduced to establish CIE.  It is obvious that the intention of Mr. Lemass was to set up a comprehensive, national, public transport service which would pay its way.  I do not understand how the Minister could suggest or insinuate that Mr. Lemass was not a hands-on politician.

      <P>The motion calls for strategic planning for CIE.  I noticed the Minister set out the strategic objectives of the Government for the CIE group, one of which is to develop a new industrial relations culture based on realism, partnership and co-operation.  I do not know on what planet the Minister has been recently because, as a Deputy with a substantial number of CIE group employees in my constituency, I have not found that realism, partnership and co-operation characterises current industrial relations in the CIE group.  That serious difficulty does not simply derive from problems relating to pay and conditions of service, but it is part of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody accepts that bus workers have a responsible task to perform.  Anybody who travels round the city at regular intervals notices how enormously difficult is their work, but the effect of the proposed rationalisation for bus workers in the city will be a substantial decrease in their remuneration.  The Minister hardly expects a group of workers in a highly responsible position to accept a reduction in their remuneration when <Col N="488" /> the Government is considering making special provision for nurses.  That matter has not yet been settled but I am sure it will be resolved before the tenure of office of the current Minister ends.  The CIE group and the Government must consider this issue because bus workers have a very responsible job and, in substance, it has been proposed that their remuneration should be reduced.</P>
    <P>Apart from the specific issue relating to the pay and conditions of bus drivers, I detect a more general problem in the workforce of the CIE group.  They are far from convinced that the Government &mdash; this also applies to successive Governments &mdash; has entertained an overall strategic plan for public transport in the State.  The Luas project has generated great scepticism in the city about whether there are strategic objectives for the public transport system.  There is a view that the amount of investment which Luas will entail and the limited coverage it will provide in terms of public transport in the city will mean the other forms of public transport, such as bus or conventional rail services, will be starved of resources.  They will not be in a position to provide the type of public transport system the city obviously needs when one considers the amount of traffic congestion.  This view is widely entertained among CIE group workers in Dublin and they need specific reassurance from the shareholder on the matter.  The substantial amounts of money involved must be of interest and the purpose of the plea for a strategic plan or a White Paper on the industry is to make clear the longterm objectives and the relative priorities of various planned investments.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about safety with regard to the cost cutting plan for the railway service.  My party's spokesperson outlined the extent of the cuts involved.  The rail service in the State has a bad safety record given the number of serious incidents in the last two decades.  Is there wisdom in allowing further redundancies in the rail service? Although the Minister outlined the investment programme for the rail service, there is no investment programme in place to extend and improve the suburban rail lines.</P>
    <P>Given the extension of Dublin into the surrounding counties of Kildare and Meath and the vast increase in population in the western periphery of the city, there is scope for substantial investment in the conventional rail network involving improved carriages, the use of the tunnel around the old loop line to Amiens Street and the development of park and ride facilities for country commuters who could leave their cars at suburban stations and travel by train into the city. None of this appears to be planned by CIE and I question the strategic quality of the decision making in CIE.  This is why my party is calling for a White Paper.</P>
    <P>Regarding Dublin Bus, I congratulate CIE for its work to date on the quality bus corridors which have provided substantial consumer satisfaction. The general view in the Dublin area is that it is an excellent innovation.  However, there <Col N="489" /> is room for an extension and intensification of that approach in the form of the reservation of road space for buses.  This would cost a great deal less than the amount earmarked for the Luas project although, in substance, it would have the same effect.  There would be a reserved, dedicated public transport route without overhead cables, tracks on the ground or half the city grid-locked for three years.  There would be a much more efficient public transport service without any of those consequences.  The development of the bus service in Dublin is the correct route to take in terms of making the public transport service as efficient, accessible and consumer friendly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Three years ago, in February 1994, I raised my concerns with the then Minister for Justice at the apparent abuse of her ministerial power about the overuse of the petition system. At that time there was growing public and judicial concern that the justice system was being undermined by the excessive use of the power to reduce fines and sentences under section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act.  I pointed out that, in the previous two year period, as many as 8,500 petitions had succeeded.  It was clear that the constitutional and statutory power of the Minister for Justice to remit sentences and penalties had developed in a most unhealthy fashion.  What was intended as a measure to be used sparingly was now routine, and fines and penalties were being routinely set aside or reduced, often without the normal appeals procedure to a higher court being exhausted.  The penalties handed down by our courts, including imprisonment, were being reduced or set aside in an unaccountable fashion and with no consultation with the court that imposed the penalty in the first place.</P>
      <P>I argued then for a curbing of the routine administrative unravelling of court orders.  The then Minister was unrepentant and it was only after a retired District Court judge challenged the manner of the exercise of the Minister's powers in the High Court that in April 1995 the High Court ruled that this parallel system of justice should be operated in the way intended under the Act, that is, sparingly.  The present Minister did not appeal this decision.  One month later, on 11 May, when I asked her what new procedures she would introduce to comply with the judgement of the court, she stated that she was having the matter considered and had commenced an examination of the practicalities involved.  What has happened in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read last week, two years later, that a District Court judge accused the present Minister for Justice of interfering with the courts in the manner in which she dealt with a petition which had come from her Fine Gael colleague, Deputy Theresa Ahearn.  The story goes back to a court order of 27 July 1992 where a three month term of imprisonment had not been executed and had lapsed during a lengthy petition process, and four and a half years later was before the judge for renewal. This was a sentence which had been upheld on appeal and had been refused an earlier petition to the previous Minister, but with the change of Government it arrived on the current Minister's desk for repetition.  The Minister, in turn, wrote to her Fine Gael colleague saying that she was <Col N="493" /> making further inquiries and added: &ldquo;This acknowledgement may be produced to the Garda as confirmation that the above sentence is under repetition.&rdquo;  That letter was dated 10 April 1995. A copy of it was passed to the local station in Ardfinnan.  It transpired that the Minister's letter had the effect of putting a stay on the order. Committal orders are meant to be different from fines.  They are court commands, not open to the discretion of gardaí to execute or not to execute.</P>
    <P>Since the High Court decision in 1995, the volume of petitions finalised has reduced by all accounts, and that is how it should be.  However, my concern is that because no action was taken to formalise the petition system to comply with the 1995 High Court decision, a halfway house has developed.  Petitions continue to come in.  A letter is sent from the Minister to the petitioner saying the matter is being considered and pointing out that the letter may be provided to the Garda as proof that the matter is under petition. By this method or ruse many warrants are going out of date and I am told judges are threatening not to renew them.  Will the Minister indicate what legal ground there is for saying that the filing of a petition postpones a warrant?  How many warrants have gone out of date while in this limbo land under petition?</P>
    <P>In a Dáil reply of 22 January it was stated that in 1996 a total of 295 petitions were finalised and there were just over 5,000 petitions on hand.  The reply went on to say that statistics in relation to cases where warrants were executed while a petition result was pending were not kept.  Neither, I assume, will figures be kept of the number of warrants that have gone out of date or lapsed while under petition.  Will the Minister confirm that many warrants have lapsed because a ministerial letter is now being used as a ruse to delay the execution of warrants in the hope that it will not be renewed when lapsed?  Will she confirm that her practice of writing to a petitioner stating that her letter may be produced to the Garda with the effect that it will not execute the warrant, in other words, putting a practical stay on the execution of a warrant, is a circumvention of the High Court judgment in the Geoghegan case of April 1995?  How can it be that almost two years after a High Court judge ordered that this parallel system of justice by way of the petition system had to be used sparingly, and nearly two years after the Minister's promise that she was having the whole matter considered, she has still not come forward with a proper regulatory position on the matter of petitions?</P>
    <P>The President of the District Court said, and I agree with him, that a lack of action on these orders dilutes the power of judges and damages their standing.  Sentences and penalties are being modified and set aside by delay and default by the petition system, as it is currently operating under this Minister.  The Ardfinnan case is a shabby example of where the order of the court was clearly undermined by a combination of politics and sluggish administration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> How many orders are lying unnoticed in Garda stations, unexecuted, paralysed by a letter of acknowledgement from the Minister for Justice, out of date and possibly unrenewable?  Why has it taken the Minister so long to bring about the changes required by the High Court decision in April 1995?  Is it not dishonest of politicians to criticise judges for inadequate sentences while at the same time retaining a method of privately setting aside sentences and penalties handed down in public by an independent Judiciary?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind Deputies of the background to the situation which has arisen in relation to the petitions procedure.</P>
      <P>In February 1994 a judge of the District Court, Judge Patrick J. Brennan, challenged the power vested in the Minister for Justice under section 23(3) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 and the delegated authority of Government dated 30 March 1951.  The District Court judge was of the opinion that the then Minister, in exercising her executive power in four specific cases heard by him in open court, had interfered with his judicial independence.  Consequently, he made application to the High Court seeking judicial review of the petitions procedure and was granted leave to do so by Mr. Justice Flood on 22 February 1994.  The case came before Mr. Justice Geoghegan on 7 February 1995.  He made a declaration that the powers were not properly exercised by the then Minister in the four particular cases used by District Judge Brennan to demonstrate his case.  However, Mr. Justice Geoghegan upheld the constitutionality of the power vested in the Minister for Justice under section 23(3) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.</P>
      <P>There is no improper use now of the petitions system by the Minister for Justice.  The Geoghegan judgment made it quite clear that the Minister could continue to exercise her powers, albeit sparingly and for special reasons, with proper maintenance of records.  The ruling does not prevent defendants lodging petitions.  It only refers to the exercise of the Minister's power.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the judgment the Minister exercised her powers in a very small number of cases where she was satisfied that they came within the scope of the judgment.  There is a large backlog of cases built up and these are gradually being dealt with in accordance with Mr. Justice Geoghegan's ruling.  As already stated, the judgment ruled that the Minister's power should be used sparingly and for special reasons.</P>
      <P>The Minister is finalising guidelines which will give comprehensive details of the circumstances in which the opening of a petition will be considered. These guidelines will be publicised so that members of the public will be fully aware of how the petitions system will work.  Public representatives, the Garda Síochána etc. will also be notified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> The position in relation to the status of a fine, which is the subject of a petition, is that a petition does not place a stay on the order of the District Court judge.  Notwithstanding the fact that a petition has been lodged by or on behalf of the defendant, if the fine is not paid within the time allowed by the judge a warrant will be issued to enforce the court's decision, as is the normal procedure in cases where fines are not paid on time. Section 1(1) of the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1991 provides that a warrant must be issued within six months of the due date of payment of the fine imposed.  There is no statutory requirement on the Garda Síochána to defer enforcement of a warrant in respect of a fine which is under petition. However, a practice has built up over the years that upon production of an official acknowledgement of a petition the gardaí normally await the outcome of that petition.  It should be noted that, in some cases, petitions come to the Minister because the gardaí inform people of their right to petition.  In considering granting a petition the Minister seeks a Garda report and, from time to time, the gardaí recommend mitigation.</P>
    <P>Since the Geoghegan judgment, the letter to an applicant informing them of the opening of a petition contains the information that &ldquo;this letter does not prejudice the Gardaí's power to execute the warrant&rdquo; and it also informs people that the Geoghegan judgment will be taken into account when considering their petition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It concerns the changes that came into effect since the introduction of the one parent family arrangement on 1 or 2 January last.  Those in receipt of deserted wife's benefit who applied to participate in a community employment scheme are obliged by the new regulations to change from deserted wife's benefit to the one parent family payment. Under the present arrangement it is possible for a recipient of deserted wife's benefit to earn up to £10,000 and still retain entitlement to the full payment.  Under the one parent family arrangement the amount of payment is considerably reduced and when payment ceases in respect of dependent children the income position of the recipient deteriorates rapidly.</P>
      <P>The amount received in respect of the one parent family payment by such recipients, who are in receipt of income under the community employment scheme, is considerably less than the amount they would normally receive in respect of deserted wife's benefit.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on the difficulties faced by such recipients? There seems to be an anomaly when someone on deserted wife's benefit can earn up to the substantial amount of £10,000 and retain the benefit when someone on a CE scheme has to change to OPFP.</P>

      <P>Community Employment or CE is designed primarily to prevent marginalisation among long-term unemployed people whose principal or only source of income is a social welfare payment.  Its objective is to provide temporary work experience opportunities together with some training that would enhance the employment prospects of those at whom the programme is targeted.</P>
      <P>Under the CE programme, public sector and voluntary organisations are grant-aided by FÁS in respect of sponsoring a CE project and they in turn benefit in a secondary way by being able to carry out worthwhile work which they could not otherwise undertake.  Suitable projects would be those that can be shown to respond to a clearly identified community need and which also develop the work skills of participants, thereby enhancing their prospect of mainstream employment.</P>
      <P>As limited resources do not make it possible to provide CE for all long-term unemployed people, it is necessary to target the programme at those most in need, such as persons in receipt of an unemployment compensation payment or persons in receipt of certain means tested social welfare payments.  In line with this, both men and women, married or single, who fulfil any of the following eligibility criteria can participate on CE.  The part-time integration option is one year and is for: those over 21 years and on unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance for at least 12 months; those over 21 years and on one parent family payment or OPFP for more than 12 months; and special categories such as those referred by the NRB, travellers on the live register or on OPFP for at least 12 months.</P>
      <P>The part-time job option is a three-year option. It is for those over 35 years and in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit for more than three years; those over 35 years and on OPFP for more than three years; and special categories such as those referred by the NRB who are over 35 years, travellers who are over 35 years and either on the live register or on OPFP for at least 12 months.</P>
      <P>Persons with children who are in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or survivor's contributory pension can apply to transfer to OPFP and if awarded this, they would then be eligible to participate in CE.  In addition, married unemployed people can swap their social welfare entitlement to qualify for participation on the programme.</P>
      <P>The present eligibility criteria for CE came into effect last year following a detailed review of the programme and in response to the recommendation of the task force on long-term unemployment. It is designed to better target the programme at the most disadvantaged of the long-term unemployed so that they may share in the benefits of economic growth along with other sectors of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the programme is currently operating slightly above capacity level relative to available resources, any decision to widen the <Col N="497" /> eligibility criteria to include additional categories would be at the expense of those priority groups for whom CE is designed.  Accordingly, the Minister has no plans to widen the eligibility criteria.</P>

      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to reply.</P>
      <P>There is a serious problem in farming and beef farming in particular as everybody knows.  Last year we lost a number of markets and supports for markets mainly due to BSE.  There has been a substantial drop in income for beef farmers. There was a protest in Dublin today because if something is not done soon, some beef farmers will go out of business.  Will the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry pay the due entitlement of farmers; the compensation resulting from two green pound devaluations, one before Christmas and the other two weeks ago?</P>
      <P>That compensation is worth about £50 million to farmers.  It is £25 million from the EU, a figure we are entitled to match from the Exchequer as other EU countries such as Germany have done. There is also a payment of £30 million in BSE compensation due to farmers that has not been paid.  Farmers are convinced this £80 million is being held cynically and will be given out before the election as a &ldquo;lucky bag&rdquo;.  It is due and badly needed now.  I call on the Government, the Minister and the Minister of State who is here to tell us why this has not been paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Joe Walsh on his recent appointment and wish him a long and productive term as Opposition spokesman on agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Irish agricultural conversion rate or green rate was revalued on 8 November 1996 and 11 January 1997.  The revaluations amounted in total to 6.187 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the agri-monetary rules, aid is payable to producers to compensate them for loss of income resulting from revaluations of the agricultural conversion rate.  In this case compensation <Col N="498" /> will be payable to Irish producers in respect of approximately 4.5 percentage points of the revaluation.  Aid is not payable for the remainder of the revaluation as under the rules this has to be set off against recent previous devaluations. The amount of EU compensation has not yet been determined but it is estimated that it will be in excess of £40 million.</P>
    <P>A specific Council regulation is required to provide for compensation following a revaluation. Such regulations were made in the case of a number of member states which had revaluation during 1995.  The EU Commission will therefore have to make a specific proposal to the Council in Ireland's case.  My Department has been in touch with the Commission and it is understood the proposal will be presented to the Council around the middle of this month.  The earliest practicable time that it could be considered by the Council of Ministers, therefore, would be the meetings of 17 and 18 March.  I hope the Council will be able to deal with the matter quickly.</P>
    <P>Following approval of the compensation measures by the Council, we will have to submit to the Commission details of the national implementing measures for allocation of the aid to producers for sanction.  My Department is in the process of consulting the farming organisations on how the compensation should be allocated.</P>
    <P>As regards BSE compensation, final decisions have not yet been made on the distribution of the BSE compensation package which was adopted by the Agriculture Council last December and on which detailed rules were adopted in January. The amount of aid in this case is £30 million.  My Department is currently examining this issue in conjunction with the distribution of the agri-monetary aid to which I referred earlier and the Minister hopes to be in a position to make a decision very soon.</P>
    <P>I assure the House there has been no undue delay in this matter and I will endeavour to have both amounts of compensation paid as soon as practicable and in the manner most beneficial to producers.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 5 February 1997.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to counteract the growing difficulty faced by employers in recruiting staff, as revealed in a recent survey carried out by the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The factors contributing to emerging recruitment difficulties are complex and diverse. They include record job creation in the three years to April 1996 during which period employment rose by 140,000.  This trend is expected to continue this year; the pressure of demand in the availability of skills in certain areas; the apparent reluctance among some employers to recruit long-term unemployed persons; the wages and other conditions of employment on offer, especially at the lower levels, and the interaction between these and the tax and social welfare system. Initiatives in the recent budget will help in this regard.  In addition, a range of measures has been introduced to ease the transition of unemployed persons into work, such as Jobstart, back-to-work allowance scheme, retention of secondary benefits, etc.</P>
      <P>I have noted the findings of the recent survey by ISME and indeed by SFA.  My officials will be meeting with both bodies to explore with them the lessons to be learnt from these studies and to develop appropriate policy responses.  In particular, we would hope, with the co-operation of these organisations, to work with them in tracking in detail a control sample of vacancies so as to get more empirical evidence both of the particular difficulties being encountered by small employers in filling vacancies and of the reasons people are not apparently taking the jobs on offer.</P>
      <P>The Government's strategy, in relation to employment policy, was outlined in the strategy paper &mdash;&ldquo;Growing and Sharing our Employment&rdquo;&mdash; which I published in April 1996.  This strategy outlined the Government's twin goals &mdash; to maximise the creation of sustainable employment and to ensure that it is shared more equally throughout Irish society.  As part of the strategy for improved access to jobs, several initiatives have been introduced and the Government has in place a range of responses to help meet the needs of the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Jobstart programme provides a significant subsidy to employers &mdash; £80 per week to take on the very long-term unemployed; Budget 97 provided for an increase of 5,000 places under the back-to-work allowance scheme bringing the total number of places up to 22,000; 15,000 unemployed people were trained in 1996 in skills which employers demanded &mdash; close on 70 per cent of these people got jobs; there has been a significant <Col N="500" /> improvement in the placement of long-term unemployed persons into jobs from community employment, as a result of the major development of the programme.  A preliminary sample survey of participants who left the programme having completed their 12 months participation period indicated that 29 per cent had found full-time employment, 20 per cent had found part-time employment, 7 per cent were self-employed and 10 per cent had entered full-time education programmes or progressed to specific skills training programmes; since last November, FÁS and the Department of Social Welfare have been running a joint programme aimed at encouraging job search activities by persons aged 18-19 who are six months or more unemployed.  There have been extensive promotion campaigns by FÁS to encourage employers to recruit apprentices in order to meet skill requirements which FÁS anticipate will be required in the future and FÁS has commissioned an independent professional survey of firms' employment needs and hard-to-fill vacancies; FÁS is participating in the on-going monitoring by Government and a number of other agencies of the supply-demand situation in a number of professional and high-tech occupations, and is considering options for dealing with any emerging imbalances; 55 new industry tailored training programmes were developed to meet strategic skills needs across the key sectors of the economy which were identified in sectoral studies and there has been a significant increase in vacancy handling at FÁS offices.  In 1996, over 42,000 vacancies were notified to FÁS; in the Dublin regions, vacancies in 1996 were 37 per cent higher than in 1995.  As part of the planned restructuring of FÁS, extra resources will be devoted to the placement service, which, combined with the resources available through the local employment services, will improve services to employers significantly.</P>
    <P>It may be noted that many employers overseas have had to completely overhaul their recruitment and training strategies in relation to semi-skilled young workers.  They have had to give more consideration to the type of career ladder which faces their operative level recruits, and, in particular, training approaches have become more systematic.  Some of these employers have already begun to respond with FÁS and a number of joint traineeship type initiatives are under way. The development of a flexible national system of traineeships for semi-skilled jobs will be one of the most important trends over the next decade or so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Progress has been made in improving the industrial infrastructure of the Border counties as follows and this is detailed in a note I am circulating with this reply.  Briefly the situation is as follows: County Cavan &mdash; 40 acre site acquired; County Monaghan &mdash; site at Knockaconny being upgraded and an advance factory to be provided in Monaghan town; County Sligo &mdash; 27 acre site acquired and advance factory to be built; County Louth &mdash; advance factory to be built in Dundalk and County Donegal &mdash; 28 acres acquired in Letterkenny for development.</P>
      <P>The local authorities have facilitated the provision of lands in the Border counties, largely through land swaps and, given the fact that in some circumstances negotiations are in the final stages, it is not possible to specify the amount of expenditure by IDA Ireland at this stage. However, the provision of advance factories in Dundalk, Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo and Donegal by the private sector will involve expenditure in excess of £4 million.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland's policy for the Border counties is to ensure that a balance exists between the demand for industrial land and buildings and the supply of suitable projects.  It endeavours to influence the regional distribution of projects, but ultimately the choice of location is made by the investors.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Border Region Development</P>
      <P>County Cavan: Negotiations have been concluded with Cavan County Council to acquire a 40 acre site adjacent to Cavan town.  IDA is hopeful that construction of an advance factory there, by private investors, will commence within the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>County Monaghan: The IDA continues to upgrade and invest in its site at Knockaconny, County Monaghan.  During 1996 substantial investment was made by the agency in upgrading this site to encourage provision by the private sector of an advance factory.  An advance factory in Monaghan town is also to be provided.  However, the timing of this will be dependent on the general availability of factory space in the area.</P>
      <P>County Sligo: Approximately 27 acres of land have been acquired in Finisklin, Sligo, for industrial development purposes.  The IDA has concluded a deal with a private developer for the provision of an advance factory there.  Planning permission has been obtained and construction will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>County Louth &mdash; Dundalk: Planning permission has now been obtained by a private developer to construct an advance factory in Dundalk.  This building is scheduled for commencement this week and should be available for promotion by IDA by mid-1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drogheda: A range of options are being considered, in conjunction with Louth County Council, to provide a large landbank suitable for industrial development in the Drogheda area.  To date various sites have been identified but price and <Col N="502" /> availability issues have yet to be resolved.  It is hoped that these issues will be progressed over the coming months.</P>
    <P>Ardee: IDA representatives will be meeting with the North-Eastern Health Board shortly to pursue initiatives to substantially upgrade a 50 acre site currently owned by the board in Ardee. The objective is to improve the marketability of the town for new inward investment.</P>
    <P>County Donegal: The IDA concluded an agreement with Donegal County Council to acquire 28 acres of land in Letterkenny to develop a business park and is currently working on the planning and development of this park.</P>

      <P>In September 1996, the German company, Fresenius, acquired National Medical Care worldwide resulting in the formation of the world's largest vertically integrated dialysis group.  National Medical Care announced to its Irish workforce on 17 January 1997 its intention to cease operations in Clondalkin with the loss of 75 jobs over a period of three to four months as part of the parent company's rationalisation decision to shed over 5,000 jobs worldwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> Efforts by IDA Ireland, in consultation with the parent company to avert the closure of the Clondalkin plant, including the attraction of an alternative project for the plant, were unfortunately unsuccessful.  I greatly regret the impact of this closure decision on a workforce which, following earlier redundancies, had thought their future was reasonably secure.  However, the decision was made outside of Ireland and was irrevocable.  As the Deputy will appreciate, responsibility in the final analysis for corporate decisions, which impact on employment, is a matter for companies themselves.</P>
    <P>However, I am pleased to say that National Medical Care is currently working with IDA to prepare a detailed brochure on the Clondalkin plant which will be marketed through IDAs extensive network of overseas offices with a view to attracting a replacement industry at an early date.  The IDA and other development agencies are working closely with existing industry in south-west Dublin in order to maintain or expand employment.  They are also actively promoting the area for the attraction of new indigenous and overseas-owned projects.  I am confident that the co-operative efforts of all interests concerned will facilitate the attraction of much needed new investment and jobs to the area.</P>

      <P>I welcome fair and robust price competition, based on price variations and a diversity of suppliers, which offers significant and enduring benefits to consumers.

This follows consultations with the director of Consumer Affairs, the Consumers' Association of Ireland, the Irish Petroleum Institute, representing the major oil distributors, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, the Service Station Retailers' Federation and the Automobile Association.  The principal changes being provided for are that retailers will be required to display their prices per litre for 95 octane unleaded petrol, premium leaded petrol and diesel, which is not comprehended by the present order and the prices indications for each of these products must be of a minimum size of 20 centimetres, in <Col N="504" /> respect of the numbers on the left hand side of the decimal point.</P>
    <P>In addition, I intend to make an order under section 11 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978 regulating the practice, which is now widespread, of exhibiting notices stating 20p per gallon price reductions.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 47 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>The Credit Union Bill, which was published before Christmas, will consolidate existing credit union legislation and set out an updated framework for the development and regulation of the credit union movement.  The terms and scope of the Bill were the subject of detailed discussions over a number of years culminating in broad measure of agreement between the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  For my own part, I have had six formal meetings with ILCU representatives since taking responsibility for this Bill.  In addition, I addressed each of the last two AGM's of the league.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The published Bill contains certain changes from the broad agreement arrived at between the league and the registrar.  In some cases these arose from policy decisions made by me about certain provisions including ceilings on holdings in shares and deposits and on loans.  In other cases, the parliamentary draftsman supported by the Attorney General decided that for legal or <Col N="505" /> technical reasons the wording which formed part of the agreement with the league was not appropriate or workable.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as published offers a number of improvements for credit unions and their members.  First, the existing shares limit of £6,000, set in the mid-1980s, is being increased to £20,000, and effective doubling of the limit in real terms. Second the Bill meets the long standing demand of the credit union movement to expand the range of services offered by credit unions to their members.  Third, it updates and consolidates existing legislation in a variety of areas, many of which were identified by the movement as out of date.  While the league has raised some concerns, it should also be recorded that the league board has generally welcomed the Bill and specifically welcomed many of its features.</P>
    <P>Following Government approval to publish the Bill, I met both with the board members of the Irish League of Credit Unions and with the Credit Union Advisory Committee on 18 December last.  I am glad to say that general appreciation was expressed for the fact that the Bill had been cleared by Government, and I invited both the league and the advisory committee to study the Bill and to make their views known to me.</P>
    <P>At further meetings with the league on 22 January and with individual credit unions concerns were expressed to me about certain aspects of the Bill.  I also attended, spoke and took questions at the open session of the league's special general meeting in Limerick on 26 January at which I heard at first hand the comments of many credit union representatives on the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have made it known that I will consider well reasoned arguments for change or improvement to the Bill but that generally I believe we have got the balance about right.  In particular, I have indicated my preparedness to review the published ceiling for loans.  I anticipate that it will be some weeks yet before any specific changes which I might propose to the Bill will be available.  I have recently arranged that officials of my Department, together with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, will meet regularly with league representatives this month to review the Bill.  I am also expecting to receive the advice of the credit union advisory committee on its terms shortly.</P>
    <P>As a final comment, the Bill safeguards the social and mutual purpose to which the credit union movement is dedicated, and it underlines in particular its community self-help principles.  I am determined that the Bill should achieve a good balance, facilitating the growth and development of credit unions without undermining the essential character and ethos of the movement as a whole.</P>

      <P>One of the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry called for legislation to prohibit below cost selling of newspapers.</P>
      <P>On 26 November 1996 I reported to Government in regard to my role in co-ordinating the work of the various Departments on the newspaper commission's recommendations and the Government approved my intention to revert to them concerning my own area of responsibility, covering below cost selling, merger control, regulation of ownership and concentration of media ownership.  I am at present considering legislative proposals on these matters.  I am concerned that such legislation would be robust and safe from legal challenge while also proving effective and workable.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should also note that, as Ireland is a member of the EU, any legislation in this area must operate within EU law, both Treaty law and EU court decisions.  Consequently, any new law in this area must apply to all EU newspapers on the Irish market.  It cannot, and should not, discriminate against any newspaper based upon a specific &ldquo;nationality&rdquo; criteria.  To this end I am taking advice on the complex law and economic issues involved.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the House in December 1996, it is also my intention to consult with and have the views of all relevant interests, including the EU Commission to ensure compatibility with our Treaty obligations before I report to Government in the matter.</P>
      <P>I am arranging a meeting between myself and the newspaper industry to have discussions with them about the issue of below cost selling and other issues in the report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry.  I should, of course, say that I and my Department have had ongoing contacts with newspaper interests since last November on the question specifically of below cost selling.  My forthcoming meeting will provide a useful forum for considering progress on the range of issues that fall within the remit of the State and, of course, the industry itself.</P>

      <P>Agencies which fall within my remit are forecasting the creation of 28,000 gross new jobs in 1997, in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.  This represents a continuation of the exceptionally strong performance of Forbairt, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development companies in 1996.  In addition, at a more local level, the county enterprise boards, <Col N="507" /> are forecasting the creation of 3,000 gross new jobs in 1997.</P>
      <P>This year's budget and estimates are framed on the basis of an expected additional 45,000 jobs in the economy in 1997.  The significant level of jobs growth across all sectors of the economy should yield substantial opportunities for persons on the live register.</P>
      <P>As regards the extent to which the forecast new manufacturing and internationally traded jobs will be filled by people from the live register, I refer the Deputy to the results of a special employment survey carried out by Forfás, at my request which was reproduced in our labour market strategy paper Growing and Sharing Our Employment.  These results show that 33.2 per cent of new employees recruited in 1995 by manufacturing and internationally traded companies within Forbairt and IDA Ireland portfolios came directly from the live register.  Further recruitment from the live register would ensue from the knock-on effect of these firms recruiting staff from other firms who in turn, on the basis of the same recruitment patterns, would also obtain a portion of their replacement staff from the live register.</P>
      <P>Apart from measures to promote employment which are the focus of the enterprise support agencies in manufacturing and internationally traded services, this Government has a range of active labour market policies in place comprising both employment-oriented and training and skills acquisition programmes to help ensure that the registered unemployed are provided with effective chances to compete for jobs.  Jobstart is a direct recruitment subsidy to employers which is specifically targeted at the very long-term unemployed on the live register.</P>
      <P>Community employment is the main manpower intervention by the State with provision being made for an average of 40,000 places.  It provides a work experience placement together with an element of training to targeted groups of whom 80 per cent come directly from the live register.  The work and skills experience gained by participants enhances their capacity to compete for jobs in the market economy.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a private sector initiative, under the auspices of the IBEC/CBI Northern Ireland Joint Business Council, is currently promoting the development of a Belfast-Dublin economic corridor.  This very commendable initiative sprang from the findings of a feasibility study carried out in 1994 which <Col N="508" /> sought to determine if such an initiative was worth pursuing.</P>
      <P>On 28 January last, IBEC/CBI organised a conference in order to further this matter.  Interested parties from the US, Canada, Great Britain and Italy were represented, where similar economic corridors are flourishing.  Representatives from the EU Commission were also present.  The results of the conference will now be analysed by the joint business council and an action plan drawn up.</P>
      <P>Reference was made at the conference to the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) proposal for a pilot project on networks and the possibility of looking at this also in Northern Ireland.  My Department is currently working with Forbairt on the establishment of a pilot networking programme as recommended by the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (STIAC).  I will ask them to examine the feasibility of incorporating a North-South element into this initiative, particularly with a view to the potential for exploiting clusters described as already existing in embryonic form in the corridor.</P>
      <P>The work of the joint business council, through its task force, in promoting the economic corridor is aimed at complementing rather than replacing existing cross-Border initiatives and in the light of the potential contribution it can make to both economic well-being and cross-Border co-operation on the island as a whole, I shall be watching its deliberations with interest.</P>
      <P>It is worth stressing, however, that an economic corridor as proposed would be but one strand of a variety of initiatives and my Department and the agencies which fall within my remit have been and continue to be involved in a number of such cross-Border initiatives to promote and develop industry, these being as follows:</P>
      <P>Ambit &mdash; the American management and busines internship training programme, administered by Forbairt, is designed to offer hands-on training in US host firms for managers and technical experts from Northern Ireland and the Border counties.</P>
      <P>ACUMEN programme is a cross-Border sales-business development programme.  It supports small and medium companies to increase cross-Border sales and to develop other forms of commercial co-operation in both parts of Ireland.  The programme is actively supported by the main economic development agencies including Forbairt, FÁS and Cavan county enterprise board.</P>
      <P>The IFI-Business enterprise programme aims to stimulate local enterprise, create awareness of the potential for self-employment and encourage business to grow profitably, develop and seek new markets and to increase their competitiveness. Forbairt and Cavan county enterprise board are represented on the management board of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, a number of initiatives to help accelerate industrial and economic development as an aid to promoting a permanent cessation of violence <Col N="509" /> include: the White House conference for trade and investment in Ireland, and the EU initiative for a special support programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties &mdash; the Delors Package.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives, related to developing links with North America encompass: the North American partnership programme (NAPP) which is promoted by Forbairt in conjunction with the IFI, and the Forbairt small business administration business partnership initiative.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is an INTERREG programme which is an EU initiative for the Border counties and Northern Ireland &mdash; excluding Belfast.  This has proved a very useful addition in relation to my Department's various promotional strategies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that both the extent of the changes required in our law to implement EU labour legislation and their impact on business have been greatly exaggerated.  In most cases, these impose minimum standards which are already being exceeded by good employers. Indeed, the success of our economy in recent years provides the proof that progressive labour legislation does not, in fact, frighten off investors but instead complements job creation.</P>
      <P>Another year of strong economic growth was recorded in 1996.  GNP growth at 6 per cent was well above the EU average of 1.75 per cent.  Total employment increased by 45,000 over the year to April according to the 1996 labour force survey. New first-time job creation in IDA Ireland and Forbairt backed companies reached 20,700 in 1996 &mdash; the second year in a row of record growth.  Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of this strong growth has been that it has been achieved without widespread inflationary pressures. Inflation in 1996 averaged only 1.6 per cent compared to the EU average of 2.5 per cent.  It seems unlikely that progress of this order would have been possible if our labour legislation had as negative an impact on job growth as is alleged by some.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, labour law has an important role to play in promoting labour market stability and minimising conflict.  Much of the international literature over the last decade has stressed the economic benefits of employment security and long-term employment relationships in terms of co-operative labour relations, greater internal flexibility, acceptance of technological change, cumulative skills and greater incentive for investment in human resources.  Labour law has an input in respect of each of these factors in the labour market.  Employees who enjoy good working <Col N="510" /> conditions are more likely to be productive and willing to embrace change.</P>
    <P>Thus, instead of fearing changes in social policy, I believe that Irish employers should seek to avail themselves of the opportunities such changes present in the form of a stable, well trained highly motivated workforce.  Modern business is a shared enterprise involving the fullest commitment of both management and workers.  Commitment on the part of workers is best earned, in my view, in an environment where basic employment rights are protected and respected.</P>
    <P>I believe further that the consensus on economic and social policy issues which we have in this country could not have been achieved without the existence of basic social standards.  This consensus approach has been a major contributor to Ireland's economic success.  That consensus is backed up by a well balanced body of labour legislation which, together with measures designed to stimulate employment, provides an appropriate framework for the purpose of achieving an efficient and competitive business environment.</P>
    <P>The Government is very much aware of the global competitive pressures to which Irish industry and business are increasingly exposed and is consequently seeking to ensure that developments in EU social policy are fully evaluated in the context of the national economic priorities of job creation and maintenance.  The major legislative programme at EU level under the social action programme is largely complete.  In dealing with our obligations to implement existing EU social legislation and in negotiations regarding new EU social policy initiatives, my Department always seeks to adopt a very flexible approach and to consult as widely as possible with the social partners and other relevant interests so as to minimise any undue impact of EU proposals on Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Over the past 25 years, Ireland has developed a balanced package of labour laws which set out basic social standards.  That process is now virtually complete, and it is anticipated that the emphasis for the foreseeable future will be on consolidating, simplifying, and improving existing provisions rather than major new initiatives. Legislation now before this House will repeal, simplify and update labour laws from the 1930s.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on his policy agreed with the IDA to seek a greater dispersal of new industrial projects throughout the country in view of the established fact that the Dublin region, particularly the northside, has the highest unemployment rate in the country.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1968/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In addressing the annual conferences <Col N="511" /> of both IDA and Forbairt recently, I reinforced the importance which the Government attaches to achieving a balanced regional spread of inward investment projects.</P>
      <P>Dublin and the east region generally have been very successful in securing a large proportion of inward investment projects over the last number of years.  The record rate of growth for 1996 recently reported by IDA Ireland, in terms of its national performance, is due very substantially to the exceptional capability of the east region to attract so high a proportion of mobile investment. When the services and sub-supply jobs generated by this investment are added, the east region is making very significant advances in terms of employment creation.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the total number of jobs created in IDA-assisted companies in the Dublin region was 6,163.  IDA client companies on the northside of Dublin city have grown substantially in recent years and Fingal, as a local authority area, has had the highest IDA jobs growth of any county council.</P>
      <P>Principal employers in the northside include Gateway 2000, Motorola, and companies like GE Superabrasives, Stream International, Linsons and Ballet are employing numbers varying between 280 and 1,350 employees.  Total employment in these particular companies is in excess of 3,600.</P>
      <P>The total number of jobs created in Forbairt-assisted companies in the Dublin region for 1996 was 3,545.  Shortly after Forbairt was established it reviewed the needs of the Dublin region and appointed in 1995, for the first time ever, a new area manager for Dublin north.  Through its area manager, Forbairt is working closely with various groups in developing a strategic plan for Dublin north.  These include: Northside Partnership; Ballymun Partnership; Finglas/Cabra Partnership; Blanchardstown Partnership; Dublin City University; IDA Ireland, NorDubCo; Fingal County Council; Dublin City Enterprise Board; Balbriggan Enterprise; URBAN; Aer Rianta; FÁS and Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>Forbairt is also actively involved with the Dublin city enterprise board and Finglas partnership in carrying out a space audit of the Finglas area, to identify space availability, land available for development and the potential demand for future industrial units in the area.</P>
      <P>Since the CEBs were established in late 1993, those in the Dublin region have approved almost 700 projects out of a total for all 35 CEBs of 6,000 &mdash; 12 per cent of the national total.  By the end of 1996, over 1,100 jobs had been created in CEB-assisted projects in the Dublin region out of a total of 7,700 &mdash; 14 per cent of the national total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other parts of the northside have also enjoyed significant growth as, for example, in East Point where there are currently six companies which have applied to relocate at the East Point industrial estate under the terms of the enterprise areas scheme.  A feature of the development at <Col N="512" /> East Point is the fact that the companies are predominantly internationally traded service companies involved mainly in the software, dataprocessing and telemarketing sectors.</P>
    <P>The total number of potential jobs at the East Point arising from the relocation of these companies is 1,634.  In addition to the above companies, I understand that further applications are expected which could lead to the present total of 1,634 jobs being significantly increased in the near future.</P>
    <P>However, even in city locations such as Dublin with their inherent attractions for large investment projects there is an ongoing need to continue impacting on the high unemployment levels. With some of the best projects in the world coming to Dublin, there are still high rates of unemployment and areas of deprivation.  The Government has a co-ordinated approach to addressing these problems through the area partnership companies and the focusing of resources in such areas, through the education, vocational training and social welfare systems.  The objective is to provide opportunities for progression and acquisition of skills required in the labour market to those who are currently excluded, or are at risk of becoming so.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin region there are five employment service networks in operation.  These provide targeted assistance to the unemployed which includes guidance training, education and employment support.  Also, FÁS is actively promoting Jobstart and Workplace as initiatives to help the unemployed return to the workforce.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Dublin and the east region have been successful relative to other areas of the country in securing inward investment projects and, notwithstanding unemployment levels in particular areas, as is obvious from other questions tabled to me today, there is a need to attempt to ensure balance in the distribution of these projects according to the regional needs of the country as a whole.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he intends taking based on the FÁS study contrasting the Irish system with Scottish job training which showed that almost three times as many Irish school-leavers ultimately end up unemployed.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The study referred to by the Deputy relates to independent research conducted by researchers from the ESRI and the University of Edinburgh entitled School to Work Transitions in Ireland and Scotland, 1979-89.  While the study was not commissioned by FÁS, it was published in its twice-yearly journal <i>Labour Market Review,</i> which is produced by FÁS to assist understanding of the Irish labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> The study showed that in 1991, about 15 per cent of Irish school leavers were unemployed, compared to about 8 per cent of Scottish school leavers.  While the percentage was higher in Ireland, there was, as the study itself points out, &ldquo;a very sharp decline in Scottish unemployment levels between 1987 and 1989&rdquo; which, &ldquo;in part, reflects economic recovery but, also, changes in the benefit rules which resulted in the withdrawal of unemployment benefits to under 18's&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The study highlights the problems of drawing conclusions on employment levels based on the results of annual school leavers surveys in Ireland and Scotland, which are undertaken nine to 12 months after the students have left school.  It is made clear that, for accurate judgments to be made, it would be necessary to assess the position of school leavers several years after they have left school.  One issue the study is clear on, however, is the link between educational disadvantage and unemployment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the position in this country, I am glad to say that the level of youth unemployment has fallen significantly in recent years due to increasing employment creation and Government measures to provide further opportunities for young people, both in the education sector and in State training programmes.  Despite this progress, however, youth unemployment has remained at an unacceptable level, particularly among early school leavers.  The latest school leavers survey shows that, in 1995, around 13,000 young people left the education system with no qualification or just a junior certificate.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the recently-published NESF report No. 11 on Early School Leavers and Youth Unemployment, which analysis the issue from a wide perspective, and which puts forward a framework for an effective policy response.  The Government has carefully considered this report, and has decided to establish an interdepartmental working group to examine the feasibility, implications and costs of implementing the forum's recommendations against the background of existing policies, and to develop a clear framework, including targets, for dealing with the overall issue.  The working group will be submitting an interim report by 31 March.</P>
    <P>Finally, and without prejudice to the outcome of the working group's findings, the Government is already employing a number of measures to provide appropriate levels of education and training to these young people, with the ultimate objective of enhancing their prospects of employment. These actions include: increasing the retention level in second-level senior cycle to 90 per cent by 2000; developing the Youthreach programme for early school leavers; priority targeting of programmes for 18-19 year old unemployed; developing a traineeship programme for young entrants to the labour market; developing the new standards-based apprenticeship system, and providing appropriate certification which will encourage and facilitate progression to further <Col N="514" /> education and training and, ultimately, into employment.</P>

      <P>At the time of the announcement of the closure of this company in November last, I made contact with the parent company in the USA to discuss the pending closure.  They made it clear to me that, while the decision to close was irreversible, the facility in Cork would be made available at a reasonable cost.  During these discussions, I also emphasised the importance of agreeing an acceptable redundancy programme with the employees.</P>
      <P>I am informed by IDA Ireland that manufacturing at the Cork plant has ceased, there are presently over 30 people remaining during the final winding down period, and that a redundancy programme was successfully finalised with the workers.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has been promoting the facility to potential investors and a number of potential clients have viewed the facility.  The other development agencies are also fully aware of the need to attract new industry to the area.  I assure the Deputy that all efforts will be made to find a replacement industry.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged by the considerable attractions of the Cork region for business investment. Since November, projects in five IDA companies have been announced with the capacity to create 1,000 new jobs.  This will build on the strong employment performance of both indigenous and overseas companies in Cork in the past two years.</P>

      <P>My Department has a shared responsibility in the selection of projects under two measures: with the Department of Education in relation to the measure entitled Boosting Growth and Retraining for Peace and with the Department of Finance in the measure entitled Investment Promotion.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first of these &mdash; Boosting Growth and Training for Peace &mdash; this measure is currently at an advanced stage in the project selection process which is expected to be finalised in the next few weeks.  Accordingly, no funding has been committed as of now.</P>
      <P>Lead responsibility for project selection which is currently in operation under the Investment Promotion measure rests with the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>I should also say that my Department, as the national authority for the European Social Fund, has responsibility for the technical task of drawing down the ESF funding componment of the overall operational programme.  The total amount of ESF aid under the programme is approximately £15.26 million of which a first advance of £830,313 has been received to date.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that people with disabilities regularly meet barriers and discrimination in obtaining insurance cover and that the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, in its strategy for equality, recommended that unjustified barriers be removed through legislation; the action, if any, he plans in order to implement this recommendation; and the barriers, if any, he has identified in this regard.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities found that, in general, people with disabilities are at a disadvantage when seeking insurance cover and that drivers with disabilities, in particular, find it extremely difficult to obtain motor insurance cover.</P>
      <P>My statutory responsibility in relation to insurance is to supervise the solvency of insurance companies authorised to underwrite insurance business in Ireland.  My primary concern, therefore, is to ensure that insurance companies maintain adequate solvency margins and reserves to enable them to be in a position to meet claims as they arise.  In that context individual companies when underwriting insurance risks must determine what is an appropriate premium for a specific risk depending on their own claims experience of that category of risk.</P>
      <P>Subject to my statutory responsibility for the supervision of solvency, I am actively concerned about the cost and availability of insurance in the marketplace as evidenced by the major consultancy study which I commissioned on an economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland.  The recommendations in that report are being currently progressed by my Department with the other Departments and agencies which would have a key role in their implementation.  In addition, my Department maintains close liaison with the Irish Insurance Federation on behalf of persons who may be experiencing difficulty in obtaining insurance cover.</P>
      <P>In relation to motor insurance the federation has assured me that the insurance industry is fully aware of the concerns of drivers with disabilities about the availability and cost of motor insurance.  For this reason, the IIF's motor insurance members agreed ten years ago, following discussions with the various disabled drivers associations and the Government established motor Insurance Advisory Board to review any loadings imposed on drivers with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Under this agreement, companies agreed that no loading should exceed 20 per cent of the premium in the first year of insurance, or 15 per cent in the second year, provided the driver was claim free.  If, after two years, the driver continued to be claim-free, disabled driving loading would be dropped altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> On the question of the difficulty in obtaining motor cover, individual insurers may decide to decline any risk.  However, here too all motor insurers are party to an agreement under which an insurer will be nominated to offer a quote if the customer has been unable to get a quote, having approached at least five insurance companies. Information about these agreements is available from the IIF's insurance information service at phone number 6761914.</P>
    <P>The IIF maintains that motor insurers have a sympathetic attitude to health and disability issues.  They generally accept people with non-degenerative disability subject to a satisfactory medical report &mdash; providing that, in cases of severe non-degenerative disability, the vehicle is adapted where necessary.  In general, insurers do not impose an additional loading in cases of mild non-degenerative disability.  Where the non-degenerative disability is more severe some companies may impose a loading.  That said, there is an agreement in place between the IIF and the Department of Enterprise and Employment whereby loadings in respect of non-degenerative disability can be reviewed.</P>
    <P>With regard to life insurance, I gather from the IIF that there is no standard code of practice governing underwriting criteria in this area.  Life assurance companies treat each individual case on its own merits and on the basis of the insurers underwriting experience.  In the case of the provision of household cover for disabled persons, I understand that, in certain instances, household insurance premiums may reflect any modifications carried out on property to cater for a specific disability.</P>
    <P>Arising from the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, the Government decided to establish an interdepartmental task force under the chairmanship of my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, to draw up a programme of measures for the implementation of the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The first meeting of the task force was held on 21 January last.  My Department is represented on the task force in relation to addressing specific departmental issues raised by the commission.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals and initiatives, if any, for the small business sector in 1997; the progress, if any, with the implementation of all the recommendations of the task force on small businesses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2878/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government fully recognises the crucial role which the small business sector plays in the Irish economy and has made very significant progress in assisting that sector, particularly through the substantial reductions in its taxation <Col N="518" /> burden which have been effected in successive budgets.  Further evidence of the high level of commitment which exists is to be found in the inclusion in Partnership 2000 of a separate chapter on action to assist small business, which is an unprecedented step in recognition of the importance of this sector.  I intend to progress the commitments contained in Partnership 2000 at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Over the coming months, I will be introducing several new initiatives for small business.  As the Deputy will be aware, on 5 November last the Government gave formal approval to proposals submitted by me to have a prompt payment Bill drafted.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure the prompt payment of amounts due to suppliers of goods and services by public sector purchasers and by sub-contractors on public sector contracts. I will be bringing forward legislation on this issue at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Later this month I intend to publish my proposed strategy on services.  The strategy will review the impact and growth of the services sector on the structure of production and employment in the Irish economy, and will examine the factors which affect the growth and development of services.  It will also review the current balance and types of State supports to ascertain whether these are appropriate and adequate.  As a large proportion of services businesses are small, the strategy will be of particular relevance in the context of small business.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing the success of the access to finance scheme and identifying the scope for introducing new finance measures for small companies.  All £208 million which was available under the AFS was fully drawn down by the end of 1996.  One thousand four hundred small businesses benefited through subsidised long-term loans over a seven year period and 8,000 additional jobs will be generated in the process.</P>
      <P>In the context of the strategic management initiative, work is already in train on the preparation of a broader strategy on administrative simplification to ensure a measured reduction in administrative burdens over time and, furthermore, to ensure that the administration requirements of new measures are kept to an absolute minimum.  During 1997, I will also be taking steps to achieve progress in the area identified in Partnership 2000 for administrative simplification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the various measures which are already up and running under the small business operational programme, certain new areas will be addressed under the programme in the near future.  A range of initiatives will be implemented which will help small business to identify new supply and service opportunities and will assist in improving the professionalism and expertise of public purchasers.  For example, an initiative on public procurement, which will come on stream over the next few months, will provide for the appointment of six full-time public procurement specialists to a joint Forbairt/An Bord Tráchtála <Col N="519" /> programme.  Other initiatives which will shortly be introduced in this area include the publication of a directory of public sector buyers, together with workships and training to assist small firms in accessing these markets.</P>
    <P>A patron programme for the services industry is being established under the operational programme. Forbairt will select a group of companies to act as patrons and will broker contacts with small service companies.  During 1997 it is planned to launch the programme to 20 to 30 companies.  A consultant has already been engaged by Forbairt to determine the availability of suitable patrons and the most appropriate operational structure.  The consultant's report is planned for completion by the end of March next, at which stage the implementation process can be initiated.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the importance of information for prospective and existing entrepreneurs in small business, my Department will, later this year, publish two guides in areas of particular relevance to them.  One will concern the starting up of a business, the other will concern financing and will incorporate full information on the important matter of available grant assistance. These projects will also be assisted under the operational programme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the importance of the Plato project, which is a business training and networking project under which larger businesses assist local SMEs in their development.  The expansion of the Plato network to three new areas in 1997 &mdash; Dublin North, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown-Wicklow and Donegal &mdash; is being supported by the county enterprise boards with the active involvement of local business organisations. The Donegal Plato programme is being undertaken as a cross-Border initiative.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on management development by the county enterprise boards during 1997 will amount to £2 million.  This level of expenditure represents a doubling of the resources available for this type of soft support activity by the CEBs compared with 1996.  In addition to all of these initiatives, I should also stress that the White Paper on Human Resources Development will include detailed proposals for the development of the human resources potential of small indigenous companies in order to improve their competitiveness both in the local and international markets.</P>
    <P>In regard to progress in implementing the recommendations of the task force on small business, the position is that, to-date, over 50 per cent have been implemented in full or in part.  The task force made 121 recommendations of which 39 have been fully implemented and substantial progress had been made with the implementation of a further 29 recommendations.  Details of these recommendations were furnished by me in response to a question from Deputy O'Rourke on 28 January 1997 &mdash; Question No. 268, ref. No. 2037/97.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> The systematic examination and implementation of the recommendations is being pursued by the small business and services division of my Department which has assessed all the recommendations and is actively pursuing their implementation. I am satisfied that, building on the work which has already taken place, very significant additional progress in this regard will be achieved in 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>Jobstart is a recruitment subsidy scheme which I introduced last summer in order to entice employers to fill new or existing vacancies with long-term unemployed persons.  The overall thrust of the scheme is to increase the proportion of jobs in the economy filled by those unemployed for three years or more against a background where such persons are often by-passed in job selection.</P>
      <P>While recruitment by employers under Jobstart during 1996 has been less than anticipated, I am pleased nevertheless that FÁS did place 669 long-term unemployed people under the scheme, which is approximately 55 per cent of the target that I set for Jobstart by the end of 1996.</P>
      <P>Given that experience indicates that recruitment subsidy schemes generally require a lead in time before becoming established and taking into account that we are dealing with the hard end of the market, I am confident that over time Jobstart will have a considerable impact in improving the quality of life for those who are long-term out of work and providing them with a brighter future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department does not collate information on wages paid to those recruited under Jobstart and other similar programmes, as responsibility for the delivery of these programmes rests with FÁS and other bodies.  However, FÁS compile statistical records on Jobstart which include the monitoring of wages being paid to participants. At the end of December 1996, 82 per cent of the participants were being paid £120 or more.  Of <Col N="521" /> these 12 per cent were earning £200 or more, and 35 per cent were earning between £141 and £160. Accordingly very low wages are not a feature.</P>
    <P>With regard to the going rate for the job, the general conditions under which the Jobstart programme operates include that the job is a normal job and must attract the going rate of pay in the company-organisation.  The Jobstart premium is a flat rate contribution towards wages.  Pay and conditions must comply with any employment regulation orders or registered employment agreements.</P>
    <P>Where the £80 subsidy exceeds 50 per cent of the gross rate of pay proposed, it will be subject to special review before being approved.  This will include a check to ensure that the employer is complying with any employment regulation orders or registered employment agreements.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the paper recycling industry needs an indigenous paper mill as dependence on export of post-consumer paper is so volatile as to be uneconomic unless a mill is available in Ireland or Government credit is given to support the industry when the international paper price drops.</Quest>

      <P>There is one paper recycling facility in Dublin &mdash; the Smurfit Paper Mill &mdash; which is engaged in the conversion of a particular type of used paper, largely used corrugated cases, to produce a paper which is reused in the manufacture of new corrugated cases.  I understand from Forbairt that in 1995 Smurfits examined the feasibility of establishing a further recycling plant but that, for commercial reasons, they have postponed a decision in this matter.</P>
      <P>I understand from Forbairt that there are certain major obstacles to the establishment of paper recycling facilities.  First, each individual end product requires its own mill.  For example, a mill that produces brown paper lining for corrugated cases cannot produce paper suitable for writing, envelopes, etc.  Second, the cost of establishing a mill is extremely high, being in the region of £80 million.  For that size of investment, companies require a level of sales that implies substantial exports.  The pulp, paper and board industries are subject to cyclical price fluctuations worldwide.</P>
      <P>Grant assistance is available from Forbairt for projects where the collected recycled material is used to produce products in a traded sector, which are commercially viable.  Forbairt's feasibility study grant programme provides support to investigate market opportunities for recycled products.  Forbairt have advised that they have not received any recent proposals for such projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The low number of overseas jobs attracted to the north-east, as to certain other areas, in 1996 is indeed disappointing and, as indicated in my reply to Deputy Noel Ahern, the overall topic of regional dispersal of jobs and projects is one of serious concern to both me and the Government. It is, however, important to note that in the period 1990 to 1995 the north east experienced steady jobs growth.  This pattern is expected to resume this year.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the IDA can only encourage promoters, albeit with financial inducements, to locate in particular areas.  The competition in attracting mobile overseas investment is intense and new projects increasingly require facilities available in larger urban centres.  The number of new greenfield manufacturing projects, as opposed to expansion of existing projects, attracted to Ireland in any year is limited.  Many of these have specific locational requirements which means they are not mobile within Ireland. Ultimately the choice of location is made by the investor, taking account of competitive advantages such as infrastructure and business environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, as indicated in reply to Deputy O'Rourke's question on the regional distribution of new employment, achieving a better regional distribution of jobs across the country requires a strong co-operative approach between the development agencies, local authorities and infrastructure/services providers.  For its part, the IDA in 1997 is favouring locations outside the larger urban centres in every way it can, including with higher grant levels as appropriate, with the involvement of private sector investors, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations and working closely with local authorities to have available quality sites at priority locations for new industrial investment.  It should be noted, however, that new projects announced during <Col N="523" /> 1996 for the north-east region, EPC Corporation and DSC Communications, in Dundalk and Drogheda, respectively, are currently in start-up phases.  While they will not immediately offset the job losses last year, over the next few years these projects, with projected employment of over 770 jobs, will be very significant in re-establishing employment growth across the region.</P>
    <P>In relation to the responsibility of Forbairt for the attraction of overseas investment, the decision of the Heinz Corporation to locate in Dundalk will boost the local economy also.  This plant, now under construction and providing good employment in that phase, will provide an additional 200 jobs.  The decision of Heinz to locate there has also increased interest in the region on the part of other overseas companies. Clearly the establishment of such major enterprises in the area will have significant downstream effects and the creation of links and subsupply to them will further reinforce the economy of the region through the creation of new jobs and the maintenance of existing employment.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is also responding to the challenge of attracting new inward investment to the north-east region through the acquisition of land suitable for industrial development and the encouragement of advance factory provision by the private sector.  I have given specific information relating to counties in the Border region in my reply to a question on today's Order Paper from Deputy Brendan Smith.</P>

      <P>The potential of the social economy has been identified by a wide range of commentators, from the EU in its 1993 White Paper to a recent report by the NESF, as offering a major source of new jobs particularly suitable to those with non-technical skills.  Although the social economy is not in itself a new development in Ireland, I am aware of a number of innovative projects which are under way.  Most of these have received significant Government support through the community employment programme and now the Jobs Initiative.  CE and the Jobs Initiative <Col N="525" /> between them allow for 41,000 places, the majority of which would lie in social economy type areas.</P>
      <P>There is little consensus on the definition and extent of the social economy.  The term usually refers to the continuum of employment related to social needs which falls between existing services provided by the State sector and market-based private enterprise services.  Accordingly its exact extent will vary between countries and over time. It can in the broadest sense include a wide range of forms of collective action such as housing associations, co-operatives and credit unions as well as individually provided services.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently commissioned, in conjunction with the Office of the Tánaiste, a consultancy study on the social economy with a brief, <i>inter alia</i>, to suggest a working definition of the social economy in an Irish context, to assess its potential for development and to identify barriers and constraints to its success, taking existing research into account.  This has involved wide consultations with groups already active in the social economy.  I hope to receive the consultants' report shortly and will give it my fullest consideration.</P>
      <P>I expect that this will be a useful input both in the short-term in looking at existing Government schemes which could contribute to the development of the social economy and in the longer term in providing a basis for the deliberations of the forthcoming working group on the social economy to be set up on foot of a commitment in Partnership 2000.  In the light of the consultancy findings I will also be looking closely at the operations of my own Department, seeking to ensure a coherent approach to the development of this significant economic area.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the social economy can produce services of real value which can enhance our quality of life, and genuine employment that offers job satisfaction and leads to better mainstream prospects for the long-term unemployed.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the county enterprise boards are playing a key role in developing local enterprise and are appreciated by their clients.  The steady increase in the gross levels of job creation achieved by the boards reflects their positive impact in the local economy. My Department is engaged on a continuing basis in monitoring the progress of the county enterprise boards, including the outcome of project approvals in terms of jobs created, and in keeping track of the level and type of expenditure by each board compared with their programmes and plans.</P>
      <P>A detailed information review of the activities and expenditure of county enterprise boards in the period from their inception in 1993 to the end of 1995 has been completed and will be published shortly.  This publication at national level will complement the reviews and reports which are published by each particular county enterprise board as a means of informing the public about their activities.</P>
      <P>The mid-term review of the local enterprise sub-programme of the operational programme for local urban and rural development, 1994-99. under which county enterprise boards are funded, is currently in the process of being finalised.  The mid-term review has involved a thorough assessment of the entire range of programmes and activities of the boards, the efficiency and effectiveness with which their programmes have been delivered and their impact on enterprise development and job creation at county and city level against the background of the operational programme. The review is expected to make recommendations for the future operation of the local enterprise sub-programme.  I intend to take full account of the mid-term review's findings in setting the strategic goals for county enterprise boards for the period 1997 to 1999.</P>
      <P>I am circulating in the Official Report details of the projects approved by each board up to the end of 1996 and the number of gross jobs created in county enterprise board assisted enterprises up to the end of 1996, according to figures supplied by the boards.  The 1996 figures are provisional. The following are the tables:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> Until such time as I have had sight of the detailed report I am not in a position to state to what extent it will be possible to publish the report.  Section 78 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, sets certain limitations on the publication of information obtained by virtue of a search warrant.  In addition, in deciding upon the issue of publication, I would wish to have regard to the need to avoid creating any hindrances to authorised officers obtaining all the information they require in any future investigations or in respect of any legal action that might be prosecuted on foot of this or future investigations.</P>

      <P>Workplace is designed to bring people who need jobs together with people who can provide jobs for a trial period of five weeks with no strings attached.</P>
      <P>FÁS are actively promoting the programme among both employers and unemployed people who are at least six months out of work and at the end of January 1997, a total of 589 unemployed people had participated in Workplace. From an analysis of statistics at the end of December 1996, 55 per cent of the participants on Workplace are in the age bracket 20-30; 55 per cent of the participants on Workplace are with firms who have one to five employees; 60 per cent of the participants on Workplace are male and 77 per cent of the participants were in receipt of unemployment assistance before participating in Workplace.  A preliminary analysis of outcomes by FÁS shows that at least 33 per cent of those who were on Workplace are now in employment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 231 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> Community Employment is designed primarily to prevent marginalisation among long-term unemployed people whose principal or only source of income is a social welfare payment.  Its objective is to provide temporary work experience opportunities together with some training that would enhance the employment prospects of those whom the programme is targeted at.</P>
    <P>As limited resources do not make it possible to provide CE for all long-term unemployed people it is necessary to target the programme at those most in need, such as persons in receipt of an unemployment compensation payment or persons in receipt of certain means tested social welfare payments.  In line with this both men and women, married or single, who fulfil any of the following eligibility criteria can participate on CE.</P>
    <P>Part-Time Integration Option</P>
    <P>Those over 21 and on Unemployment Benefit or Unemployment Assistance for at least 12 months.</P>
    <P>Those over 21 years on one parent family payment for over 12 months;</P>
    <P>Special categories such as those referred by the NRB or travellers on the live register or one parent family payment for at least 12 months.</P>
    <P>Part-Time Job Option</P>
    <P>Those over 35 years and in receipt of Unemployment Assistance or Unemployment Benefit for over three years.</P>
    <P>Those over 35 years and on one parent family payment for over three years.</P>
    <P>Special categories such as those referred by the NRB who are over 35 years or travellers who are over 35 years and on the live register or on one parent family payment for at least 12 months.</P>
    <P>Persons with children who are in receipt of survivor's contributory pension (SCP) or deserted wives benefit can apply to transfer to one parent family payment and if awarded this, they would then be eligible to participate in CE.  In addition, married unemployed people can swop their social welfare entitlement in order to qualify for participation on the programme.</P>
    <P>The present eligibility criteria for CE came into effect last year following a detailed review of the programme and in response to the recommendation of the task force on long-term unemployment and is designed to better target the programme at the most disadvantaged of long-term unemployed so that they may share in the benefits of economic growth along with other sectors of society.</P>
    <P>Given that the programme is currently operating slightly above capacity level relative to available resources, any decision to widen the eligibility criteria to include additional categories would be at the expense of those priority groups for whom CE is designed.  Accordingly I have no plans at present to widen the eligibility criteria.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> With regard to FÁS mainstream training/specific skills training programmes I would point out that all unemployed people, including widows in receipt of a survivor's contributory pension and women in receipt of deserted wives benefit are eligible to participate in these programmes.</P>
    <P>Also from time to time FÁS offer return to work courses for women who wish to return to the workforce.</P>

      <P>From time to time I receive representations concerning alleged price fixing and other anti-competitive practices.</P>
      <P>I would have grave concerns if any of these allegations are well founded.  It is to deal with such allegations and any other allegations concerning anti-competitive practices that the Competition Acts are on the statute books and the independent Competition Authority was established. The authority has recently been given additional powers.</P>
      <P>With the enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, in July last year a system of public enforcement of our competition laws is now in place.  I have appointed a Director of Competition Enforcement in order to give effect to the public enforcement provisions of this Act.  The powers of the director of competition enforcement are as follows: (a) to carry out an investigation, whether on his own initiative or as a result of a complaint to him from any person, into any contravention of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, that he suspects has occurred or may occur and (b) to make recommendations and give advice to the Competition Authority as respects the institution by the authority of legal proceedings for the enforcement of the Act.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, any individual or company who feels aggrieved concerning alleged anti-competitive activities such as price fixing now has the option of pursuing their allegations either by: (i) taking a civil action themselves under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991, or (ii) making a complaint directly to the Director of Competition Enforcement requesting him to investigate the allegations.</P>

      <P>Labour mobility is a particular characteristic of the construction industry, and it is not unusual or new for the industry to advertise for workers in the UK, just as the UK construction industry has advertised in Ireland for workers when it had peak demands for labour. The fact that the Construction Industry Federation is advertising in the UK reflects the high level of activity in the construction industry in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In relation to manpower planning, FÁS, through the construction industry training committee, has recently developed a manpower forecasting system to assist employment and training planners and, in particular, the construction industry, to match future demands for skills.  The social partners, including the construction industry itself, are represented on this committee.  The system is capable of estimating demand for 25 construction occupations at a national and regional level.</P>
      <P>There has been a significant increase in the number of apprentices being recruited in the industry with, for example, the intake for bricklaying and plastering increasing by approximately 100 per cent between 1993-94 and 1995-96.  The new standards based apprenticeship training system will ensure that the skills of craftsworkers employed in the construction industry will be up to best-practice standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the labour force survey &mdash; ILO basis &mdash; of 1995 is encouraging in so far as it shows that the number of persons unemployed for more than one year, which is the general definition of long-term unemployment, fell from 127,600 in 1994 to 102,100 in 1995 and there was also a slight fall in 1996, the number of those long-term unemployed is still at an unacceptable level and I am constantly reviewing existing measures and developing new responses to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a key element in the strategy to fight long-term unemployment is the establishment of the local employment service, as recommended by the NESF in its Report No. 4, Ending Long-Term Unemployment.  The purpose of this service is to provide a tailor-made response to the needs of targeted long-term unemployed, especially in areas of particular disadvantages. The LES is currently operating in 14 areas, and the Government will shortly announce the extension of the LES to a further four areas. The forthcoming evaluation of LES by Forfás will inform this expansion as well as any necessary strengthening of supports required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> FÁS employment services are also gearing up to become more pro-active in providing guidance to long-term unemployed people and the matching of those people with suitable vacancies.  They are also actively co-operating with the Department of Social Welfare by providing guidance and progression, on the full range of labour market opportunities, for all referrals.</P>
    <P>Temporary employment measures like the Job Initiative and community employment provide the long-term unemployed with valuable work experience within community projects.  This helps break the cycle of unemployment by allowing individuals update and develop existing skills as well as learn new skills which can help individuals compete better for jobs in the labour market.</P>
    <P>Certain changes were introduced for CE in 1996 to better target the programme at the long-term unemployed and include the splitting of the programme into the following two distinct options.  The part-time integration option is aimed at long-term unemployed people with reasonable prospects of employment and whose prospects of obtaining mainstream employment would be enhanced by participation on the programme and the part-time option is aimed at long-term unemployed people with poor employment prospects.  Under this option participants, who have an annual contract of engagement, can have their contract reviewed for up to three years.</P>
    <P>There are currently over 40,000 people on CE and FÁS are promoting the programme as a viable progression into employment.  It is imperative that the value of experience gained on CE be recognised and accepted by employers.  This will require convincing employers that the community workplace provides a real and professional work environment where valuable skills can be developed.  As a measure to assist the long-term unemployed to find permanent employment, FÁS will, in 1997, strengthen certain aspects of community employment by, for example, providing training to sponsor committees so that they may be more professional in their role of employers.  It will also involve more stringent vetting of projects through evaluating project business plans on a value for money basis; strengthing links with local employers by involving them in the vetting projects and awarding a workplace merit award to community employment projects. This should strengthen the positive perception of local employers that community projects do provide a real work environment and encourage employers to give more favourable consideration to the long-term unemployed and by the provision of a reference to all community employment participants to support their application for jobs in the labour market.  The pilot Job Initiative, which I launched last October, at present has 711 people who are working full-time in the social economy at the going rate for the job.  The numbers employed under this programme will increase to 1,000 shortly as soon as sponsors in <Col N="536" /> the voluntary-community sectors complete their recruitment plans.</P>
    <P>Jobstart, the employment subsidy scheme, has approximately 809 people, who were at least three years unemployed, currently in employment. FÁS is continuing to actively promote this scheme with employers, to encourage them to take on more long-term unemployed people.  In addition, approximately 589 people have undertaken the workplace programme, with a view to progressing to a job.</P>
    <P>On the preventive side, Youthreach, which caters for early school leavers, is being re-focused with greater efforts to get progression and placement opportunities for these young people.  The possibility of increasing the number of foundation places is also being examined particularly in the context of the recent NESF report on early school leavers and youth unemployment and all 18-19 year olds, who cross the six month threshold on the live register, are being referred to FÁS by the Department of Social Welfare for an intensive programme of guidance, counselling and assistance on labour market opportunities.</P>
    <P>On the policy side, a strategy group on employment and unemployment, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, will shortly be making a report to Government, which will include further refinements to the extensive measures we have introduced for long-term unemployed people.</P>

It has made known its views to the British Government on numerous occasions within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  We have urged the need for stricter controls, effective guidelines and maximum restraint to curtail the use of plastic bullets to the greatest possible extent and to minimise the risk of death and serious injury.</P>
      <P>The Government's concerns regarding plastic bullets were deepened by the manner in which they were used during the disturbances surrounding the contentious parade in Drumcree in July 1996.  There was widespread concern at the contrasting numbers in which plastic bullets were used before and after the stand-off at Drumcree. Of the 6,002 plastic bullets fired during the disturbances as a whole, 662 were fired before the stand-off ended on 11 July.  The vast majority, 5,340, were fired afterwards in nationalist areas. The concerns to which this disparity gave rise and other issues relating to the use of plastic bullets during the disturbances related to Drumcree were taken up by the Government at the special meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference convened at the Government's request on 18 July 1996.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomed as a first step the announcement by the British authorities in the aftermath of these disturbances that the Inspector of Constabulary &ldquo;will conduct a review of the RUC's procedure and training for handling public order situations including those relating to the use of plastic baton rounds&rdquo;.  The Government believe that the Inspector of Constabulary, in his review published on 22 January 1997, has made a number of detailed and potentially valuable recommendations governing the use of plastic bullets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government supported the view of the Mitchell Commission that a review, <i>inter alia</i>, of the use of plastic bullets, combined with progress toward more balanced representation in the police force, would contribute to the building of trust.  The Mitchell Commission's view on plastic bullets was noted in both the report of the Inspector of Constabulary and the report of the Independent Review of Parades and Marches, published <Col N="540" /> on 30 January 1997.  The Government welcomes the review's conclusion that the adoption of the thrust of the inspector's recommendations &ldquo;relating to public order and the use of plastic baton rounds, and visible commitment by the RUC to sensitive, even handed policing allied to absolute professionalism of conduct, would contribute to a positive long-term solution of the parades issue&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government will urge the British authorities to take account of the views of the north review and to implement as a matter of urgency the recommendations contained in the Inspector of Constabulary's review.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to pursue this issue in the context of its ongoing contacts with the British Government within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <P>The investigation of the circumstances in which this person tragically died is a matter for the French authorities.  In response to a formal request from them, my Department was involved in arranging for French police officers to be present when, in 1995, statements were made to gardaí by Irish companions of the deceased.  The investigation, which is being conducted by a <i>Juge d'Instruction,</i> an investigating magistrate, is still under way.  In view of the time that has passed since it commenced and the understandable concern of the family of the deceased, I have instructed the embassy in Paris to ask the Ministry of Justice to see whether anything can be done <Col N="541" /> to bring it to an early conclusion.  My Department will continue to monitor developments and to keep the family informed.</P>

      <P>The case to which the Deputy refers has been monitored closely for some years by my Department.  As indicated in my replies to questions about this case on 21 November 1995 and 26 September 1996, representations have been made to the British authorities on a number of occasions regarding the conditions of detention for this prisoner and others who are currently held in special secure units.  Particular concern has also been expressed on humanitarian grounds about the policy of closed visits which is currently in operation.  This has been done through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, most recently at the conference meeting held on 20 November 1996, as well as through the Irish Embassy in London.</P>
      <P>On my instructions, the individual in question was one of a number of prisoners visited in a can-sular capacity by an embassy official in the course of a round of visits made over the period 18-20 November 1996.  Complaints about the conditions under which he and the other prisoners are held were pursued by embassy officials during a subsequent meeting with British Home Office and Prison Service officials.</P>
      <P>The delay in proceeding with court charges against this person and others arising out of an attempted escape from Whitemoor Prison in September 1994 was also raised with the British authorities. As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, the trial on charges of attempted escape recently collapsed for the second time.</P>
      <P>For their part, the British authorities maintain that this prisoner's conditions of detention, including the restriction to closed visits, are a function of his &ldquo;exceptional risk&rdquo; security classification and have stated that the categorisation of a prisoner is periodically reviewed.  I would assure the Deputy that we will continue to point to the need for a humanitarian approach to this issue.</P>
      <P>I am also aware of the concerns that have been expressed about the possibility of wrongful conviction in this case.  The embassy in London has met with supporters of a campaign which is seeking referral of the conviction to the Court of Appeal by the British Home Secretary and will continue to follow closely developments in this regard in the period ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note also that this individual has applied for transfer to this jurisdiction under the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  I would once again reiterate that we stand ready to <Col N="542" /> receive all such prisoners who seek to transfer to this jurisdiction under the convention.</P>

      <P>The Government closely monitors humanitarian aspects of the treatment of republican prisoners in Britain.  I have personally raised these issues at political level through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and at other ministerial meetings, and our views have also been conveyed to the British authorities through the Irish Embassy in London. Humanitarian issues relating to individual prisoners are raised with the British authorities on an ongoing basis.  Consular visits are also made to the prisoners by officials of the Irish Embassy in London.  The prisoners to which the Deputy refers were most recently visited by an embassy official on 18 November 1996.</P>
      <P>The embassy subsequently met with the British Home Office and Prison Service for a full discussion of issues relating to the conditions and treatment of the republican prisoners in Britain which had been raised by the prisoners themselves and by Members of the Oireachtas who had recently visited them.  I also raise the conditions of republican prisoners classified as exceptional risk, including thoses on remand, at the most recent meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference held in Belfast on 20 November 1996.  In all our contacts with the British authorities, the humanitarian difficulties for the prisoners and their families have been highlighted.</P>
      <P>In this context, the system of closed visits for republican prisoners classified as exceptional risk has been the subject of representations to the British authorities on many occasions.  As indicated in my response to a question from Deputy Tony Gregory on 17 December 1996, the Government has consistently taken the view that these prisoners should be permitted open visits, especially for family members and consultations with legal representatives.  For their part, the British authorities have continued to state that the application of the policy of closed visits is a function of these prisoners' categorisation as exceptional risk prisoners and that these prisoners' categorisation is periodically reviewed.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the legal representative for a number of the prisoners concerned is reported to be in the process of seeking a judicial review of the closed visits policy.  I would assure the Deputy that developments in this matter will be followed closely by my Department in the period ahead.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a person wishing to avail of the car scrappage scheme has the option of either arranging directly for the car to be scrapped at one of the ten approved scrappage plants or, alternatively, allowing a motor dealer, from whom the new replacement car is purchased, to make the necessary arrangements.  In either event, an application for repayment can only be processed if it is accompanied by a completed &ldquo;Certificate of Destruction&rdquo; issued by one of the ten approved scrappage plants.</P>
      <P>The application for repayment can only be completed by the owner of the scrapped car, although the person concerned may indicate on the application form that the Revenue Commissioners may make repayment to the motor dealer.  This arrangement enables the dealer to credit the customer with £1,000 in advance of the scrapping of the car.  Revenue's involvement in the scheme is confined to the monitoring of the activities of the scrappage plants and the processing of completed applications for repayment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the reports in the media that cars intended for scrapping were not in fact scrapped but put back on the road.  While the numbers involved are not known, it is understood that they are in the region of 20.  This practice is not in itself illegal provided that an application for repayment is not lodged with the Revenue Commissioners. However, the practice is contrary to the spirit of the scheme if the owner of the car had concluded a deal with the motor dealer on the understanding that the car would be scrapped.  Discussions have taken place with representatives of the motor trade who have given an undertaking to observe the spirit of the scheme in the future.  I have been informed that the Society of the Irish Motor Industry has now directed its members that all cars offered and accepted by a member <Col N="545" /> garage under the scrappage scheme must be scrapped.</P>

On 7 October last the trader's accountants were requested to supply additional information to support the claim.  In the absence of any response the claim was formally disallowed on 1 November.  If the trader's accountants provide the additional information requested, the claim can be re-examined.</P>

      <P>The provisions of EU Directives 91/680/EEC and 92/12/EEC, agreed as part of the tax measures establishing the EU single market, authorise the continuation, until 30 June 1999, of duty free shopping facilities for intra-Community travellers. This arrangement was agreed to allow the duty free operators time to diversify their activities. In the absence of a proposal from the Commission and an agreement at Council, duty free sales for intra-Community travellers will cease on 30 June 1999.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to terminate duty free or tax free sales for travellers to non-EU destinations in 1999.  That portion of the duty free business will remain and, for certain airports, particularly Shannon Airport, the non-EU travellers are a very important source of revenue. Other State airports also handle traffic to and from non-EU locations.</P>

      <Quest>the current tax exemption given on the taxation of redundancy or retirement lump sums; when the current regulations were introduced; if these regulations are indexed linked or adjusted for inflation; if he will consider adjusting them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the current legislation in relation to tax relief in respect of redundancy lump sum payments is section 115 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, as amended by section 8 of the Finance Act, 1993. The exemptions and reliefs in respect of redundancy lump sum payments to which an individual may be entitled are briefly as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  <i>Basic Exemption</i></P>
      <P>The first £6,000 plus £500 for each complete year of service in respect of that particular employment is exempt from income tax.</P>
      <P>(ii)  <i>Increased Exemption</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic exemption may be increased by a maximum of £4,000 if no claim for relief has been made in respect of a previous lump sum payment, and no tax-free lump sum has been received or is receivable under an approved superannuation scheme relating to the office or employment.  If a tax-free lump sum of less than £4,000 has been received or is receivable from the scheme, the increased exemption will be the basic exemption plus £4,000, less that <Col N="547" /> amount or, in the case of deferred benefits, the acturial value of that amount.</P>
    <P>As an alternative to the above reliefs a taxpayer may, if more favourable, claim an amount known as the standard capital superannuation benefit SCSB.  The SCSB is calculated as 1/15 th of the person's average yearly salary, i.e. averaged over the last three years of service, per complete year of service, less any tax free lump sum which is received or receivable under any approved or statutory pension scheme.  Further relief may arise where an individual has foreign service.</P>
    <P>If a taxpayer is liable to tax on part of the redundancy payment he or she is also entitled to top slicing relief.  This means that any amount of the payment liable to tax is charged, not at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate for the year in which he or she is made redundant, but at an average tax rate calculated by reference to the previous five years.</P>
    <P>Lump sums payable from approved occupational pension schemes are not chargeable to tax under section 115 (2) (d), Income Tax Act, 1967, as amended by the Finance Act, 1972, Schedule 1.  However, these lump sums must be paid within strictly approved limits.  The maximum benefit which may be paid to any individual at normal retirement age is 1.5 times final remuneration.  This maximum benefit is conditional on the individual having completed at least 20 years service with the employer up to normal retirement date.</P>
    <P>The above information summarises the regulations governing tax relief available for redundancy and retirement lump sum payment which are rather complex.  Further information may, however, be obtained directly from the Revenue Commissioners if required.</P>
    <P>The exemptions and reliefs available in respect of lump sums payable from approved occupational pension schemes and redundancy payments calculated by means of the SCSB are indexed to the extent that they are calculated in relation to a person's salary.  In regard to the basic exemption limits for redundancy payments, I would draw to the Deputy's attention that major changes were made in the tax treatment of redundancy lump sum payments in 1993.  These changes included the introduction of the further tax free addition of £500 per completed year of service in the employment, to the previous tax basic allowance of £6,000 &mdash; or £10,000 in certain circumstances &mdash; as well as improvements in the alternative SCSB.  These changes resulted in very significant improvements in the tax treatment of redundancy lump sums, particularly as they apply to workers with a number of years service.  For example, the minimum amount allowable tax free to a worker with 12 years service doubled from £6,000 to £12,000.  In the circumstances I do not consider that an increase in the existing tax free redundancy lump sum exemption is justified at this time.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the question of VAT liability on services received by bookmakers from Satellite Information Services, SIS, which are based in the UK, has been under consideration for some time.  The services in question are received under licence from the UK. Under EU VAT law, such services are taxable where received and are, therefore, liable here for VAT at the standard rate of 21 per cent.  A final determination on the matter has not issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of a programme of information for bookmakers and in any attempt to quantify the VAT liability arising, an Inspector of Taxes arranged to visit bookmakers by appointment <Col N="549" /> and discussed the matter fully with them.  No formal assessments have issued to date.</P>
    <P>Representations disputing the basis for the liability were received from one representative body who have held a meeting with the Inspector of Taxes.  Other associations representing bookmakers, including the Allied Betting Offices Association, have appointed a firm of auditors to enter into discussions on their behalf with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Pending the finalisation of the various issues involved, all relevant action in relation to the bookmakers has been temporarily suspended. The matter will be finalised when these discussions are completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's net income from the EU over each of the past five years is as follows: 1991, £1,853m; 1992, £1,604.6m; 1993, 1,791.8m; 1994, 1,335.9m; 1995, 1,480.2m; 1996, 1,436.0 (est).</P>
      <P>Over the period 1989-93 Structural Fund receipts averaged 2.5 per cent of GNP, with about 4.2 billion ecu of Community funds confinancing a total spend of 9.5 billion ecu.  The Community Support Framework is estimated to have raised GDP and GNP by 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively, by the end of 1993.  Employment levels were increased by 30,000 over the period. Over the longer term the ESRI have estimated that GNP would be about 1 per cent higher by the year 2000 as a result of the 1989-93 CSF which represents a real rate of return of 7-8 per cent.</P>
      <P>Total CSF and Cohesion Fund expenditure will amount to 11.9 billion ecu over the period 1994-99, with Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds accounting for 6.9 billion ecu.  The 1994-99 CSF, according to Commission estimates, will add about 1 per cent to annual average growth rates &mdash; GDP &mdash; in Ireland over the period, with Community assistance from Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund accounting for half this growth. Overall growth for the period was forecast at over 4 per cent per annum.  The Commission estimated that the CSF 1994-99 would contribute 0.4 per cent per annum to total employment, or at least 35,000 net jobs over the period.  On the basis of progress to date, these projections are likely to be exceeded.</P>
      <P>A mid-term review of the CSF, 1994-99, which is currently under way, will assess the CSF in terms of its impact, efficiency and effectiveness. The mid-term review will give an indication of the progress actually being achieved under the current round of funding and of the contribution which Structural Funds are making to the development of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>The other component of net income from the EU is inflows relating to agriculture.  The dominant component of this &mdash; direct payments to farmers &mdash; accounted for an estimated for an estimated 42 per cent of farm incomes last year.</P>
      <P>There is no available information on the precise impact of net income from the EU as a whole on the economy.  However, while these flows have not determined our recent economic success, they have made a significant contribution to it.</P>

The remit of the Ombudsman was originally confined to Government Departments and offices staffed by civil servants but in December 1984 a Government order extended his remit, <i>inter alia</i>, to cover health boards and public hospitals &mdash; not including clinical matters.  Consideration is now being given to legislation which would extend the remit of the Ombudsman further to cover agencies established since 1980, non-commercial State bodies and bodies &mdash; including hospitals and other institutions in the health sector &mdash; which derive 50 per cent or more of their funding from the State.

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if he will seek ways to encourage business angels and other private investors to invest directly in private companies in view of the fact that BES and venture capital funds are not freely available and particularly to structure the capital gains tax regime to balance the reward for risk as against alternative low tax investments currently available to such investors in order to encourage participation in private share ownership.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3060/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The BES currently applies to qualifying companies operating in a range of economic sectors where the level of risk is high and the required pay-off to the State for tax assisted investment is jobs return.  Given the cost of the relief, and the need to target it, I have no plans to widen the scope at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital gains tax code already contains provisions which encourage participation in private share ownership.  Section 27 of the 1993 Finance Act grants deferral of capital gains tax liability arising on the disposal of shares in a company where, <i>inter alia</i>, the disponer has been an employee or director of the company and the consideration obtained from the disposal is reinvested <Col N="552" /> in a private trading company in which the disponer becomes involved both as a shareholder and employee or director.</P>
    <P>In addition, section 66 of the 1994 Finance Act provides for a reduced rate of capital gains tax for disposals of shares in certain small private companies.  This encourages investment in such companies.  Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that in this year's budget, I announced that this reduced 27 per cent rate will from the 6 April next be 26 per cent.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that whether a 40 per cent or a reduced capital gains tax rate arises in any particular instance the availabilty of indexation will reduce the effective rate of capital gains tax.  Indexation is not available in respect of deposits.  Furthermore in the present climate of low interest rates the after tax return on capital gains could be significantly greater than that arising from deposits.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of measures announced in the budget in relation to incentivising the developing companies market.  These are availability of the BES; increase in the limits for SPIAs targeted specifically at DCM companies and no loss of tax deferral if reinvestment is made in a company which subsequently obtains a listing on the DCM.</P>
    <P>These measures will encourage entrepreneurs to grow their companies so that they can obtain a DCM listing, can have access to capital and may more easily be able to realise their own investment and move on to another project.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would point to the substantial reductions in the standard corporation tax rate in the last three budgets which will, by making more profits available for reinvestment, provide a major boost to business development and enterprise.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that basic data are not available which would enable the information requested by the Deputy to be provided.  Information is not recorded in such a manner that would enable capital gains tax paid in respect of the disposal of shares in small private companies to be readily identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of indicative information, a reduction by one percentage point of the lower rate of capital gains tax on the disposal of qualifying shares <Col N="553" /> in certain companies held for more than three years is estimated to cost about £0.2 million in a full year.  This estimate is tentative and does not take into account any possible behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such a reduction.</P>
    <P>To obtain the information requested by the Deputy, it would be necessary to carry out a detailed examination of all the relevant documentation. Such an exercise could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESRI report on the economic implications for Ireland of economic and monetary union, which I commissioned last year, is a comprehensive analysis of the impact of economic and monetary union on the Irish economy.  The report examined the implications for Ireland of a number of membership scenarios, including the situation where Ireland joined economic and monetary union but the UK, at least initially, did not do so.  The consultants concluded that, on balance, membership of EMU, even were the UK not to join, would be beneficial for Ireland.  The detailed sectoral analysis in the ESRI report of the impact of EMU on the tourism, retailing, agriculture, manufacturing industry and financial services sectors should be of considerable interest to all those preparing for EMU, both in Border areas and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>As regards preparations, I should point out that preparedness for EMU, as for other changes in the economic environment, is primarily the task of businesses and individuals themselves to ensure.  I take it, therefore, that the Deputy has in mind the measures being taken by the State to facilitate businesses and individuals in doing so.</P>
      <P>The first requirement here is the provision, as far as possible, of a sound and stable economic environment conducive to sustainable economic and employment growth.  The present economic climate in Ireland is characterised by high economic and employment growth, low inflation, sound public finances, interest rates close to historically low levels and a high level of investment, notably under the community support framework. My recent budget was designed to improve this climate further, in particular by providing tax and social insurance reductions aimed at securing continuing wage moderation and by improving our corporation tax structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a more specific level, in December I launched a national information programme on <Col N="554" /> EMU and the changeover to the single currency, with the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Tourism and Trade.  The programme will be in phases, designed to correspond with the phases of the changeover and to provide information in a timely way: as the Deputy will be aware, EMU will begin on 1 January 1999, when the single currency, the euro, will come into being, but euro notes and coins will not be introduced until 1 January 2002 at the latest, with the changeover to the euro being completed within six months of their introduction.</P>
    <P>The first phase of the programme will run to the end of this year and will focus mainly on provision of information to help businesses prepare themselves for the changerover.  Forfás is running a business awareness campaign to this end.  The business awareness campaign is directed through business associations, professional bodies, and State agencies that deal directly with enterprises: these are represented on a consultative committee for the campaign.</P>
    <P>Forfás has also engaged consultants to study how businesses, especially small and medium-size enterprises, should best plan for EMU and the changeover to the euro.  Their study is expected to be completed in March and following that, Forfás expects to hold a series of information meetings in 1997, at which it would present the results of the study.</P>
    <P>The national information programme will be reviewed in the second half of 1997 when the question of broadening its focus will be considered.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 to 92 inclusive and 100 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in a small number of hospitals the waiting period for the reporting of cervical smear results is in excess of the recommended interval of one month.  The Department of Health is currently addressing the need for additional posts including cytoscreeners for cytology laboratories and in addition wherever possible the time of staff employed on a part-time or sessional basis is being increased to bring about an immediate improvement in the reporting of cervical smear results.  My Department is also discussing with a number of hospital authorities the capacity of their laboratories to process additional smears and the resources required.  As regards the hospital to which Deputy Fitzgerald refers I regret that the hospital took this action without informing or discussing the situation with the Department of Health.  The action taken by the hospital might have been avoided had they done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My policy for cervical screening is contained in the national cancer strategy which was launched in November 1996 and which is based on the report of the Department of Health cervical screening committee.  I believe that cervical screening is a worthwhile preventive health measure when delivered as an organised screeninng programme. <Col N="556" /> Accordingly, a national organised screening programme will be introduced for women in the 25-60 age group at five yearly intervals.  The target date for the commencement of a national programme will be not later than 1999 or earlier if resources permit.  In the meantime, while arrangements are being made to prepare the ground for the national screening programme, the commencement of the implementation of the report's other recommendations is under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): My Department, together with the National Rehabilitation Board, a statutory agency of the Department of Health, operates a number of measures to improve employment prospects for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The employment support scheme which was set up in 1990 assists people with disabilities to obtain open employment.  The scheme, which is administered by the NRB, offers financial support to employers to encourage them to employ people with disabilities whose work productively levels are less than average.  There are currently 392 people with disabilities in employment with the assistance of the employment support scheme.  This year I allocated an additional £100,000 to this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NRB also launched a new &ldquo;Positive to Disability&rdquo; symbol in May 1996.  An initial 12 companies where awarded the symbol in recognition of their commitment to the employment of <Col N="557" /> people with disabilities.  Discussions are on-going with a further group of companies and it is intended to award the symbol at six monthly intervals to eligible companies.</P>
    <P>The NRB also operate general support services to people seeking employment.  These include the workplace equipment adaptation grant whereby the NRB provides employers with a grant towards the costs of adapting the workplace to accommodate people with disabilities and Job clubs which provide a range of supports free of charge for people with disabilities who are seeking employment.  The NRB currently employs a number of employment co-ordinators to review the relationship of current training provision to labour market needs.</P>
    <P>In addition to measures to assist people with disabilities obtain open employment and supported employment, sheltered work enterprises provide work places for people with disabilities who are unable to obtain or retain open employment. These places are provided by statutory and voluntary agencies and by health boards.  Day activity services are also provided as an alternative to sheltered work where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to create 500 sheltered employment places over the period of the partnership.  In the course of providing additional places, it is intended, through the NRB, to pilot new models of sheltered work and to develop minimum standards for all forms of sheltered work.  To that end I allocated £500,000 in 1997 for work places for people with physical and sensory disability.  Discussions are currently taking place with the NRB about how the new models will operate.  All aspects of sheltered employment are being considered by the national advisory committee on training and employment, established by the NRB, which is due to report this summer as well as the review of training and employment for people with disabilities being undertaken by my Department at present which will report later this year.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, A Strategy for Equality, recommends the development of a wide range of economic and social services for people with disabilities, including health, personal support services and employment for people with disabilities, including people with hearing impairments.</P>
    <P>The Government decided, on publication of the report, to establish a monitoring committee comprising representatives of Departments, social partners, organisations representing people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers to monitor the implementation of the commission's recommendations, including the health care and employment recommendations which are the responsibility of my Department. This is subject to the submission to Government, in the first instance, of a programme of measures to be implemented, which will be drawn up by an interdepartmental task force on which my Department will be represented.  This task force <Col N="558" /> is due to submit its detailed action plan by 30 June 1997.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, was published at the end of last year.  The report highlights the need to develop a comprehensive range of flexible community services to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including people with hearing impairments.  Officials of my Department are in discussion with the health boards regarding the implementation of the report.  The report will also be considered, in conjunction with the health recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, by the interdepartmental task force and monitoring committee approved by the Government recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card and are certified by their general practitioner as having a long-term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of £32 per month.</P>
      <P>In 1995, the health boards carried out a review of the community drugs schemes generally.  In the case of the DCSS, that review showed that there were a considerable number of people who, although holding a DCSS card, had ceased to use it, indicating that they no longer had an ongoing monthly requirement for prescribed medicines in excess of £32 per month in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  A review of the scheme is ongoing in the Eastern Health Board and persons who do not satisfy the criteria in respect of a regular and ongoing need for prescribed drugs and medicines have had their cards withdrawn.  To date approximately 1,900 cards have been cancelled by the board and a further 330 cards are due to be withdrawn.  Such persons may avail of the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, where any expenditure on prescribed medication in excess of £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board. Should a person at a future date have an ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of £32 per month, the person should apply to the board for a new drug cost subsidisation scheme card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The granting of a DCSS card in any individual case is a matter for the particular health board <Col N="561" /> concerned and boards must ensure that the criteria for eligibility for the scheme are met both in relation to the issue of DCSS cards and in their use.  The question of patients getting prescriptions dispensed which they do not need does not arise as medical practitioners are obliged to prescribe on the basis of a patients medical need, rather than on the basis of availing of a particular scheme.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.  The figures show incidence rates per 100,000 population for the ten most frequently reported sites broken down by health board area of residence and by sex.</P>
      <P>The data derives from the National Cancer Registry which started to collect national data on the incidence, i.e. number of new cases, of cancer for the first time in respect of 1994.  The registry will shortly publish its first report which will contain considerable detail about cancer in Ireland. The Deputy will see from the table below that there are variations between males and females in the incidence of certain types of cancer.  These variations may be due to the use of tobacco and alcohol, differences in diet and other lifestyle factors.  However, cancer is generally seen as a multifactorial disease and it is rarely possible to identify a single causative factor.  Overall variations in crude incidence rates will also result from differences in the population age profile in each region.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the data attached refer to new cases of cancer recorded in 1994.  The total number of persons with cancer, i.e., prevalence as opposed to incidence, would be much higher than these figures.  The National Cancer Registry's data on the prevalence of cancer will improve as data over a number of years from 1994 onwards become available.</P>

      <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has examined the issue of improving employment and other opportunities for all people with disabilities.  Chapter 7 of its <Col N="568" /> report addresses the issue of training and employment and its recommendations are aimed at bringing about an improvement in the employment prospects of all people with disabilities, including those who are deaf.</P>
      <P>The commission also addresses the issue of technology and telecommunications and makes specific recommendations in the area of assistive technology.  These recommendations are of particular relevance to the deaf community, dealing with such matters as the question of text telephones and the provision of sub-titles for television programmes.  The question of making available sign language interpreting supports in public services is also addressed.</P>
      <P>The report of the commission is being considered at present by an interdepartmental task force which I have asked to prepare a plan of action based on the report.  It is anticipated that the plan will be completed around mid-year.</P>
      <P>I will also be setting up a monitoring committee to oversee the implementation of the commission's recommendations.  The monitoring committee will be representative of people with a disability, their families and carers and service providers as well as social partners and Departments.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh. 121 go 125 le chéile.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Carey, has had meetings with farmers and their representatives in the Burren area of County Clare to discuss the proposed designation of special areas of conservation and related matters in the context of the rural environmental protection scheme.  SACs will generally be selected from the areas already proposed for eventual natural heritage area status and will account for about 550,000 hectares in about 400 sites, or about 70 per cent of the proposed NHA areas. The specific areas to be proposed for inclusion in SACs will be published as soon as I make the regulations to transpose the EU habitats directive into Irish law.  This will happen very shortly.</P>
      <P>When the regulations are in place, the process of consultation with individual landowners and the general public leading to SAC designation will commence.  Details of the designation proposals will be sent to each landowner-user thought to be affected where these can be identified. These details will include maps as well as information regarding the conditions applicable to the relevant site, compensation and arrangements for objections-appeals.</P>
      <P>In addition, the designation proposals will be publicly advertised and persons who feel that they may be affected but who have not received individual notifications will be invited to contact the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department, which will provide the relevant information.</P>
      <P>The conservation conditions which will apply to SACS in the Burren will be identical to those already agreed by my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Teagasc, private planners, and farming organisations in the context of the REP scheme, which is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> With regard to the question of compensation, the Government has committed itself in the context of Partnership 2000 to the payment of a fair and proper level of compensation to those affected by the designation of SACs, having regard to the level and extent of restriction and all reasonable losses arising as a result of SAC designations, and to the difference between the value pre-designation for environmental purposes and subsequent value of the land consequent of designation as an SAC.  It was also agreed that an independent arbitrator shall be appointed by me to adjudicate on disputes in relation to the level of compensation.</P>
    <P>The amount and form of compensation that will be payable has for some months been the subject of discussions involving my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and farming organisations.  As these discussions are ongoing, it would be premature at this stage to comment on the terms likely to be finally agreed.</P>

Section 8 of the Electoral Act, 1992, extends the right to vote at Dáil elections to resident British citizens.  It also provides for extending the Dáil franchise to nationals of other EU member states on a reciprocal basis.  The United Kingdom is the only member state which extends the right to vote at parliamentary elections to resident Irish citizens and there is, therefore, no scope under existing law for extending the Dáil franchise to nationals of other member states resident in Ireland.

      <P>The Government's national strategy for traveller accommodation, which was announced on 29 March 1996, contains targets in relation to a range of traveller accommodation options, including transient halting sites, and provides for the introduction of new and amending legislation requiring local authorities to adopt five year programmes to provide adequately for traveller accommodation needs.  The draft legislation, which will provide for amendments to the housing and planning codes, is in the course of preparation. Pending the enactment of the legislation, local authorities have been requested, in view of the terms of the national strategy, to proceed with the preparation of programmes to ensure that appropriate targets are met within the time frame envisaged.  Further advice for local authorities on the preparation of such programmes is being developed in consultation with the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group.  Based on returns received from local authorities, there are at present six transient halting sites with 85 places for caravans for travellers as follows:</P>

      <P>Under the motor tax code, the owner of a vehicle <Col N="577" /> applying for a licence (tax disc) for it must apply to the licensing authority in whose area the vehicle will be ordinarily kept.  Where the vehicle is not ordinarily kept in any one area, the application is made to the licensing authority for the area where the principal place of business, or the usual place of abode, of the owner is located.  The owner of a substantial fleet of vehicles may, with the consent of the relevant licensing authority, apply for licences in respect of all the vehicles in the fleet to the licensing authority of the area in which the owner's principal place of business in respect of the fleet is situated.  I am satisfied that the arrangements I am currently developing for an equalisation fund will obviate any necessity to make major changes in the foregoing arrangements.</P>

      <P>I take it that the question relates to financial support from my Department for the water pollution programmes of local authorities.  Questions relating to assistance for particular sectors, in the context of water pollution, are matters for the other Ministers concerned.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, the capital investment programme for water and sewerage schemes amounts to more than £650 million under the National Development Plan, 1994-99, with over £150 million available for investment in the current year.  This programme contributes to a significant reduction in the pollution loads discharged to our major rivers and lakes, and to the marine environment, from local authority sewage treatment and disposal works.</P>
      <P>Local authorities' current expenditure on water pollution control is in general financed from local resources combined with their allocations from the rate support grant.  A sum of £440,000 is, however, available to my Department in the current year to support local authority initiatives in relation to environmental investigation, research and monitoring, and £118,000 of this amount will be payable under INTERREG II to Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal County Councils in respect of follow-up monitoring programmes on the Erne and Foyle, and to Cavan County Council in respect of the completion of a nutrient management study.</P>

      <P>The main criteria to be met for the granting of recognition to a new denominational school is that prospective pupils will be available in sufficient numbers to establish and maintain a viable school and that appropriate religious instruction is not available, in the particular denomination involved, in existing schools within a reasonable distance.  At present, no minimum level of overall enrolment, or of junior infant enrolment, is specified for the granting of official recognition.  The overriding requirement is that the prospective school can demonstrate sufficient growth potential to ensure long-term viability.</P>
      <P>In view of the significant demographic decline, my concern to ensure the viability of all applicant schools has increased considerably.  This was a major factor in my decision to establish the commission on school accommodation needs, whose task it will be to draw up detailed criteria for the recognition of new primary schools.  The commission will be commencing this task shortly.  I will consider how the criteria applicable to all new schools should be developed or altered in the light of the commission's recommendations.</P>

Schools were selected for inclusion in the programme on the basis of priority of need as reflected in the level of educational disadvantage of the pupils concerned and also having regard to the availability of suitable accommodation to house a pre-school project.  Unfortunately, the school in question did not have the necessary accommodation available to accommodate a pre-school project.</P>
      <P>The school in question was among those invited by the Education Research Centre to apply for inclusion in the urban phase of the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  All applicant schools submitted data on the educational disadvantage of their pupils under a range of specific criteria devised by the Education Research Centre. The centre selected schools for inclusion in the initiative on the basis of priority of need as reflected in the data submitted.  Unfortunately, based on the data it submitted, the school in question was not among those selected by the Education Research Centre for inclusion in the initiative.  The needs of the school in question will be considered in the event of any further develoment of the early start pre-school programme or the Breaking the Cycle initiative being undertaken.</P>

      <P>School attendance committees are responsible for the enforcement of the School Attendance Act in <Col N="586" /> certain parts of Dublin, and in Cork and Waterford. In all other areas the Garda Síochána have responsibility.  Consequently, figures for rates of early school leaving by county are not available to my Department.  The White Paper, Charting our Education Future, proposes that responsibility for monitoring of school attendance will fall within the remit of the education boards when they are established.</P>

    <P>It is a fundamental objective in the White Paper, Charting our Education Future, that the rate of retention in school to completion of senior cycle should increase to 90 per cent by the end of the decade.  Progress in the achievement of this target is being made, and rates of retention have increased from 70 per cent in 1986 to 82 per cent in 1993-94.</P>

      <P>The school in question was one of 691 primary schools which applied to the Education Research Centre for inclusion in the rural phase of the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  All applicant schools were invited to submit data in relation to the educational disadvantage of their pupils under a range of specific criteria devised by the Education Research Centre.  The centre selected schools for inclusion in the initiative on the basis of priority of need as reflected in the date submitted by the schools.  Unfortunately, the school in question did not rank high enough in terms of priority of need to warrant its inclusion on this occasion.</P>

      <P>Assistance is provided under a scheme of grants towards the cost of school books for necessitious pupils.  The allocation for 1996-97 to each secondary, community and comprehensive school in County Donegal under the scheme is detailed in the following table.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of the scheme, a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship due to unemployment; prolonged illness of a parent; inadequate means to support a large family; being a single parent family and other circumstances which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.  Each year, schools submit a return to my Department indicating the number of pupils they consider to be eligible for assistance under the scheme.  This information is used by my Department to determine the amount of the grant allocation provided to each school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> The scheme is administered in schools by the principal teachers.  Subject to their annual financial allocation and the terms of the scheme, principals have discretion in the selection of pupils to be assisted and the level of assistance in each case.  The means by which such assistance is provided by schools to necessitious pupils &mdash; financial assistance, vouchers or provision of books on loan or otherwise &mdash; is a matter for the individual school authorities.</P>
    <P>In addition, a special seed capital grant for the establishment of book rental/loan schemes for necessitious pupils was provided to second level schools which are officially designated as disadvantaged and which have given a commitment to introduce a book rental/loan scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 173 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to the primary school sector.  Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools, by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.  When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>My Department has received an application for disadvantaged status from the school in question. The disadvantaged areas scheme was last expanded in 1994 when an additional 54 primary schools were granted disadvantaged status for funding purposes only.</P>
      <P>Schools were selected for inclusion in the scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socio-economic indicators which had been agreed between my Department, schools' management and the INTO.  The case put forward by the school in question was fully considered on that occasion.  Unfortunately, on the basis of data submitted by the school and having regard to resource availability, the needs of the school were not considered to be of such priority as to warrant inclusion on that occasion.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, I launched the Breaking the Cycle initiative in an effort to target resources on selected urban and rural schools which have been identified as being particularly disadvantaged.  The school in question was among those considered by the Education Research Centre for inclusion in this scheme.  However, the view of the ERC was that the needs of the school were not sufficient to justify its selection for inclusion in the scheme.  The case put forward by the school in question will be considered in the context of any future development of supports for disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary schools.  The disadvantaged areas scheme was last expanded in 1994 when an additional 54 primary schools were included for funding purposes only.  All primary schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, were invited to apply for inclusion in the scheme on that occasion.  However, I understand that no application was received from the school in question and its case was not therefore considered.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, I launched the Breaking the Cycle initiative in an effort to target resources on selected urban and rural schools which have been identified as being particularly disadvantaged.  The urban phase of the scheme was targeted on schools which already had disadvantaged status.  Unfortunately, by virtue of its not having disadvantaged status, the school in question was not eligible for inclusion in this initiative.  I understand that officials from my Department will shortly be meeting with representatives of the school in question to discuss their situation.</P>

An appeal to the Supreme Court on this issue is being considered.  The implications for the particular section of the Coroners Act, 1962, will be considered when the court proceedings in the matter have concluded.</P>

In addition applicants must live alone or only with qualified dependants, a carer, a person in receipt of a short-term unemployment assistance payment or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right.  Recipients of short-term social welfare or health board payments do not fulfil the eligibility criteria for receipt of the fuel allowance.</P>

      <P>At present the maximum amount of unemployment assistance for a husband, spouse and one child is £116.20 per week.  In such a case if a mortgage supplement of £35 per week is also payable then the total weekly household income amounts to £151.20.</P>
      <P>If the spouse of the claimant were to take up employment for 16 hours say two days, and had earnings of £60 per week the rate of unemployment assistance payable would fall to £101.20 and the family would no longer be entitled, on means grounds, to a mortgage supplement.  Thus the total household income would then amount to £161.20, not £196.000 as stated in the question.</P>
      <P>Where the spouse of the claimant works for 32 hours, say four days, each week and earns £120 per week the rate of unemployment assistance is further reduced, but the working spouse could then claim family income supplement of £25 per week thus bringing the total household income to £178.10 per week, not £154.00 as stated in the question, which means that the household is £24 better off not £3 better off as stated in the question.</P>
      <P>Furthermore as part of the budget package I have recently announced a range of measures which will give people in these circumstances an even greater incentive to take up employment. First, a tapered retention of the adult dependant payment will be introduced in October next for persons in receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit and allowance and pre-retirement allowance.  Under this arrangement the adult dependant payment will be retained on a sliding scale where the individual takes up work earning more than £60 per week. Second, the weekly income thresholds for family income supplement are being increased by £10 and the supplement will be calculated on the basis of gross earnings less superannuation contributions and PRSI instead of on total gross earnings as at present.  I will be introducing the necessary legislative changes as part of the Social Welfare Bill which I intend to bring before the House shortly.</P>

      <P>The back-to-work allowance was introduced as part of my Department's programme of initiatives designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force. The scheme has proved to be a very worthwhile initiative with over 16,500 persons currently in receipt of the weekly allowance which provides support over a three year period to those wishing to take up employment and self employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the scheme, applicants must be signing on the live register for at least 12 months. Spouses of eligible claimants are allowed to participate in the scheme in lieu of the claimant who then becomes a dependant on the spouse's back-to-work allowance and signs off the live register. Such arrangements can be made through the local jobs facilitator.  There was no change in this position in 1996.  If the Deputy is aware of a particular case where difficulties arose in this regard I will have the details checked and will be in touch with her about it.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos.212 and 214 together.</P>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  In addition applicants must live alone or only with qualified dependants, a carer, a person in receipt of a short-term unemployment assistance payment or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right.</P>
      <P>A review of the scheme was recently carried out on behalf of the Department by independent consultants to ensure that the scheme is operating effectively and equitably.  A draft of the consultant's report was received a short time ago in the Department and any changes to the eligibility criteria of the scheme will be examined when the consultant's final report has been received.  Any recommendations arising from the report with financial implications could only be considered in the light of available resources.  It is expected that the final report will be available by the end of February 1997.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  Since the scheme was first introduced in 1990 substantial improvements to the means testing arrangements have been introduced.  In July 1994, for example, an income disregard of £100 per week in respect of the spouse's income from employment, or self-employment, was introduced.  In addition, the initial disregard of £2 was increased to £6.  In 1995, the disregard of spouse's income was increased to £150 per week.</P>
      <P>In the context of the 1997 budget, I was pleased to announce that the means test for a number of payments, including the carer's allowance, is being further eased in relation to the treatment of capital and savings.  The more generous provisions which already apply to a number of other groups are being extended to carers, non-contributory old age pensions, non-contributory widows and widowers, and people on the pre-retirement allowance.  This measure will make a significant contribution towards my objective of achieving a uniform and consistent treatment of capital and savings for means test purposes across all social assistance schemes.</P>
      <P>In addition, last month's budget provided for payment of an additional amount, equivalent to 50 per cent of their existing personal rate payment, to carers providing full-time care and attention to more than one person and also for an easing of the full-time care and attention condition in situations where care recipients are attending approved rehabilitative courses.  I will continue to take every opportunity to further improve the terms and conditions applying to the carer's allowance scheme and thus to enhance the position of carers in our society.</P>

    <P>Of the employers inspected during the year, 7,408 &mdash; 78 per cent &mdash; were found to have their affairs in order.  Arrears of PRSI/PAYE amounting to £12.97 million were determined in the other cases and appropriate follow-up action to recover these arrears is under way.  In addition to ensuring compliance with PRSI rules checks are carried out by inspectors to ensure that employees are not concurrently working and claiming unemployment or illness payments.  In 1996, a total of 86 cases in respect of offences under the Social Welfare Acts, 30 of which related to employers, were finalised by the courts.  Convictions were obtained in 75 of these cases, 28 of which related to employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of consumer concerns relating to the cost of motor insurance.  Against this background, I commissioned the Deloitte &amp; Touche consultancy report which examined the question of the cost and availability of motor insurance, including the cost for young people.</P>
      <P>I have spoken on numerous occasions to the House in regard to the position of young and inexperienced drivers as a high risk category.  The established facts in this regard, which I have previously detailed in response to similar questions, are as follows: the most recent statistics published by the National Roads Authority show that (a) almost 38 per cent of the motorists involved in fatal and personal injury accidents in 1995 were young drivers and (b) 41 per cent of the road casualty victims in 1995 were between the ages of 18 and 34.  The analysis provided by the sixth report of the motor insurance advisory board showed that claims frequency declines with age of policyholder for all types of cover.  The analysis also showed that, in terms of relative claims cost, the 17 to 24 year old policyholder is a greater risk than those aged 25 to 30, who in turn are a greater risk than those aged over 30.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report on an evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland provides further evidence of the high cost of claims associated with the young driver.  The consultants found that the average cost of an insurance claim for a 17 to 24 year old driver is over twice that for a 36 to 40 year old driver and that motorists in the younger age group are responsible for over three and a half times the claims costs of motorists in the 36 to 40 group.  Given these facts, it is not surprising that young drivers may experience difficulty in obtaining quotations for motor insurance and that, from an underwriting and solvency perspective, insurers will quote relatively high premiums to young and inexperienced drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report concluded that the inculcation of safer driving standards in young drivers is the key to reducing their high accident rate and to obtaining lower premium quotations. That report also indicated that drivers with good claims experience have seen their insurance premiums reduced in real terms since 1990.  In this regard, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the specific recommendations by Deloitte &amp; Touche in relation to the possible introduction of a graduated licensing system for learner drivers similar to a model in force in Ontario.  I understand that my colleague the Minister for the Environment is to undertake an examination of the Ontario model in the context of current law and practice in Ireland.  I would also point out <Col N="609" /> that an insurance incentive scheme has been established by agreement between the Irish Insurance Federation and the Driving Instructors Register (DIR) whereby insurance discounts will be offered to young drivers who have completed an agreed number of driving lessons over a calandar year.  The National Safety Council is also working to produce course material on road safety to fit in with the new primary school curriculum and has recently adopted a five year road safety programme which includes the development of educational material in 1998 for transition year students in secondary schools.  Some schools are also offering driving training courses on a commercial basis.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the dispute between the company and personal finance advisers of the company, regarding management's proposals to restructure the salesforce in order to improve the competitiveness of Irish Life in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>The company and the Manufacturing, Science and Finance trade union, representing the majority of the saleforce affected, have availed of the services of the Labour Relations Commission the services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court in their efforts to resolve the difficulties that have arisen from the company's proposals.</P>
      <P>I understand that the personal finance advisers have rejected a recent Labour Court recommendation on the dispute.  It is disappointing that, to date, the parties have been unable to utilise the recommendation of the Labour Court as a means to resolve their dispute.  I have stated to the House on previous occasions that it would be inappropriate for me to intervene in such industrial disputes, as intervention could only help undermine the role of the State's dispute settling agencies.  I have full confidence in the services and expertise provided by these agencies.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for the resolution of this dispute rests with the parties directly concerned. I take this opportunity to urge the parties to continue their efforts to reach a settlement of this dispute, which is not in the interests of the company, its workforce or its customers.</P>

    <P>I accept that these figures represent a disappointing performance, but new projects under way in Dundalk and Drogheda which involve the EPC Corporation, the Heinz Corporation and DSC Communications have projected employment of almost 1,000 new jobs.

      <P>Full (class A) social insurance was extended to community employment (CE) workers with effect from 6 April 1996.  One of the effects of this change in social insurance class is that sponsors may become liable for the payment of redundancy under the provisions of the redundancy Acts.</P>
      <P>Redundancy payments are designed to give financial assistance to workers while they make the transition from a job, which had become redundant, to a new job.  CE is a labour programme designed to help persons make the transition from unemployment to employment, so redundancy payments would clearly be inappropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was made aware of this anomaly I decided to use the powers available to me under section 4 (4) of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967 to exclude by ministerial Order, CE workers <Col N="611" /> from the scope of the Act.  The order is being prepared by my Department at present and I expect that it will be signed shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant progress on restructuring PRSI contributions has been made since this Government was formed.  The Government recognises the positive impact which a restructuring of PRSI contributions can have on improving employment performance.  It agrees with the view expressed by the NESC in the 1993 report that the impact on employment of restructuring PRSI could be maximised if the restructuring were focused on achieving greater reductions at lower income levels. In this respect recent budgetary changes in PRSI have been directed at lower income levels.</P>
      <P>In order to direct relief at those on low incomes generally, including those outside the current income tax net, the 1995 budget introduced an allowance of £50 per week for contributors on the full rate of employee's PRSI.  This allowance was subsequently increased to £80 per week in the 1996 budget.  In addition, a reduction of 1 per cent in the employee PRSI rate for class A and class H contributors, representing over 70 per cent of contributors, was announced in the recent budget.  These initiatives have contributed significantly to reducing the PRSI wedge on lower income.</P>
      <P>Further progress on restructuring of employer's PRSI contributions at lower income levels was also made in recent budgets. The 1995 budget increased the income threshold below which the lower rate of employer's PRSI of 9 per cent applies from £9,000 to £12,000 per annum. The lower rate of 9 per cent was reduced to 8.5 per cent in the 1996 budget with an increase in the threshold below which this lower rate applies from £12,000 to £13,000.  This threshold is being further increased to £13,500 following the recent budget.  The object of these reliefs is to target reductions on lower paid employments in order to secure a competitive reduction in non-wage labour changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These changes have had a positive impact on the creation and maintenance of employment.  A recent survey carried out by IBEC in consultation with my Department found that in the case of firms which had increased employment, 30 per cent of firms considered the recent reductions in employer's PRSI to be either important or very important factors in their decision to recruit staff. <Col N="612" /> Of those firms where employee numbers remained the same, 44 per cent of firms stated that the recent employer's PRSI reductions had helped to maintain job levels. It is my view that the restructuring of PRSI contributions which has taken place to date will continue to have a significant positive impact on future employment levels.</P>

      <P>Community employment (CE) is designed primarily to prevent marginalisation among long-term unemployed people whose principal or only source of income is a social welfare payment.  Its objective is to provide temporary work experience opportunities together with some training that would enhance the employment prospects of those at whom the programme is targeted.</P>
      <P>As CE has only been in operation since April 1994 it is too early yet to evaluate the full impact of the programme.  However, a preliminary sample survey of participants who left the programme in 1996, having completed their 12 months' participation period indicated that 29 per cent had found full-time employment; 20 per cent had found part-time employment; 7 per cent were self-employed; 10 per cent had entered full time education programmes of progressed to specific skills training programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that the ESRI undertook a survey last year of a sample of persons who completed FÁS programmes, including community employment &mdash; or its predecessor the social employment scheme &mdash; in April-July 1994. This survey showed that 36 per cent of the sample CE participants were in employment in 1996, <Col N="613" /> some 14-26 months after completing the programme. This contrasts with surveys of previous periods when the percentage in employment was in the range of between 14-22 per cent.</P>
    <P>These results are encouraging although there is by no means room for complacency and I can assure the Deputy that the programme will be subject to ongoing evaluation and assessment.</P>
    <P>While links between individual projects and local employers is a matter for sponsors and FÁS, who have operational responsibility for the delivery of CE, I am aware that such linkages exist and are reinforced by the setting of placement targets by FÁS for sponsors.</P>
    <P>The local employment service network is currently operating in 14 key areas around the country. Part of the services offered to the unemployed are referrals to FÁS for participation on community employment.  The mediators involved in the local employment service are best positioned to assess the needs of individual clients.</P>

      <P>The success of IDA Ireland in attracting high technology projects, particularly over the past number of years, has resulted in a buoyant demand for electronic engineers, technicians, computer science and software engineering graduates and young people with foreign language fluency for teleservices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> In 1996, over 13,000 new jobs were created in IDA-backed companies, making it the best job creation year ever.  Overseas companies are now creating two and a half times more jobs per year than they were ten years ago.  The current substantial requirement for people with electronics, software and language skills will certainly continue over the next five years as companies already committed to Ireland continue to build up their operations here.  These include: Intel, Hewlett Packard and IBM in electronics; Oracle, Saville Systems in software; Alps, involved in automotive parts manufacturing and Hertz and Gateway 2000 in telebusiness.</P>
    <P>The jobs available are at a number of different educational levels &mdash; at graduate, certificate and diploma level.  In particular, there will be a large number of job opportunities in manufacturing and electronic, mechanical and production engineering. These offer creative and worthwhile career opportunities.  Because Ireland is a recognised and rapidly growing base for companies needing these skills, there is and will continue to be an abundance of job opportunities for people with them &mdash; opportunities for working with world class companies and state of the art technology.</P>
    <P>There is also a growing need for people with fluency in foreign languages for the telebusiness sector.  With further substantial growth anticipated in the telemarketing business over the next few years, it is also important that language skills continue to be available to meet projected requirements.  Policy initiatives have been taken to ensure that this will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>The availability and quality of skills in Ireland is one of the key competitive advantages we have in attracting inward investment to Ireland.  This is attested to by the overseas companies located here and the Government fully recognises the importance of maintaining this competitive advantage so as to continue to provide much needed jobs for young people and school leavers in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Forbairt is also working with Irish industry in the manufacturing and internationally traded sectors. In 1996, Forbairt assisted companies created 8,842 new jobs.  The agency is investing in and assisting companies to develop and grow to maximum capacity.  This investment has a significant impact on increased employment throughout the economy, both directly in the companies supported by Forbairt, and indirectly in the growing number of service and supply businesses necessary to service the growing industrial base.  The resultant job opportunities will lead to new openings for young people with the appropriate skills and education.</P>
    <P>Forbairt is actively participating in a number of activities which are aimed at encouraging a culture of enterprise and a spirit of enterpreneurship among young people.  At secondary level it is the national sponsor of YES, the young enterprenueurs scheme.  This is a programme organised by a voluntary group of teachers, parents and professionals. <Col N="615" /> It runs a school-based competition for students between the ages of 12 and 18, aimed at preparing young people in full-time education for the challenge of employment.  It does this by encouraging them to develop their entrepreneurial skills by setting up and running their own businesses. The YES programme started in one school in 1991-92 and has grown each year since then.  In the 1996-97 academic year, 250 schools are participating, involving 7,300 students.</P>
    <P>My Department and the agencies are continually monitoring the employment needs of industry and are co-operating with the education sector in seeking to ensure that the skills and education requirements of the different sectors of industry and services are adequately catered for.  In this respect, agreement has been reached to increase the intake of school leavers to the software disciplines to cater for the projected increase in demand for software graduates.  The skills needs of other growth areas have also been reviewed in detail and necessary resources will be assigned to ensure that we benefit to the full from the high employment growth rates which are projected into the future.</P>
    <P>In summary, I am satisfied that the various job creating activities of the agencies that come under my remit, in conjunction with a continuation of the successful economic policies being operated by the Government, represent the best way to create job opportunities for, <i>inter alia,</i> young people and school leavers.</P>

      <P>IDA Ireland was given responsibility for the industrial property portfolio in January 1996 and current policy in relation to the provision of advance factory space is that it will in future be provided by the private sector.  IDA Ireland will then actively promote and market such buildings.  This is in line with the policy recommended by the Forfás board following a detailed consultancy report and as endorsed, after careful consideration, by me.</P>
      <P>There are also incentives under the business expansion scheme to encourage the provision of advance factories.  IDA actively encourages the private sector to utilise this scheme in selected locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To make this type of investment attractive to the private sector, IDA Ireland seeks to ensure that the supply of advance factories in any area matches the demand.  This ensures that factories are not vacant for long periods and that the <Col N="616" /> private investors receive an early return on investments.</P>
    <P>The decision on where to situate advance factories is informed by the needs of locating projects for sophisitcated commercial and business environments.  Accordingly they must not only meet exacting standards in terms of land and buildings, but must also provide top class road, rail, sea and air access.  Issues such as the availability of natural gas or high volumes of water may also be specific requirements for some individual industrial processes.</P>
    <P>IDA will continue to work in partnership with the local authorities and the private sector to ensure that they are fully aware of the needs of modern mobile investment projects.  It is in the interests of each local authority to make adequate provision for sell-serviced industrial lands if new projects and increased employment are to be secured for their areas.</P>
    <P>I have given detailed information on specific developments concerning plans for advance factory provision in the Border counties in my reply to the question from Deputy Brendan Smith on today's Order Paper.</P>

      <P>The Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938 governs the opening hours of retail establishments. The Act provided for a ban on Sunday trading for most shops but gave the Minister power by order to add to the list of exempted businesses, or to exempt specified regions from the provisions of the Act.  However, an order made later that year exempted the whole country from the provisions of the Act and effectively removed all restrictions on Sunday trading.  This remains the position.</P>
      <P>The 1938 Act was enacted for the primary purpose of regulating competition.  Therefore any justification for the reintroduction of the legislation to ban even limited types of Sunday trading would have to be based first and foremost on competition considerations.  I do not think that such considerations arise at present.  The issue of Sunday working is addressed in the Organisation of Working Time Bill, 1996.  This Bill will impact to some extent on Sunday trading.  The Bill is currently at Committee Stage.</P>

      <Quest>his views regarding the lack of attractiveness of investing directly in small private companies having regard to the capital gains tax rate which gives no allowance in the rate for the period that a shareholder retains his investment as against the many alternative tax efficient investments available such as special savings accounts and that venture capital and BES funds are not freely available to all start up situations; his views in relation to the necessity to look at the capital gains tax regime to encourage business angels and other private investors to invest in private companies balancing the reward risk element as against other secure low tax investments currently available.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3059/97]</QRef>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Investors will seek to find investments that strike a balance between high returns and low risk.  This balance between risk and reward varies between investors and their portfolios. It is a recognised problem internationally that investors are more inclined to invest in larger quoted companies than in smaller unquoted companies, especially start-ups, because of the perceived lower risk profile.</P>
      <P>In Ireland we have a lower rate of capital gains tax applicable to investments in small private companies, market value less than £25 million.  A reduced capital gains tax rate of 26 per cent, 27 per cent for disposals before April 6, 1997, applies to individuals who sell shares in a qualifying company provided they have owned such shares for at least three years.  As such this incentive gives a substantial allowance against CGT to investors who hold their investment in small companies for at least three years.  I regard this measure to be a significant incentive for private investors, including business angels, to invest in smaller private companies.</P>
      <P>It is the experience of my Department that there is often an unwillingness, albeit an understandable one, on the part of entrepreneurs to part with equity stake in their businesses, especially in the case of small private companies where founders generally retain the large bulk of all share ownership until they have substantially built up the net worth of the company.  At such a stage those companies may seek a public quotation or sell a substantial block of their share-holding by way of a trade sale.</P>
      <P>In the above circumstances it is often difficult for firms to expand without investment from external sources, and to this end the State has actively encouraged small businesses to seek external funding assistance through the development of various funding mechanisms and initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before outlining some of the more significant improvements it should be noted that the supply of venture capital is primarily the responsibility of the private sector and the principal role of Government is to encourage and support private <Col N="619" /> sector initiatives, sometimes on a partnership basis.  In this regard the actions of this and previous Governments have been successful.  The venture capital market has undergone significant positive change over the past number of years in improving the supply of venture capital to start-up and early stage companies.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme is a good example of public and private sector partnership making a significant contribution to enterprise funding.  However, it is clearly understandable that not all start-ups can freely access BES or venture capital funding.  Where this arises there are a range of other financial supports available to start-ups from sources such as the industrial development agencies and the county enterprise boards.  However, both the marketplace and my agencies will, of necessity, apply the appropriate qualification criteria in the provision of all financial support for enterprise.</P>
    <P>Some of the more significant measures that have been put in place over the past number of years to improve the supply of venture capital for private companies, including start-up and early stage companies, include the following: under the operational programme for industrial development £66 million of early stage equity is being made available for investment in growth orientated firms.  The funds are available through approved seed/venture funds.  Fifty per cent of the funding is being provided by the European Regional Development Fund and the balance by the private sector.  The measure specifically provides for a target level of seed capital investment of 25 per cent of the available funds; the business expansion scheme has been extended to April 1999.  Since its inception the BES has been successful in channelling equity capital into unquoted businesses in Ireland, including a substantial number of small firms requiring smaller amounts of capital, i.e., up to £50,000; in addition the scope of the BES has been widened to provide a refund of certain income tax already paid by an individual who sets up and takes employment in a new qualifying business; in the past few years a number of new seed-venture capital providers have become active in the venture capital market and are characterised by their concentration on start up and early stage financing and the industrial development agencies, as part of their development mandate, are increasingly devoting more resources to equity investments in developing indigenous companies.</P>
    <P>Evidence of improved access to equity capital for unquoted companies is contained in the results of 1992 and 1995 Equity Capital surveys carried out by my Department.  Whereas in 1992 57 per cent of the respondents were of the view that the then climate for raising equity had deteriorated, this figure had dropped to only 5 per cent in the 1995 survey.</P>
    <P>While I am reasonably satisfied with progress to date in improving the taxation and financing conditions for smaller private companies, I assure <Col N="620" /> the Deputy that I and my Department keep these issues under regular review and that new or improved measures will continue to be proposed and supported in line with the changing demands of the business environment.</P>

      <P>The county enterprise initiative has been allocated £21.133 million in 1997, an increase of 7 per cent on the allocation which was contained in the Book of Estimates for 1996.  The 1997 allocation represents a significant increase on the original financial provision made for the CEBs in the operational programme for local urban and rural development (LDP), 1994-99, under which the boards are co-financed by the European Union.</P>
      <P>Under the LDP the boards were projected to draw down over £27 million in State and EU funding during 1995 and 1996.  During the period in question, however, the level of activity undertaken by the boards resulted in expenditure exceeding £40 million in State and EU funding, with the additional funding being provided by the Exchequer, as a result of a decision by the Government to provide the funds necessary to enable the boards to carry out their activities.  A similar pattern of expenditure will occur in 1997 with the boards receiving an allocation of over £21 million as against a projected expenditure figure of £17 million in the operational programme.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any exceptional backlogs on a country-wide basis but the Deputy will appreciate that, notwithstanding the very generous allocations which the boards have received to date, all State funded bodies and agencies must operate within a budget and must prioritise their operations. I am confident that the boards will continue to successfully promote micro-enterprise at local level within the budgets allocated to them.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in the categories specified in respect of headage payments, cattle and sheep premia and arable aid payments is being processed and will be sent directly to him shortly.  These payments account for the great bulk of CAP payments to farmers.</P>
      <P>Payments in respect of other schemes are not readily classifiable according to size of payment or, where such classification is possible, cannot be related to headage, premia and arable aid payments.</P>

      <P>The information is given in the following table in respect of the number of herdowners paid in 1996 under the various 1996 headage and premia schemes; the 1996 BSE package of measures to compensate farmers for loss of income due to the BSE problem; 1995 extensification premium which was paid in 1996 &mdash; this premium is normally payable in the period April-June of the year following the year of application for the various premia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that the figures in respect of the special beef premium scheme relate to <Col N="623" /> the number of applications paid rather than herdowners.  Applicants under this scheme were allowed to apply on up to four separate occasions under each of the ten month and 22 month age categories.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> In most cases the same herdowners would also have received balancing payments under the 1995 schemes during the early part of 1996.  The following is the table:</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="625" />
      <Col N="626" /> Number of herdowners paid in 1996 in respect of 1996 schemes, BSE Package and 1995 Extensification Premium.</P>

    <P>Since the beginning of the BSE crisis last March up to the end of December I have succeeded in securing the most flexible intervention arrangements with regard to weight limitations and eligible categories, despite the strong reservations of the Commission and most member states.  These were significant factors in underpinning market prices in 1996.</P>
    <P>I have sought equally flexible arrangements for 1997 and detailed proposals have been put to the EU Commission.  While the Commission has reduced the weights for the first quarter I have succeeded in getting a derogation for the 04 category for Irish producers for this period.</P>
    <P>While the extension of the export restrictions by the Russian authorities is regrettable, I am confident that the full Russian demand for Irish beef in 1997, which will be significant, will be met by counties not involved in the restrictions.</P>
    <P>Producers in the restricted counties should not be significantly affected as the domestic and other markets which account for over 70 per cent of our production remain open to beef from those counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 268 to 271, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The calf processing scheme was originally introduced by the European Union as a part of the 1992 CAP reform package in an effort to reduce the number of calves available for beef production.  This scheme, which was voluntary on member states, was implemented only by Portugal, the United Kingdom and France.</P>
      <P>The fall in beef consumption in the EU in 1996 created a new surplus of beef in the EU and a need to reduce production.  The measures adopted by the Council in October 1996 obliged member states to introduce an early marketing premium scheme for veal calves or the calf processing scheme.  As Ireland has no veal industry we are obliged under Council Regulation (EC) No. 2222/96 to introduce the calf processing premium scheme.</P>
      <P>Nine EU export licensed meat premises have been selected as processing centres.  The centres are strategically located to minimise haulage distances for the calves.  The transport of these calves is subject to the strict conditions set down under EU and national legislation.  The processing centres are required to meet new and strict animal welfare requirements.  The calf processing premium will be paid only on animals which are in a fit and healthy condition on presentation and are processed in conformity with the conditions applying under the scheme.  I am, therefore, satisfied that the scheme as operated should not give rise to animal welfare problems.</P>
      <P>The object of the calf processing premium scheme and the early marketing premium scheme for veal calves is to reduce by 1 million the number of calves available for beef production.  This number is equivalent to about 350,000 tonnes of beef per annum within the EU.  This measure will assist in bringing the market into balance, thereby assisting producer prices to recover to reasonable levels and orderly marketing to be restored within the EU and internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of calves which enter this scheme in Ireland will be determined by the price of calves relative to the value of the premium. Because calf prices in Ireland are traditionally higher than those in other EU countries it is <Col N="632" /> likely that the numbers entering the scheme under the current rate of premium will be small.</P>
    <P>The losses in premium as a result of the disposal of calves through the scheme will be determined by (i) the eligibility of the animal for premium, (ii) whether the animal is a bull or steer, (iii) the level of stocking intensity of the enterprise and (iv) the date of slaughter.</P>
    <P>The premiums available for steers and bulls are as follows:</P>
    <P>Special Beef Premium for Steers: £90.17 per head on up to 90 animals in each age category &mdash; ten months and 22 months.</P>
    <P>Special Beef Premium for Young Bulls: £111.98 per head on up to 90 animals between the ages of ten and 21 months.</P>
    <P>Extensification Premium: £29.80 is granted provided the stocking density on the producer's holding is less than 1.4 l.u. per hectare per year. Where the stocking density is less that 1 l.u. per hectare the extensification premium is £43.13.</P>
    <P>Deseasonalisation Premium: The rates of payment in respect of steers slaughtered in licensed meat export premises 1997 are as follows:</P>
    <P>Animals slaughtered in the period 1 January 1997 to 15 April 1997, £60.09; animals slaughtered in the period 16 April 1997 to 29 April 1997, £45.07; animals slaughtered in the period 30 April 1997 to 27 May 1997, £30.05; animals slaughtered in the period 28 May 1997 to 10 June 1997, £15.02.</P>
    <P>These national losses in premia and output value must however be measured against the losses that would arise if no action was taken to restore market balance.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the beef intervention tender of 14 January 1997.</P>
      <P>Tenders received on that date amounted to 5,007 tonnes at prices ranging from 253.01 ecu to 252.5 ecu.  For tenders to be considered for intervention they must be under the reported market price for the prior week plus a processors margin of 14 ecu.  The reported market price for that week was 244.7 ecu per 100 kg.  This would have allowed for tenders up to 285.7 ecu per 100 kg. to be considered for intervention at the adjudication in the beef management committee meeting on 17 January 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the difficult market situation in Ireland the Commission proposed that all tenders for steers under 253.01 ecu should be accepted in full with those over that level subject to a 25 per cent co-efficient.  The effect of the decision by the committee to accept the full Irish offer was to <Col N="633" /> improve cattle prices as traders competed for cattle supplies to fill the tender.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the reform of the Common Agriculture Policy in 1992, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry was obliged under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3508/92 to establish an integrated administration and control system.  A specific requirement of the system was the development of an alpha-numeric land parcel identification system &mdash; LPIS &mdash; for all land parcels which are the subject of an area aid application. The purpose of this parcel identification system is to provide the Department with a data-base whereby land parcels being claimed for area aid purposes can be located, identified and have area values and land use attributed.  The original deadline for implementation of the system was 1 January 1996 but this was extended recently to 1 January 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The LPIS operated for the 1996 area aid scheme and is currently being updated for 1997. As part of this update, a number of applicants for area aid have been requested to supply maps because their 1996 applications contained nonunique references to one or more land parcels the <Col N="634" /> location of which could not be identified.  I should point out that these requests for maps arose only after all documents and maps submitted by the applicants were cross-referenced.</P>
    <P>In the case of a large project like this, with over 130,000 applicants and nearly half a million maps, it has not been possible to cross-reference every map with every application and it is inevitable that some maps have been mislaid.</P>
    <P>If any area aid applicant has been requested to submit a map which he supplied with a previous application, he should notify my Department in writing or by phone and identify the townland in which that parcel is located.  I have arranged for the continued operation of the freefone number 1 800 46 47 48 which farmers can ring.  My Department will then arrange for the issue of a map of the townland in question to the applicant.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the reform of the fruit and vegetables sector which is the subject of Council Regulation (EC) 2200/96 (OJ. L.297 dated 21 November 1996). Title II of this regulation covers the provisions, other than intervention, for producer organisations. The main change is that producer organisations which satisfy certain criteria may now get matching public funding for approved operational programmes.  This means that producer organisations must levy their own producer members in order to attract counterpart public funding.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements Community withdrawal compensation for products withdrawn from the market will be reduced to the levels set out in annex V to the regulation.  There will be a single level of compensation for each product. The maximum amount which may be withdrawn as from the year 2002 will be 10 per cent of members' produce marketed.  This restriction will be gradually phased in starting with a maximum of 50 per cent in the coming season.  I expect that the detailed Commission rules will be published towards the end of February 1997.</P>

      <P>The amount of legal costs paid by the Department of Defence in 1995 was £1,340,505.  This sum represents the legal expenses of persons, including members and former members of the Defence Forces, who claimed damages or compensation from the Department and who were either awarded costs by the courts or whose costs were paid by the Department as part of out-of-court settlements.  The State's legal costs are normally paid from the Vote for the Office of the Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions governing the payment of subsistence allowance to Defence Forces personnel are provided for in Defence Force Regulations.  Subsistence allowance is only payable where personnel who are performing duties away from their station are not provided with rations.  This does not arise frequently, however, as there is a comprehensive catering system in place in Border units to cope with feeding troops in the field.  Full hot meals are provided in barracks for those performing the duty before commencement and on completion of duty.  Also while on patrol personnel receive flasks of hot tea or coffee and sandwiches.</P>
      <P>I would like to add that in addition to basic pay, personnel serving in Border units are in receipt of a Border duty allowance of £50.07 per week in the case of officers and £44.91 per week in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates.  A military service allowance is also payable to all members of the Permanent Defence Force up to and including the rank of colonel to compensate personnel for the special conditions associated with military life, such as the unsocial hours of duty, being subject to transfers and a requirement to serve in all conditions.  The current rate in the case of officers is £2,091 per annum, and in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates is £40.08 per week, £2,091 p.a., with the exception of privates with less than three years' service who receive £14.43 per week. These allowances are paid, irrespective of the actual hours worked, on a continuous basis, including periods of annual leave, sick leave, etc.</P>
      <P>The rates of remuneration of the Permanent Defence Force, including military service allowance and Border duty allowance, were determined by the Gleeson Commission in 1990.  The commission expressly stated its conclusion that military duties were clearly in a distinctive category and that it would not be appropriate to fix military pay on the basis of a direct comparison with the pay of gardaí.</P>
      <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, the payment of allowances comes within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association and may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the association.  The question of the payment of an allowance to personnel involved with the BSE-related operations in Border areas has been raised by the association under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Under the terms of the scheme, as agreed with the association, discussions on claims which are being processed are confidential.  You will appreciate, therefore, that as the matter is under active consideration at present it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

      <P>The level of licence fees in the Foyle fisheries area is primarily a matter for the Foyle Fisheries Commission, subject to the general requirement that regulations made by the commission are approved by the Minister for the Marine and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commercial salmon licence fees for the Foyle area have historically been higher than those in the fisheries boards regions.  In this regard, direct comparison between the Foyle Fisheries Commission and its counterpart bodies cannot be made readily and would have to take account of the different characteristics of the regions, the differences <Col N="639" /> between roles, functions and operations, as well as the differing financing-funding arrangements which apply.</P>
    <P>Since the early 1980s commercial licence fees in the Foyle area have remained static in real terms &mdash; increases have been in line with inflation.  The commission advises that the fees charged for commercial licences have not, however, had unfavourable impact on demand for licences which continues to exceed supply.</P>
    <P>The commission's revenues &mdash; 37 per cent of total income &mdash; have been traditionally insufficient to meet its costs and the income deficit &mdash; 63 per cent of total income &mdash; is funded jointly by the Irish and United Kingdom authorities. Licence fees account for almost 90 per cent of total revenues and given, not least, the stated objective to progressively reduce the deficit, a reduction in licence fees is not a feasible proposition.</P>
    <P>I understand that the commission has informed the advisory council &mdash; which represents local commercial fishermen and anglers &mdash; that licence fees will not be increased for 1997.</P>
